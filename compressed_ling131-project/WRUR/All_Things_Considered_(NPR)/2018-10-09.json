X. six are news dot org\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I melted Chang this morning began with a surprise resignation from the White House Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations says she will step down by the end of the year\nWhen she and President Trump spoke to reporters at the White House today they took turns praising each other\nShe's done an incredible job [noise] she's a fantastic person is very important laid would feel so is somebody that gets it\nAnd Haley tried preemptively to answer a question about her future\nFor all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty and\nI can promise you what are we doing it for that point so I look forward to supporting the president and the next life\nAll right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins me now to talk about all of this he Mara Hi Elsa so why now why is Haley stepping down ... well\nThat is a really good question we don't know exactly why now but we do know that she wrote her resignation letter six days ago which would have been just as President Trump was attacking Christine Blasey Ford that my data looks so good if she'd resigned then\nShe says she's terminally millionaire self she's going to go into the private sector we know that she and her husband are not wealthy people they have a lot of debt based on her financial disclosure form\nSo for someone who does want to run for president maybe some time in the future time to make a lot of money she is staying on 'til the end of the year but it made sense for her to announce this now because in case the Republicans lose big in the mid term she doesn't want to be seen as kind of a rat deserting the sinking ship right when you go to hell yeah\nSo that they have different about this departure compared to other exits we've seen from the Trump Administration is that he seems to be leaving on good terms with President Trump is that actually the case\nYes it sounds like it's the case she is the most adept political operator in the cabinet you know she has been just a seller right away but somehow being out of Washington has allowed her to carve out\nThis independent political persona as a loyal Trump cabinet member but not a sick event she's tougher on Russia than he is although that's true of many relatives of his foreign policy team but she has been able to separate yourself from Trump when it suits are purposes\nRemember when she said there would be um sanctions on Russia than Larry Kudlow said no Nikki Haley is confused and she reported very friendly and said I don't get confused and she also wrote an op ed piece saying on the one hand she wasn't anonymous the internal\nAnonymous resistor but also pointing out that she does from time to time different with the president but she brings\nThose differences are privately now some Republicans grumbled that was pretty self aggrandizing but once again she was able to burnish her own brand as someone independent\nForeign policy hawk but not a total Trump is she actually could kind of had it both ways okay so yes she's actually managed to have it both ways which shows you that she is a really good politician\nSo as we heard Haley just say she won't be running for president in twenty twenty but are we to assume that this is really the end of her political\nCareer we are certainly not and nobody does um she is not going to challenge the president in a primary in twenty twenty um she hasn't ruled out not running for president a lot of people think she'll run and twenty twenty four or possibly she'll take a Senate seat in South Carolina F. one comes open\nBut her presidential ambitions are well established\nAnd it was really interesting people who are following her career and speculating about its future paid careful attention to what she said about Ivanka and Jared today she said that Jared\nWas such a hidden genius that no one understands [laughter] of course the president's talked about as a possible replacement for Nikki Haley so she is staying on good terms with all the members of the Trump\nFamily That's NPR's

six month period they run the gamut from complaints about contractors who allegedly charge too much to whistle blowers who claim they suffered reprisals\nStorage a former prosecutor can discuss them only in general terms still he's playing a visible role at an agency that often seems invisible with its spy missions and classified budgets\nAnd they say it's always been the most secret agents in

they shouldn't do this shouldn't be that in the past they have gotten around them and that's why we ended up with these\nAre huge dropping scandals\nThere are hints of a new approach the NSA Director used to hire and fire the inspector general under new rules Stuart is the first nominated by president and confirmed by the Senate in July ... released an unclassified version of a semi annual report something never done before\nAnd there's the office logo when store to arrive the office of the inspector general R. O. Y. G. had the same one as the NSA with an eagle at its center\nAnd I thought wait a minute we're independent gee he put together a graphics team are logo now has a big all which looks like it's doing oversight I said\nHis recent report does address weighty issues like the government's use of the foreign intelligence Surveillance Act or five so\nWe found that there were several deficiencies that had the potential to impact protection of us person privacy\nHe also raised concerns about Internet searches that could jeopardize civil liberties however the details are only in the classified

suggested she simply worn out by the often combative diplomacy at the un joking that she wears body armor on the job President Trump praised Haley as an effective advocate for his America First agenda\nWe've just had a lot of emphasis so many other friends who also and I think the world is Nikki said the world is really respecting the United states again much more so they haven't and they

United states at the un and for that I commend her\nWhy do you think President Trump should be looking for when considering as he's considering the replacement for Nikki Haley\nWell first of all I didn't presidents should always consider people who they are going to be comfortable working with secondly\nIdeally somebody with a some international experience of whatever kind whether it's international business or think tank or or politician ... somebody who's got a an a mind that the you know it's OK America First for the American idol alone and\nOne of the people most responsible for
