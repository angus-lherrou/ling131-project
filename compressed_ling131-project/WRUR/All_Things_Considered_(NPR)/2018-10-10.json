you're talking about to brief still left from Hurricane Florence are you talking about stuff that's just come down newly since then with went\nWell what's kind of like in phases we uh the initial

which is a three percent declined here to talk about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also so what parts of the markets on this planet today\nWell a tech was particularly hit hard it's been the foundation of a this market but ah all of the um all sectors really were down um\nUh the the fall virtually wiped out all of these talk gains since mid summer\nBut the tech sector has been the hardest hit and ... and as I said it's one of the foundations of the market in fact the tech heavy NASDAQ lost four percent of its value today and the S. and P. five under which also has a lot of tech lost three and a third percent so it was a tough day to day for everyone but particularly for tech\nUm now I understand that the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation rate and the Federal Reserve has said that will continue to raise rates ... that's it I Will stop raising two it's ... it's been smart rate between three and three point five percent but are there inflation fears going on\nWell well there aren't but interest rates are fears contributed to do this or rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks\nThat's made the market nervous in fact uh this is the fifth straight day of losses for the U.S and the five hundred and rising interest rates make stocks less valuable a and there's concern in the market about just how high rates might go to the Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually\nAnd as you suggested it will stop a between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go there are some inflation concerns but they're\nRelated to the very very strong economy we've had a unemployment at a fifty year low so there's concern in the markets the wages will begin to rise more rapidly and create more than ... flirtation\nPressures okay so you're saying the economy remains strong ... should not be good for the stock market what happened\nWell the economy is strong in the U.S and most accommodated are saying today salary is not the end of a double marketing stocks\nSo a while the U.S economy remains strong um Europe is cool to bed and so I've emerging markets a the IMF gave a less than going assessment of the global economy this week than it had just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are these concerns about a global trade war a disrupting a the global economy a trade war between the world's two biggest economies are the U.S and China so what we saw\n... returns to the room and explains ... family what he'd done to help bring about this dramatic change it wasn't just good medical attention it was a philosophy you know when you get on an airplane you get sick\nSo ... because the airline industry has a checklist\nWhen he started in the ICU he realized every doctor did things differently and they figured they can't all be doing the right thing so gradually he started building a checklist of the best way to handle basic tasks first they figured out when it's safe to take someone off the ventilator he explains then\nWe started standardizing how to remove people off of ... then we came up with a way to measure of your brain was deliberation not what you got that measurement and we were doing this to you when you were there we were measuring whether you were delirious and you were at the beginning\nYou Lee came up with a list of six steps to take in order to reduce delivery him in return patients to health as quickly as possible\nWe put all of this into a bundle which we now call the ... a B C D E F bundle\nThat bundle includes close management of drugs like sedatives which can cause to leery of patients are tested daily to see if they can wake up and if they're ready to get off the ventilator F is for family engagement us as these all reduced the amount of time patients spend delirious\nAnd that in turn markedly reduces the risk of long term brain damage\nGetting out of bed early that eat part is cuts to him and a half so these things are all intersecting as\nHe sits on a ... bed ... explains that it's a big change from what many are you still do which is to knock out a patient and treat their dysfunctional body rather than focusing on them holistically\nTo me the lynchpin of this whole thing is to respect the humanness of each patient thank you again a little bit they view\nThe bundle when done correctly reduces the risk of ICU triggered dementia by twenty five to thirty percent easily says that makes a big difference to a lot of patients it's gradually been adopted it icy use in recent years but he says it's still not the standard everywhere\nAbout half from our last survey had been doing some elements of the bundle\nPulling it altogether a to F is a challenge Dr Kirk Volcker at the Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida discovered that when he took part in nationwide study to expand the use of the bundle in all sorts of hospital\nIt was not as easy as we expected it to be in a couple of aspects\nPatients require more time and attention if they're alert in bed or walking up and down the hallways with their respirators into\nWe're talking about a a cultural change so we have to buy in from the nursing staff once we were able to get that by an event you have to have buy in from the physicians also\nThat's harder in a community hospital where physicians are more independent and the only two rounds three days a week gradually the ideas took hold he says though they're still resistance to using the eighth through F checklist to make sure every element is it tended to every day in every patient\nI think in concept it's the rule but actually going through and seeing a B C D E F is the exception\nIt was even a challenge to make it routine at Vanderbilt\nLet the ... and I can't be\nJoanna throwing a clinical pharmacists to the ICU says when she arrived at Vanderbilt it was clear what needed to get done but nobody was responsible for seeing it through\nThey need to many cat were nice to be here and rethink or day in San ... helped me teasing project to really empower the American dream than than makes it happening every day\nWest elites crusade now is to make what this hospital does standard around the world for one thing he argues it can actually save money by reducing the amount of time people spend an expensive ICU words\nBut the most important thing of course is not the money is the human being and so if they are getting better care surviving more often with a more intact brain and not bouncing back the next year we see some financial benefits to me that too

challenging for for the bonds and there was a lot of speculation that would kill off the market there was this fear you know investors would see these big losses and nobody would ever want to buy a catastrophe bombed again but the market has has come back pretty well\nSo we're seeing more catastrophic storms are our tap on just going to become a riskier investment\nYeah and then that's always going to be a potential problem the more big storms you have sort of less attractive these bonds are young but there is another issue I think that is even more of an immediate problem over the past decade interest rates and things like treasury bonds have been very low so investors have turned to these catastrophe bonds because\nYou know they could are much higher interest rates on them well now interest rates in general are rising so relatively speaking catastrophe bonds aren't as attractive as an investment as they were in that\nThat's bound to weaken demand for them\nInteresting lesson

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen\nSaudis flew into stand all last week drove to the Saudi consulate and then deported that same day on private planes headed for Cairo and to buy\nAnd this is according to the Washington Post which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudis sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that feed is Fifteen people is a lot to to kill an individual in a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said it actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping\nOperation but we still don't know but what we are understanding\nIs that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show not clear whether they wanted to capture and prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way okay let's\nLet's unravel that a little bit ... U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what what Saudi officials discussing ...\nCorrect misses us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on the show to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening stumble could be sort of plan B\nOr for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these intercepts I eat did they warn ... what\nMy sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government warn ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nAnd from Americans for the art\nThis is all the ...

low in the low sixties clouds and storms tomorrow than drying up becoming breezy and cool later in the day as the temperature falls from the seventies into the fifties where it eighty four in Rochester you can find more news on line and there will be like six on news that or\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know that Chang President Trump is attacking Democrats over a plan to expand Medicare to cover all Americans\nIn an op ed published today in USA Today Trump says the Democrats' plan would hurt seniors he made a similar claim last night at a campaign rally in Iowa\nA majority of Democrats have already signed up for his socialist healthcare plan that would of glitter right Medicare Medicare Advantage for twenty seniors\nAlright fact checkers have challenged the president's claims and one of those facts ... is our very own Scott Horsley who joins us now to set the record straight have got good to be with us\nSo we are just weeks away from the new terms now Democrats are talking a lot about health care to both sides are clearly focusing on this issue now\nThey are ... you know health care is an emotional issue it taps into people's fears and vulnerabilities it also taps into our pocketbooks in a big way so it has long been a potent issue for mobilizing voters especially older voters who are more likely to show up at the polling place\nIn the past Republicans have campaigned against Obamacare this year Democrats think it's their tour and they're campaigning against GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare fully half of the Democrats' campaign ads had been devoted to this issue Here's Senate democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nThere is one issue above any other that is going to define the results in the November sixth election and that is health care\nAnd President Trump is apparently also sensing the political power of that argument so he's mowing a counter offensive with this critique of Medicare for all\nSo why does come saying about that program in particular this this idea basically letting everyone get Medicare instead of having to pay for private insurance\nThe first thing the president says in his USA Today column is that it would carry an astonishing price tag thirty\nTwo point six trillion dollars over a decade now that sounds like a lot of money as it is but what the president leaves out is important context which is that our current healthcare system\nIs on track to pay even more than that we already have the costly as healthcare system in the world and if you count tax breaks for the insurance that workers get on the job\nThe federal government already thoughts about two thirds of the total bill but we're not getting any of the efficiencies or the buying power that would come from replacing private insurance with a single payer system\nAnd how does the president explain why shifting to a single payer regime would hurt senior citizens\nArgues that Medicare for all would lead to rationing doctors and hospitals would be put out of business that seniors would lose control of their health care but he offers no evidence for those claims he he really seems to just be a playing on generational fears that any effort to boost health security for younger\nAmericans has to come at the expense of their higher seniors\nOkay but realistically what are the prospects ultimately for Medicare for all\nEven if Democrats win in November they're not going to have the power to pass Medicare for all over the president's certain veto and uh like Obamacare and GOP plans to replace Obamacare Medicare for all might not look so shiny and break when you actually have to debate the the details of the plan\nBut if we're going to have that debate Elsa is probably useful to do so with facts not fear and unfortunately the president's op ed column today doesn't really contribute to that\nFinally the president has repeatedly said that he had kept his promise to protect people with pre existing conditions is that true he\nHas made that promise repeatedly but in fact he and his fellow Republicans have tried to unwind the protections in Obamacare and they proposed replacing them with unspecified state level guarantees\nThe insurance industry has warned that could destabilize the market create a patchwork of state regulations and raise prices for older sicker Americans\nThat NPR fact checkers Scott Horsley think he's got You're welcome\nParts of the Carolinas are still trying to assess the damage from last month's Hurricane Florence\nAnd now here comes Michael Storm slammed into the Florida Panhandle today with gust of a hundred and fifty five miles per hour by the time Michael reaches the Carolinas tomorrow it is expected to be downgraded to a tropical storm\nAs NPR's Tom Gjelten reports from Wilmington North Carolina some of the problems of hurricane can bring only emerge weeks after the storm has passed\nAt the market north apartment complex in Wilmington U Haul trucks lined the streets the apartment buildings here survived the storm and tax but the power was out for many days during heavy rain and the units were damaged by mold the roughly five hundred residents are being told they have to vacate\nMoving on up and move it out where to go to\nGary Moore and his girlfriend are hauling furniture out more says they'll put it all in storage he was planning to move in with his mother but he just found out her apartment has been temporarily condemned as well\nFEMA representatives are on the ground here they can give to displace tenants some rent money to get them started but they can find new housing for them the apartment owners giving each tenant a thousand dollars in cash but Moore says that won't go far\nYeah ... and they know they love to go to the movie with a love able to do it at all like you were a\nMore his girlfriend's Sarah Sewall kings sits in a chair by the front door her head in her hands I'm stressed out\nI'm says\nIs the first thing the red cross here says about seven hundred and fifty people in Wilmington need shelter now not counting those living with friends or relatives churches that provided shelter want their facilities back\nSchools that sheltered people are reopening so the housing problem here is actually getting worse not better\nSame with the economic situation some problems show up only after business owners assess the damage employees can be caught unprepared like Tony Witherspoon she worked at a gourmet markets in downtown Wilmington\nWe closed during a hurricane we actually opened back up that\nTuesday for the public after the hurricane um ...\nWe received a letter that they were going to be temporarily seething operation\nSo what looked like a promising situation suddenly turned oblique\nThey didn't give us a date that they may possibly the opening Nick how they gave us a very short notice three days\nGabriel Robinson who worked in a pub in downtown Wilmington had a similar experience after the hurricane damage to his business I came in for a few days to help with the cleanup process but\nOther than that I have no idea about the work environment or what's going to happen with that\nNeither business owner was available for comment\nThis day Robinson has come to the offices of stepped up Wilmington a nonprofit that helps disadvantaged people find new employment\nStep of Wilmington workload has doubled since the hurricane challenges like the one Robbins and faces are not uncommon it leaves me in a position where I don't know if I'm unemployed I don't know when my next paycheck is coming small businesses are especially vulnerable to something like a hurricane\nGary Coleman who directs the small business center at Cape Fear community college here says unless the business has insurance a disaster can wipe it out", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Rochester", "day": "10"}
