U.

about but now they feel really appalled and the core message in a world of negative polarization is the people who say you are bad a really bad themselves\nAnd this is essentially the message Republicans are now driving home and they've eliminated the Democratic advantage and and to see as them and in red states not in blue states but in red states you begin to see the polls swing over the Republican direction\nHow about that I mean David right both sides have clearly been galvanized by Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings were less than four weeks away from this midterm election can't you see that fresh energy driven by the confirmation hearings reshaping battle lines\nWere absolutely if you look at the polls and again we have four more weeks before this election and uh in this era for weeks is what you know for years used to be\nUm it does appear that\nThat this may be helping the Democrats in the house races\nBut it could be helping the Republicans in the Senate races in part because where those Senate battlegrounds are they are uh the the biggest prize is in this in the Senate elections are largely democratic held seats in states that Donald Trump won\nAnd um we are seeing a significant amount of movement in those polls toward the Republicans\nBut you think it could help a Democrat and house races because of the suburban women do\nIt the ... the the biggest

crown prince personally how your colleagues make that direct link to someone\nWell you're right that the you know increasingly the presumption a by intelligence sources on Capitol Hill in ... in the White House is that our colleague a Jamal 'cause shaggy is dead end that Saudi Arabia is to blame and one of the biggest pieces of evidence or U.S intelligence reports that\nThat shows that the crown prince actually ordered an operation to lure him back to Saudi Arabia where he was supposed to be detained that the timing of all this is unclear but it is\nUh if if what we're hearing from from Turkish sources is true\nWhich is that a essentially is a hit squad Fifteen people was waiting for him in in the consulate\nUm it is just impossible to imagine that some kind of that an operation like that would not have happened without the knowledge and approval of the very top levels of of the Saudi\nGovernment and when President Trump was asked about 'cause she'll be in the oval office yesterday about an arms deal with the Saudis and this is how he answered\nWe don't like it John we'd all like we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten billion dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have four or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable but\nDidn't let me turn to you let me turn this should the u._s. be selling arms to Saudi Arabia right now\nWell like the president credit for almost a usually when people sell their sole they tried to deny that there certainly is a pretty honest that were selling a or democratic principles were selling human rights were selling us residents life\nDown to two for for money\nOr even stipulate at a price and so ... it's sort of ... and looks like the axis of greed and we in the Saudis are part of it uh and the second thing that's seems clear here is that we have spent the last couple of years sucking up to the Saudis\nAnd you would think if that would have a good effect on Saudi foreign policy you think they wouldn't do this sort of thing and so the idea of flattering people to get them to do your thing flattering really dictatorial

Hi Mary Louise\nSo the G argue has been around for a century since around the time of the Bolshevik Revolution but safe to say for a lot of us here in America the first time we heard about them was twenty sixteen\nThat's correct from the election hacking but these are very busy guys and girls um\nThey have been involved in this ongoing case of to G R U agents the alleged agents are accused of poisoning Sergei Skripal and Britain he's a former G R U agent himself who had had a traitor to his wife ... swap was living in Britain\nThe difference though this case is filled with lots of glaring almost comedic screw up some first of all screwy ball in his daughter survived the attack in March which was was clearly not the intent\nThan assassination attempt that did not manage to assassinate the two people who were being targeted go on that is correct\nAnd the two suspects were seen on the security cameras which are all over Britain and then the suspects go bad are back in Russia and they make this very strange appearance on on Russian television to explain what they were doing in solitary but\nSo the\nSo there are blaming their explain that solved there is this beautiful town and they were just tourists and of course if you were going to to England\nYou would make a trip to solve barriers to see this a church tower the hundred and twenty three meters high um and then they said well it was cold and flashy and so they turned around after a couple of days and and headed back\nTo Russia okay so fast forward to this month to October and to some equally questionable spy craft on display and then other ones\nRight and so this is sort of the follow up the Dutch announced that just last week that they've caught for they say gee argue agents\nAh with high tech equipment in a rental car outside the office for the prohibition of chemical weapons which was testing\nThe the chemicals apparently used in the attack back in March um now they were caught in a rental car they apparently tried to smash some of this equipment one of the phones or was apparently traced to a G R U headquarters in Moscow had only been used a couple of days earlier\nI'm even found a receipt for a taxi or from the barracks to the airport in Moscow\nIt sounds so clumsy it almost makes you wonder if they wanted to be caught or at least didn't care if they were I think\nWhat we could say is they really don't seem to care if they're caught the Russians just deny deny deny on there's no indication that they're they're stopping these kinds of actions\nBut what is the U.S trying to do to stop these kinds of actions and we keep hearing about indictments for example against Jerry officers\nThat's right the indictments against you argue officers are seven were announced last week twelve from the Mueller investigation in July [noise] um so there is this naming and shaming and providing details it'll level we really haven't seen previously now one of the interesting developments is how to respond\nOr two months ago President Trump has signed a directive\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to do see if this deters the Russians in any way\nAnd Paris Greg Myre thank you thank you turns\nOut that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown up by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nA premise is that there is no to the conclusion other than the Russians faceless ... for the attempted murder\nBack in September of British authorities held a press conference they released passport photos and names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nAt his life story so they were traveling underwriters says I'm visa ...\nA guy like Eric towler that sounded like a

media in Venezuela pinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because this guy's you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook but\nRemember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy the trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise]\nWhen you look at these photos on there on our on our website and it's just a bunch of rushing just random Russian guys going through in kind of fight saying at this like military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they like photographing is it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis was a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person I put a photo shows are boy ... 'em up on the wall\nColonel ana totally ... the speeding image of the man and the photo released by the British right there on the wall with his name's spelled out for all to see and bell and cat turned up a lot more it turns out if you're willing to risk getting a nasty computer virus you can download all sorts of Russian databases\nThings like insurance databases um driver's licenses voter database and things like for some reason and one hundred percent legal but it's out there\nIn in those databases they found way more photos and details about their ... old phone numbers and addresses including one that linked him to a local military intelligence headquarters\nThis week they also id ... tell us by a guy they think is named Aleksandr Michigan Michigan came from a small town in Russia's far north once they found him belly cat worked with Russian journalists to send someone up there\nAnd they had a picture and are showing around people in the town they're like oh yeah that that's all right you know that Sasha ... in short in Russia in ...

from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases and abuse like the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that skating horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions you on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though isn't to knowledge meant by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now\nI'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think that the people in Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal release today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four
