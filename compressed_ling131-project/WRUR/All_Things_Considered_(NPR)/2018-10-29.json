historical perspective on this I mentioned you're a professor of Holocaust studies\nDo you see parallels or are we nowhere near that point yeah um\nI see certain ... certain ways in which the analogy does not apply at all\nIn Nazi Germany this was the government's doing this uh what we're seeing in this country in terms of anti Semitism is may be a willingness some part of ... certain segments of the government and certain people in government\nTo look the other way but this is not government sponsored\nHowever there are parallels a the parallels in the attacks on democratic institutions or institutions which are at the bedrock of our\nDemocracy the judiciary are elected members of Congress you can disagree with them but when you begin to engage an ad hominem attacks\nAre attacks on the

also see lessons wage for civilization to advance and and do things in a very different way than the way they unfold in the ... century\nI think so I think first of all not to see it just on one side

what's more showers arrive Wednesday\nRight around sixty forty four burly Rochester find more news on line a W X. six are news the other word\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nAnd I'm Ari Shapiro we're learning more today about the man who's believed to have killed eleven worshippers at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday he was arraigned in a courtroom in Pittsburgh earlier today\nJulie turkey which has been reporting on his background for the New York times and she joins us now welcome thank you thank you for having me you've been speaking with people who know Robert powers including a childhood friend of his what have you learned from them\nSo most of the people that we've spoken to describe them as very quiet very isolated you lived alone he seemed to watch television in the night he PO box for not the sort of a mailbox that his apartment which is just south of synagogue [noise]\nBut I spoke to a friend of his has known him for years and years\nThey went to elementary school together they went to middle school together they went to high school together\nAnd he said that that I'm Robert hours as a child was very smart but also seem to really struggle with social cues and the two of them were friends and they would play together they would build things together they would take things apart\nThey would build bombs together as sort of pranks and law watermelons but as time went on the two of them sort of grew apart and Robert hours became quieter more isolated\nAnd then in high school eventually just disappear and it's not clear if he graduated and it's not clear to this man what happened after that\nPaint a picture for us of his life at this apartment complex the man you portraying your reporting almost seems like a dose like he's not even there\nYeah um so he lived in is sort of low slung apartment building about twenty five minutes south of the synagogue and the people they're sort of described him as so unremarkable that they didn't even remember the name\nAnd that he was pretty much a ghost she would come and go and sometimes disappear for days come back go inside and that was pretty much it\n[noise] and there's such a contrast between vet demeanor in person and who he was on line tells about the person he was on social media\nYeah so at least in the last year he spent a lot of time on the Internet and he\nUsed a lot of really terrible things about Jews about immigrants he was clearly very angry and he seemed to find a like mine get community on Gabrielle crucial media network that has become more popular\nAmong All right activists among white nationalist people whose views are unwelcome in places like Twitter and Facebook even the president and didn't escape his\nAnger and he seemed to think that the president had not gone far enough in completing the goals that Mr Bowers\nAnd can you tell whether those online communities shaped informed Hughes hateful views or whether he just found a home for those pre existing beliefs when he joined these communities\nI don't think that we know enough yet to see that I think than is one of the things that he's going to come out over the next couple of weeks of the next couple of months as investigators going into his past\nWhat else are you still hoping to learn about him and his motives\nI mean we would certainly like to know more about how did she become as hateful as he did and how long has that been going on and what role did Internet playing [noise] did the current sort of political anger and conflict playing uh so\nI Know that investigators are going to be going through his computer files are going to be going through his home they're going to be talking to folks who know him who might have worked with in family members friends that kind of thing\nBut Julie ... of the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bauer as the accused synagogue shooter thank you very much\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow\nAt today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as a country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding not surprisingly White House press\nThe terrorists are Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage and the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents\nAre and and against the media uh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on this rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the solar in cheap or certainly not the night or in chief\nUh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy uh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nShe says I guess she doesn't have any ideas what she does and I have none\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the midterm what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nEverything that happened outside the office she didn't care to stand to be important story was what happened inside or office it was what she had to focus on it was the story it was what was really happening of course all the time it was tempting to get caught up in the outside story the affairs the sex\nThe trails the soap opera but the real work was here inside or office\nIt almost feels like a FISA statement for the book\nIt is actually and I put that in because I didn't quite trust the reader to get it ... you know those two paragraphs or a marker for the reader saying look guys this is where the real story is\nI Know that is true of the novel is that really true in life it's hard to imagine that the trails and affairs cannot actually be what's important to whether American lives or dies\n[noise] I have to say that in the long run they don't matter the stuff that happens outside the office doesn't matter and and I can tell you that by analogy so what happens in really good marriage counseling the marriage counseling illustrated in this book\nIs that by the end of the process when you really begin to get it when\nYou can actually understand for the first time in your life what your partner is really saying to you you feel like a new person it's as if you shed everything that happened before\nRight I mean so if you had an affair before it's as if it happened to a different person it doesn't count anymore you're you're new does that make any sense\nIt doesn't it makes it sound like the marriage counseling is about much more than marriage it's about real transformation of each individual\nIt has to be it absolutely has to be and that's why it takes time because it's it is not some kind of\nBlinding insight that you're going to have oh God this happened to be a nice fourteen now we understand it I'll be different it's not about that at all it's about learning lessons that you should have learned when you were growing up maybe by watching your parents but your parents didn't have it together they weren't didn't have a great marriage it's about learning these lessons of how\nYou can relate to the other person how you can understand what they're thinking and you have to practice you have to practice it again and again and that's that's what the couple of dozen this book there are certain little things that the marriage cancer leads them through for example throughout the book show stopping to say I want you to look at each other and told me what you see\nAnd as you read the book you'll see that they see more as they learn more until they're really can see the other person in a in a deep and meaningful way\n[noise] I said that we only me three characters in this book which is not exactly true because the way you right that's right it really is sort of a fourth character there is which is the marriage itself\nIt's the marriage itself and the marriage scouts are actually sees the marriage as a distinct and real character she's actually listening to the marriage as the marriage changes in the office and she's trying to get\nThe couple to be able to do that as well to see their marriage as as something that they built over time that's very important and it's all live in a way this different from each of the\nMarriage rates have been going down for decades according to the Pew Research center today just about half of adults are married down from about Seventy five percent in the sixties your book has clearly pro marriage why do you think this institution still matters well\nI mean you're absolutely right my book is pro marriage um but it's not pro marriage in any kind of transnational sense that we have to have marriage is pro an important relationship because it makes your life so much better you know I mean there's a reason that everybody wants to have a relationship it's like\nThe two of you individually are one thing but if you can get it together you literally become more than the two of you if you can if you can create a important fulfilling relationship together\nDo you think every marriage could benefit from a good marriage counselor or is it really just sort of for people in crisis and dysfunction\nOkay I I think that every marriage could benefit from a good marriage counselor you know you may not have to go for four years but I think that um you can really learn a lot I don't think you should settle for a marriage that just you know is okay\nI mean it's it's the critical thing in your life you want to marriage that's wonderful you want to marriage that that you can feel and talk to and that gives it back to you [noise]\nWell ... thank you so much for talking with us about your book ... thank you so much this was really fun is

two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\nThat just goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing and the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities in these additional\nFive thousand or

border agents used more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter dissolves who a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so these soldiers were also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties or their own leaders support role again and plus we come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the eighties seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate

walking only system in August that shift hasn't been reported until now that means there is no longer wait list to access their services but it also means you might have to get there early to score bed\nWe're pretty much always that that oil and uh and if if there is a bad that it's open it's only for a matter of hours\nWe received a narrow lead he Leo's inpatient detox unit in Rochester and she says the change to walk in is a way to help people get treatment at the moment they're ready for it instead of calling ahead to make a plan that might follow through she says forcing people to make appointments had some pitfalls\nThat created a kind of a backlog of people and then we were having trouble getting hold people some people phones weren't working or we were able to reach down on that they create an environment where someone is ready for treatment were able to get them in the day\nStill though deniro says demand for detox outpacing supply\nThe hardest part of that is always having

tomorrow or the fifty forty four in Rochester it's all things considered that five thirty five from NPR\nNews this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro the man accused of sending more than a dozen package bombs too high profile Democrats critics of President Trump and CNN made his first court appearance today\nFifty six year old she's our say oc could spend decades behind bars if he's convicted Danny Rivera from member station WFCR and was in the courtroom and joined us from Miami Hi Danny\nHey I Know this a court appearance was largely procedural tell us what happened in court this afternoon\nYeah it was really like you said mostly procedural there wasn't a whole lot of you know guilt or innocence talk\nI'm basically say up was formally charged on five counts of federal crimes ranging from threatening former presidents\nTo illegal mailings of explosives um remember he was arrested near Miami last friday he'd been driving a white van plastered with anti democratic pro Trump's an anti media stickers and he'd apparently been living out of that band for we don't know exactly how long but for some time\nI'm In court today prosecutors basically said they don't want him to have the option of bail because they consider him a flight risk and danger to other people in the community\nWhat was his demeanor\nSo before the the hearing actually got started he was talking with his attorneys and he was wearing a he was he was shackled at the wrists and ankles and he was wearing a tan\nJumpsuit he didn't see much um but when he talked he did sound kind of defeated you could hear his his you could barely actually hear his voice at all it was it was quite raspy\n'em before the the proceedings you could I caught a glimpse of him tearing up and looked like his his attorneys kind of gathered around to to shield him from from the view and once that started happening I'm the judge asked them series of questions you know do you understand the charges brought against you if you just kind of nodded I mean he looked\nSomewhat defeated I Would say um [noise] and the\n... yeah and ...\nSorry about that um you you could see you could see he was upset at some point you his face kind of turn red who's cheering up his upper lip was quivering um he he didn't look like he was doing too well and\nAnd this was all taking place in southern Florida which is not worth trials going to take place explained that\nYeah so the charges were actually filed in the southern district of New York um he was arrested in in my close to Miami so that's where the the original I'm hearing is taking place but he will at some point be taken up to to New York\nOr the U.S attorney there is the one prosecuting the case of many of the package bombs were mailed there in that office has a long history of prosecuting these kinds of crimes\nUm the the trial itself I wouldn't bet on it happening anytime soon these cases tend to take years or even longer to go to to to trial if there's no ...\nYou'll I'm In the meantime the next year into the judge said it's going to be on friday here in Miami so here you're at least until then and at that point we learn whether he'll be recently released on bill\nOr if you can be transferred up to New York for for more hearings right that is Danny Rivero reporter with member station WFCR in in South Florida thanks

helps people with disabilities\nChris ... is vice president of residential supports with achiever and she joins me now via Skype to remember the Rosenthal brothers a crush of welcome and I'm On my condolences on your loss I'm so sorry\nOh thank you very much we appreciate that\nDescribe she's so and David for me what were they like\nDavid and see so we're larger than life they were two of the most kind generous people they were so entwined into the fabric of their community\nThey loved to rock all through his ... hell they would stop and talk to everyone and anyone\nAnd I read that she saw had an official rule he was a greeter at the synagogue\nYes stay still was not only a greeter at the synagogue but I Would refer to him as the ambassador to throw hell he was always hello how are you David Was a very reserved person\nBut as soon as you said hello today that he just opened up they were so close to their family David would call his mother every single day when he got home from work\nThey got up with a positive attitude\nHow's your family how are you do and what your day look like for today blessings for you today and they threw parties for everything in fact one time they had their bathrooms remodeled in their home and they wanted to throw a party for remodeling the bathroom [laughter]\nTrying to imagine that one and and and then\nThere was a next door neighbor where they had their house remodeled and they were going to put it on the market and they went to the open house because they wanted to be a part of that yeah\nWhat kind of work today do you describe them coming home from work\nDavid Was working for good well and cleaning and see if there was about to start a job two days a week and a family oh business\nHas it taken a toll on your staff who worked with them and help them for for all these years\nYes to raise them at such an early\nAge excuse me and they are such a\nVital part of their family our family so it is extremely difficult now\nI'm so sorry part of what also must be difficult is letting all your other clients all the other people who rely on achieve a no how are you talking them through this\n[noise] myself and other staff member went out yesterday to meet with house late so people her down to offer them and explanation as best we can about the events of Saturday\nAnd to offer any support we are also going to offer people kind of a service where people can come and share their memories and their failings\nThrough your planning some kind of gathering within your organization to honor and remember them absolutely and it sounds like these are two brothers who like to party who would have appreciated that gesture and been right there in the mix\nI think that is exactly correct I think that our Saturday she could have counted them to be where they were\nThat's where they wanted to have been the best way that we can remember them an honor them is to know that they live their life well anybody you talked to in ... near them they were well respected in their church and their family", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "29"}
