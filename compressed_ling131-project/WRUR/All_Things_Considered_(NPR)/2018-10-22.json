WRX exciting news\nAbout um NPR News this is all things considered ... and I'm Audie Cornish President Trump declared over the weekend that the U.S is pulling out of the intermediate range nuclear forces arms control treaty now president Ronald Reagan signed this treaty with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the White House thirty one years ago\nFor the first time in history the language of arms control was replaced by arms reduction in this case the complete elimination of an entire trash of us and Soviet nuclear missiles\nHere with me now to discuss why this treaty is no longer acceptable to another Republican president as NPR national security correspondent David Welna welcome to the studio ... okay so the intermediate range nuclear forces arms control treaty or we can call it the INS what does history to actually do\nWell you know this was signed in the Nineteen eighties when the U.S in the Soviet Union had nuclear to missiles deployed along the periphery of Eastern Europe and they could reach their targets in only eight minutes which left almost no time for any response it was a very dangerous situation which neither the U.S nor the Soviet Union wanted to continue\nAnd so the treaty requires the destruction of all these intermediate range land base nuclear missiles once and for all and it really was the beginning of the end of the Cold War\nNow President Trump says Russia has not been in compliance with the treaty do we know this is true\nWell you know U.S officials beginning with President Obama four years ago have been saying that Russia's been cheating on this treaty\nThat Russia's been deploying some land base intermediate range cruise missiles that could strike targets in Eastern Europe in violation of the treaty but Obama did not want to kill this arms control treaty figuring that it's so provided a means for talking with the Russians at least\nOf course Ronald Reagan a Republican hero right to the party what is the difference in philosophy here why we're seeing this president President Trump determined to pull out of the treaty\nWell you know Trump does not like international agreements he's already pulled out of the Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear deal\nI think this really shows that the Russia hawks and administration are getting their way and it's not the state department is doing this even though that's traditionally where such policies are carried out this bears the hallmarks of national security adviser John Bolton\nHe's never liked arms control deal he wrote in two thousand eleven that the u._s. should leave the treaty and Bolton is in Moscow today and tomorrow delivering that message what's been the response from the Russian government\nAre not great Russia's deputy foreign minister Sergei ... was quoted yesterday by the Russian news agency task says calling this move blackmail by the U.S he also called it a very dangerous stuff\nIs there any chance that Russia can gain something from the U. S. spelling out\nThere is it would allow them to more freely deploy weapons that they've apparently already developed while the U.S only last year began doing research and development for intermediate range weapons remembered thousands of weapons of this nature had to be destroyed so it's not like the U.S has stockpiled ready to deploy now\nIs it possible that the ... might be for lack of a better term bluffing right to to get a better deal\nThat could be this is a Soviet era treaty and it limits what the US can do not just in Europe but across the entire planet and Trump would like a deal to include China which right now has no restrictions on deploying intermediate range nuclear weapons they might be pressured to joined the INS if the U.S started placing such weapons in the south Pacific\nDavid in the meantime the u._s. does have other arms control agreements with Russia or those imperil\nI think this does mark a major shift in us arms control policies since Nineteen seventies the thrust has been to limit nuclear weapons and under Trump the momentum all seems to be toward ending these treaties and letting the sole nuclear arms race get going again\nAfter all this administration has pushed for developing new nuclear weapons and they've been approved by the new defense budget\nThat's NPR's David Welna David thank you for your reporting your well commodity\nResidents of the Florida Panhandle are still reeling from the destruction caused by hurricane Michael\nAs a snapshot of where they stand now twelve days after the storm about Seventy thousand customers remain without power some water and sewer systems are not working\nAnd cell phone service is spotty a complete breakdown of communications during and after the storm crippled the emergency response and now it hinders recovery NPR's Debbie Elliott reports Jim\nMelvin lives in ...

around supporting the failed repeal effort and then helping orchestrate one more push to undo the law a couple of months later he says working with Trump on health care and other issues created a real bond\nWhat happened was success he became president United States we started working together we started working together and it builds trust when you have successive builds trust when you build trust is built friendships\nTrump put it another way then we started to like each other then we started to love each other\nA close relationship with Trump is an asset if a Republican wants to survive a

Detrow NPR News [noise]\n\nAnd you portray going on to Christie's auction block Thursday maybe reminiscent of a Rembrandt but it's actually the work of artificial intelligence\nIs called a portrait of Edmund Bellamy the work was created using an algorithm and it might fetch around ten thousand dollars\nComputer's making art is nothing new but a computer creating a portrait that's being auctioned by such a prestigious art house now that is new art appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the bugs around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this in welcome thank you a pleasure to be here also how controversial is this in the art world or a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art\nYou can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine all by Marcel disarmed where he literally took a men's urine and hang it on a wall right and this completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what are actually is for\nThe twenty first century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen again and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of the human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand that things like technique and the uniqueness of the piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply well they still apply\nBut let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or any work of art really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process to roll out\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the voters who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine oh\nThe artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artist ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the quarter is the collective and maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it\nAnd given that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so\nI think in terms of art the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated art work hasn't gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened because this is a canvas print", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city":
