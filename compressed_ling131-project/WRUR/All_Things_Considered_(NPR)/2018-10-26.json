commentators on the week in politics now\nThis news\nLife from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi Singh a Florida Man is now facing federal charges in connection with more than a dozen explosive devices addressed a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump this week NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports federal agents picked up Caesar say ... in South Florida\nCaesar say August facing five counts including the legal mailing of explosives threatening former presidents and assaulting federal officers the FBI Director Christopher Wray says a nationwide investigation has recovered Thirteen improvised explosive devices\nEach device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe a smallpox a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material\nRace as say I was identified through a fingerprint donate ... allegedly sent a congresswoman Maxine Waters a Democrat from California authorities say there may be more explosive devices in the postal system undo along NPR News New York\nInvestigators say their probe is not over there looking at least nationwide that includes tracking say ox digital footprint all indications so far that not only was he a registered Republican but say I was a diehard Trump supporter at the White House today President Trump said political violence will not be tolerated\nMuch never allow political violence to take root in America and not let that happen and I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nBut the FBI says it's too early to say what motivated the foiled attacks on Trump's political foes\nToday he did not react to calls from across the political spectrum to take the lead as president of the United states and tone down the inflammatory rhetoric against his political critics and the press which he still accuses is spreading fake news CNN was among those targeted this week\nThe L G Beatty cue community is reflecting on the life and brutal death of Matthew Shepard murder in Laramie, Wyoming in Nineteen Ninety eight\nIt was a hate crime that had a galvanizing effect on the nation but discrimination persists\nOn CNN and then later he sent out a tweet that complaining that this bomb stuff\nThat's his were his phrase a was hurting the Republicans in the election there's something very specific here about our president and his party because it knows that most of its supporters support President Trump is incapable of talking out against him\nDavid you want to answer that I Know parsing through the Twitter feed can take out some time but okay I Want to move on to something else then defense secretary Jim Mattis has authorized the deployment of troops to the U.S Mexico border and this is as this caravan of\n... some thousand migrants is traveling north through Mexico um the response to this is clearly political right now that has no legislation is being passed right there is no other kind of movement David what do you see and how we are talking about immigrants migrants in asylum seekers right now is this a permanent shift\nI Do think it as a permanent shift if us working class Americans or why their incomes have stagnated the\nTwo answers they give our immigration and trade\nAnd so a lot more people have come to see immigration not only as a cultural shift\nBut as an economic threat as well I think what strikes me about this particular episode is that again the catastrophic tones pleasing about it we've had waves of refugees come to our shores throughout our history as late as April or some come ashore some get granted asylum about twenty two percent in this last wave\nAnd we're a big country and we can handle a lot of people are and the idea that this is some existential threat seems to be completely overblown it's an issue that we can deal with a but the way it's being portrayed as some some out of control situation is just out of proportion to what's actually\nGoing into mid terms what is the Democratic replied to a a Republican platform that talks about these issues such tried to Italy\nWell I think one of the difficulties here besides the fact that President Trump clearly sort of focused on this caravan because he knows that talking about the threat of immigration\nOr helps to mobilize his base of the problem here is that there is a total mischaracterization of what Democrats stand for they're constantly accused of being for open borders\nAnd when you look at all of the immigration bills have ever voted for it they call for an end with support I should say back in the day from some Republicans\nThey all spoke of obvious limits on immigration and the ... in ten days right I mean right but the I think what they are doing what they have to do is say we're not far open borders and this is an attempt to push us away from issues related to economics to health care\nOr end to the issues a lot of voters voting on to the point where Republicans have had to essentially mislead a that's a terrible word about where they stand on healthcare a and I think they are doing that quite effectively and a lot of a local races governors races and I think an integrate many house races to\nDavid to Democrats are putting a lot of stock in conversation about health care how are you thinking\nAbout that yeah I think it's and credibly stupid idea\nA Donald Trump represent he's represents a big change in American foreign policy of big change in American identity or he plays on cultural ended any the issues it's really a comprehensive critique of where the American establishment has been\nAnd what strikes me as the Democrats are not even trying to answer that critique they go to health care they said we you know we Obamacare it gives you protection for for insurance for pre existing conditions and we want to preserve that so well Trump makes a very comprehensive mostly cultural and the density critique\nThe Democrats come back with a materialist response which is we're going to protect protect your benefits and that's a decent response in normal times but in the times like this of the Democrats should be making an argument in defense of pluralism in defense of diversity a big argument against what Trump's stance\nEJ last hard minute to you\nI think that yeah the voters disagree with tape it that\nThe if you look at all of the polling the top of the top three issues health care and economics ranked one to or to one uh in where in where the voters come from I think Trump's cultural message appeals to a minority of the electorate which he is trying to mobilize\nAnd I think national unity or just come simply from defending pluralism which by the way Democrats do I wrote recently about a lot of Democrats in a few Republicans defending\nUh being open for example to refugees and away the Trump Administration has not but the way we come together is to solve problems that's what a candidate like Stacey Abrams is talking about down in Georgia where I was a this week and it seems to be working pretty well for her\nAnd that's a JD on at the Washington Post and Brookings Institution thank you so much good to be with you David Brooks at the New York times have a good

the head of the phone they will be apprehended however a ... officer and an attack at their own personal safety extraordinarily serious they they can't have a valley of course that defended his house\nJohn how is this intense rhetoric playing out at the U.S Mexico border\nSo today I spoke with the mayor of Columbus New Mexico is ... cities right on the border across from Columbus Mexico he said an armed militia from Florida is already camped out west of town patrolling private ranch land you got a call from another militia leader from South Carolina earlier in the week\nHe said quote if you need help with the illegals coming across you let me know and will be there\nThe militia leader reportedly said if were fired on will shoot back solace told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol ... we've\nHeard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and the care of and that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet or tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number sort of more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase\nThat's a huge growth how our border agents handling Matt\nSo a border patrol agent in South Texas told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect ice will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior\nAnd that leads thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped

if it comes across as like a radical statement\nBecause so much of what we're able to do with artists skip boxed in so much\nJust want to be gone\nOne of the songs on this album is about making the decision to go into music for time vulnerable right yup vulnerable um is about like me sitting in the\nParking lot at work and like not wanting to go in and um one day I just called up my boss and and

like you need to not want to skip it on your like jog getting artists in our writing to be on Spotify playlist and why are like watering down and really deluding\nTheir own creativity give me an example give me an example of a song that could have gone to different\nYeah stranger is actually one that\nHas a very mellow verse um and then it switches up to be really aggressive and I think it's a prime example of like what not to do you want to get a playlist that because people are going to like do you like [laughter] I hear you're like oh you don't want to be like job and you're like you know writing a report or whatever\n[noise]\nMe me me\nMe Don is strange I mean toning and changed on it and\nIt seems cliche to talk about um\nBeing a role model more empowerment and visibility and yet\nI mean I I used to be I mean I'm Still obsessed with like five fi and fantasy novels and I feel like I'm like turning myself into upper tagging this one it it feels surreal\nHonestly um I I I I feel lucky I also feel like I have worked really hard to like create something that I'm proud to share and if people can connect to\n'em and I hope to like not just to be an example but use any kind
