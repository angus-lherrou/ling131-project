thousands of Central Americans from crossing illegally Here's NPR's Tom Bowman\nThe department of homeland security has made a request to the Pentagon to send hundreds of troops down to the border to help with a border patrol\nWere told to defense secretary Jim Mattis will sign that order today sending as many as eight hundred army troops down to the border we're told they're going to be military

strained ties between the U.S in Saudi Arabia and it's sort of rivalries and the middle east between the Saudis the Iranians\nAnd the Turks turkey has been strategic and dominating the narrative and earlier today NPR's Deb Amos told me that Turkey's president isn't just trying to gain an advantage over the Saudis\nHe also was playing his hand to improve relations with the U.S at ... they've been terrible over the past year on a variety of issues um but you know it's ... ... is working with Washington on this particular event\nAnd the pressure comes at a time that the Saudis and the Turks are on different sides of this regional cleavage and it goes to this question about how\nMajority Muslim countries are governed\nThey favor Islamist activists for example the Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis the UAE eat the Egyptians they hate those people are they put them in jail\nAnd so for for turkey it it is good for them to see the Saudi leadership in some ways shaking their reputations question because it is good for turkey as a regional leader\nYou know in the U.S policymakers are so focused on the divide between Saudi Arabia and Iran um how has around played into\nThis story if at all oh they've been very quiet um and in the first two weeks had nothing I'm only in the past couple of days have we began to see Iranian official speak up the first was the head of the judiciary a hardliner who said there's no way this murder could have taken place without protection from the west\nThen on Wednesday the Iranian President Rouhani also repeated that charge that you know it was under us protection that this happened how when the ... century could we have such a terrible murder\nThey see their position strengthened as Saudi Arabia is weak and they are on different sides in a number of conflicts in Yemen in Syria and Lebanon\nAnd they have not been forceful until now but they are moving into a position of criticizing the Saudi leadership and when I think about the Trump Administration\nUh and Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia was the answer to their conflict with Iran and away right I mean the Saudis backed the president when he pulled out of the Obama era nuclear agreement with Iran um what does it mean for Washington's or on policy\nThat question has reportedly been part of the White House calculation as the whole story unfold here is why Saudi Arabia is critical to the Trump plan to squeeze Iranian oil imports\nIf you take a rainy an oil imports off the market and that is exactly what the Trump Administration wants to do you could drive up oil prices gas prices in the United states if you don't find a way to fill that gap\nThat's what Saudi will offer they are the only oil producer that has spare capacity and they have said that they will make up\nAny deficit in a rainy and crude and keep oil prices steady now so far\nUh Saudis energy minister has said this is exactly what they're going to do they're going to open those caps this all begins on November fifth\nAnd November fifth what's the significance of that date November fifth is when the U.S sanctions go into effect that is when it will become very difficult for the Iranians to sell any

suspicious packages had been intercepted so far packages contain would appear to be explosive devices and were sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump\nThe FBI is saying it can't rule out that there may be more suspicious packages moving through the mail now\nAnd this story is but the U.S postal service in the spotlight joining us to talk about that is NPR's Miles parks he's been looking into postal service policies look into the city among either we don't know anything yet about who delivered these packages what's known so far but how they were delivered\nRight so the FBI and the federal investigation arm for the postal service both declined to comment when I asked that exact question a earlier today but we can sort of piece it together based on what we know about where the packages were actually intercepted at this point we know that at least seven to ten packages were handled by the postal service\nOr the packages addressed for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for instance we're flag and mail screening facilities by the secret service and two of the packages addressed a Joe Biden were also founding postal facilities in Delaware\nObviously that's important because us yes has screening procedures specifically in place to try to catch incidents and dangerous items like this\nWhen it comes to mail entering the U.S postal system what are those screening\nProcedures so it's really different based on a number of different factors you know the size of the package for instance\nMaybe most importantly is who that package is going to\nIf you want to send mail to the White House or to Capitol Hill or another major federal building for instance uh it's automatically going to go to a separate offsite screening facilities check for suspicious looking items so these suspicious items that we are talking about\nA period of a sense using excessive stamps which is something experts say is one of the first kind of red flag items to look for during the screening process\nOr at the end of the day though the postal service does admit that they that because of the crazy volume that the that they deal with that can't screen every single item that enters the system so they have a system of best practices that they asked companies and even private citizens to use a when going through their own male\nAnd the reports are that these appear to be homemade pipe bombs it's not clear what kind of damage they could have cars can you give us some context like how um I guess random is this like how often are explosives mail\nYet it's maybe not as rare as one would expect they that the U.S postal service says it's about sixteen averages out to about sixteen bombs per year ah which which might seem like a lot\nBut if you consider in the context of more than a hundred and fifty billion pieces of mail get processed by the postal service every year I kind of puts it into perspective\nI specifically when it comes to investigations\nUm they open Nineteen investigations into a hazardous material that could be bombs that could be chemical weapons that were being um are trying to be delivered it could even be hoax a bombs are hoax chemical weapons\nAs well and they were able to gain a twenty convictions in those investigations but mostly when it comes to the investigations we are talking about a male staffed and mailing of narcotics or is a much higher percentage of what they're looking at\nOr they're going to be any policy changes as a result\nOr not at this point it it doesn't seem that way I'm obviously everyone involved in the postal service is going to be on much higher alert right now I talked with somebody at the American postal workers union\nWho made an interesting point basically saying that we've been focused a lot about on the government officials in the media members in the case of CNN who seem to have been targeted by these packages but there's also postal workers who were put in danger who were carrying packs point a to point B were also in danger in these situations\nOr if you remember back to two thousand one in the anthrax attacks there were two postal workers who died back then\nUm so there's no indication that any policies are going to be changed but we're definitely seeing people on higher alert\nThat's NPR's Miles Parks thanks so much thank you\nTo another story now about methamphetamine which is making a comeback addiction to the potent drug first became a crisis in many small towns in the early Nineteen nineties Smith use was leader eclipse by opioid addiction\nAs Frank Morris of

because you had everything that goes with the drugs like ... like a safety shelter\nAs I mentioned theft prostitution and currently an outbreak of hepatitis a here it's just a ... story in southeast Missouri and other parts of rural America Matthew stepped early this decade when lawmakers cut access to key ingredients but ... says it was about the same time that opioids took root here\nNow that they're hammering out on the opiates guess what's happening now the methods coming back in that meth is surging across the country usage\nMethamphetamine nationally is that an all time high\nEric Smith is assistant special agent in charge of the drug Enforcement Administration is Kansas City office\nIt is back with a vengeance and the reasons for that or to fall number one the product is now produce cheaper and number two it's produced at a much higher potency level\nIs because most myth no longer comes from small home labs Danny whiteley police chief in Poplar Bluff Missouri says cheap high quality imports have flooded the market\nNinety nine percent of the methamphetamine is coming in now is coming in as crystal meth or ice that's being made by the super labs in Mexico they like the stuff and fifty a gallon drums\nMissouri highway patrol sergeant mark the Clinton says Mexican drug cartels are getting that message to places and people didn't reach before\nI Would say that the meth problem has basically exploded across every race and social economic class that you can imagine that drug\nPosts isn't keeping pace and you can see that at one of the busiest storefronts in downtown poplar\nBluff [laughter]\nSoutheast Missouri behavioral health were uninsured meth users take a backseat to people using oh\nYeah absolutely harder to get treatment\nWorked for the rest of this clinic and he says public funding prioritizes treating opioid addiction\nMethods doing a lot of damage and individuals are turning to use math instead of other substances whereas they might have chose opioids in the past but people are dying from opioids not that\nVery quickly over social media so that's something that's very important for the subject to know because you know there's Facebook and most of the countries I work in and I talk about why I'm doing these stories you know I don't just walk in there like I have the right to take their picture I talk about\nYou know I think it's really important to see how women are suffering or how women are dying and childbirth and so\nThing I Do and a lot of women say no and that's totally the right to say now is the way you operate\nStandard among war photographers understanding there is no playbook that everybody\nGets this year but I'm curious you mail photographers take that much sensitivity in advance\nI've been told that it's rare that people work the way I work that they take the time to be very respectful and to ask people\nHow they feel comfortable being photographed you know\nI also have to discuss nudity for example I was shooting maternal mortality recently in Somaliland and that's a very deeply conservative country in place and they're\nThe women you know they said okay if you photograph for example the baby coming out and I don't want my face or you have to cover or you know and they give me the rules and that's what I Do you're making me think\nOf a photograph that you took of a woman named I act and who's was she was raped during\nWar and South Sudan Iraq by the time you met her she was very pregnant yeah as a result of that rape you spent several hours photographing her in a dress and then you thought you know if I'm trying to show her belly her pregnancy point here\nDo we do this without close um and you as you were photographing her showing her the images on your camera correct to make sure she understood what it looked like\nYeah and I also before I even approached her with sort of what I envisioned I went to Kimberley who was the woman who had sort of rescue her and given her the safe house and said you know does this seem insensitive how do you feel about this is this\nSomething that would be rude to ask and she said no absolutely not let's take this to her and see how she feels and so we went and sort of talk to her through it and before I even finished my son she had taken her dress off and it was like totally she completely understood\nAnd you know as a woman I haven't been raped but I I have been assaulted in Libya I was groped repeatedly and I made a decision to talk about that very openly because I think\nYou know as a survivor it's important to try and strip away the stigma and I think different women feel comfortable revealing different things about themselves and some people do and some people don't and that's one thing I've learned over the years\nAnd I think with Iraq it was something she wanted to do she wanted to show what had happened to her to sort of talk about it it was part of her therapy and I think it's very important for me as a photographer to not make those rules for people and everyone has the right to decide how they want to portray themselves you've\nTalked in past about what a huge advantage it as if anything to be female and a lot of the places where you're trying to work because as we're hearing you have access to half of the population that are male photographer might not have access to\nWhat I loved and that kind of surprised me in this book as you also get great shots of American women there's a there's a photo going here of a navy lieutenant in the nurse corps she's stationed in Helmand Province of ... okay so the shot describe or you've caught her in the ladies' room so\nAmy I mean this is after a very intense\nUh I was on a medivac in bed and um they would bring wounded soldiers out and Amy was a navy nurse and so she was you know they're in the trauma hospital\nAnd so after a an intense night I sort of followed her back to the showers where the women go and I you know I was like I Want to just shoot what your life is like here and\nShe was completely like fun and open and got it\nShe's she's I should explain she's got shaving cream while they're up are lagging shaving it made me I look at it and I'm thinking why would you bother to shave and helmet [laughter] after I can\nTell you why because as a woman who's worked in like a very male world and in a war zone for Twenty years I Do everything I can still try and feel like a woman you know whether that means like sneaking eye liner on in the middle of Helmand or lipstick or\nPerfume I always carry perfume and my camera bag H its psychological because I have to sort of maintain some semblance of myself\nYou're right they're shaving in the in the next shower stall [laughter] [laughter]\nYeah and that was the fun of photographing women in the military because it's like it was the first time that I actually had women to hang out with because for so many years it was just me or me and my colleague Elizabeth Rubin

I mean you know a person that is on the rise of people who are likely not going to find\nAnd and I can't lights and people now that running away from conflict and ... in that context of honey and\nSo you're saying that there is a mix of both economic migrants and people who are seeking asylum because they fear of persecution in their home countries or fear violence do you have people in the caravan who are making it clear to you that they wish to go to the United states\nOr not they may come as we have a seat on Romney's not belong to flat out they can't live in that that's not necessary in the u._s. but when the next you know\nThere has been a lot of concern in the U.S about the numbers of people who might be trying to apply to asylum in the U.S has un agency are received any pressure from the Trump Administration to process people they're\nNot going on now that are ... I think it's I think it can be very clear may have actually three offices in South and make secret whining and ... and I ain't going to see that night and you're not going to have said\nThat you have

starting now as we\nAsk them to see we have received in the end of September ... drinking fountain obligations\nUNH ER is identified kidnapping and other security risks is that something you're talking about that is a risk within the caravan or from outside of it\nI think I find a cat and we have nothing in Cyprus at these things are just along the path that they have on his thinking right now\nWe are advising people they used to be careful too lazy fired by group that they don't look I notice a my face I mean I Would have had it on\nFast and they can be either ... or Richard ...\nI'm

negative for high that they they've perfected leave everything behind an artist to survive\nMaria Rubio is a communications officer with the un refugee agency thank you for speaking with us\nFrom ... well President Trump has threatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid\nTo Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the u._s. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America shouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on foreign\nRelations and she knew you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more care of him which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nThis is actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to\nLeave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want\nThings to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars ... billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back to Central America\nUnited States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just this aid the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now trans national and nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages\nAre not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what\nWould you tell them that you know I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day":
