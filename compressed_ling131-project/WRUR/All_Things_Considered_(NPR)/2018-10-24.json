... death was announced on Saudi state TV\nThroughout that time the Trump administration's position on the killing of ... and Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nHas been evolving the president has condemned the killing that still has not condemned the Saudi crown prince\nOr said whether he believes NBS as he's referred she played a role\nWhen Republican senator who has been a vocal critic of the Saudi king in his policies and the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman himself is Indiana senator tot young he has called the crown prince impulsive and reckless and says the U.S should send the Saudi leader a message senator young welcome\nThanks for having me also so what is the message the U.S incentives Saudi Arabia right now\n[noise] um it's crystal clear Americans won't stand for this sort of behavior we've seen in recent weeks and I would say uh over the last couple of years of the behavior coming from\nThe Saudi Government and more specifically from the Saudi Arab parent a prince Mohammed is contrary to our values our international laws in our national security interests\nHasn't been a mistake for President Trump to put so much trust him in Solomon's pledge to reform its country then\nLook I think it's really important that we work with security partners in the middle east there aren't many options to choose from\nA but we do have leverage or as a country to use against the Saudis to bring them in a better behavior so that they're not repeatedly killing civilians through airstrikes using our weapons in our fuel is they've been doing for the last couple of years in Yemen so they're not murdering journalists are like\nIndiana State a graduate ah ... in Washington Post journalist so these are the sorts of things that we need to not only highlights but we need to begin holding\nThe government in Riyadh to account on on account of these actions\nAnd on holding Riyadh accountable some of your colleagues in Congress haven't calling for a regime change in Saudi Arabia for the crown prince to be replaced you agree that that would be a good step\nWill look we're still confirming certain details with respect to a this most recent tragedy in the interim I've been encouraged that the administration is revoking the visas of individuals' we already know had been involved\nIn this ... situation\nI'm but I'm not prepared to rule anything out uh I I think we should suspend all arms sales until we know more and we should most certainly should stop refueling Saudi coalition aircraft are engaged in the sort of atrocities I just referenced in the country of Yemen\nRight you mention that you would like to see Saudi arms the Saudi arms deal with the U.S get ripped up the President Trump has talked a lot recently about all the jobs that would be lost if this White House tore up that arms deal with Saudi Arabia do you share the president's concerns about jobs being lost [noise]\nLook I think that the number of jobs are the ... levy loss from this ah or frankly fairly minor and I I I don't see that as a major consideration I see this instead as a matter of upholding our values and um let's not forget our national security interests here\nThe country of Yemen has been destabilized by Saudi action\nThat country happens to be the headquarters of al ... in the Arabian Peninsula the most dangerous al ... affiliate out there so um it's essential\nWe've talked about what Congress could possibly do to address the situation in Saudi Arabia but what about the presidents do you believe that President Trump has been vocal enough calling out Saudi Arabia enough in the wake of democracy oh geez that\nWell I think uh the president's message or these gather more information it's of all he's in a good spot now in fact\nHe condemn the ... death as the worst cover up ever that's a pretty strong condemnation for a country that has historically been and will remain I think an important security partner of ours\nBut should President Trump had been so reticent to criticize Saudi Arabia at the beginning\nI think reticence when you're dealing with national security partners is probably a positive impulse but right now he's in a situation having together more facts are that we have just been experiencing the worst cover up ever and and so that's pretty strong language coming from the president United States\nDoes it concern you the close ties the Trump Administration has with members of the royal family in Saudi Arabia specifically Jared Kushner the president's son in law has cultivated a very close relationship with the crown prince\nAnd I'd been some on does that concern you\nYou know we have had strong relationships with Saudi government's for generations and uh that's uh something that has continued with this administration recognizing the Saudis have been in can continue to be very important security partners they provide us valuable intelligence\nBut I have to admit that relationship or gets undermined is the Saudis\nAre Deceive Us and as they engage in a violation of our fundamental values as strongly appear to have done or in this instance and the ...\nRepublican senator Todd Young of Indiana

homes have been slumping for four straight months how much has the market called commerce figures show that new home sales are down more than Thirteen percent compared to last fall\nBack then the housing market was hot home sales and home prices were both rising\nMillennials all those young adults who are the way our first house starting families during the recession years they were on the market I'm buying their first house they were driving a kind of a lot of demand\nParent or as us as a senior economist at Zillow just a year ago interest rates are averaging under four percent houses were selling quickly and home values were rocketing up but now it's a very different picture the housing market is weakening\nHimself have been falling prices are few appreciating but at a slower pace\nLawrence unit the chief economist for the national association of realtors he says this is not a mysterious situation the fed has been raising interest rates after a long stretch of low rates as a country recovered from the great recession\nThat means rates for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage or now closing in on five percent for the first time in years\nAnd that makes it more expensive to buy a house so you would expect to see a drop in sales and that's not the only reason sales could be slowing that sharp increase in home values it has consequences you and says and the booming housing

good news for you and you don't even need it telescope to see it he says no matter how crazy world me feel take heart in its molecular order\nThe good News I'm bringing new comes from the universe itself and you can find it in something as simple as a single grain of salt\nActually it's not a grain of table salt I Want you to focus on but the molecular structure making up that great\nSee every salt molecule is made up exactly one atom of the elements sodium and one atom of the element chlorine fat never changes and what might seem a little weird I'm here to tell you that we can take great comfort in that tiny atomic fact\nYour sea salt of your income laying solved\nIt might have some extra additives in there like iodine and there are other compounds that scientists like to call salt but no matter what the sodium chloride molecules in your salt shaker are always hooked together in exactly the same way that never changes\nAnd it's a constant see that means that every molecule salt as exactly the same properties as every other molecule salt in the entire universe through all of space and all of time off salt molecules look the same\nThey moved the same and most importantly they behave the same\nSee at the rock bottom basement level of the universe things are not a mess instead there's a kind of angel singing in the cloud sublime order that science reveal to us and every molecule of salt has a shape and a behavior that is intern perfectly specified\nThey are like beautiful cosmic lego blocks clicking together in the most perfect way and this never ever change is the fact that all Adams everywhere across the universe display this perfect unchanging lego blocks quarter\nIs why the reliability of chemistry as possible it's one nature can start with tiny items and use them to build all the other things that make up the wonder of life around us\nYou know stuff like mountains in oceans slime molds and sequoia trees spiders and cocker spaniel dolphins and

X. X. I.\nMobile app from NPR News this is all things considered I Know that Chang Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman made his first public comments today on the killing of journalists Jamal ...\nHas a has a limited to the gym yesterday\nSpeaking at a conference in Riyadh the crown prince said it was painful to all Saudi citizens he called the killing a heinous crime the killing prompted many western CEOs to canceled their plans to attend this high profile gathering U.S Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin canceled his appearance by\nMany us business executives did show up\nAnd to find out more about what had happened at this conference we reached New York times reporter Alan Rapaport he's in Riyadh welcome thanks for having me some first talking about what this conferences for the Saudis want global companies to invest their money in the king and that's the basic objecting right\nExactly it's called the future investment initiative and it's the second year that they've done it has become known sort of colloquially as the ... in the desert a conference and drawing about three thousand people wow this week\nOr wow world and in part of the deal is Saudis want to diversify their economy so they're not as reliant on oil I imagine\nExactly so there's lots of panels going on at the conference where they talk about capital markets investing technology and you know effort to make Saudi Arabia hub for these kinds of industries come here and set up shop\nNow does your of course the killing of democracy energy cast a shadow over the conference but today the crown prince directly confronted the issue in his comments what what'd you make of his remarks today\nIt was quite interesting everybody was kind of wondering first of all whether or not he was speaker nodded name he did whether or not he would address the situation and ah he did address it head on a he did not take any responsibility personally for it\nWhich was interesting but he called it a heinous act and he promised springs I ever did it to justice so I think that was his attempt to try and I lay concerns a among people from all around the world who think this is sort of part of the Saudi culture to violate human rights in this way\nAnd how was the audience reacting as the crown prince was speaking today\nIt was a very positive you know I'm sort of a bully in the audience in favor of the crown prince you got a standing ovation um after he uh discuss the situation as well as when he was talking about the Saudi economy and how you know he wanted to lead the charge to make it an economic powerhouse in the middle east\nYou mentioned that it was a very supportive audience I I Want to talk about what American companies did show up they who did you see there\nThere was a broad range of executives from all different kinds of companies the big names from like ... and Goldman Sachs we're not there are some of the bank and lower level executives but\nI think some people were definitely shy about being there they were in many cases can sealing the names that are ... by their ties are keeping their jackets buttoned up which you might not you in Saudi Arabia were pretty hot\nWhere people willing to talk about why they did show up what they hope to get out of the conference\nYeah somewhere I mean there was definitely a sense of people that I spoke to\nBut you know this is an important business opportunity important investing opportunity and I didn't want us our relations with the Saudis I think some people felt that you know their attendance if they didn't show up wouldn't necessarily be notice or make a statement so they felt like they were going to go\nAnd see what happened anyway and there were others who felt that you know it's unclear at this point exactly what did happen and you know until investigation as conclusive they were going to give the Saudis the benefit of the doubt\nHave you heard anything yet at this conference that makes you think ... that will determine new American investment in Saudi Arabia or hurt existing ties with the kingdom\nI think so I mean I think it will depend somewhat what additional evidence comes out going forward but you know people said that the big banks and biggest brands and business are going to be reluctant to jump back in right away because of the central damage the brand\nAs well companies in Silicon valley which are very focused on ethical investing the defense companies were less reluctant than the big bang to step away from the conference\nI think they just seem less concerned about the backlash against their friends and such a important market for them to be involved in I think it was an economic interest for the subway\nThat's Allan Ropper port of the New York times thank you so much for joining us today thank you for having me\nAnd here in Washington the Senate Judiciary committee considered for more of President Trump's judicial nominees today but two senators attended the
