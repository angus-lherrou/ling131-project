time to agree on terms for Brexit but it keep person is missing from tonight talks British prime minister Theresa May earlier today may briefed her fellow European leaders on progress that negotiators made so far\nAnd then the other twenty seven leaders met over dinner without Mrs Maine to decide what to do next and pure psoriasis already Nelson is in Brussels watching the ... and goings at this summit hey Shariah\nHi Mary Louise\nLet me come straight to the basic question which is whether or not they're going to reach a deal before the u._k. scheduled to depart the you this coming march where does that stand well\nThat's the question that nobody seems to be able to answer tonight uh everyone's trying to put on a optimistic face chance or ... tonight said there Ninety percent of the way they're\nMerkel of Germany going wrecked um and ah but the problem is that there is a key sticking\nPoint about where to basically put the border between the u._k. and the e you have to have a hard border with customs and passport control and that's what I think the border that they are that they don't want is between Northern Ireland and uh Ireland Ireland being part of the EU in Northern Ireland being part of the u._k.\nAnd so they can't agree though exactly where to put it elsewhere who would have run that border that sort of thing and that's what's holding everything up\nAnd it's really frustrating because everybody felt that this week was the week they had to come to a deal in order to get enacted before brags that happens on march twenty ninth of next year slow that prime minister Peter ... captured the dire or our mood as it were the best\nThing is usually an optimistic person but not today\nMy hope was that the day we will have already some for free the solution on the table but it looks like it will not be a deal today\nBut he and other leaders are saying that they're keeping an open mind\nWhat about Theresa May the British prime minister she's still sounding optimistic\n[noise] well I Would say she's the cheerleader today I mean she says that the case position is still on the table she feels that they're getting close a but she wouldn't say whether she's presenting any new proposals which the e council president Donald Tusk and other leaders want\nThat seems to be with you very hard in order to ensure that was the address these issues of what we've seen is that we've sold most of the issues in withdrawal agreement I Believe it feels she's uh she's not at the time to make you know\nShe also wouldn't say or what she thought about extending the transition period the u._k. would have to leave the EU which is something that some leaders including the Irish prime minister we're talking about\nElaborate on that I mean what would that mean to extend the transition period after Britain leaves the you\nWell right now the agreement is more or less that ah when the u._k. leads on twenty ninth of march next year that basically until the thirty first of December the following year in other words twenty twenty\nOr economic and trade deals between the you can eat would remain unchanged and now they're talking about extending yet another full year in order to increase the chance of negotiating a full treaty\nAnd meanwhile hanging over all this is just the specter of Britain might leave the EU without a deal might just crush out\nYeah and that's something that everyone is is quite worried about it besides the fact you have snarled borders in price hikes for goods uh it it will be a problem for a lot of the countries including Germany for example were analysts say that the costs could exceed a hundred and Fifteen billion dollars if there is a hard to break that as it were\nA hundred and Fifteen billion while and fierce arrests are hard enough and reporting from Brussels ... You're welcome Mary Louise\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for the British and European economies have for the U.S George Parker has written about this he's a political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following those negotiations welcome back to the program ... if there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty ninth when the u._k. leaves you\nWill that could be quite severe depends of ... kind of no deal we actually ended up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal with\nEverybody ended up throwing places each other in person left you in very but don't you and indeed than you could see some very serious impact to the border so you would have\nA ... you'd have to check some old goods coming in and also you can say we're supposed to talk of the moment that with ... two shoes cues the pools coming into person I'm very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out of ... trees were closed down\nOn the bank of England is full costs this could be actually a very chaotic and damaging upside for the British Academy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning going on you in case this happens to curb stockpiling of medicines there's the fresh food road could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that\nHaving some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool that will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big his\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines once you introduce border checks the place where there are ... for the moment you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so\nSo there are concerns that they will be shortages certainly in more distant posts from the pool so\nPretty serious such as being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate says what would happen in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock of cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red tape up the borders and that without to business costs\nIt would make it ... percent or less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market the potential for terrorists as well\nSo the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit ... sort of an aircraft\nCrunchy losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but over time person will be a poor place in otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe they the u._k. leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because a person as a major destination for European exposed so they were the U.S affects on all manner of European produces whether some and they won produces in France cop she says in Germany\nOr you name it they ... they will be affected because UK off to breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries\nBut the point is is a symmetric shock waltz it's true that the other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or is this sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\nI think it's more of a lot to be honest I I mean we all quite the way yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nGone from living in the darkness truly canals saying this is a real thing and if it's not

a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters who had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint had smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use are around you found in the midst of all and the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis we reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on who you listen to that whole\nConference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis and Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the mentored based upon that\nSo just to parse this out there would be an issue about whether they have used\nMarijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burn somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister true though he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he had used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nThis is double the ...

showers at five thirty five it's all things considered\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I'm Mary Louise Kelly last name the two U.S Senate candidates from Texas debated in San Antonio\nThree weeks before election day there was an important opportunity for democratic congressman Beto O'Rourke an incumbent Republican Ted Cruz to make their cases to voters that debate like the race was downright nasty as NPR's Wade Goodwyn reports\nSenator Ted Cruz is reelection campaign has not been shy about attacking his opponent congressman Beto O'Rourke on TV\nI'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message met who more ... more extreme than the ones you didn't know in\nWhat attack ad which eventually seemed to backfire Cruz's campaign misleading edited video tape to make it appear as if all work said he supported flag burning which he did not say\nFederal organizations are too extreme for them to do list for Jackson\nUntil now Beto O'Rourke has declined to participate in negative campaigning but with the polls showing cruise with anywhere from six to nine point lead the congressman relented and has gone on the attack\nRepublicans and Democrats alike know that we've got to lead on immigration reform and yet Ted Cruz is the only senator to vote against moving forward with that conversation vowing to deport every single dream\nLast night or their debate in San Antonio this trend continues cruise painting O'Rourke is a dangerous extremist\nIf you work in energy if you work in oil and gas Congress metal rock record on this is extreme he didn't just vote for a ten dollar a barrel tax on oil he's also voted for aggressive regulations of fracking\nBut unlike their first debate last night O'Rourke hit back\nThis is what you can expect over the course of this debate a center cruise not going to be honest with you is going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or ever taken is dishonest why the president called ... and it's why the nickname stuff because it's true\nAlthough cruise would force a laugh when a war attacked him his face revealed is true emotions and the senator didn't like it but the debate in San Antonio was more than just battle it was substantive to\nCruise has the numbers on his side there are hundreds of thousands more Republican voters in Texas the Democrats\nAs a result Cruz spoke mostly to his base\nThe state of Texas is booming we got right now the lowest unemployment in forty nine years Texas is seeing the benefits of low taxes in low regulations and congressman O'Rourke position is always always always in favor of higher taxes\nIf cruise generally played to Republican fears of what would happen if Democrats gained any power or work tended to speak to voters\nThe ... weather will remain the inspiration of the world is an open question right now the partisanship the pettiness the dishonesty that defined so much of a national conversation we're in desperate need right now of inspiration\nAlthough workers running way ahead of other Texas state wide Democrats close still just you know cigar\nI think that are very good democratic candidate running against a flawed Republican candidate has a chance to break through that's why ... came up so strong on cruise\n... a professor of political science at Southern Methodist university\nCruising is an acquired taste people respect him as a conservative fighter they don't necessarily like him\nThey gave Rourke oh look but Democrats have to recognize that competitiveness is a decade or two decades out it's not two years if not for years it's longer than that because demographic change is very slow\nBedroom ... roll up here and an hour long CNN town hall of Arab tomorrow evening and my talent on the Texas border Ted Cruz declined to participate ... through the voters' questions himself Wade Goodwyn NPR News\nHarvard is defending its admissions policy in uh Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she's a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nGreat thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see admissions policies change not to have racing it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering one at assesses the students qualifications yeah I think\nSo because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that a decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but what seemed for fair admissions has been showing in the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents Missouri's missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of get this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal reading to artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher and everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think of that argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\nI'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context\nThe kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo I think\nThat a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at night and the context of race but again like I said married in the context as economic status or something that speaks more to someone's opportunities or resources is really important and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Rochester", "day":
