that's what they're doing and frankly it saves a lot of money by doing that it is certainly are having a separate election would be very costly\nRaces as a process is simple with two columns on the

line at W. excerpts our news though to work\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I know the Chang mid term elections are less than one week away and we're going to take a look at the money that has been pouring into these races billions of dollars have been spent on advertising and most of that money is going to democratic candidates\nThe center for Responsive Politics a nonprofit that tracks campaign money projects that a total of five point two billion dollars will be spent during the entire election cycle\nThe group's executive director Sheila Krumholz joins us now to talk about how all of that money is being spent welcome thank you glad to be here okay so fine point two billion how some compare\nTo previous mid term elections spending\nThis is way up from the two thousand fourteen mid term elections so five point to this cycle versus just three point eight billion in two thousand fourteen that's at thirty five percent jump and a record\nAnd how is this money getting spent TV radio Internet social media like where would you see most of the money going right now\nTV is still tops in the most competitive races and overall kind of pulling back we see that\nA almost a billion dollars has been sent already this cycle on media\nWay uh uh from two thousand fourteen at this point in the cycle so a media uh advertising on TV for the competitive races\nI digital advertising across the board for all races yeah especially on Facebook yeah here it's through the roof this year Facebook spending a yes why is that you think well it was certainly successful in the two thousand sixteen uh election cycle for a lot of actors\nAre so far I think as of today face because now to two hundred Ninety six million dollars and uh as in terms of FCC report it digital ad spending a it's one hundred and five million a with a almost ten million of that going to the presidential race so that that race has already taken off\nAnd as we said the vast bulk of the spending is coming out of democratic candidates and you know I'm curious when you see one side vastly outspending the other side is that a sign that that side has a good shot at winning or is it more than a sign of some insecurities and lack of confidence I think\nBoth come into play on the one hand the Democrats are thrilled to see big numbers are in their call on this cycle and that is an asset they these candidates need money to get their message out\nOn both sides so uh that's a positive sign for the Democrats on the other hand to the degree that this money is coming from voters\nIn other states\nThat is not so helpful and election day so there is a lot can backfire\nAnd it can be viewed as outside meddling ah by voters in other states that have nothing to do at the interests of the district or the state they represent the people who may be energized about a candidate that are unable to help them on election day when it really counts\nSo that's one way a lot of money can backfire are there other ways for instance could spending a lot of money on ads actually annoy voters because I talked to a lot of voters who hate getting bombarded by ads could that ... de Presse voter turnout\nCertainly some of the advertising is designed to suppress voter turnout they are in opposition to a candidate as opposed to a supporting a candidate so those are going to be a especially\nTiresome for the voters some more money does not necessarily mean more votes\nMore money does not necessarily mean more votes on election day the candidates who has spent the most typically wins however will see this ... this year whether ah the Democratic a fundraising advantage\nWill help to drive down the reelection rate which has been impervious to change especially in the house races Sheila Krumholz\nIs the executive director of the center for Responsive Politics thanks very much my pleasure thank you\nThe U.S has had three alarming incidents in a matter of days the

Ari Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports\nOne problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means for the United states\nWe are the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is this the president so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut the sizzling economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China in the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten use six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim an economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen they fall if it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they selling it and buying dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nWhen's the primary season when she dethrone to ten term democratic incumbent in Massachusetts Boston\nCity councilwoman Ayanna Pressley had spent more than a decade working in politics as an aide to lawmakers like Senator John Kerry before she decided she should be the candidate\nI've certainly been a toiling invented a democratic politics working hard to elect Democrats in the commonwealth and throughout our country and so for people to tell me that I should wait my turn my mother did not raise me to ask permission to lead and so I raised my hand\nI spoke to her about some of the obstacles she face when she decided to run for Congress\nWhat did trouble me and hurt me was that I was drawn to it by the charges of identity politics throughout my campaign\nAnd it was just sort of um an assumption that my message was not appealing to or that my work had not been to the benefit of a broad and diverse coalition of many people\nAnd that was hurtful because that is a a play out of the GOP handbook\nNot a charge that would have expected to be lobbied against me by Democrats and certainly not people that consider themselves to be progressive\nI Want to jump in here because um there are democratic groups that did not necessarily indoors share campaign right um the Congressional Black caucus a pack also emily's list um you had people like Deval Patrick a former governor you had John Lewis\nOf Georgia the civil rights legend who all came down for your opponent my capital on oh\nWhat kind of message does that send to you\nWell first and foremost I'm no Neal fight to this and I knew what I was getting into there's usually a de fall to incumbency\nI did not expect that I Would have the support of the establishment locally or nationally I knew this would be lonely I knew it would be up hill I knew that it would be bruising\nYou mentioned the idea of having to go up against incumbents right and the Democratic establishment what are some of the obstacles that people who are newer to politics are going to face especially as black women are there other kinds of aspects to running that they ... they may be locked out of either by tradition or through other factors\nWell listen I was told everything from I shouldn't be wearing my hair in twists

disadvantage and that's the thing you felt like you had to turn into an advantage in some way\nAbsolutely people said because I don't have a degree that I have no business running for office\nI left school not because I didn't know the value of an education\nBut because my mother got sick and she lost her job and I was her caregiver in battling that pre existing condition of leukemia\nWhich ultimately took her life that is a story that millions of Americans can relate to and we need more people that are governing from a place of lived experience\nBecause these are the experiences of millions\nAnd the reason why so many policies don't work for people\nEither because people are not at the center of those policies\n[noise] you know right now we're looking at Stacey Abrams in Georgia
