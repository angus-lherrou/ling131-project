all three of the suspects now in custody are men born here in the U.S NPR's Greg Myre he joins us now to talk about the common threads between these incidents I Greg hey are we hear so much about international terrorism and efforts to stop people from other countries these incidents are all homegrown how common is that\nA absolutely you know nine eleven really concentrated the mind on radical Islam from abroad but the numbers since then tell a very different story deadly attacks by the far right white supremacist\nOutnumber those by Muslim extremist by a ratio of three to one about Seventy attacks versus twenty three\nThe death toll in the past Seventeen years about the same about a hundred and twenty five on on on both sides here the far right tends to target a small minorities in smaller numbers than him indiscriminate attacks the nominee of the radical Muslims have carried out\nAnd when you look at the three people who are accused of these attacks in the last week they all look similar to each other a men born in the u._s. should we read something into that as if the new face of extremism\nA it's sort of been the face of extremism these are American men acting on their own and they account form a solid majority of extremist attacks\nReally started picking up about a decade ago or the man accused in Pittsburgh made anti Semitic remarks on social media the Louisville suspect had a reputation for racist comments in the mail bomb suspect in Florida\nAre always told worker co workers that he admired Hitler and thoughts of gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated

necessary condition\nGreg we've seen so much in the way of government efforts to fight Islamic extremism is they're the same effort to stop this kind of domestic far right extremism\nProbably not the same level or Christopher Wray the FBI Director was before Congress or just a couple of weeks ago he he said Islamic extremism and he still sees that as the greatest threat\nBut then he noted very quickly there are a thousand active investigations inside the U.S and he said this covers everything from right to left and everything in between he didn't break it down further than that but he specifically said this was not Islamic extremists he was talking about here I'm\nIn the challenge of course is how do you find people there are is the social media trail but there are so many American men expressing the thoughts these days it's hard to tell of who will act in who's just ranting\nWe're going to hear more in a moment about one social media site that's become a platform for these rants but first the FBI is describing the scope of the problem what is it and the Trump Administration more broadly doing about it\nThe Trump Administration hasn't shown a lot of interests the Obama administration created a program countering violent extremism given grants to local groups to prevent radicalization the Trump Administration has cut that way back then hasn't really focused on far right threats despite the growing numbers of attacks\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre Thanks Greg thanks sorry\nBefore Robert Bowers walked into the tree of life synagogue in

the latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia at\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate and a legit scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either our first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\n... a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week and it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the special special counsel's office was you know is usually very tight lipped but I did decide to speak about this\nUh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purported plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that would date back to time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Muller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with an empty provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual working at\nThe OK so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting timing here\nThe timing is indeed curious yeah the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nAnd this is all the ... and good afternoon sunny skies fifty three in Rochester fifty three and ... and\nAuthorities say the ex girlfriend of a ...

I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I melted Chang Saturday's shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh has focused attention on the rise in anti Semitic attacks an anti Semitic rhetoric\nAnd to talk more about anti Semitism and white nationalism we reached out to a lotta Kaufman she works on racial justice issues in the Jewish community welcome thank you it's great to be here\nAnd we'll start with a very basic question but it's a question that still confound me why did you use such a focus for white nationalist [noise]\nYou know for white nationalist theirs is deep deep commitment to maintaining political historical um an institutional supremacy in the United states I'm an around the world in terms of you know global white nationalism there's a perspective that a certain kind of lightness is superior and\nA real intention to maintain that kind of superiority both on on the inter personal level in terms of attitudes or behaviors and beliefs and how to transfer between people\nBut also on ... on a national level through our politics um through the way that we talk about and document our history authored a way that we manage our institutions and it's um an effort to maintain power\nAnd to keep people who are different um marginalized 'em and separated in in our communities\nYou mentioned in a certain kind of white ... in much of the American Jewish community is of European descent and identify as being white but you're kind of thing that makes no difference to white nationalist why do you think that uh\nEighty to Ninety percent of Jewish Americans are are white or come from a white background to white nationalist you know are Jewish community here in the United states largely comes from immigrant backgrounds already comes from backgrounds have strong ethnic identity when we came to this country\nAnd ah we were among the whole group of people from different countries who were other because of our our our national origin and just certain kinds of white and it's we're elevated and celebrate in this country as far as our history goes back\nWe should mention that you are Jewish but you're also black that for white nationalist hatred of Jews different from racism against blacks Latinos and other minorities that they see a threats\nPeople of color are visibly different and because of that we've been an easy group to target and we've been an easy group to keep separate\nFrom those who have more skinned privilege because their skin presents later whiter and then in contrast we think about the hatred and Jews and if we assume that most user white in this country then we have to find another way\nTo separate Jews out and so this this particular brand of white nationalism in the United states as a particular kind of Christian white nationalism is designed to take away from this idea that we are stronger because\nThe bird diversity and to scare people into thinking we are stronger because of our individual identities\nSuit you see something new about the anti Semitism we see in the U.S today I'm anti Semitism has persisted for centuries but there is something\nDifferent about it now what's different about this time is that we have people in power who are using their institutional position that had traditionally been designed to bring us together as a country to separate us of the country through anti Semitic and you think that's new\nI think when we have our policymakers amplifying ideas as a real amplifying stereotypes has stopped\nAnd using fear\nTo marginalize Jewish people in a way to elevate the fear mongers it is different and the other thing that's different is the empowerment of the anti Semite to express their anti Semitism in ways that are terrified said what new strategies can we or the Jewish community in particular employees\nTo combat the new forms of anti Semitism\n... I think the thing that we need to remember\nIs that white nationalism and designed to marginalize all of us and so this is the most important strategy we can develop\nIs to come together to develop friendships and trust and relationships\nSo that when we need each other as neighbors and friends and when the white supremacist come knocking on our doors or when they come marching down our streets that we know each one of us is going to come out of our houses and support the other\nThat we will not question who needs who needs this kind of advocacy but it becomes part of our culture as a as a as a as a as a nation and out of the people\nThat is our most important right now\n... is director of the use of color field the building and you should have thank you very much for joining us today Thanks so much for its imitation with my privilege\nThe notorious Boston gangster James Whitey Bolger is dead at the age of eighty nine he was killed in a federal prison in West Virginia\nBolger rose to power the Nineteen seventies while also serving as an FBI informant he spent years on the run eventually he was caught arrested and convicted of eleven murders\nWB or a special correspondent David do area is covered Bolger for decades and joins us now by David Hi Ari the FBI and us attorney's office in West Virginia said they're going to investigate Bulger's death what can you tell us about what happened to him\nWhat we what we know are is that he was transferred to the hazel in federal prison in West Virginia last night he was placed in the general population but he didn't make it to roll call this morning and wouldn't authorities investigated they found\nBolger it bent over a having been killed he suffered by the way nine of heart attacks while in federal prison in Florida just before coming up here he was in a wheelchair and he had a bottle of emergency heart attack medicine around his neck but he was killed\nHe has been a character in the public eye for decades remind people of his back story\nWow well you know you have to think of him is at the beginning in the middle in the end of six decades of awe inspiring evil in violence and corruption during what was called by the war on organized crime and he served as\nA top secret FBI informant which meant that by helping put his rivals behind bars Bolger became the most feared mobster in New England and he did something else he corrupted the agents and cops\nSo that he turned the Federal Bureau of investigation into would've centrally was the Bolger bureau of investigation and they tipped him off to wouldn't be informants\nSo that he could turn kill them as lieutenant Kevin waste once told me Bolger could look out the window from the south Boston home point to the city and say I own this\nTown such a complicated in deep relationship with the FBI which was supposed to be cracking down on people like him tell us more about how that dynamic worked\nWell you know they buy buy tipping him off by taking is money by becoming beholden damn\nAs they should have been a big old or the FBI they enabled empowered in older than him even giving them the names of these would be witness\nAnd the Justice Department he claimed to deal with them but but they certainly were protecting him to the fact that when he won on the lam in in California was out there for sixteen years people refuse to believe that the FBI was really looking for his FBI handler John Connelly", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "30"}
