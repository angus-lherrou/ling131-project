considered I Know for Chang\nAnd I'm Ari Shapiro now we're going to hear from a friend and former classmate of judge Brett Kavanaugh who wrote a letter in support of the Supreme Court nominee in August\nAnd now says he has changed his mind mark ... within the law school class of Nineteen Ninety along with Kavanaugh and he joins us now welcome to the program they keep her having me when you think back to the late eighties when you when Kavanaugh were in law school together what stands out to you\nWell it was intense experience as a small class of about a hundred and sixty people at that time at Yale Law we knew each other pretty well and uh the classroom experience and the social experience where both among the most intense of my life\nWhat was Kevin like back in law school when you were students together\nOne way or in law school a rat was like most people he was young energetic smart somebody that was interesting to talk to and hang around with a I never and this is important to say I never saw any of the behavior or anything like what's been alleged and I never heard stories about that\nYou're a Democrat what factored into your decision to sign a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee along with twenty two other classmates endorsing Kevin ... over the summer\nI Am a Democrat however my side lost an election and I'm certainly aware that Brett Kavanaugh does not agree with me on a number of legal and political issues but having lost an election the other side was not going to nominate somebody that I Would have chosen in that way\nAnd so you have to look at qualifications you have to look at experience and so I knew from my own experience with Brett that he was somebody that I liked but I called some people who practice in front of the court that a court of appeals for the district of Columbia and they explained that he was a fair judge somebody who hire good clerks in real good opinions\nAnd so in part based on that I signed the letter\nAnd then what was it about last Thursday's hearing that prompted you to send a second letter just yesterday to the Senate Judiciary committee withdrawing or support I think\nIt really has to do not so much with the allegations of Dr for given that we're still waiting for the FBI to report on that it has to do with the exchange he had with the senators which is a co equal branch of government\nAnd having civil discourse with the quote unquote branches of government is something that we have to expect from the Supreme Court\nIn particular it was the exchange with my own senator Amy ... car wreck Kevin uh started by recognizing his or that he liked her that he had my work but then when she has to hard question he responded by throwing the question back at her\nThis was a question about his drinking\nThat's correct and he done that before with Senator Whitehouse or perhaps one other senator in ... there was something about that that was like a gut punch you know it was it was it was really disappointing no he did come back and apologize for that at least in the center of hope which are\nBut that's something that is very hard to get over why do you consider that disqualifying like I said because there are a expectations of the Supreme Court that they have to treat with respect to co equal branch of government they can't as we often hear irrigate the power to themselves\nAnd if he's going in with that kind of contempt ... branch it's deeply troubling\nI Know that you've been in touch with other classmates do you feel that your representative or more of an outlier\nI'm an outlier in two ways I mean I was outlier for signing the letter in the first place if it was only twenty three out of the hundred and sixty some members of the class who signed it in the first place so that made me an outlier in certainly an outlier or with my Proctor and withdrawing from the letter [noise]\nUm so it's it's really only the two of us are among said oh group who who did those things\nDo you still consider him a friend\n[noise] yes I I I Hope that we can have a friendship I'm I suspect he might be screened in my calls right now but uh I Hope not\nMark all sorts of Yale Law school classmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh thank you very much thank you and professor also now teaches law at the University of St Thomas and St Paul Minnesota\nThe federal government was so I'm prepared to carry out the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families earlier this year that it wasn't even ready to has the children and where did it even had a plan to reunite them with their parents\nThat is from a scathing report from the homeland security department internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the d._a. chess inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel hey I'll say it you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families like why isn't new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary here's to Nielsen\nIt is important that these miners\nVery well taken care I don't believe that perhaps they are very well taken care\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that the H. S. held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages in border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and it's just an after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child and our care for any parent\nHa chess by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time the age I said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general fine that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\n... ... then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nTom Harwood was president of the union then he said Chinese students complained about the topic and pressed him to drop one of the speakers Anastasia when a former miss world Canada ... also a human rights activist and a member of a spiritual meditation group banned by the Chinese government again Tom ... actually\nIt goes to the point where the embassy signed up our office and started questioning us all about the debate often if we could ... an even go to the point\nWell one of the officials at the embassy suggested that if this debate went ahead the u._k. might get less favorable traits comes off to brag says Harwood was done it's just quite shocking that within an institution that was a hundred and Seventy five years old that prides itself on hosting free speech for exchange for you to base\nThat an outside influences trying to change that will try

image measures that China scholar at Oxford University\nOne of the context for the obsessive way in which Chinese officials can sometimes think about the way that China is portrayed as the ... is the fact that for the best part of a hundred and fifty years China was of course not in control of its and destiny\nIt was a period when foreign powers carved up China which the government calls the century of humiliation the government's recent economic boom changed all that\nThese days China was much better position to actually spread that narrative talk about itself in those terms\nWith we might say much allowed to make a ... and that is creating some cognitive dissonance I thing for some parts of the American establishment which maybe for a long time so that democracy was not the only way that China could guys but the only way that any country could possibly go\nNow Chinese President Xi Jinping is gone further than past leaders arguing the China's authoritarian system is a model for others and alternative to liberal democracy ... with the Mercator Institute for China's studies the Berlin based think tank\n... they would do is just point fingers and say well look at where democracy has gotten you look rational decisions you got Trump and the White House ... we just ... out of\nWind field says the goal is to undermine support for the western system\nWhen young people

considered I'm all for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro survivors of sexual assault are sharing their stories many for the first\nTime Washington Post columnist Monica ... has been getting a steady stream of them in her inbox and her latest column has the headline deer dads your daughters told me about their assaults this is why they never told you many people have been sharing the column on line and I spoke with Monica has to be about it earlier today\nI like a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of survivors wanting to share their stories of sexual assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I've never told as my dad I don't think he could handle this\nAnd what did they tell you about the reasons they never told\nTheir father some women said\nI'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail\nSome women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him this would make him cry the someone in did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect any and he would feel like he failed\nIt is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well\n[noise] I did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of women said I told my mother and learns that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world\nAs a young woman and so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of taboos ... exist because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lady pain explain what you mean by that\n[noise] you know it just just think about tropes in sitcoms where\nSaid dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery story that he can ever make\nWe do that with ... we do that with breast feeding all of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on his spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on this spectrum\nAt five thirty three it's partly cloudy sixty two in downtown Rochester sixty one right now and run quite good afternoon I'm Scott five Bush ... news\nUsed to run to

was in Washington working with Republican Arlen Specter\nDid we agree on everything no maybe I Want to go a little more here you want to go a little bit more there but that's the art of compromise and

mid seventies tomorrow\nAnd NPR News this is all things considered I Know for\nChang and I'm Ari Shapiro Donald Trump has described himself for decades as a self made billionaire claiming that he built his fortune using a one time loan from his father\nMy father gave me a small amount of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay him back and I had to pay him back with interest\nThat identity as a self made success was central to Trump's presidential campaign now a major investigation by the New York times demonstrates the ways in which that story is false the reporter show that Donald Trump received hundreds of millions of dollars from his father over the years starting as a toddler\nAnd the story reveal schemes that Trump family used to avoid gift and estate taxes schemes that stretch and possibly break tax laws rushed Buettner is one of the reporters who wrote the story welcome to all things considered Thanks Ari how did Donald Trump requires so much wealth from his father over the decades\nIt's a complex story we found two hundred and Ninety five unique streams of revenue that Fred Trump's set up over the years to funnel money to his children especially to Donald Trump who was always sort of his favorite child\nI Want to get into a couple of those streams in detail but first us to talk about where the story comes from you write that you had more than a hundred thousand pages of documents as well as interviews what kinds of documents are we talking about here\nBy the time we were all done we had more than two hundred tax returns that related both to Fred Trump personally and to his various business entities we had general ledgers bank account statements property records and some court records that were helpful to time the pieces together\nOkay sort of dig a little bit more deeply into this reporting you've got about ten blockbuster stories and this one sprawling article and I'd like you to tell me about one of them\nYou write about a company the Trump family created called all county building supply and maintenance and in theory this was a company to purchase and installed refrigerators and other appliances and properties that Fred Trump owned\nIn practice it allowed for Trump to transfer huge amounts of money tax free to his kids how did this work all county looks like a company you\nKnow when you hear the name but it actually had no existence in the world other than on paper Fred Trump had always negotiated personally the prices for the things he bought boilers roofs\nBut in Nineteen Ninety to ... bills for those items began being in voice from a company called all county building supply\nAll county within voice it get the money and then they would create another envoys to Fred Trump's businesses with a twenty percent thirty percent like pat added on to that or a hundred percent in some cases you say and some ... in some cases there were some cases right where they're getting things for free and then building\nFred Trump's businesses whenever the cat was would just be split between Fred Trump's force\nHaving children who are the owners of our identity that's right and they were performing no work for that the only work was done by an employee Fred Trump's who is also a nephew of his ... employees secretary who handled these buildings things are among her other tasks\nFor Trump to gifts to all of his children but Donald you write more than any of the others you describe him bailing out Donald Trump time after time there's an instance where he bought three and a half million dollars in poker chips to rescue in Atlantic City casino\nBut there was one time the father pushed back against is on Donald Trump was beginning to suffer from dementia Donald Trump tried to change his father's\nWell what happened that was right in Nineteen Ninety at Donald Trump's darkest financial moment he was facing being forced into bankruptcy by who's creditors\nAnd he had some lawyers right up a ... a change to his father's will that would give him much more control over all those assets\nHe didn't tell his father or his siblings who was doing this you just had the lawyers show up at his father's house I believe it was in the piece of paper in front of him\nHis father or somebody in the room realized right away this is not where we want to go with this and he pushed back and ultimately called Donald Trump sister who was then a federal judge in a lawyer obviously and ask her to intervene and to make sure that\nDonald's creditors couldn't come in and pillage Fred Trump's empire and the Donald we wouldn't have any more control or employed over the state than any of his other siblings would\nThe White House has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that well\nWe think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about another transaction Trump Palace\nAnd then the cases where there were audits there's evidence that the trumps didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser grossly undervalued some of the properties\nRuss ... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today\nThanks for having me or the New York times story you just heard and that says that Trump's were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it\nAs NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do so\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax bonding as usual is one thing to have kind of self serving valuations that are on the global side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years that doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades and simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively\nAnd years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been now with\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns has now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nAnd the fact is that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of revenue also to the extent the IRS has resources that are not going to be allocating it toward gift tax enforcement\nThe same is true with the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nTheir peers to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a transaction involving the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years ProPublica has reported that President Trump's sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less
