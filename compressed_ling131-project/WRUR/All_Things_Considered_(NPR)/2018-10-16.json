I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I'm Mary Louise Kelly when hurricane Michael barreled through Florida it also crashed right into the middle of too hotly contested political races Florida is of course a swing state and a critical one\nAnd candidates vying for the governor's seat and a U.S Senate seat were quick to jump into relief efforts here's Democrat Andrew Gillum he's running for governor and wielding a chainsaw to help clear fallen trees\nLiving up there meanwhile here's his opponent as his Republican Ron dissent is on his way to the panhandle to help out ... years\nWhy why are we are\nThe folks in northwest Florida need you well let me bring in Steve ... he's the Tallahassee bureau chief for the Tampa Bay times he has been out and about today covering current governor Rick Scott at sea bass gay welcome to the program thank you so much for hurricane Michael shaken up these two big races\nIt's had a major effect and the governor's race in the race for the United States Senate because the Democratic candidate for governor is the mayor of Tallahassee which got hit hard by the storm\nAnd the leading Republican candidate for the U.S Senate Rick Scott sitting governor is a if pressed into his other role as commander in chief in an emergency to sort of a help the state recover\nTell me a little bit more about how the candidates have adjusted what they're doing we heard a little bit there from the gubernatorial candidates out on the campaign trail meanwhile Rick Scott who as I mentioned is currently governor he's running to be senator I hear he has turned his campaign over to his wife at least temporarily so that he can focus on cleaning up after the hurricane\nThat's correct Rick Scott has suspended campaigning\nAnd his wife first lady and Scott who is really not had much of a profile as first lady has stepped into the role that's very unusual and I just left Rick Scott in Gadsden county which is the next county west of Tallahassee\nRick Scott though he's not formally campaigning he was listening a post for people's concerns about storm problems but everyone wanted to have their picture taken with the governor everyone wanted to shake his hand\nThe point I'm making is you can't ever completely separate governing from campaign\nLet me ask you one practical question early voting in some of the hardest hit parts of Florida is supposed to begin at the end of this month October twenty sevens are those polling places likely to be up and running\nNot in a place like bay county which is the hardest hit comedy of the ball and which is by the way the biggest county in the hurricane zone\nThere are scrambling and I've talked to elections supervisors who are asking governor Scott's issue an executive order that would dramatically reduce the number of voting locations\nSo that you have these super of voting centers maybe every five or ten miles people would have to travel further to vote but everyone's vote would be protected\nHas the hurricane changed the issues that voters say they want to vote on I mean I'm thinking of climate change which is not often mentioned first and foremost among things that drive people to the polls that hurricane Michael ... was a part the intensity was impacted by warmer waters which was of course linked to climate change\nI'm skeptical whether that's going to be elevated as a major issue throughout this campaign for both governor and us of it\nDespite all the problems we've had here with red tide and the algae sea level rise environmental issues are not polling\nNearly as importantly as health care\nAnd education and the economy what a hurricane does to alter the dynamics of politics and campaigning is getting reinforces to people that without government you have nothing in a in an emergency you know everyone's asking where's FEMA everyone's asking you know we're first responders are and they're grateful for the help they're getting from first responders\nBut everywhere you look you see the hand of government trying to give people hope\nSteve ... Tallahassee bureau chief for the Tampa Bay times talking about the impact of hurricane Michael on\nPolitics in Florida State by state thanks so much ...\nObamacare won't be on ballots in next month's

to health coverage\nMcCaskill blast her Republican opponent Josh Hawley for joining a lawsuit that seeks to overturn Obamacare and as a requirement that insurance companies offer coverage regardless of a person's medical history Republicans insist they will protect patients with preexisting medical conditions though they've been vegan saying how\nThat'll cross around the country have seized on this issue Erika Franklin Fowler who directs the Media Project at Wesleyan University says healthcare dominates congressional campaign it out pacing jobs taxes and immigration\nDemocrats had been laser focused on health care this year\nIs the mirror image of what we saw in past election cycles when fellow says Republicans ran a blitzkrieg of ads attacking Obamacare while Democrats said largely quiet\nRegardless of how Americans feel about the Affordable CARE Act there are provisions of it that are very popular once it became clear that those provisions are in trouble I think that has sort of changed the landscape of how politicians will talk about it that cycle\nDemocrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November on the other hand if Republicans keep control they could take another run at repealing Obamacare\nVice president Jessica Anderson of the conservative group heritage action so that could happen during the lame duck session even of Republicans lose in November\nMany Republicans won the ability to finish the job they've campaigned on this for over eight years\nNo matter which party controls Congress next year Anderson says the Trump Administration will likely keep trying to chip away that Obamacare for example the administration has already relax regulations allowing stripped down insurance policies with reduced coverage\nThe president will still be in office in his administration will still be active in trying to find places to roll back harmful rag\nBut Democrats might be able to put the brakes on some of those efforts if they win a majority in November Drew Altman has the Kaiser Family foundation healthcare research organization what you're\nLikely to see is much greater and even fears over

things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly secretary of state Mike Pompeo is in Riyadh he is meeting with Saudi Arabia's leaders about the disappearance and likely death of journalist ... ...\n... talk to NPR earlier this year he told my colleague Jackie Northam that he was no fan of the direction crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was taking Saudi Arabia\nHe has no interest in the ... the full he thinks he can do it alone than he does it really any cult that opinion or do you want to share those changes and saw the movie with him\nChilling words to hear now from that interview with our international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam and Jackie is with me now to talk more about the crown prince and whether he's a reformer or not he jak high married\nSo early on a lot of people thought that he was headed down the path toward reform and and one of the big things that was cited was his decision to allow finally Saudi women to drive people thought about what the promising and there were other moves in a similar vein right\nYeah that's right it was just over a year ago in Saudi Arabia announced it would allow women to drive again that ban was seen as a clear sign of repression and the kingdom\nUm he also allowed women to go to work again any open movie theaters after about a thirty year ban on that too and all of this happened very quickly at the same time his faces they were all over TV and magazines and that\nIs very dynamic compared to the rest of the older Saudi leaders who are known for making the decisions very slowly\nHe also has tried to open up the economy making Saudi Arabia less dependent on oil\nYes that's right yeah and and that's not going very well at all and here's where we really start to see the ... side of the crown prince he wanted to make fundamental changes to the economy and quickly and it's part of that he wanted to fight corruption is a way to bring in foreign investment\nBut it was a way that he did it that's become emblematic of how he operates instead of using laws in court he rounded up more than two hundred Saudi businessmen and princes and government ministers and he held them at the Ritz Carlton hotel for more than three months\nUntil they paid hundreds of millions of dollars to get out\nNow most people would say that's probably not a good way to attract foreign investment in fact it probably do just the opposite which it appears to have done I'm thinking also have\nSome of his recent moves on the international stage at the war in Yemen where Saudi Arabia has carried out a ... I think say say largely indiscriminate bombing campaign and then there was the situation or with the prime minister of Lebanon remind\nAnd the minister Saad Hariri ah he was visiting and Saudi Arabia and he was detained by the crown prince to think about it to a painting of sitting prime minister or well he's visiting your country um that's how I built him arrests\nFor being reckless in a bully and many of the analysts that I've talked to over the past few months\nThinks this is because he just doesn't sinks through or recognize the repercussions of what he's doing 'em and perhaps he doesn't have a great world view and you know he ... he didn't travel abroad very much unlike most other Saturday elites and so perhaps he doesn't have a keen sense of geopolitics\nCircle back to that tape of your interview with ... where he said he doesn't think the crown prince ... we want to encounter opinion is a consensus that recent events might be proving that remark prophetic\nWhen in fact actually over the many months now I he's rounded up for religious figures economists activists including those who uh work to get the female driving ban overturned and he doesn't tolerate criticism as you say um and that included from ...\nYou know he saw the handwriting on the wall he had to leave the country because of that and how what are they ready to come here had to you know he had to leave Saudi Arabia come here and you know given what's happened his suspected murder will have to wait and see whether the crown princes repressive tendencies are even worse than what people were fearing\nThank you Jacki thanks very with NPR's Jackie Northam\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has developed a close relationship with Jared Kushner President Trump's close advisor and son in law during ... time at the White House that relationship now faces more scrutiny after ... disappearance\nNPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe chair to tell us more about Cushing has role in shaping U.S foreign policy including port Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with Mohammed than some of them\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person or since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both\nBoth in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first foreign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to\nAh Canada or Mexico first\nAh and he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many\nLeaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people and so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to be the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\n... it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Christian or a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of Christmas portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared mnemonic I there is such a genius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... about Trump a but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not\nHappy with questionnaires are influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry and personality pretty much above all\nSo now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it and the secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the ground for us\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion or was one of the White House officials who is reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter could show gee went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials are pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince has denied any knowledge of this disappearance\nUh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience that it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)",
