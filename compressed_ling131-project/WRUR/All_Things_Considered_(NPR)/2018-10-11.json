I think it's also important to remember that President Trump got nine out of town Republican votes and twenty six day not that every one of those nine out of ten who voted for him was thrilled with every aspect of what he was saying\nOh I think we're in a pretty good position going into these midterm elections I'm I'm pretty optimistic will be able to hold our majority\nThere was a talk at one point in time about no dissecting where these losses were happening for Republicans particularly in the Hispanic community it is it time for that to happen again\nWell I don't think there's any question that we would like to be doing better than we are with a Hispanic Americans although some of the most prominent Hispanic politicians in America I happened to be Republican\nWith regard to women voters we've always had something of a ... it's never been as wide as it is now we have two great women running for the Senate this year Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee and Martha ... Arizona I think we can improve our position with women voters and it was a fan of voters are for sure\nWith African Americans we haven't been able to make much although I think it is noteworthy that a temp Scott there's a member of our conference and he's the arguably the most popular politician in South Carolina so\nThere is hope with African American voters as well but I'm a more optimistic about closing the gender gap and by improving our position was as\nYou're looking ahead we talked to three and a half weeks away from this election how many Republicans will be in the Senate next year now you know I'm not\nGonna [laughter] I'd say out of their production business\nSometimes to non answers are telling that was Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell speaking with our Kelsey Snell on Capitol Hill today and kills you is there anything else he just wouldn't answer\nWell yeah I think it's important to note that this is a a longer interview that we can ahead it down for a time and he and I talked about a lot\nAnd one of the things he did that really struck me is that he avoided criticizing President Trump Adam ... and most issues particularly on the economy and on President Trump's comments from last night that the fed is crazy for raising interest rates McConnell just wouldn't go there\nAnd in that section about health care when we heard him say it was a major failure he didn't say it's a fight he wants to repeat and that's not what a lot of conservatives want to hear they wanted to hear that and Republicans are going to go back if they still have control and try again to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd on that same issue we got into an extended conversation about Republicans and protections for people with pre existing condition okay two Senate candidates are involved in lawsuits to weaken those protections and he told me that Republicans are campaigning on keeping those protections and gave a contradictory response\nAbout how they can support those lawsuits but still want protections in place [laughter] one\nThing that leaped out at me listening they're back to your health care point he described as a failure to pass health care overhaul is the only major disappointment and I was thinking I I can think of others I mean what about comprehensive immigration reform they wanted to get that done it's not done\nThat really wasn't on his list and you know I hadn't been on the list for a lot of Republicans that I've talked to a who had worked on immigration many of them said that they still hold out hope that immigration could be part of a broader conversation later in the air potentially around spending\nI'm speaking you're spending and speaking of immigration did you ask about the border wall which people are talking about again funding for Trump's border wall with Mexico\nYeah I asked him if he thought there was going to be a shutdown fight in December over the border wall with Mexico he says he wants to try to get funding for the wall\nBut he's talking about a lot less money than House Republicans he said about you know money for about one year roughly the amount that they've been spending on border security altogether and now that's not the big down payment or major investment that some in the house are talking about and that sets up the possibility of an immigration conversation other big spending fight one\nOther thing that you that you raised with him was women and where women are left post Kevin are confirmation battle um he acknowledged that there's always been something of a gender gap in terms of voters for for Republicans and acknowledge that is going to be a challenge\nYeah absolutely and he said that he is going to make an effort to get more women on the Senate Judiciary committee next year he says he's asked in the past and he's going to ask again\nAll right NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell talking about her interview today with Mitch McConnell are there on Capitol Hill Kelsey

it helped me in my own coming out story to stop being angry about how long it took or feeling guilty about my path in my process\nAnd just feeling a bit more proud of who I Am and there's I don't know

sixteen murders jump to the highest rate in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign since then the murder rate there has fallen some but gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\nMy of director the attorney general's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave to straighten it out on to straighten it out fest is no reason for what's going on there [noise]\nBut what that means it turns out opposition\nThe administration is filing a brief with a federal court saying it opposes a package of police reforms in Chicago that's known as a consent decree the decree aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public Trump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intense of policing\nStop and frisk it works and it was meant for problems\nLike Chicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk from says the widespread\nStopping and frisky potential criminals reduce crime that conclusion is contentious though and stop and frisk can also turn into racial profiling under twenty Fifteen court settlement Chicago police have had to fill out extensive forms justifying their stops which has led to fewer stops\nThe administration believes this sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make crime words and that this new consent decree is more of the same\nBut Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in\nOnly really haven't had any keep from them and kill now\nMadigan as the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nUh if they wanted to have a role or they had that opportunity they decided that they are getting hot and therefore chose to do nothing\nThis is NPR it's W. ex exciting News I'm Alex Wright and good afternoon sixty five degrees with cloudy skies more

things considered ... and I'm Mary Louise Kelly we're going to talk now about the man behind a name you have been hearing a lot these last few days Jamal ... he used the Saudi journalist who walked into the Saudi consulate and assemble last week\nAnd then disappeared was never seen walking up prompting reports that he was kidnapped\nOr maybe murdered by a hit squad flown in from Riyadh for that express purpose but who is or was ... and why would he had been seen as posing such a danger to the Saudi regime that is such an extraordinary operation would have been put in motion\nOr we're going to put those questions now to shutting ... of the Brookings Institution welcome Hi thanks for having me God have you with us All right we know some basic facts ... age fifty nine\nOr that he's an editor or that he's a critic of his government in Saudi Arabia [noise] what else should we know about him\nSo the interesting thing about him is that he wasn't always a dissident and he was actually a consummate insider with close connections to the Saudi royal court that's what makes this different this is someone who came from the inside and then decided that he could no longer support\nNew Saudi policies under a new leadership and he left Saudi Arabian June twenty Seventeen he went into exile he came to the yeah came to the U.S\nAnd started writing for the Washington Post what did he write that would have annoyed the Saudi regime so much\nSo one of his pieces that is getting a lot of attention now in retrospect he wrote in September twenty Seventeen where he basically announced his break\nWith Saudi Arabia is the factor leader ... been selling man also known as NBS the crown prince ... and he supported some of the general reforms that NBS was trying to put forward including\nMore rights for women but he felt that if Saudi Arabia was going to go through a transformation that the people had to be part of the conversation and the Saudi leadership and NBS in particular increasingly moved in a direction where\nThey didn't want any questioning of this new direction\nAnd cause shaggy couldn't bring himself to agree with that and I think that he was pained\nTo have this break with the Saudi regime he didn't want it\nAs you look back over what he wrote what he did what he said over the last year or two was there a moment where it appeared he'd crossed a line on was starting to put himself into danger\nKnow I don't know if we can point to one moment but I think we can say that he had become\nThe most prominent Saudi dissident but more importantly the most prominent Saudi dissident in the west I mean the fact that he wrote regularly for the Washington Post\nThe fact that he knew many in the policy community in DC so I think he was the one person who could credibly and effectively I'm casting doubt on\n... been selling man's vision for Saudi Arabia at a time when Mohammed bin Salman or NBS as he's called was really trying to portray himself as this young reformer and the young reformer that America should ... wagging to\nThis is interesting because because a lot of journalists have written critically about Saudi Arabia and that the direction that Mohammed bin Salman is taking at what you're describing is why he might have been seen as a\nAs a more of a danger than others but he had such a platform that he was so well connected in Washington and outside of Saudi Arabia\nAnd he's coming from within Saudi society he knows the major players in and leaders in the Saudi royal court so it's different you know if I criticize Saudi Arabia for something that's one thing but if ... ah did that\nThen it's different because he's speaking from within the family\nDoes it strike you as puzzling though I mean the reports are being source to Turkish officials Turkish investigators saying that this team of Fifteen people flew in on private planes with the express purpose of targeting ... that just seems like\nA massive operation to take out one editor\nIt sounds so crazy that it's hard to get your head around it\nThat Saudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their critics can you imagine that this actually happened in the way that Turkish officials said yes I think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I I think many people\nHave been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think is surprising level of indifference it's almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community in a sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different intelligence agencies are moving in this direction it seems that this is the most plausible scenario\nShadi Hamid thanks so much for having me my pleasure Shadi Hamid is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution we have been talking about Saudi journalist and dissident Jamal ...\nNow because she'll get disappearance and possible murder is draining relations between Washington and Riyadh and it comes at a time of heightened tension between

NPR's Michele Kelemen reports\nRobert Jordan was the Bush administration's ambassador to Saudi Arabia in the wake of the September eleventh attacks and he said in times like this it's crucial to have

crown prince feels emboldened by this relationship with Trump stone and loan as for the president he says he wants to get to the bottom of the show gave situation but he's not ready to cut off lucrative arms deal\nWe don't sell it to them they'll say well thank you very much will live from Russia or thank you very much will buy it from China that doesn't help us not when it comes to jobs and not what it comes to our constitution losing out on them where\nTrump was speaking a day after a group of senators sent him a letter requiring him to consider sanctions against Saudi Arabia am Senator Chris Murphy is also calling on Trump to dump supporting the Saudi military campaign in Yemen\nThat bombing campaign in our participation in it is predicated on our belief that the Saudis are
