the plan maybe most memorable for another discovery it portends NPR's Joe Palca has more\nThere are several things that do make the new object nicknamed the goblet remarkable Scott Sheppard says size is not one of them\nOn a small end of a dwarf planet we don't know exactly how big it is but we think it's about three hundred kilometers inside which was about six or seven times smaller than what to do is\nShepherd is an astronomer with the Carnegie Institution for science he and his colleagues first spotted the object in twenty Fifteen\nThere's only one thing we know immediately when we find it object and we know its distance from the sun but that's all we can say we can actually say anything about two or\nThree more years of measurements have revealed the new objects orbit and it's a doozy first the goblins orbit isn't even close to round like er it's it's a very elongated ellipse next it takes forty thousand years to make a single revolution around the sun\nAnd it never gets closer to the sun than six billion miles about twice as far as Pluto is from the sun objects this far out with really elongated orbits or just weird\nThe current models of solar system formation don't predict these objects\nJuliet Becker is an astronomer at the University of Michigan now it's possible that these models are wrong but Becker says a better explanation may be the giant planet some astronomers think is out there\nIn easier solution is the existence of planet nine because it naturally creates these objects in the solar system\nThe gravity of big planets like Jupiter or Neptune canceling smaller objects into weird orbits if they happen to wander by but the goblin doesn't get anywhere near Jupiter Neptune so some astronomers think planet nine might be out there doing the swinging\nBecker says right now only a handful of objects points to the existence of planet nine so there's plenty of skepticism that it really exists\nI guess I have kind of a ticker in my mind is how many new objects do we need right now we obviously don't have enough but this particular object is such a unique orbit and it's so useful that like I the ticker in my mind just jumped up like where a lot closer to having enough objects\nCertainly the goblet gives new confidence to several teams already searching for planet nine but so far no luck Joe Palca NPR News

those sorts of questions to lawyers who've been responsible for vetting judges carry joins us now he carried I also\nSo but the judge has already have to complete a pretty thorough and very long questionnaire is it surprising that the White House didn't touch any of these allegations of sexual misconduct and Brett Kavanaugh's case\nIt's true that judge candidates gas a bunch of questions known in shorthand as the sex drugs and rock and roll questions things like did you abuse alcohol or drugs did you have a wrap sheet what about financial improprieties but those questions usually start at age Eighteen and go forward\nIn this allegation by Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh\nHappened when he was Seventeen years old to be clear Kavanaugh has denied any sexual misconduct but\nThere were plenty of hints about his use of alcohol\nFrom that high school yearbook injury to his fraternity at Yale which was known for rock as parties to his own speeches once he got on the federal appeals court here in Washington DC\nWords like what happened at Georgetown Prep stayed at Georgetown Prep in a time in a speech when he reminisced about baseball outing at Yale where

question does it violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nTo execute a convicted murderer who has such severe dementia that he doesn't remember the crime he committed NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports\nVernon Madison committed a terrible crime in Nineteen eighty five after leaving his girlfriend's house he returned and shot and killed a police officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection\nTwice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct the third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows a trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffers from severe vascular dimension\nHis lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this prime things of that the state six to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the result of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia is so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself for his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely urinate on himself and asked the guards to take him to the toilet [noise]\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or a psychotic it's All right to execute him the eighth amendment he said is not like the constitutions other amendments it's a mirror of our norms and our values\nAnd what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable\nThat executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior\nJustice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I think if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's schizophrenia or delusional\nLawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime\nAnd he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murdered after the argument
