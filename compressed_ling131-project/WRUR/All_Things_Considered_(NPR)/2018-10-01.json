Rochester\nDoes no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example\nWe actually need to find out what we can find out dinner to Jeff Flake said that the FBI minds evidence Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath his nomination is over for Monday October first it's all\nThings considered\n... and I'm Ari Shapiro the White House now says the FBI should interview anyone at once and the Kavanaugh investigations so how much can the bureau accomplish in one week\nLast year after the Las Vegas shooting when survivor is trying to help others deal with their trauma I ... in a panic thinking about how many people would have invisible wounds later growing problems that General Electric\nIt became a big bureaucracy ah and it moved slowly in a world that kept moving more quickly and we'll remember the French singer Charles asking them or first these headlines\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Laurie London\nPresident Trump says the FBI should do a comprehensive investigation into the allegations surroundings Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and that he's keeping in his words an open mind\nBut as NPR's Mara Liasson reports he also says that Senate Republicans should determine the scope of that investigation\nPresident Trump said he wants the investigation to end quickly and that the FBI should look into whatever the Republican Senate wants it to he said he believes Kavanaugh was truthful in his testimony and that his family has been treated horribly but he also said he has no backup plan if Kavanaugh should withdraw or be rejected by the Senate\nI Hope that he gets approved I Hope that the report comes out\nLike a ... like I really think it should I think it will I Hope\nI Hope what look I'm waiting just like you\nThe president said he was surprised how vocal Kavanaugh was about his drinking problems in high school President Trump doesn't drink which he joked today was one of his only good traits Mara Liasson NPR News Washington\nTrump is also telling a newly reached trade agreement with Canada and Mexico Canada is chief trade negotiate eight or in negotiator agrees NPR's Windsor Johnston reports the U.S Mexico Canada agreements would replace the north American free trade agreement or NAFTA\nTrump says the new trade deal is based on the principles of fairness and reciprocity\nOnce approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement in the history of our country with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed\nTrump says the agreement will create jobs across the manufacturing agriculture and technology sectors it would also protect Canada from any future automobile terrorists imposed by the United states\nAbsolutely agree I mean it goes then then the issue is truthful is not only sexual assault is an issue but it's lying to Congress in lying under oath or clearly that would be just\nOr even if it's found that Kavanaugh lied about say his drinking habits you think that would be disqualifying as\nWell so that has been a whole new issue that I've been fascinated with that people have said OK if we can now now that we have him on record for new things I Try to find new things that maybe we we can say not necessarily lying about what we have different interpretations\nWhen people that one person says yes objectively I think you drink too much and he says objectively no I don't think I was drinking too much then that's enough for lying enough to exclude him that's no longer a dialogue about sexual assault as trying to find some way to trip up a nominee\nTo be able to catch them on something based on some kind of history from thirty six years ago\nThat that that's no longer really drawn to be able to get to a judge that's trying to be able to destroy someone personally I Am offended by that I think most people should be quite frankly many my democratic colleagues have said to me quietly I really hope that they don't reopen my time when I was in high school the way that we're opening up a time on Brett Kavanaugh and he's in high school and draw to challenge everything\nYou don't think it's fair to say that it would be disqualifying Brett Kavanaugh was missed characterizing his drinking habits as a teenager\nSo drinking habits as a teenager and someone saying he drank too much and the other ones that you didn't drink too much becomes subjective issue a sexual assault is very clear\nRepublican senator James Lankford of Oklahoma thank you very much for joining us today but glad to be able to share with

and China's new wealth and power are changing the world this week we're starting a series that explores China's reach into other countries NPR's chief international editor will Dotson joins us now to get a preview hey well I also\nSlanted the on the series is looking at China but from the vantage point of other countries why look at China from the outside\n[noise] right well for nearly Thirty years we've been reporting on a rising China we've been following as it reaches one economic benchmark after another\nAt some point you have to recognize that the world is changed and China's not rising anymore it's risen right what we're looking at now is not a developing country it's a major player that throws its weight around that is confident and assertive in sort of pushing its its interests and if you want to see that engagement you have to be looking outside of China\nAnd how did you decide where to go to assess China's massive influence around the world well\nWe went to more than a dozen countries around the globe we went to South America Africa Europe south east Asia and what we were looking to do is not just to sort of a cheetah\nA geographic diversity we're looking at a diversity of places in terms of the countries that China is meeting so that means how China engages democracies versus how it's engaging developing economies struggling societies places\nThat are very far afield generally far out of their orbits and places that are in their strategic backyard\nAnd without telling us too much about the ... here in the next coming days and if you found\nWell it'd be great to start with a story that our Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz about uh he was looking at China as meddling in Australia meddling yeah look of course China in Australia have a really broad relationship or they are huge trading partners\nBut the relationship is deeper than just goods and services he looks at a writer who was trying to write a book critical of China's influence in Australia and for the longest time he couldn't get it published in Australia\nAnd and this is sort of thing that's really remarkable here is that China is no longer content to stifle free speech just within its own borders it's now extending its influence into public fears of other countries exercising censorship in foreign country exactly\nWhere else did you that go well and in Africa are Nairobi correspondent found a massive new infrastructure project that links to of Kenya's largest cities\nNow this is something you can find many places like this it's something that can you deeply needs it's a it's been very well done and very well executed but is now leading to greater local resentment added this Chinese operation using Chinese labor\nAnd there's fear understandable fear in Kenya that they won't be able to pay the Chinese back\nThat these Chinese projects that we're seeing spring up around the world are creating traps that could cause future dependency\nIt's also important that China doesn't always get its way in some places they are making massive investments are in these projects are hitting the skids and we have a story that look some of the problems that can the devil even China or in Morocco\nAnd then in Europe there are concerns about China stifling free speech fear over investment in certain high tech sectors and also there's growing concern about China investing huge amounts and ports around the continent here's one analyst explaining what's worrying some in Europe\nThey've invested all along the periphery of Europe it's like almost in anaconda

staff writer at politifact thank you very much my pleasure\nNow let's look at what the FBI is trying to find out during a week long investigation of Brett Kavanaugh the\nPresident formally asked the bureau on friday to reopen its background check of the Supreme Court nominee and that means we are now three days into the probe NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here in the studio Hi Ryan either\nLet's start with the big sticking points so far which has been the question of the scope of the investigation do we know what the FBI is looking into exactly\nWe don't exactly know what they're looking into no Democrats as we've heard have complained that the scope of this is a kind of being curtailed reined in by the White House they say that the administration's put strict limits on what the FBI can investigate Democrat set the FBI and the White House today a list of twenty four people that they say that the bureau should or should talk to\nThe administration has pushed back against this uh they've said that uh they do want a full investigation they've made clear that um they also don't want a fishing expedition\nToday the president said that he wants what he called a comprehensive an investigation he reiterated again that he wanted done quickly\nUh and it is the White House that has the final say on what the FBI gets to look into in this background investigation that said Trump said today that well he has final say he's listening to what the Senate Republican leadership or wants to have checked out what they want looked into and then he's directing the FBI based off of what the Senate says\nAnd what has the Senate Republican leadership said they want the FBI to look into\nWell they initially said that they wanted the FBI to look into what they called credible allegations of sexual misconduct\nThat was always a big enough kind of ill defined enough that the questions about scope where it almost inevitable a on this question a senior U.S Senate GPA pointed comments any Senator Lindsey Graham made over the weekend\nA Graham said that the FBI would talk to witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford mentioned in her testimony last week that includes Kavanaugh's friend mark judge a gram also mentioned Deborah Ramirez she's the second woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kevin all\nThose allegations said back to their time at Yale in the early mid Nineteen eighties and those are the only people that Graham mentioned\nSocial mentioned this is day three of the FBI's week long investigation do you know much about what the FBI has been doing and those three days so far\nWith the bureau itself has not provided any ah any clarity on this but NPR has learned that the FBI has interviewed Ramirez\nUh she's given the FBI list of people that she says either witnessed the elected incident uh or heard about it uh contemporaneously you on that though it's it's pretty much cricket side of the bureau has not reached shut the Ford at this point\nIt also had an reach out to a third woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh that's Julie sweat Nick uh and then there are number of possible witnesses who could have information about the various a legend events in question when of course is Kevin ... friend mark judge we talked a lot about him judge has said he'll cooperate with the FBI\nOf his his lawyer today declined to say anything beyond that\nAnd at the same time more of Kavanaugh's high school and college acquaintances are speaking out tell us about what they've said most recently\nWell in the last twenty four hours a former friend of Kavanaugh's at Yale came out and publicly ... disputed Kevin O's representation of his of his drinking as a young man this is Chad letting too and he's a history professor at North Carolina state now\nAnd his comments don't relate to allegations of sexual misconduct but really about how much Kevin I drank and ... says is that he frequently drank with Kevin ... when they were at Yale us as Kevin I was a belligerent and aggressive drunk\nA but at the same point in time the White House has put out statements from two college

from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problem was were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and nice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later\nI'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up\nWell the real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at the place like the department of energy but you write about\nSo the department of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean the stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo there's jock there when the day after election no one shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the

judges\nAnd you want me through how he would go about this one if he were on the team investigating Kevin\nFirst I Would spend a lot of time trying to locate the home perhaps Dr Ford could ride around with agents we don't have much time you know we have to do it quickly if we can limit the neighborhood or the general area and we might be able to find the house\nThey're also real estate records available to the FBI would investigate\nLet me just start with the first example you would actually have Christine Blasey Ford in a card with you and just drive around the neighborhood and see if that jaws her memory to point out the house I absolutely would else and and you would try to look for what you said for plans of houses in the neighborhood yeah matched the description from her memory\nI
