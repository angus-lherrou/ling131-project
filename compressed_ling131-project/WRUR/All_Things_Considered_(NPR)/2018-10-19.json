things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly in Washington and I melted Chang in Phoenix, Arizona President Trump is campaigning here tonight Arizona is a state where the G O P dominates politics right now both of US Senators the governor most state lawmakers they are all Republican\nBut that could change because waves of Latino will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state\nAnd to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called policy it's about eighty percent Latino [noise]\n\nI'm In a restaurant serving port those out got as and tacos and I belong to a guy who gives the Republican\nSomehow the way we handle our homes especially in Hispanic community is the way Trump wants to run the U.S [noise]\nRamon bearing owns a small business repairing floor is he's a registered

fourteen years old and it's\nFunny that he told me somehow that door makes me feel safer it made me think you know that you know it doesn't make sense more more metal their keeps\nThe wars we've while you know\nSit outside and within seconds you'll run into people who vehemently disagree with parents like evil Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news or coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to or you can either status you've seen the kid's been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party he asked me I mean who's solving all that you know Trump and his agenda\nThere is a reason Hernandez view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJust have Garcia hits the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to still win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us\nCitizens twenty Eighteen could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join Thirteen\nI'm not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding in the district state representative Tony Rivera\nHave any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say well they'll say um how could you be a Republican when the Republicans don't support 'em Hispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd it's just wants to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as he knocked on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some time I was on the river on the Republican running for realize I'm I'm here answering questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nYeah that is a ... I feel that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexico\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in short immigrants from Mexico and um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws\nBut I think this is a country of an opportunity and I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them I ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party is\nAnd on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize as a people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration switching I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is good I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor ... who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked to see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection Doug ... on the ballot and its diagnoses agenda\nDo see hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it would be as you approach do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security that we need to stop them\nWe need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that now I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic it Republicans want to appeal hearty why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party and the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that like Abel Hernandez\nRemember him the truck driver who says immigrations the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThis was litigated Twenty years ago two thirds of the American people sided with me\nIs true two thirds of Americans at the time said Clinton should not be removed from office that the charges didn't justify it with the country feel the same way today and how does Bill Clinton sex scandal of two decades ago continue to\nShape political culture today Susan Glasser oversaw the Washington Post coverage of Bill Clinton's impeachment now she writes the letter from Washington column for the New Yorkers Susan Glasser thanks for coming in thank you so much you started at the post one week before the Lewinsky story broke\nOne week before the Lewinsky story invoke exactly I was a supposed to be the deputy national editor in charge of investigation so at the time that was the Clinton fundraising scandal now mostly forgotten in the annals of history\nAnd when the Lewinsky story broke how did you all initially think about framing we're kind of story was\nWell it was a political earthquake and I remember standing slack jawed in the post newsroom along with you know hundreds of other journalists\nWhen President Clinton came out and said you know I did not have sex with that relation with that woman and in hindsight it seems more clear cut what the outcome is going to be but there were certainly moments when we felt along the way that the Clinton presidency with hanging in the balance\n[noise] I've been going back through some of the Post's coverage of the times and trying to reconcile what you were writing with what I remember feeling I'm Around the same age as Monica Lewinsky and I'm struck when I look back at how women of my generation didn't rally around her\nThe culture has shifted and you know as a woman in many ways I'm sure you know you and I both\nWelcome many of the changes and the revelations have the last year about sexual exploitation of women harassment of women in the workplace and this unfortunately was not reflected in either the politics or the culture of that moment it was at\nA sexist environment in Washington in some ways that are still true today and some ways that things are are not\nFeel really of a different time we had to look back at it now\nSetting aside things the Clintons have shed in this last year it was really Donald Trump who played a big role in re injecting the Clintons sex scandals in to the national political debate at the second presidential debate he brought Clinton's accusers style\nI wanted a broad set out here just for those\nActions speak louder than words [noise] Mr Trump Mayer says that\nThe ... graves\nJuanita Broderick speaking right before walking into the presidential debate to sit in the audience with Paula Jones and other Clinton accusers\nSusan Glasser the read on that was Trump was wheeling out Clinton's accusers in order to deflect from the Access Hollywood tape in order to deflect attention from his own accusers did it work well\nI think Trump has learned a lot from how Bill Clinton survived the impeachment scandal and raising it out and denying or telling the truth slowly you\nKnow Trump did use the female accusers of Bill Clinton to shield himself I guess that he knew correctly that Democrats would be accused of being hypocrites that has continued to be the case throughout\nThe subsequent me to revelations which took place after that twenty sixteen campaign and many people myself included\nBelieve that part of that sort of national furor over the meat you story has been a response in some ways to the fact that there is another male president in the oval office who has been credibly accused of misconduct by numerous women in Trump's case I Believe it's Nineteen women\n[noise] do you think Bill Clinton would have survived the Lewinsky scandal if it unfolded today\nYou know that is the question I Will say that the Democratic party has shifted publicly at least more than the Republican Party when it comes to what to do about members in their own ranks\nWho are accused of this kind of wrongdoing look at how quickly they abandon Al Franken the Democratic senator from Minnesota you know maybe that would have happened with Bill Clinton maybe not\n[noise] do you think it serves a purpose to reckon with Bill Clinton's legacy at this point where does it leave us or is it time to let it go well\nI Do think Donald Trump's continued mentioning of the Clintons at every turn suggests how useful part is in\nFoil it is at this hyper partisan time\nYou know there's some truth to Bill Clinton's point that we have litigated\nThis issue two decades ago and to me the fact that it does keep recurring is largely a reflection of the fact that we're grappling as a country with the unique presidents have Donald Trump and the many allegations of wrongdoing towards him\nSusan Glasser now a columnist at the New Yorker thanks so much\nThinking
