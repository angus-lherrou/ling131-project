S. ... considered about um with China\nThe problem is that China was never a party of this agreement so really they don't have any restrictions on building these kinds of missiles\nAnd you know if if the U.S wants to negotiate with China a similar kind of deal then they can do so\nCould point out of this treaty complicate U.S Russia relations at this point\nCertainly they both hold today just as they did back in Nineteen eighty seven the largest amount of nuclear weapons in the world and it's in their self interest to prevent other states or non state actors from getting as many nuclear weapons as they do and how worried\nShould the average citizen be who's watching all of this play out right now just leaving this treaty in your opinion make the world\nLess safe\nFor a long time people really believe that international agreements where the best way to create peace and stability in the world you didn't have to like your partner in a treaty but you could still\nA deal with them and you could believe that they would obey the terms of the agreement and you could verify that and you could retaliate if they didn't\nBut a lot of those rules are going out the window and increasingly under the Trump Administration and under scrutiny and Xi Jinping we're seeing more strong arm moves and so what's more worrying for me is that we may go back to a time when whoever has the biggest missile\nThe largest warhead is the one that has the security and um that really takes us back to some dark times that many people worked very hard to prevent\n...

reports from the Mexican state of Chiapas\nAfter only a few days in the migrant caravan twenty eight year old Betty west we only use her first name because of threats against their face the difficult choice she'd come determined to reach the U.S and seek asylum\nLet me add\nOne yeah\nShe says I came with my two brothers and sisters but his Mexican forces blocked the bridge into that\nCountry her family said they were leaving the caravan one brother turned around to signing he could make it in the meantime an under us\nHer other brother and sister in law had family send them money and they paid smugglers to take them to the U.S but it costs a thousand dollars in the family didn't have enough money for Betty and a five year old son Justin\n... but ... not that I'm On my mom and my my ...\nIt's really hard and she says we don't have a mom she dies it's hard to see your brother's leaves you choose a sister in law over you buddy injustice more low but\nNot from all\nOn the bridge they met this family a grandmother for two daughters and several children they took her in just in in sort of caravan family the Guatemalan border is now well behind them right now they're showing up black tarps above a cardboard floor they've laid in the Central Park this little town weeks left\nHere you really get an idea of how thousands of people can survive walking across Mexico\nThat's a radio spots from the local government of weeks left a town of about thirty thousand it as citizens to bring donations of food water in clothing\nFor hours locals have been streaming\nAnd getting the

but they knew they could continue north once they met the other family going back to Honduras she says is not an option\nI mean I'm a semi land\nAs Betty explained she had a tortilla shot back in to seek out the Honduran capital five different gangs were extorting her and she owed them five hundred Lynn pure as a week about twenty dollars that was nearly half of what a shot may and the gangs threats if she didn't pay they take Justin\nAnd went around that and what not to ask the land of\nThe pain is so huge she says the kids suffer but she says they can't go back to hunter is even though she's heard about families being separated at the U.S border right now just in seems to be having fun on this epic truck north he's bouncing around with his friends his mouth stained blue from a lollipop locals are handing out to kids\nI mean yeah they do like to thank God\nShe says I'll cradle in for a while as we walk because he gets tired I don't care I'll carry him as far as we have to go the caravan keeps Betty injustice safe gives them a sense of family they lost a few days ago it brings out locals with donations it's the only way\nShe could imagine making it to the U.S for NPR News I'm James Frederick in weeks left Mexico\nRight now in update on migrant children who were separated from their families at the U. S. Mexico border\nTwo hundred and forty five children remain in federal custody that's according to government data analyzed by the American civil liberties union\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should first say that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families\nBut it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification so I think one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and their reunification\nFor those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are ... I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody into a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because of the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed them killed and this was a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring our child back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite fuzzy but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about [noise]\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\n[noise] the ACLU has reported that five children have parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nI kinda just made a decision by the stall was him to do that will just wasn't interested in it that's why I went into this and sometimes I mean going without work ... when I joined the industry would just be post nine eleven you know\nThe it's a good vibes and ...\nStage to offer the stereotypical portrayal is I think his stories that take place on explicitly ethnic sized terrain by aims to ... those and that was worked out fights taking shape when I joined industry\nI was lucky that with ... some of those projects to flat for lying it's about a group of terrorists but they just kind of these lovable do\nAccidently blow up bin Laden wherever I'm just kind of makes you second guessed it maybe a more subversive thought than they once this is just like us in stage three I'd do is um this idea of the problem is that you know when I'm not ... ...\nEuros I'm playing on only one which I very very culturally specific and you can look at issues like playing roles where I can play a guy named a full day but the the promised land in just about the rest of the nation is about ... the place where it's like I could also play practical in the series\nIs not about leaving my identity behind is about not just being shuffled through a two dimensional idea of it\nSo as your star is on the rise you reached this new level of fame and we'll call this level of fame the Hollywood sex symbol [noise]\nThere's like you can't see that the audience at this event can is a master's photo from a magazine projected on the screen behind us is raise mad lying on a leather couch oiled up with a shirt [laughter]\nLike for you [laughter] you could [laughter]\nYou're kind of put on a pedestal right especially when somebody is like a smart on current events and issues of the day than you are the kind of woke Internet boyfriends and that is a pedestal you can be knocked off of how precarious does it feel that kind of popularity\nOkay what is I mean it's two two things I think about what you said first is this idea of kind\nOf embracing your sexuality is a man is brown Ninety particular um that's something that sometimes I feel is like a little bit corny let's face it you know it can be but I also think if somebody is kind of important to do because I think often brown men you know coach indicted ... allowed to be sexual sensitive essential day like\nEither terrorists barbarians are going to come and eat your kids will be competing in my family and then the object of desire oh you know I've internalize that that caught\nMe as well and in my own mind I never costs myself as the leading guy or someone who'd be you know desire but in that way and so that's really approaches re education and kind of\nRe examining your self image to allow yourself to do that to not itself to be that particularly if you're from a sixty conservative culture so it's actually something that it's it's it's I think it's been Paul my journey of growth due to allow myself to occupy that space [noise]\nUm in terms of like being knocked off incident pedestals I mean like you happen to be ten seconds doesn't it you know\nAnd I asked because you do speak out on ideas right you're not afraid to go on some talk show and really say what you think about something and see if you get nervous\nYeah I guess maybe on some level I Do feel like\nA man maybe there aren't a lot of people like me doing\nThis so I Do feel a responsibility to represent wherever but coming we'd that in speaking to your point of being knocked off as kind of ... and disappointing people you can't represent everyone climate represent everyone's point of view the idea that I can like you know that any given film whether it's like\nBending ... disease to the big sequel goodness gracious me with the night off can satisfy\nThe experience of a billion Muslims around the world well how many million South Asians are in America that in itself is patronize\nAnd it's an unfair but into place I think the one responsibility do have is to try and be\nFull self and that's going to disappoint some people on the religion of some people I'm too busy to other people I'm going to take a show a few months with some people I'm not taking enough others [noise] you know no one in this room of course [laughter] so\nI think the main the main responsibility you have is like no I'm going to do me like even when it's scary for me\nEven when I'm going to find out my comfort zone and if you expose I'm going to be my for the most complex cells and doing that hopefully you inspire other people in power the people to go like why you know he's going to look at the show up in that and maybe I can to

for the killing of journalist Jamal ... secretary of state my palm pale made the announcement today\nWe've identified at least some of the individuals responsible including those in the intelligence services the royal court the foreign ministry and other Saudi ministries who we suspect to have been involved in Mr to show that we're taking appropriate actions which include revoking basis entering visa look out and other measures\nMeanwhile Gina Haspel the head of the CIA is in Turkey today to investigate because she'll just killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul NPR's Greg Myre is here to tell us more about that visit outlook and Greg hey so what is hassles role here\nWell she's got a very significant role in not only with her title is head of the CIA this is a place she knows really well we know she speaks Turkish I'm In a rare speech recently she said is stumble along with London or two of her favorite cities in the world\nThe CIA number says exactly where somebody spent their undercover days but she clearly knows this place she's a player she knows how the\nThe how things to take place there um and remember the U.S turkey and the Saudis are allies and they're conducting these sort of ... separate investigations\nBut there's also negotiations going on um this is probably not likely to end so much in a court room as a as a political agreement and some sort of negotiation so that's the key thing I think to keep watching\nSo what is the White House hoping to accomplish by sending hassle there\nWell the president clearly wants to stay in very quickly he's been very close to the Saudis he wants to resume these close ties and have\nBusiness go on a pretty much as usual but he's been very inconsistent in his responses um he's talked about a a credible investigation and then he's talked about things he's not so sure of severe punishment but then he talks about the value of arms deals so he's been all over the place so here's what he said just today\nSomebody really messed up and they had the worst cover up ever and where should have stopped is at the deal standpoint whether they thought about it because whoever thought of that idea I think is in big trouble\n[noise] so I think the president is looking for Haspel and and Mike Pompeo to give him a clear picture of actually what happened who was responsible so that there can be some sort of a clear policy uh put in place\nIn the meantime turkey has been revealing more and more information each day about what they say happened inside the Saudi conflict do we have a better sense about what they want to happen next\nYeah I think we saw today president or the one gave this big speech\nAnd he talked about this being a premeditated murder so he's clearly still playing hardball with the Saudis and and they've got some real issues turkey and Saudi Arabia or rivals turkey wants to be seen as the preeminent Sunni Muslim country\nUm turkey has a very bad economy they would like investment from Saudi Arabia Saudi a contract so the Turks are likely to keep playing this out drawing it out where where's the Americans and the Saudis would would probably like to to finish it up
