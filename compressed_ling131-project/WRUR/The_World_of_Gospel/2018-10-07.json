are some of them they're going to step\n[noise] real high right but I just think that the programs are becoming a service now I think we're coming out of the situation of competition you know\nEven though and that's and that's the thing that we have [noise] stop putting out that competition saying you know because as I always say we're from Rochester right we all saying Hi\nI stress Rochester I don't care how smooth you're saying you're saying higher because everybody in Rochester through the years we've always gone on the floor to do our best for the lord and do our best for the people who come out to support\nAnd [noise] ... and you know ... years we had people say oh it's not for competition well it's never been for competition has always been supported because from when I was little it to this point in time you can look around a program if she's somebody from every group if they're in town at that program\nI I see I'm thinking about a living and to think about your father\nOne man comes to mind is that the ... and that was a good job now my dad now man they should be telling them that talks about man I tell you what we do with you all today nobody wants to sing the day and that's where a lot of that came from did anything by right but it was just something to make everybody leaves you don't want to try and do a good job\nAnd so there's no whip in there's no beaten but it's just a\nWhole goes party that's going to be going on 'cause a lot of us has changed hands were not going to the clubs are we going to serve to enjoy Jesus together so I was one of my mind you all\nSaturday Night all roads lead to embrace street\nThat we know as corny as corn here that's supposed to the yo yo yo know about the going to be when he called the battleground lassie delivering the miracle men that that's right now and we we respected but we think the way\nFor opening the doors open because this has this been Rochester history you know man because a lot of folks that came to town I saw for the first time\nRight there at Cornell clear about that if you look for however\n... what's the man or a guy stealing child when banks yeah man yeah a lot of great group the blind boy I mean a lot of great letter that group that came through those doors I've learned a lot just from sitting on those a business in Washington is how the pros done it\nA you know what I remember back then you had an anniversary and on the anniversary the whole city was shut down shut down because everybody we're going to call in here\nAnd listen you're going to do whatever you know a good meal I write about what is the anniversary in your local banana putting good chocolate cake and all the rails and chicken you know you're going to listen kind of green you had to go by going out and all that he wasn't going to pop out in the buffet it was a\nProgram that's right you know and and all the groups and like you said the only only within that was going on is Satan was getting whipped up put on the run\nAnd that's and that's what a no no because we're if a group came to a program and then they have all this official guys that's right it wasn't to my ... man you got to pay me to do this and it was like hey man what we need to do you need more possible I mean he's saying is right you go in the corner and try to go over that part to make sure everybody doing ... you don't care who it is",
