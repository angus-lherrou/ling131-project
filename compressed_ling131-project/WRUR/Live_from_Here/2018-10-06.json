J. and David Bowie is China Girl kicked in\nI was in shock without even looking at the monitor this gang really old guy was killing it\nHe had a bar filled with people half his age holding up their cell phones and dancing along I looked over to his friends but they kept right on eating buffalo wings as if he does this all the time\nHe handed you a standing ovation and shuffled off and before I knew what his bald friend was up there without taking his hands out of his sweat shirt pockets he bounced is round head from side to side stopped and Bon Jovi living on a prayer began the entire bar lost their minds\nEveryone was screaming the lyrics with fears held high as this old dude rocked out with less emotion than a plate of oysters\nI never saw anything like it a very attractive waitress was hugging the tall fisherman and showing your phone case with a picture of David Bowie on\nThe bald guy was shaking hands with strangers as women squeezed him and kisses had have you ever thought that you're eating in a seafood restaurant in Long Island but it actually discovered the fountain of youth and ended up singing I've got you babe in the eyes of a salty old fisherman\nAnd I'll definitely be back until next time this has been Tom Papa out in America [noise]\nBut some [noise] for for John Will\nBe performing near here from Livermore performing arts center October twenty
