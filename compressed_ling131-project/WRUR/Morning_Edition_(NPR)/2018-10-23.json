releasing details about his murder\nSlowly Turkey's president ... said today he will reveal what happened to the Saudi critic and journalist when he went to the consulate in Turkey to obtain marriage paperwork\nOn October second this issue as you may know has become the center of a tense relationship between two regional powers and or the one could see this is an opportunity to gain some leverage over the fact of Saudi leader crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nNPR's Peter Kenyon is with us from Istanbul where he's been following this story Hi Peter how are you still has president or to want taken such an interest in what happened to ... well\nBasically he doesn't have any choice I mean the world is focused on this killing ... a one newspaper columnist wrote last week or so a turkey is not the bad guy this time as you noted this has not been the greatest place for journalists\nUh other commentators have tried to make a distinction between jailing journalists and killing them but anyway there's been a steady drip of evidence from the Turkish investigation\nAnd analysts say it's very much and Turkey's interest to be aggressive thorough go wherever the evidence leads\nAh so far it's pointing toward Saudi Arabia to show was a steady government critic you had a column in the Washington Post and the question still remains was it a rogue operation is Riyad claims or did the Saudi leadership of the hand and ordering it\nAt the Saudi foreign minister has basically repeated and Indonesia that they want to hold those responsible to account a Turkish foreign minister today raised the possibility of an international investigation possibly by the United nations\nAnd meanwhile everyone is saying we have more information and we're prepared to release it do we know what Turkey's guy [noise]\nThey have been giving little bits out day by day there is a known that I Know who's seen it all who's talking publicly about it or the CIA director was dispatched ... up presumably to see and hear what exactly turkey does have\nA but basically the evidence we are seeing calls into doubt the Saudis story that this was a brawl was an accident\nA real killers that has nothing to do with the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On\nA we're seeing evidence of calls from the consulate to key advisor to the crown prince\nA and a report even that he ordered the killing ... plus there's been footage of a Saturday consular official burning papers the day after ... killing ... and also footage of an apparent body double a man dressed in ... closed\nLeaving the constantly on the day he went in so that all speaks to pre meditation and attempts to cover up\nHe's won using this situation as an opportunity to kind of confront crown prince Mohammed bin some on\nWe're going to watch that closely it's an important aspect of all is a Saudi Arabian turkey a long time regional rivals different foreign policy views and the Saudis along with the Israelis have been seen as America's top allies in the middle east turkey is an important ally part of NATO\nOr now with this widespread international criticism of Saudi Arabia this could be an opportunity for air to want to raise turkey started as a key Muslim power a vital Mideast player\nOr it would if that happened to be something of a jolt to U.S foreign policy though I mean turkey could never replace Saudi Arabia is us partner in confronting Iran for instance so it's not clear this will fundamentally altered the regional power structure but people will be watching it closely\nNPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul Peter

hundreds of thousands of people took the streets of London recently to demand what they call the people's vote on Brexit they want to vote again\nAt the same time prime minister Theresa May is trying to complete breakfast and she is in some political danger members of her own conservative party are said to be plotting against are forcing some and the opposition Labour Party to defend her ears ... shadow bread it here's cure storm or the shadow breakfast administer\nSome of the court some comments about farmers to this weekend attributed to conserve the country's former ministers are nothing short of discourse [noise]\nNPR's London correspondent Frank Langfitt is on the line Frank morning hey good morning Steve a is Britain any closer to actually completing this deal to leave your\nMost interesting Steve I'm answered she ... the prime minister may was in the house of commons yesterday she says nine to five percent of the deal is done but that remaining five percent is huge it's we've talked about how to avoid a border on the island of Ireland\nNow you know by leaving the use the u._k. creates a need for a border between Ireland matches up you know part of the a party you and Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. ah but they can't seem to work out an agreement on this and that's what's been holding everything up\nSo with all of this pressure on trees are made from within her own party for essentially not having a hard enough breakfast or not getting a deal done or just because conservatives in fight country survive\n[noise] um it was really tough language as you were hearing from cure storm or there was a talk of yesterday were against the last few days where even a member of her party said there's a meeting on Wednesday and she should bring her own news um it's it's very hard language isn't really actually kind of bothered people here in the United kingdom\nUm but the thing is what's been remarkable about a prime minister may is she's been out this now for two years and she's still standing a lot of people didn't think she'd be here um and even opponents I think have some grudging respect for her um her ability to sort of continue to dig punches\nA but continue to work on this and the other thing is there's nobody obvious to replace her\nAnd the the Tory party her party the conservatives are very concerned about a another election where they could lose the labor\nWhile I'm trying to figure this out Frank I'm just going across the political spectrum ... sort of in the middle trying to get a deal done there are people on her right who want it to be a harder deal that Britain that at all or independence from that you you but then there are these people on the left the hundreds of thousands that we mentioned who went out and protest and free peoples vote on Brexit what exactly would that be\nWell what they were talking about there is here with here that they basically says they say you know two thousand sixteen when this post was a first put to the people they feel they were sold a bill of goods or the Brexit fears that everything's gonna be great we're going to cut a great deal with the you were going to get a lot of money back to working to pay for healthcare\nNone of that to happen and Brexit negotiations or what British call a shambles in pretty much everybody agrees on that\nUm and so that's what they want but it's not likely the Theresa May is going to go for this because it's the last thing she wants to she has so much trouble politically in her party and beyond she certainly doesn't want to take this back to the people there's there's no going back because what you know I I really it's very unlikely at this point\nFrank thanks so much really appreciate it happy to do it Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt speaking with us from London\n[noise] All right now let's get some perspective on that highly publicized caravan that's heading for the United states\nThere are dramatic pictures showing about seven thousand people on the road out of violent Honduras and these are real families with real stories as we've reported on NPR but he's not as big an event is news stories might suggest a few thousand of those people may reach the EU\nS and if they're like people in past caravans they'll probably request legal entry but remember the U.S except for more than one million legal permanent residents every year\nThe reason you're hearing about the caravan at all because of the symbolic use being made to these very real human beings\nMigration activists hope to call attention to Central American suffering President Trump has used the caravan to stoke fear before an election he falsely spoke yesterday of plots to quote overwhelmed by the states you kept the caravan and the news by threatening to cut off aid to Central American countries\nNow they said that he threatened was actually designed to address the problem of migration but he was complaining about NPR's Michele Kelemen reports\nPresident Trump is sounding increasingly frustrated with how Central American countries are handling migration\nWater bottle of Honduras El Salvador's invested a lot of money every year we have a far as I say for us nothing he's\nNow warning those countries that he will start cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid though some lawmakers are pushing back\nLike cutting off you know write your faith rather than through here\nThat's Eliot Engel the ranking Democrat on the house committee on foreign affairs he says the president may be frustrated and angry about the caravan of migrants coming from those three countries and moving through Mexico but cutting aid will help\nBut just make the situation we're ... we should be working with these countries to try to uh to help alleviate some of the problems are driving people to come to the United states is the birthplace\nUSAID and the region is meant to do just that addressing the root causes of migration by improving security and rule of law last year according to the U.S global leadership coalition the U.S provided about eight hundred thirty eight million dollars in foreign assistance to Central America and Mexico\nAnd it is making a difference on the ground according to rich Jones who spoke to us from El Salvador where he works for Catholic Relief services\nThey history the economics and it's already dark of voting interconnected sorts very much in the interests of United States to see that developed and happened here that violent you reduce here because it's pushing people in Georgian irregular migration\nThe Trump Administration is reviewing all USAID making clear to countries that receive assistance that they should support U.S interests congressmen NGO points out that Congress holds the purse strings and he and his colleagues won't sit quietly bind if the administration tries to go around the will of Congress\nWe keep hearing from the administration that everybody has to obey whoa how about the president obeying the empowerment Control Act which prohibits the president from with jewelry or pounding money appropriated by Congress\nBut don't expect any quick moves on this as James Roberts of former foreign service officer now with the Heritage Foundation a conservative Washington think tank\nWhere dozens of programs in the three countries and they the Caribbean or not all of them are effective\nManner you're too small or to make a long term difference it's often difficult to measure them\nWhile Roberts would liked a thorough review he points out that it takes time and needs to be coordinated with Congress he also argues that it is in U.S interests to help these countries blue security and economic opportunities for people in the region to keep them home\nAnd cannot begin to solve all the problems of on crucial has to be from private sector ... it is a very small piece of the puzzle\nThe state department won't say whether it has received orders from the White House to cut aid officials ad that they believe Central American governments are discouraging their citizens from taking the dangerous journey north Michele ...

he's expected to give a press\nBriefing later detail how the U.S will pull out of a Cold War era nuclear arms treaty\nThe Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty prevented Russia and the U.S from having certain intermediate range missiles but President Trump says Russia is in violation of the agreement and it's worth noting the Obama administration said the same and two thousand fourteen\nAnd then yesterday President Trump said that the U.S in fact plans to expand its nuclear arsenal until other nations in his words come to their senses John ... is with me now he's the director of the nuclear Crisis Group and former special assistant to President Obama can morning sir\nGood morning I said we are hearing the term arms race thrown around is this language and are these developments warring team\nThey are um not only or the United states and Russia um vastly increasing their nuclear capabilities their missiles and numbers of nuclear weapons but with a longer engaging with each other which are operating in the lines and the\nThat we could calculate misunderstand or stumble into a crisis where nuclear weapons could be used as growing\nAre so so time to be very careful you served on the national Security Council under President Obama and and you were there when he accused Russia of violating this treaty the U.S did not withdraw then why not\n[noise] so we're very concerned that Russia's developed a small number of missiles which are banned by the treaty and deployed them but they haven't produced them in numbers that really threatening to change the military situation\nIn Europe we still have the upper hand through NATO Russia's building these the counter our conventional superiority our goal had and under the Obama administration to get Russia back into the treaty because it serves our interests I think the big difference between President Trump the President Obama is President Trump really doesn't have a strategy for bringing Russia back in\nA is really happy just to pull out a and John Bolton who was killed a number of arms control agreement over multiple stench of the government uh is very happy to go along with that strategy but there is NO PLAN for how you would prove American security once we do that\n[noise] what do you think Templeton is going to say today\n[noise] I think they're going to say you can't cheat on American get away with it I'm the same thing he told the north Koreans back in two thousand two um he's going to say this treaty no longer serves American interests because you cheated on it\nUm and we're going to go a merry way and do whatever you want you guys will just have to play catch up um and I think as we've seen a lot of it is more than capable not only playing catch up a building systems which undermine our security and we're going to be adding fuel to the arms race that were already in\nThat there's another nuclear arms reduction treaty that I Know a lot of people have an eye on the new start treaty which is due to expire in two thousand and Twenty one and yesterday John Bolton said the U.S has not finalized its position on extending new start briefly remind us what it is and what happens if it expires\nSo you start is the last a strategic arms control agreement in place in the United states and Russia it puts American inspectors on the ground in Russia and Russian inspectors on the ground in the United states and it limits both countries\nTo know more than Fifteen hundred and fifty nuclear weapons I'm\nFrom the ministry says there's office two years how they haven't figured out that this was in our

you might see as the ... the nobody was talking about vice presidents do nobody was talking about no deal whatsoever\nThe prime minister was trying to complete breakfast is in some political danger members of Theresa May's own conservative party are said to be plotting against are forcing some of the opposition Labour Party to defend her ears cure ... who's the shadow Brexit administer\nSome of the court some comments about farmers to this weekend a tribute to concern on these ... as a nothing short of discourse [noise]\nNPR's London correspondent Frank Langfitt is on the line Frank morning hey good morning Steve a is Britain any closer to actually completing this deal to leave your\nMost interesting Steve I'm prime minister may was in the house of commons yesterday she says Ninety five percent of the deal is done but that remaining five percent is huge so we've talked about how to avoid a border on the island of Ireland\nNow you know by leaving the you use the u._k. creates a need for a border between Ireland matches of you know part of the EU and Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. ah but they can't seem to work out an agreement on this and that's what's been holding everything up\nSo with all of this pressure on trees are made from within her own party for essentially not having a hard enough breakfast or not getting a deal done or just because conservatives unified country survive\n[noise] um it was really tough language as you were hearing from cure storm or there was a talk of yesterday were against the last few days where even a member of a party said there's a meeting on Wednesday and she should bring her own news um it's it's very hard language and really actually kind of bothered people here in the United kingdom\nUm but the thing is what's been remarkable about a prime minister may is she's been out this now for two years and she's still standing a lot of people didn't think she'd be here um and even opponents I think have some grudging respect for her um her ability to sort of continue to dig punches\nA but continue to work on this and the other thing is there's nobody obvious to replace her\nAnd the the Tory party for part of the conservatives are very concerned about a nother election where they could lose the labor\nWhile I'm trying to figure this out Frank I'm just going across the political spectrum ... sort of in the middle trying to get a deal done there are people on her right who want it to be a harder deal that Britain not at all or independence from that you but then there are these people on the left the hundreds of thousands that we mentioned who went out and protest it for A People's vote on Brexit what exactly would that be\nWell what they were talking about there is here with here that they basically said they say you know two thousand sixteen when this post was a first put to the people they feel they were sold a bill of goods or the Brexit fears that everything's gonna be great we're going to cut a great deal with the you were going to get a lot of money back to working to pay for healthcare\nNone of that to happen and Brexit negotiations or what British call a shambles in pretty much everybody agrees on that\nUm and so that's what they want but it's not likely the Theresa May is going to go for this because it's the last thing she wants to she has so much trouble politically in her party and beyond she certainly doesn't want to take this back to the people there's there's no going back as what you know I I really it's very unlikely at this point Steve\nFrank thanks so

an event as news stories might suggest a few thousand of those people may reach the U.S and if they're like people in past caravans\nThey'll probably request legal entry\nBut remember the U.S except for more than one million legal permanent residents every year\nThe reason you're hearing about the caravan at all because of the symbolic use being made of these very real human beings\nMigration activists hope to call attention to Central Americans suffering President Trump has used the caravan to stoke fear before an election he falsely spoke yesterday of plots to quote overwhelm the United states he kept the caravan in the news by threatening to cut off aid to Central American countries\nNow the aid that he threatened was actually designed to address the problem of migration but he was complaining about NPR's Michele Kelemen reports\nPresident Trump is sounding increasingly frustrated with how Central American countries are handling migration\n... Honduras El Salvador them a lot of money every year we give a far as I did nothing for us nothing he's\nNow warning those countries that he will start cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid and some lawmakers are pushing back\nBy cutting off you know write your faith and that's the president's doing here\nThat's Eliot Engel the ranking Democrat on the house committee on foreign affairs he says the president may be frustrated and angry about the caravan of migrants coming from those three countries and moving through Mexico but cutting aid won't help\nWhat just make the situation we're we we should be working with these countries to try to ah help alleviate some of the problems are driving people to come to the United states in the first by\nUSAID and the region is meant to do just that addressing the root causes of migration by improving security and rule of law\nLast year according to the U.S global leadership coalition the U.S provided amount eight hundred thirty eight million dollars in foreign assistance to Central America and Mexico and it is making a difference on the ground according to rich Jones who spoke to us from El Salvador where he works for Catholic Relief\nServices they history yet\nAnd it's already dark of voting interconnected George very much in the answer to the United states if you ... developed an ... year that violence you reduce here because\nIt's pushing people and the Georgian irregular migration\nThe Trump Administration is reviewing all USAID making clear to countries that receive assistance that they should support U.S interests congressmen angle points out that Congress holds the purse strings and he and his colleagues won't sit quietly by if the administration tries to go around the will of Congress\nWe keep hearing from you missed ration that everybody has to obey the rules out about the president or ... pounds Control Act which prohibits the president from ripped story or pounding buddy appropriated by Congress\nBut don't expect any quick moves on this as James Roberts a former foreign service officer now with the Heritage Foundation a conservative Washington think tank\nThere those programs in record numbers and they the Caribbean or not all of them are stricter men or you're too small in order to make a long term difference [noise] it's often difficult to measure gun\nWhile Roberts would liked a thorough review he points out that it takes time and needs to be coordinated with Congress he also argues that it is in us interest to help these countries moose security and economic opportunities for people in the region to keep them home\nAnd come up begin to solve all the problems of countries where there has to be from private sector investment it is a very small piece of the puzzle\nThe state department won't say whether it has received orders from the White House to cut aid officials ad that they believe Central American governments are discouraging their citizens from taking the dangerous journey north Michele ...

nuclear arms treaty\nThen Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty prevented Russia and the U.S from having certain intermediate range missiles but President Trump says Russia is in violation of the agreement it's worth noting the Obama administration said the same and two thousand fourteen\nAnd then yesterday President Trump said that the U.S in fact plans to expand its nuclear arsenal until other nations in his words come to their senses John wolf style is with me now he's the director of the nuclear Crisis Group and former special assistant to President Obama can morning sir good morning\nI said we are hearing the term arms race thrown around is this language and are these developments warring team\nThey are um not only are the United states and Russia um vastly increasing their nuclear capabilities their missiles and numbers of nuclear weapons\nBut we're no longer engaging with each other we're sort of operating in the blind and the chances that we could miss calculate misunderstand or stumble into a crisis where nuclear weapons could be used as growing\nAll right so so time to be very careful you served on the national Security Council under President Obama in ... you were there when he accused Russia of violating this treaty the U.S did not withdraw then why not\n[noise] so we're very concerned that Russia has developed a small number of missiles which are banned by the treaty and deployed them but they haven't produced them in numbers that really threatened to change the military situation in Europe we still have the upper hand through NATO Russia's building these the counter our conventional superiority\nOr goal had been under the Obama administration to get Russia back into the treaty because it serves our interests\nI think the big difference between President Trump and President Obama\nAs President Trump really doesn't have a strategy for bringing in Russia back in a is really happy just to pull out a and John Bolton who was killed a number of arms control agreements over multiple stunts and the government is very happy to go along and pursue that strategy but there is NO PLAN for how you improve American security once we do that\n[noise] what do you think John ... is going to say today\n[noise] I think John Boehner is going to say you can't cheat on American get away with it I'm the same thing he told the north Koreans back in two thousand and two um he's going to say this treaty no longer serves America interest because you cheated on it um and we're going to go or merry way and build whatever missiles we want you guys will just have to play catch up\nUm and I think as we've seen a lot of ... more than capable not only playing catch up with a building systems which undermine our security and we're going to be adding fuel to this arms race that were already in\nThere is another nuclear arms reduction treaty that I Know a lot of people have an eye on the new start treaty which is due to expire in two thousand and Twenty one and yesterday John Bolton said the U.S has not finalized its position on extending new start briefly remind us what it is and what happens if it expires\nSo new start is the last a strategic arms control agreement in place between the United states and Russia it puts American inspectors on the ground in Russia in Russian inspectors on the ground in the United states\nAnd it limits both countries to know more than Fifteen hundred and fifty nuclear weapons [noise] I'm from the ministry she has been his office two years how they haven't figured out that this was in our interest is beyond me\nBut if it goes away we will be looking at a Russian program that grows or even more than it has a and we will be likely having to increase our own spending a and our own nuclear
