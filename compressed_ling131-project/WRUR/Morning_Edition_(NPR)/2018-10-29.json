the the focus of the media on the pipe bomber\nWhat I mean this this is not a president who really seems to embrace the role of consoled her and she so maybe some of what you're saying is is not that surprising what what do we see from from the decision of his\nWell it's not surprising he doesn't see his role\nAs previous presidents have as a moral leader he doesn't seem to think his role is to sues\nAnd he'll after a violent incident like this and this really isn't in his political repertoire you know words really matter a president's words matter more than anyone else's because he has the biggest megaphone and he has the most moral authority if he chooses to embrace it\nBut these are the moments when the president has in the past done them worst with the public at large his approval ratings dropped after Charlottesville in his famous comments about how both ... they were good people on both sides\nAnd the ... the kind of scorched earth political rhetoric\nThe belittling and demonizing of his opponents that really works with his base and he even asked his supporters at a rally over the weekend do you want me to tone it down is that okay and they all said no\n... well I

among many things that the bows and arrows or an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled the country for just over two decades and what what\nWhat conclusions can we draw from from this moment in his victory\nI think David we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' policy\nWho govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade ... sick of corruption that sick of crime and the un for the restoration of national pride and I took that ... you know helps explain why both NATO defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... she's so comprehensively\nI should say though that both NATO himself insists the survival of democracy is not an issue here last night again he promised to defend the constitution but he has said a lot of alarm bells ringing I mean the level of Atkinson was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court said\nEnough to his he read how puff of the constitution to report is\nThe need for the future president to respect democracy and the rule of law yeah it's unusual\nAh there's another thing both ... this record of making sexist and racist homophobic remarks and you know you'd think that would have been seriously damaging for him but\nHis supporters tend to dismiss these jokes as as a joke so oh they blame it on fake news all they just say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent ... corrupt\nFor example here's Kevin ... without a lawyer aged forty two who I spoke to outside both not his home in Rio de ...\nHe's rainy on that's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe this I think he really puts dye\nOkay feel so there's a supporter of both in our oh um I mean you say that many people are overlooking the potential threat to democracy that some of his critics say he is saying that he's going to fight corruption is going to fight violent crime a lot of Brazilians really care about those things that have a plan\nWhat he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use lethal force against suspects and that's already extremely coming here especially in the poor mostly black neighborhoods where there's a war over the narcotics trade\nLast year there were six sixty four thousand homicides and Brazil and there's an epidemic of robberies and against people against banks trucks and Brazilians a sick of it and I think that's a big reason why so many voted for both NATO\nLast night I visited Brazil's largest ... ... people that are very worried as I found out when I spoke to Luis Fernando ...

love living there everyone I spoke to said they love it there\nAnd this has been a time for them to to mourn and to try to manage this I understand there was an interfaith service last night\nYeah I mean the night of the shooting there was an impromptu vigil in the center of town and people came out just to be together a last night there was a huge gathering in an auditorium\nI'm On a at a a soldier's memorial at this grand auditorium there with a with a Lincoln's Gettysburg Address engraved in the wall behind all the speakers but there was a Baptist choir singing um local faith leaders from a Christian Muslim Jewish\nA faith that was packed inside and then when I stepped outside a I there were thousands more people standing in the rain or just flowing down the steps under a thousand different colored umbrellas and they all said they were there just to show solidarity to show the Jewish community that they weren't\nAlone I Want to call attention to one thing you mentioned there you noted that Muslims were among those offering condolences to Jews are\nYeah there there were I mean people have all faiths were coming out to uh to just say we are with you uh we're so sorry about what happened but we won't let you go through this alone\nSo you also alluded quilt to an impromptu vigil on Saturday Night and there was a lot of commentary on social media about something that people chanted they chanted on Saturday Night and the candlelight vote vote vote vote in what way are people in Pittsburgh connecting this shooting to politics\nI mean I think people are have been unafraid in this community to just say we think this is because of the political discourse I've heard that a lot of people aren't saying specific politicians names all that often but they're being very clear that they think the\nThe political discourse has descended and the voices that used to be marginalized there there's a lot people used to be on the fringe are now right in the middle of the conversation and and people here are mad about it um they want to do something people talked about a yeah getting out the vote they talked about trying to do something about guns\nAnd okay something about guns which gets to another question what did you hear from some Pittsburgh residents anyway about what they want to be different\nI mean you've heard them you could hear the mayor talking about uh wanting commonsense changes wanting to make sure that they talked about assault rifles that no one could sort of step into a house of worship with a a weapon of war and and kill so many people\nSo

Mexico's ambassador to the United states ambassador to morning or\nGood morning Steve I Want to begin with the facts here seven thousand or so people which is a lot of people looks like a lot on TV but I Do know it's part of this much larger somewhat ordinary flow of migrants so how serious situation is this the view of your government\nWhat what we're facing your Stevie ... humanitarian crisis the Mexican government response has been basically two things urging be both winter in compliance with immigration law to Mexico and then F offering refugees stop tools\nTo all those people from Central America to requested including health services education and an identification what the Mexican Government wants to assure is that movement on whatever migration fixed place it's legal it's safe and it's sort of\nThe impression from here was that the migrants did not in the fall of Mexicans Mexico's immigration laws there was an effort to stop them at the border with Guatemala and and the and the government more or less let them in is that right\nHave a meeting trying to avoid at all costs violence in the border unfortunately some of the people in the care of and have been very violent against the forward the even though that they have offered the possibility of entering in compliance with immigration and refugee start social police very seem pretty to uphold our laws there's for us\nSense of the human rights commission and ... of Mexico and also several NGOs that can testify to the fact that the police has acted appropriately but nevertheless we want to make sure that our laws are enforced\nYou offer them refugee status I Believe you said and yeah the leader of this group seemed from terrorists Without Borders that is involved in organizing this caravan seemed dubious of that offer and indicated their suspicion that the majority of people who are invited to apply for asylum but ultimately be rejected and deported is that actually what tends to happen with\nA sign of out of uh the the number that we have is our on three thousand five hundred people are out of those um we have one thousand eight hundred and Ninety five people that have requested a ... percent that a request for refugee status\nOne thousand four hundred and thirty five of them are being processed and about a four hundred and twenty two have actually been repatriated to the states so right now it's unclear I think that a lot of them will in fact end up requesting to stop those because it's a very generous offer on the part of a Mexican Government\nI'm just going through those numbers first you said thirty five hundred you believe this caravan to be about thirty five hundred people\nYes it's more of that some of the numbers that have been a a thrown out there that the official number for us it's the old around three thousand of them are in the states of ...\nThe carbon was a little bit bigger but I'm Around two thousand I mention of for foreign original coastal five thousand have already a percent that their request for refugee status\nOr this is important in front of us perspective ambassador because you're saying the caravan of smaller than reported and it's getting smaller over time as some of them except refugee status there aren't actually that many people heading for the U.S anymore\nWell as some of them are cheerleading tend to get to the U.S and we have close cooperation with U.S authorities to handle this\nIn the best possible way but I Do have to say that the official figures of the people that are still in the car to have such\nIs around three thousand five hundred a little bit less perhaps\nAnd around two thousand of the original group have already requested a refugee status in Mexico and this the situation continues to evolve and uh obviously being monitored by Mexican authorities and asks appropriate in coordination with the U.S authorities again we want to assure\nWe have a humanitarian crisis in our hands but we want to assure that are these the scandal that migration is scandal legally safe and orderly\n... thanks very much for the time really appreciate it on the contrary Steve thank you for the space around them

of the Republican election campaign though it is still far from the U.S border the caravan is on Mexican soil and our next guest represents the country with responsibility for just now Iran and we'll go to Europe says Mexico's ambassador to the United states ambassador to morning\nGood morning Steve I Want to begin with the facts here seven thousand or so people which is a lot of people looks like a lot on TV but I Do know it's part of this much larger somewhat ordinary flow of migrants so how serious situation is this the view of your government\nWhat what we're facing here Steve is really a humanitarian crisis the Mexican government response has been basically two things are urging people to winter in compliance with immigration law to Mexico and then F offering refugee status to all those people from Central America to request that including\nHealth services education and an identification what the Mexican Government is one to ensure is that movement and whatever migration takes place it's legal it's safe and it sort of\nThe impression from here was that the migrants did not in the end followed Mexicans Mexico's immigration laws there was an effort to stop them at the border with Guatemala and and the and the government more or less let the man is that right\nWe have ... trying to avoid at all costs violence in the border unfortunately some of the people in the care of and have been very violent against authority even do that they have offered the possibility of entering in compliance with immigration and refugee status or police there seem to uphold our laws\nThere are ... of the human rights commission and ... of Mexico and also several NGOs that can testify to the fact that the police has acted appropriately but nevertheless we want to make sure that our laws are enforced you\nOffered them refugee status I Believe you said and yeah the leader of this group seemed from terrorists Without Borders that is involved in organizing this caravan seemed dubious of that offer and indicated their suspicion that the majority of people who are invited to apply for asylum but ultimately be rejected and deported is that actually what tends to happen with a sign of\nOut of uh the the number that we have is our on three thousand five hundred people are out of those um we have one thousand eight hundred and Ninety five people that have requested a percent that a request for refugee status\nOne thousand four hundred and thirty five of them are being processed and about a four hundred and twenty two have actually been repatriated to the states so right now it's unclear I think that a lot of them will in fact end up requesting to stop those because it's a very generous offer on the part of a Mexican ...\nI'm just going through those numbers first you said thirty five hundred you believe this caravan to be about thirty five hundred people\nYes it's more that some of the numbers that have been a a thrown out there that the official number for us it's the old around three thousand of them are in the states of ...\nThe carbon was a little bit bigger but I'm Around two thousand us I mention of for far no regional coastal five thousand have already a percent that their requests for refugee status\nOr this is important in front of us perspective investor because you're saying the caravan of smaller than reported and it's getting smaller over time as some of them except refugee status there aren't actually that many people heading for the U.S anymore\nWell as some of them are cheerleading tend to get to the U.S and we have close cooperation with U.S authorities to handle this\nIn the best possible way but I Do have to say that the official figures of the people that are still in the car to such east around three thousand five hundred a little bit less perhaps and around two thousand of the original group have already requested a refugee status in Mexico and the ... continues to evolve\nAnd uh obviously being monitored by Mexican authorities and asks appropriate in coordination with U.S authorities again we want to assure we have a humanitarian crisis in our hands but we weren't too sure that these these ... that migration is scandal legally safe and ordered\nInvestor thanks very much for the time really appreciate it on the contrary Steve thank you for this space around I'm Olga terrorists as Mexico's

decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to
