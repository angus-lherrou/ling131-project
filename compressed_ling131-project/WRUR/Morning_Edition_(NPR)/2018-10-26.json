NPR's medical months and our thanks to medical You're welcome art which I Want to get your thoughts on what to medical was saying because you have been in Texas for the last week talking to voters\nRight let's talk about Texas I Am currently in Del Rio which is\nJust next to lake ... on the Rio Grande river which separates the U.S and Mexico and this is the last stop on a week long road trip that we've done through the twenty third congressional district here in Texas this is one of the state's only true swing districts\nTotally fascinating place and well that sounds about a third of the entire U.S Mexico border\nOkay so this is a massive district and I wonder as you've been knocking doors talking to people does any of what to medical was just saying line up with what you've been hearing from people particularly from women\nRight so he mentioned the power women so we wanted to talk to some especially in the suburbs around San Antonio suburban women are really going to be influential in these midterms we met a woman named Janet Ogle for ... uh she like a lot of white liberal women in this country said that Donald Trump's election\nJust devastated her a and really caused her to become politically active in a completely new way now she registers people to vote she volunteers for democratic candidates I'm and she is committed in a way she never was before let's listen to a little bit\nI Wish I'd done more earlier for progressive candidates I just didn't think it was so necessary now I Do ...\nSo at the same time or I should know we also talked with one of Janet's neighbors a Republican who really likes what President Trump is doing in fact she was going to speak with us a on Monday we had this all scheduled and she had to reschedule so that she could road trip to Houston with her friends to see Donald Trump do his thing at a Houston rally\n[laughter] All right and I know that while you been down there you also been looking at particular economic factors in these places and you you visited a place that's experiencing something like an oil boom\nSomething I mean totally like boom I'm this is a place called ... Texas\nIt's really benefited from all the fracking that's been happening in oil country I'm just to give you a sense of how the place has grown in twenty tend the population was around eight thousand people today city officials don't even know what the real popular while they speculate that because of all the temporary oil workers who are there\nAre there could be up to fifty thousand people living there at any given time uh which has put a massive strain on the town because it ... it all happened so quickly they haven't been able to really keep up there's not enough food on the grocery store shelves they don't have enough restaurants\nBut what's really interesting is how it seems to be changing the politics of the place most of the population is Hispanic traditionally they've been Democrats\nBased on our conversations there that could actually be shifting a because these all these new people are coming in with new viewpoints people who gives the party in power credit for the current economic boom I Want to play a clip of from a conversation we had with a guy named John packed\nOf a double bus our from ... of struggle for a long time and it's come out here and I'm I'm not struggling more water was\nDoes it feel like it's going to dry up anytime says [noise] along Trump's all feel good rub drunk driving\nIs run the Trump trainer and trains pretty happy about the economy credits the president clearly a lot of people here feel that way\nAnd of course immigration a huge issue where you are\nRight um you would think so anyway we're actually at a part of the border that's pretty quiet we're just a few miles from a coon yeah Mexico\nThese two communities Del Rio in a ... totally entwined like is the case in a lot of border cities we met people who cross the border on a daily basis to go to the dentist I buy the groceries\nUm they don't see it as a crisis here uh and opinions about President Trump and his immigration policies are pretty much split in a partisan way what people here do agree on and we're talking about Democrats we spoke with an Republicans\nIs that a wall the idea of building a border wall is not going to fix the country's broken immigration system\n... the last question Democrats have been looking for years to turn Texas blue I think it's going to happen\nRight so we've heard a lot about the so called blue wave on the congressional side the incumbent Republican will Hurd has an advantage to recent poll says he's up Fifteen points against his Democratic challenger Gina Ortiz Jones on the Senate side the Democrat Beto O'Rourke is given Ted Cruz for his money recent polling has him down five points against crews\nAre Ted Cruz's fighting for every vote though he is going to be here in Del Rio next week something people here say hasn't happened for a long long time\nRachel Martin in Del Rio Texas thanks very reporting Rachel you about [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThis is NPR News\nFor your public radio station comes from our members and from certified documents\nStructured recycling committed to safeguarding business sensitive information to document shredding media destruction and product incineration eleven thirty three Emerson street for\nOnline at C.

Dominique Oh hi Rachel so I Am at this moment looking up at the vast Texas guy and it feels pretty far away from Washington DC and politics\nBut something that's really nice um but let's dig into the poll\nFindings eh let's start with the president and Republicans they saw bumping enthusiasm among the base during a justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing did it last\n[noise] not really you know the Kavanaugh factor appears to actually have faded as a big motivating issue for voters Republicans have maintained their level of enthusiasm but with the pollsters tell us is that that is more likely because it's October the closer you get to the election there's a natural rise\nA and when you look at Kavanaugh specifically the number of people saying he's motivating their vote has gone down between both parties including Republicans\nAnd we see the president's approval rating back down to thirty nine percent we see Democrats opening up a gap of ten points now on the question of whether you want to have a Democrat or Republican in control of Congress and your district\nI feel like you've been on the program several times over the past few months talking about the importance of women in these midterm elections a President Trump is struggling on that front as the polls show that he's making any inroads with female voters\nNot at all at one of our pollster said that it's really all about the gender gap here in twenty Eighteen or they said twenty ten and twenty four team are really about men who are motivated to take back the house and Senate upset with President Obama but\nIn twenty eight peanuts about women who are motivated against President Trump we saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating to preference for control of Congress and\nIn particular when you look at white college educated women they give the president the lowest approval ratings of almost any group and are among the highest to believe that these elections are very important so they're very motivated ...\nReally interesting because we did meet a woman here Janet ... in the suburbs of San Antonio\nSame thing um she's a liberal she's a Democrat but the election of Donald Trump a shattered her and she's become politically motivated in a in a totally new way so we've definitely seen that play out here what about issues the medical I mean it does a poll addressed what are the issues that are that are going to motivate people to turn out this year\nWell you know first and foremost a driving factor in this election as President Trump two thirds say that the president will be a factor in their vote that's twenty points higher than in twenty fourteen when the same question was asked about President Obama and that's the year Republicans took back the Senate but when we does when we drove in specifically at some of the issues that are important to people\nThe top issue of course was jobs in the economy followed by health care and immigration all of which we've heard a lot about in this election but when you break it down by party that's where you see some real differences Republicans jobs in the economy and immigration far and away the biggest issues nothing else comes close\nFor Democrats health care and climate change a notice I didn't mention those tax cuts Republicans hope to run on those but they haven't broken through more people say they'd be motivated to vote for a Democrat because of those tax cuts\nAnd when you ask people about the rising federal deficit sixty percent including a plurality of Republicans\nStay in order to address the deficit they'd prefer to roll back tax cuts rather than okay entitlements and fears of medical months in our\nAcross the Midwest it's grain harvesting time and this year there are three big problems one is wet fields too low crop prices exacerbated by trade war that decimated the Chinese market for soybeans and third some twists from the new tax law Amy Mayer reports from Iowa Public radio\nAnd ran and harvest leaving in ...

gone as far as the same time ... view of it I was ...\nYears you know it's going to be here and that you feel bad and she feels\nThat way because I feel like this little ... you know that's not right and that's a vitamin solving long drawn out for like ... or ... one of these\nI mean this is fascinating she is being interrogated by a police officer who's telling him it's good to hear that you feel bad what does that tell you\nWell I mean what really that shows you how good Larry Nassar is at manipulating\nOther people and and how overwhelming on an individual level\nThat can feel you know what is more likely in this situation that one young woman as far as this detective is aware as miss understood a valid medical technique\nOr you know this Olympic doctor who's been doing this for so long and who's so many people love and he's the best at this that he abused one girl I mean it's just hard on a human level to not get sucked into this kind of manipulation\nThis is Lindsey he does this over and over I mean we've given you one example Noel but he does this in a multitude of ways over this two and a half hour long interview and he also layers and I teach this I lecture on this\nAny sort of doubt you might have had about his techniques and his legitimacy he's really doing everything they can to build that up this is Kate again\nHe gets cleared to go back to work after that they put him back into the clinic and we know that at least Seventy women and girls say that they were abused after that twenty fourteen case and and when he returned to treating patients\nSeventy yeah eventually another interrogation and this interrogation leads to his arrest I Know you have some tape of that but tell me about it as well\nSo this is an interrogation from twenty sixteen or another accuser has come forward that same her name is Rachel ... and she also comes forward publicly in a a newspaper article in the Indianapolis Star\nAnd she also decides to call police about a case of abuse that had happened to her Fifteen Years prior and this call goes to a different detective at MSU police detective injury among offered\nAnd she definitely takes a different approach\nOr she is working ... name of his own\nGoals you know I wouldn't have been over ... characters or was used my motives are losing good if I have ... is not a huge pushing off to her\nLook I I'm again this\nWas something that you're just trying to me is very different than how she describes in her ...\nWhat is the important difference in this interrogation why does this interrogation lead to an arrest or the other one did not\nI mean to put it probably to simply does that give them an for OCD comes in believing Rachel she also has the benefit of knowing that this is the second complaint\nAnd Rachel has brought a lot of evidence with her that this abuse happened journal entries medical records\nAnd so India believes Rachel and she's able to go into this interview and put the pressure on Nassau are\nIt's not about well why did it take so long for this woman to come forward or maybe she was confused it's very much Nasser needs to be able to answer very simple questions and you start to hear

actually\nYou know you're just saying that you know you you you um [noise]\nAnd when we interviewed this detective Andrea I'm an for one of whom she talks about looking back at this interview is that she herself\nWas kind of unsure why NASA our we have so much trouble answering such a simple questions like why would you have interaction during a medical appointment\nI was thinking should ask questions a different way and that pertains to answer and then I thought that was his answer he doesn't have one he doesn't have an explanation\nHe doesn't have an explanation so you guys in your ...\nCan you learn to that it does make a big difference if if police if parents start by believing the victim worth the very least hearing the victim out\nYeah well I mean fundamentally this is how guys like this operate as they know that you don't want to believe that somebody you love and trust and who seems like just as great guy\nCould be hurting somebody as humans were not good at thinking that can happen to the people that we work with or who are family but the reality is that guys like ... don't operate in a vacuum it it takes a lot of people to be manipulated and to fail\nThese women

C. and I'm Rachel Martin in Del Rio Texas we have been on a road trip through the tax is twenty third congressional district district which is actually a rare swing district in his very red state it covers a long stretch of\nLand that goes from outside El Paso all the way to San Antonio and we've been visiting different corners of the district talking to voters about what's going through their minds ahead of the mid term elections\nImmigration has become a huge issue leading into these midterms across the country President Trump has seized on to the issue during rallies I had a voting day including the rally that he held here in Houston earlier in the week\nBut we wanted to know how the immigration issue is playing here along the border right now at this very moment I'm looking out over the natural barrier that separates the U.S and Mexico\nIt's lake ... died on the Rio Grande river ... means friendship in Spanish which is appropriate because like other American border towns life in Del Rio is woven together with the town on the other side in Mexico and they'll reuse case it's the city of Kenya Mexico\nFamily and this border this is Amanda ... her family has lived around Del Rio for generations\nAnd our house is just a five minute drive to the border and on the other side is a coon yeah I don't look down to them and they're equal because I\nGrew up with them but you still don't want them to come here I wanted to come here but I Want them to come here the right way Amanda lives with her longtime partner Ralph also grow up they're like you're going to be like some tea okay either they would be in a hot humid or highly\nYou're also demand across into a coon yeah a couple of times a week what takes you to\nI have friends yes and I have um I go shopping over there I go to the dentist over there I buy groceries over their\nAmanda has sympathy for people who are seeking a better life in the U.S [noise] but you also has a lot of stories about people she says are gaming the system she tells me she worked for a time at the local jail where she talked with people who got caught coming over the border\nTo fight to keep it all because I get my teeth you know my medicine\nSo you think there are too many illegal immigrants who are exploiting the system yeah\nThat's the part that I don't think it makes me very angry\nWhat do you make of talk from President Trump when he says if he wants to build a wall that would separate Del Rio from Mexico now\n... ... ... when they say separate or what there is a law that I'm thinking of anybody backing you what you can get through\nNow to be clear in parts of the border near Del Rio there is not all there is a big black fence and in other areas there is no manmade barrier at all\nIt's it's it's ... it's a rugged terrain\nThis is Joe Frank martini as he's been the sheriff here for the past ten years he is a tall man with weathered skin and white hair and a voice that says he's seen an awful lot in these harsh conditions\nPeople are prepared for that we've had those instances where you know people have died out there when the last six months of that we've had three\nOver the past year he's taken an assortment of lawmakers from Washington DC on a tour of the border just like he's doing for us today we drive along the dirt road that runs parallel to Mexico\nThat's one good before he bought his starts talking about the border wall\nThe new to see it in this natural state people up north like with this war zone and her\nAnd it's actually not\nTo me before we start throwing money at a problem you have to do in front of the problem\nTo him the problem is an immigration system that's been broken for fifty years and he says it can't be fixed with a wall because for starters where would you put it Jeff Martinez drives us up the road where there is no more fence\nInstead there are these houses along the river bank he pulled up on a vacant lot between two homes you know the owner he tells us it's no problem there ... sheriffs\nThat'll do further as much as\nJust across this little if even a river this looks like a week of increased the river and remember how many feet are we talking\nAbout ah we're probably talking what three hundred feet four hundred feet [noise]\nI mean that's the hard to swim across now so a ninth someone can just swim across just walk up here just like we didn't walk to that road mhm\nI asked sheriff Martinez how the immigration debate is affecting people's politics here\nAnd like other folks we spoke to in Del Rio he said it's not top of mind for residents this is a relatively quiet part of the border the people who do sneak in get out quickly and moved to a bigger cities\nAnd even the Republican congressman will Hurd has spoken out against the wall he's facing a democratic challenger named Gina Ortiz Jones who's trying to tie her to President Trump but this is a swing district and heard has positioned himself as a moderate and by doing so he's won the support people like Jeff Martinez\nWill come to an air of human in this same tour alike worries you feel that our officers are he's been an advocate for us\nAnd this is interesting because sheriff Martinez like most elected officials here is a Democrat and even though we didn't vote for President Trump and has some issues with his policies and his rhetoric Martinez is pleased about one thing\nThis administration the sure have been invited to the table previous administrations\nWe weren't or we were older but it'll leaving the bones were blown\nUp like the to solve the immigration issue the sure to be able to return to gender just go to though because\nHe knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very long time which brings us back to the original question what about that well\nSee my idea was to you can control with technology cameras a sort of putting the physical structure because we are you going to put it\nHe points to the houses along the river on the U.S side of the border\nAre you going to put these people and let you go we're going to put these people in the wrong side of the wall\nMeanwhile people like Amanda year a block out the noise about the wall she will vote for the incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Republican congressman will Hurd and she will keep going back and forth across the border in her backyard\nAs she did with us from Madison and just like that were in Mexico city the exchange places around here where the dollar exchange so this is how can we walked down the main streets filled with bars [noise]\nAnd stores selling all kinds of Mexican handicraft we saw that one storefront where a woman is sewing handmade dolls stressed and colorful dresses\nFishy is actually making them if not mushy and they're not coming from China these are authentic maybe they can\nCheck out his language and then with a smile she nudges her long black hair over her shoulder and waved goodbye and I had I guess in her white SUV and weights in the long line to cross back over into the U.S [noise] she'll return in a few days though she has dresses that need tailoring [noise]\nFrom Del Rio Texas

ideas are quantifiable can be put into calculations showing how technological bright ideas boost the economy or fix the environment\nThat used to seem crazy to many other economists who tend to focus more on concrete things which is which is coming out of factories not seemingly mushy things like ideas\nDr Paul Romer chews on all sorts of interesting matters such as the difference between blind optimism I things will be fine you'll magically have enough money for retirement versus what is called conditional optimism retirement will be fine if we have a savings plan\nRobbers and economists to New York university's stern school of business the other day he got the news that he was one of two winners of the Nobel Prize in economics stuffed rubber welcome to the program glad to be here\nI mean since you won the prize the other day I've been trying to catch up and read up on what you call conditional optimism trying to understand it better this isn't just rose colored glasses aw shucks technology progresses be patient a lot of this gets worked out\nCan you give me a sense of what the nature of the conditional optimism is\nYou think about the fears people had a century ago about mechanization in the way this was going to destroy jobs the complacent attitude would have been to say\nOh it'll all work itself out everybody will be fine that's that would have been the wrong attitude what we had was this sense of we've got to do the right thing the twentieth century\nThere was a high school movement that said we've got to get everybody up to the level of high school education\nTo be able to do the new kinds of jobs that are that are coming so if conditional on doing the right thing in that case a big investment education everything turned out better for everybody but if you just are complacent say uh it'll work itself out\nOr you're you're not going to be happy with the outcome\nYou know it's funny you should mention that historical example a crucial story we continue to follow here is what technology will do for but also due to the labor force\nWith artificial intelligence automation robots are entering everyone says highly disruptive period but I Do talk to people who say don't worry about it as a matter of policy it's worked itself out in the past does your notion of conditional optimism\nHelp us with what tech will do to the workforce this time around\nAbsolutely and there's a cautionary message here because people can look at the past and say hey you know the twenty century turned out fine so there's no problem it turned out fine because we did things to make sure it turned out fine and so there's no basis for complacency in the success record that we can see when we look back\nThere are new things we need to do in the labor market in education and didn't thinking about the future of energy sources as long as we do those things everything really can turned out fine\nNow many of our listeners will know that your dad Roy Romer was the governor of Colorado for more than a decade you probably think of a pretty good sense of how politicians chick but help me understand that you don't think that economists like yourself should be out there actually lobbying for the policies that they believe in\nOne of the most powerful insights an economics is this idea of a division of labor you do the thing you're good at other people do something else that they're good at the net effect is better for everybody\nSo there's a process that involves a kind of political entrepreneurship where you know someone like my dad or any other politician builds coalitions they tried to make a case for some kind of decision\nThat's something that that I could see he was very good at but I didn't want to compete with him because he was so good at it so I wanted to go off and do something else what we can do as economists and scientists more generally uh say\nWe're not going to join the fight between the different sides that's got to play out but all sides will be better off if you start from an accurate sense of what's true and our job is to be the ones who can say here's what here's what we know and there's some things that you could try but you will ... will you are the ones who make the decision\nAnd before we go duck to remember at UC Berkeley when they win a Nobel Prize they get an assigned parking spot did NYU give you

the whole everyone sort of keep to themselves which actually suits are just fine she filled up water bottles and we headed out for a walk we go on strike yeah actually for this way in many ways Janet represents a lot of white liberal women\nWhen Trump was elected and I kind of fell apart and to get back together I actually did a lot of reading of you know OK Howard how to survive this and the advice was get busy\nFor her that included volunteering for a group she cared a lot about Planned Parenthood\nAnd I actually got a pink Cape my first year\nBecause I put in more hours energy and people could me about it much and you don't have to wear the Cape again today\nJanet follows politics more closely than she ever did before she registers people to vote she donates to campaigns she even less campaign staffers stay in our house so it was it an overstatement to say that it has been a political awakening\nFor you know I've always been aware of politically but I've also been complacent\nAnd look around wearing this relatively affluent area I got mine you know I don't really have to worry that much um and I hate that about my history I Wish I'd done more earlier\nFor progressive candidates I just didn't think it was so necessary now I Do\nWe keep walking around the island in the middle of the street where the cactus is are painted to look like pumpkins for Halloween so if you like we can cut right through here to my house yeah let's do that in fact there are a lot of campaign signs in Janet's front yard all for Democrats including Beto O'Rourke who's running a surprisingly competitive race against Republican\nIncumbent Senator Ted Cruz Janet's not the only ONE Campaign signs have stirred up an Internet scene battle on the Web site next door it all started when one guy said someone had stolen his Ted Cruz sign\nThen he and others on the site talked about reading their signs with the power record to electric you the next person who tried Janet read the comments off the thread\nHere's what I wouldn't want to kill them but I Would share the video of them being shocked until the break or kicked good for you it just goes on\nFor her crew supporters are in the same camp as Trump supporters and she just can't understand where they're coming from\nI think Trump spaces last I think um when I hear them described as a cult that makes sense to me from what I've heard and seen that what ever he says it's fine whoever he hurts assign\nGen its neighbor Ellen Pfeifer is a big fan of Donald Trump Hi Ellen thank you so much for doing this absolutely I'm excited we were supposed to talk with her the same day we saw Janet but then Trump came to Texas for a rally and Ellen had to go she and a couple of friends drove up to Houston stood in line for hours\nAnd got to see the president do his thing we spoke the next morning how was it\nIt was great it was everything that you hear on TV that it's going to be in more\nEveryone likes the direction that the country is moving she likes Trump's tax cuts the low unemployment rate she also likes the president's position on immigration\nThe obvious the onslaught of migrants coming up uh the inability of the the countries that are coming from and coming through two songs to flow a it's very concerning and ah there's just no accounting\nFor all these people flowing in I told Ellen about my conversation with her neighbor Janet ... in particular the bit where Janet said Trump's base acts like a cult\nEllen says she doesn't think of herself as a radical she's voting for Ted Cruz and Republican will hurt and the congressional race but she thinks of herself as open minded\nI blocked walked with a liver over in a very liberal neighborhood all summer and the because I thought she was the best person for the job so I don't you know I don't think I'm part of that cold\n[noise] um I guess I Would close by just asking if you could change anything about our current political moment would what would you change\nAh [noise] I I think I'm Out there every day you know I'm trying to a ... to be the opposite\nOf a cold and and have open arms to people\nAnd uh I I\nYou know I Hope that I can lead by example and I think I Do uh we might have\nPolitical differences but we all or you know working towards the same goal\nBut Noel that sentiment that you heard Ellen expressing there really is aspirational she she totally feels the divides between parties right now so does her neighbor Janet as we heard they're each making their case to their neighbors to try to see the world as they see it\nAnd these voters are going to be making decisions into really big races how are they talking about the Senate contest between Beto O'Rourke and Senator Ted Cruz and about the congressional race\nRight so we should say the congressional race a pitch the incumbent Republican we'll heard against the Democratic challenger Gina Ortiz Jones and according to a recent poll by the New York times will heard is up in that race fight Fifteen points so that's a really big spread you know he's got an advantage not only is he the incumbent but he's\nReally positioned himself as as a moderate in in a swing district which he has to do\nA and and that is working to his advantage over work and cruise much closer a cruise is up by seven points vet or work is making a play or we'll see if all the mild he's put on his car all the face time he's putting with voters will make a difference um but it would be it would be\nTo tonic shift in Texas politics things right so this is NPR

C.\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin and this morning we are broadcasting from Del Rio Texas which is just a few miles from the U.S border with Mexico I'm at this very moment looking over lake ... on the Rio Grande river or this is the natural divide between the U.S and Mexico\nDel Rio is part of the twenty third congressional district in Texas a really one of the only swing districts in this red state and we've been here talking to voters about what's on their mind to head of the twenty eighth team terms and how they measure the presidency of Donald Trump\nThere's a new poll out this morning from NPR PBS NewsHour embarrassed that addresses that very topic and we have NPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro with us to discuss the findings ... Dominique Oh hi Rachel so I Am at this moment looking up at the vast Texas sky and it feels pretty far away from Washington DC in\nPolitics but something that's\nReally nice but let's dig into the poll\nFindings eh let's start with the president and Republicans they saw bumping enthusiasm among the base during a justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing did it last\n[noise] not really you know the Kavanaugh factor appears to actually have faded as a big motivating issue for voters Republicans have maintained their level of enthusiasm but with the pollsters tell us is that that's more likely because it's October the closer you get to the election there is a natural rise a\nAnd when you look at Kavanaugh specifically the number of people saying he's motivating their vote has gone down between both parties including Republicans\nAnd we see the president's approval rating back down to thirty nine percent we see Democrats opening up a gap of ten points now on the question of whether you'd want to have a Democrat or Republican in control of Congress and your district\nI feel like you've been on the program several times over the past few months talking about the importance of women in these midterm elections a President Trump is struggling on that front as the poll showed that he's making any inroads with female voters\nNot at all at one of our pollster said that it's really all about the gender gap here in twenty Eighteen or they said twenty ten and twenty fourteen were really about men who are motivated to take back the house and Senate upset with President Obama but\nIn twenty eight peanuts about women who are motivated against President Trump\nWe saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating to preference for control of Congress and in particular when you look at white college educated women they give the president the lowest approval ratings of almost any group and are among the highest to believe that these elections are very important so they're very motivated\n... really interesting because we did meet a woman care Janet ... in the suburbs of San Antonio same thing she's a liberal she's a Democrat but the election of Donald Trump a shattered her and she's become politically motivated in a in a totally new way so we've definitely seen that play out here\nWhat about issues the medical I mean it does the poll addressed what are the issues that are that are going to motivate people to turn out this year\nWell you know first and foremost a driving factor in this election is President Trump to third say that the president will be a factor in their vote that's twenty points higher than in twenty fourteen when the same question was asked about President Obama and that's the year Republicans took back the Senate but when we drove in specifically at some of the issues that are important to people\nThe top issue of course was jobs and the economy followed by health care and immigration all of which we've heard a lot about in this election but when you break it down by party that's where you see some real differences Republicans jobs in the economy and immigration far and away the biggest issues nothing else comes close for Democrats it's health care and climate change\nA notice I didn't mention those tax cuts Republicans hope to run on those but they haven't broken through more people say they'd be motivated to vote for a Democrat because of those tax cuts\nAnd when you ask people about the rising federal deficit sixty percent including a plurality of Republicans say in order to address the deficit they'd prefer to roll back tax cuts rather than okay entitlements\nAnd fears of medical months in our across\nThe Midwest it's grain harvesting time and this year there are three big problems one is wet fields too low crop prices exacerbated by trade war that decimated the Chinese market for soybeans and third some twists from the new tax law Amy Mayer reports from Iowa Public radio\nAnd renting and harvests leaving in ...

C. and I'm Rachel Martin in Del Rio Texas we have been on a road trip through the Texas twenty third congressional district which is a rare swing district in this very red state and it covers\nA long stretch of land that goes from outside El Paso all the way to San Antonio we've been visiting different corners of the district talking to voters about what's going through their minds ahead of the midterms\nPresident Trump has made immigration a central issue in the upcoming vote warning about the influx of migrants from Central America who are coming through Mexico towards the U. S. the president hammer at this point again during a rally in Houston earlier this week\nBut we wanted to know how the issue is playing here along the border which is where we are right now I'm looking out over lake ... which connects to the Rio Grande river\nThat river is the natural barrier that separates the U.S and Mexico\nArmy started means friendship and Spanish which is appropriate because like other American border towns life in Del Rio is woven together with the town on the other side a coon yeah Mexico\nWe're a family and this border\nThis is Amanda ... her family has lived around Del Rio for generations and our house is just a five minute drive to the border and on the other side is a coon yeah\nI don't look down to them and they're equal because I grew up with him but you still don't want them to come here I wanted to come here but I Want them to come here the right way\nAnd mental lives with her longtime partner Ralph\nLaw also grew up here like if you're going to be like some tea okay everybody would talk to me are higher than manned across into a coon yeah a couple of times a week what takes you to\nI have friends yes and I have um I go shopping over there I go to the dentist over there I buy groceries over their\nAmanda has sympathy for people who are seeking a better life in the U.S [noise] but you also has a lot of stories about people she says are gaming the system she tells me she worked for a time at the local jail where she talked with people who got caught coming over the border\nTo fight you can get it because I get my teeth you know my medicine\nDo you think there are too many illegal immigrants who are exploiting the system yeah\nThat's the part that I don't think it makes me very angry what\nDo you make of talk from President Trump when he says he wants to build a wall that would separate Del Rio from Mexico now\nIt when they say separate ... there is a while to get on with anybody back in the winter you can get through\nNow to be clear in parts of the border near Del Rio there is not a wall there's a big black fence and in other areas there is no manmade barrier at all\nThe rooms rugged terrain\nThis is Joe Frank martini as he's been the sheriff here for the past ten years he is a tall man with weathered skin and white hair and a voice that says he's seen an awful lot in these harsh conditions\nPeople are prepared for that we've had those instances where you know people have died out there when the last six months up there was a three\nOver the past year he's taken an assortment of lawmakers from Washington DC on a\nTour of the border just like he's doing for us today we drive along the dirt road that runs parallel to Mexico\nThat's when the before anybody starts talking about the border wall\nThe new suit in this natural state people up north like who is a war zone on her\nAnd it's actually not to me before we start throwing money at a problem you have to identify the problem\nTo him the problem is an immigration system that's been broken for fifty years and he says it can't be fixed with a wall\nBecause for starters where would you put it Jeff Martinez drives us up the road where there is no more fence instead there are these houses along the river bank he pulls up on a vacant lot between two homes you know the owner he tells us it's no problem there perks to be a sheriff's\nThat'll do for others much\nJust across the little yes it's even a river this looks like an earthquake will be Christian books rerun room how many feet are we talking\nAbout ah we're probably talking what three hundred feet foreigner food\nI mean that's the hardest from across the so a ninth someone can just swim across just walk up here just like we didn't walk to that road mhm\nI asked sheriff Martinez how the immigration debate is affecting people's politics here\nAnd like other folks we spoke to in Del Rio he said it's not top of mind for residents this is a relatively quiet part of the border the people who do sneak in get out quickly and moved to a bigger cities\nAnd even the Republican congressman will Hurd has spoken out against the wall he's facing a democratic challenger named Gina Ortiz Jones who's trying to tie her to President Trump\nBut this is a swing district in heard has positioned himself as a moderate and by doing so he's one of the support people like Jeff Martinez\nWill ever come to an air of human in the same tour alike worries you felt that our office or you're you've been an advocate for us\nAnd this is interesting because you're Martinez like most elected officials here is a Democrat and even though he didn't vote for President Trump and has some issues with his policies and his rhetoric Martinez is pleased about one thing\nThis administration the shirts have been invited to the table previous administrations\nWe weren't or we were older but it'll ... even the bones were blown\nUp by the way to solve the immigration issue the sure to be able to reject the gender just go to go because\nHe knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very long time which brings us back to the original question what about that wall\nSee my ideal is to you can control with technology cameras that sort of put in the physical structure because where you're going to put it\nHe points to the houses along
