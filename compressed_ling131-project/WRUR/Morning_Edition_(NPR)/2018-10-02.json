organizations in particular\nThe world Trade Organization President Trump often complains that these international groups take advantage of America and he's often targeted the WTO which sets in enforces global trading rules in fact the administration is\nUnhappy with the WTO it's been blocking the appointment of new judges threatening to cripple the organization NPR's Frank Langfitt has the story from Geneva\nPresident Trump can stay on the world Trade Organization series and two thousand and Seventeen\nI get a headache thinking about who made these deals [noise] run after another WGM in the White House in July\nWTO's street in the United states very badly\nAnd into Bloomberg News interview in August\nI Wish you the WTO shingle stray dealer and if they don't shape I Would withdraw from the WTO\nFor one thing the U.S government complains the judges of the global trading organization which oversees disputes overstepped their bounds here's Robert Lighthizer us trade representative speaking last year at the center for Strategic and International Studies a Washington think tank\nThere have been a lot of cases that were uh in my opinion the decisions are really indefensible\nFor instance in response to a complete from Mexico WTO rule the U.S had to use the same standards for adults and save tuna in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans even though the conditions in animals are different marriages Crowley is a professor of international economics at the University of Cambridge\nCountries like the United states he oh this is a little bit of an infringement on our right to regulate our own domestic consumer markets and so there's been a a small a series of chipping away at these types of domestic discretionary policy [noise]\nThe world Trade Organization focused on the banks of Lake Geneva today is a beautiful beautiful day uh hardly a cloud in the sky lights in the eighties people are out in boats paddle boarding even swimming in Lake Placid um put inside the WTO uh right now the mood is really different\nIt's without any question the case that this is a crisis\nKeith Rockwell's chief spokesman for the WTO says the organization is running out of judges to your appeals on trade dispute in the past two years the WTO is going from seven judges to three by the end of next year it'll be down to one and unable to hear appeals\nWhich observers say could encourage more countries to violate trade rules and that rock well says could hurt the global economy\nIf the rules of the game or not being adhered to and enforced it creates uncertainty and that affects investment decisions sourcing decisions\nAnd businesses could become more cautious about investing a new projects which good her jobs and growth us insisted just wants to reform the WTO but many observers are skeptical of Trump's intentions\nNow we know to to make them better which you cannot do you are like the system on completely ignore it and that's what the Trump restrictions doing to get\nMore solar e ... is a professor of international economics of the University of Geneva he says Trump would rather do one on one deals where he thinks the U.S can get better terms because of the vast size of the American economy or Iago spoke over Skype\nIf you ask me what the structure of us are new stretched really good read all of a joke because then the u._s. can do whatever he wants to come with being white decrease on the street ... wants to impose us rules on every country\nWhich would up in the global trading order although Trump has threatened to pull the U.S out of the WTO he can actually do it without congressional approval but in the meantime the president can make it harder and harder for the organization to do its job Frank Langfitt NPR News Geneva, Switzerland\nThis

I wore a pink shirt to work or I I held my girlfriend's per se while she ran into the bank\nOr I ordered a drink at a restaurant and when it came out to me it had a little cocktail umbrella in it and my you know my friends tease me so it's like it's just mundane things like women don't say oh I wore the wrong shirt\n\nWhy would men make such a big deal over trivial thing\nThe familiar explanation is massage any or homophobia that is what Boston talked to she began to think about the different messages that boys received from a very young age are you a real man or they say man up\nBoston built on this inside and conducted a series of research experiment into why men behave the way they do a conclusion\nMy collaborators in I argue that the male gender role itself is kind of conceptualize as a more precarious status so manhood is something that hardship or an easy to lose relative to womanhood\n\nManhood is something that's hard to earn and easy to do many fewer pink shirts and pushes because they're defending something fragile in terms of why this would be the\nCase or why would you have one sex essentially have a more limited repertoire we'll have more policing around us boundaries or why do women take that femininity for granted in ways that men do not take them asking it for granted\nThat is really hard question to answer but I think it has to do with um [noise]\nHow men their social status is more hierarchy Akeley organized than women's is\nSo men are kind of more interested in or motivated to attain social status and that kind of then translates into what we propose is kind of a chronic anxiety about their status and that translates into a concern about whether once seen as a real man or not\nMen worry about what other men will think what women will think well they themselves might think Boston has some ideas on how to get more men into nursing she argues that the way to do it is to come up with a new set of stereotypes\nYou could spin nursing as a very masculine occupation it's dangerous to physically grueling our stereotype of the nurse you know you could modify that stereotype and turn nursing into a profession that does seem masculine or male appropriate [noise]\nSomething along these lines happened to Robert Vaughn when he was considering whether to become a nurse at twenty three he just finished for years in the navy\nHe wanted to go back to school his wife's dad had a suggestion my father\nIn law who's a respiratory therapist said hey you know you should really look into nursing\nVon didn't immediately take his father in law's advice\nLike a lot of guys I think the first thing that went through my head was well that's a a woman's job\nBut one did get a job at a hospital working as a security guard and one day something happened that up turned his stereotypes about nursing\nWe had a couple guys who came in to the emergency room and they were just very belligerent fighting there was blood all over the place and the nurses in us and the sheriffs were holding them down and it's a dating and and restraining and I was like man this is this is pretty [laughter] the action that the nurses were saying was pretty exciting for me [noise]\nYou know you think of nursing do you think of someone sitting at a [noise]\nA bedside being let me hold your hand and and you see what it is realistically day to day\nAnd for me it was\nA hundred and eighty degrees [noise]\nIt comes to fighting stereotypes we often imagined that the right approach is to explain why stereotypes are wrong [noise]\nBut Robin Williams lives and Jennifer Boston's experiments suggest a different solution and perhaps a more effective one [noise] stereotypes are powerful because the stories we tell about ourselves\nMhm are powerful the shape how we see the world and how the world sees us but in the end [noise]\nWe're only stories stories we can rewrite them\nShankar Vedantam NPR News I'm\nJohn ... is the host of NPR's hidden brain podcast and radio show you can hear more research about masculinity on the latest episode\nSupport for hidden brain comes from zoom zoom offers cloud video conferencing online meetings and a video conference room solution and one platform featuring digital video and audio screen sharing the count registration and more at zoomed on us\n\nComing up later today on all things considered a freelance workers also called contingent workers make up to a third of the u._s. workforce by some estimates will look at the many financial challenges that those workers face\nTo listen to that story ask your smart speaker to play NPR or ask for your local member station by name [noise] you're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep and you're listening on number support it public radio W ... am Rochester W.

will be treated fairly he has long argued the bail system favors the wealthy and punish the poor\nTurns out that the story is more complicated now many of those who pushed hardest for bail reform saying the new system may be making the problem worse NPR's Eric Westervelt reports from home\nIn the downtown San Francisco public defender's office you might think attorney chase Abboud dean would be excited about the recently signed California's Senate bill or sb ten which abolish is money bailing America's most populous state after all ... and fellow public service lawyers have long called money bailing unconstitutional pillar of biased system\nI saw your bank account often determines who gets out of pre trial custody and the poor and people of color often end up on the losing end but this deputy public defender is not in a celebratory mood\nI was disappointed and I felt betrayed the newest be ten doesn't actually change the races system of mass incarceration just expand\nThe new law was in response to a state court decision declaring that the cash bail system unconstitutionally denied people due process\nNow under the new law takes effect next year instead of setting bail a judge will use a computer program as part of his or her determination whether a suspect is low medium or high risk for flight or to public safety\nWho didn't believe this will dramatically expand the number of people who will be detained pre trial\nHe points to one section in particular deep in the bill section Thirteen twenty dot Eighteen a subsection five that section so broadly worded ... argues it could encompass anyone for any offense that he says will kill the power ever more into the hands of prosecutors police and judges\nUnder sb ... and now prosecutors can seek detention for virtually any\nCrime regardless of whether it's violent or involves weapons or whether the person accused as a prior history or under this law prosecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nAnd then there's its impact on the deals currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn ... with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he says the youth detention to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nIs pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single\nDay the new Dell\nReform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's computer program that aims to measure risk after putting an arrest and conviction\nThat algorithm gives the bill of near of objective science attorney rifling says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact the police stop search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people\nAnd that the courts treat people of color trip poor people worse or there's various factors that these risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif's fan over dean CEO of a nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect but she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist fan or do you notice that discretion to detain or release pre trial has always reside with judges\nThis new law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nOh that makes it should also be like they shouldn't even where people are ending trial\nMeantime the bail industry which would be put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box an industry coalition is currently

service providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers like Comcast Time Warner\nTreat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California earlier this year the administration were moved to those standards at the federal level Tim will is with us now he's at Columbia Law professor and they actually coined the term net neutrality Tim welcome\nTo the show or good morning why is this a priority for the department of justice net neutrality\nYou know I I think that they uh uh of decided they really want to have a a a environment where [noise] uh you know ... it's open for business I guess as their argument and the other concern that California's meddling with a federal policy\nWell how effective is California's position I mean the federal government argues is as an issue of interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that the the uh for broadband providers and California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state\nOr in about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California is going to say is listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered ... and it's always delivered locally and when you think about it um you know it's just between it's just that thing in your home and the word the local state that's all they care about they're not trying to\nControl everything and so I think that's what California's argument will be\nWhat is the president this kid says and dozens of other states are\nVery net neutrality laws right\nIn fact dozens of other states have a new neutrality laws you know it it gets through a really fundamental policy question which is where the states are sort of free to experiment economically filling up the federal government has abandoned the neutrality\nFor reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union in other words we want there to be no rules or for any Internet providers and other states feel differently Internet's a sort of California where where much of the Internet was invented\nAnd so I think that that's what's at stake here is really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish in California we should note has is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of fronts on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest\nFor one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum you know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do you know we think this is a dangerous\nSo it's not a case where the Trump or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word California law on the other hand it's a question of the California law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce phrase goes\nAnd so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local or really national or international I think that is a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see uh the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on us\nI mean I I think almost all of them one they've also they they like in the intro the law they don't like the idea that you know Comcast or or a TNT will try to charge them extra block their content know most people vast majority Americans wanting to troll the laws that sort of the\nFood for an audience of to the Florida it's the abroad than lobby and the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised how many states are are trying to fill the gaps\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school thanks so much for your time it's been a pleasure\nHow much besides the title is really changing of the north American free trade agreement\nWants to prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American auto worker\nBut as President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nAmong other things the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets and set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the AFL CIO the largest union in the U.S\nIn her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages up which by the way has a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now there isn't such a huge wage differential\nThis is a big departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs\nThat could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the auto industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid terrorists Chad ... is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nHe says such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now have to be made with workers that are earning higher wages\nAnd that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules that down says and makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia or if you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper places to build automobiles to export anywhere around the world\nAnd that he says could offset some of the labor games from the deal ...

a question\nFor credit Christmas worker former assistant director of Europe you know it's actually much\nThank you [noise]\nAll right there was some big news out of one of the world's biggest companies today the Seattle based company Amazon announced that it plans to raise wages to Fifteen dollars an hour that is for all full time part time and seasonal workers they're going to start this next month\nIt's a bold move for a company that's been in the spotlight lately and not in a good way necessarily NPR's Alina Selyukh is here in the studio to talk through what this change means highly nagging morning and just to note here Amazon is one of NPR's financial supporters solely know what other details can you share\nRight so they should press release in here if you takes away from that or take away from that you mentioned at uh the Fifteen dollar minimum wage will apply to fulltime part time and seasonal workers also importantly temporary workers contract workers\nWhich is where a lot of the scrutiny has been for Amazon specifically they issued a number of few months ago saying that the median wage at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars a year which is a very uh\nInteresting contrast to the fact that the company also this year I'm a topped one trillion dollars in worse and so for the contract workers that Fifteen dollar minimum wage will mean a lot I'm also the number of employees that will be affected by this is pretty staggering it's more than two hundred and fifty thousand is on it well\nI mean I I noted that you just talked about an Amazon has been under a lot of very public scrutiny for how it treats its employees not just the the median wage which you outline but just the conditions of workers is is this change a result of of that public scrutiny\nWell it's unclear it you know if you follow Amazon if you wait kind of long enough there will inevitably be some kind of a story in the news about um is a specific it's usually specific warehouse in a specific location where some\nI'm a criticism comes up about the the way that the employees were being monitored or how much money they're making and general Amazon usually comes back to that to say well actually all of our fulltime workers um in warehouses well do you make Fifteen dollars to begin with if you count in all the benefits and and things like that\nUm but the interesting thing is that this has become kind of a rallying cry Senator Bernie Sanders has gone after Amazon for this basis a CEO Jeff basis came to speak in Washington um if you weeks ago and I went to that and outside of the hotel there was a small group of protesters\nUm they describe themselves as socialist and mainly what they did talk about what specifically that optical\nKind of contrast of Jeff Bass does not just the wealthiest man or in the world but the wealthiest man in history ... running a company where the employees were uh I'm not making a huge amount of money um and they had a little science talking specifically about that\nI'm In the other thing to remember is just how ... how vast Amazon has become in a few months recently right I mean the larger business contacts for this Amazon clearly is doing well in this moment so they're feeling like they can afford this change\nIt's I think that's part of it and you know Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gets asked a lot about you know do you think your companies too big they did buy a whole foods recently they have a variety of businesses getting into cloud services getting into deliveries I mean we're talking\nTruck fleets of truck drivers fleets of warehouse workers fleets of um you know call service people and it often turns it into a bit of a philosophical conversation about you know large institutions should be scrutinized you know it's not personal large institutions anywhere she'd be scrutinized\nUm but the fact that they now do you have sort of this interesting span of workers and retail um and on the business side kind of does make it an interesting development that that that they're raising minimum wage\nI mean lawmakers on Capitol Hill you mentioned Bernie Sanders but others have been pushing for a federal minimum wage uh Fifteen dollars an hour how is this move now by Amazon such an important company how's that going to affect that effort\nBut there is a really big us being in that press release that Amazon issued which is they're saying they are going to quote working to gain congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage which could be huge if you have one of the\nMost valuable American companies now lobbying for Fifteen dollar a minimum wage federally that could be really huge it's important to note that other companies have been moving toward this a lot of the state have been moving toward this target as one example I can offer of a company that is going for Fifteen dollars by twenty twenty\nAnd also importantly in this moment the timing of this is interesting we're about to go into the holiday season and Amazon says it will pay it seasonal workers Fifteen dollars um this is perfectly time for that that creates a lot of pressure on a lot of the other retailers that are battling in this really tight labor market for the exact same types of\nPeople who might be looking for employment right during the holiday\nSeason All right great explainer

have over a giant Internet service providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers like Comcast Time Warner\nTreat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California earlier this year the administration removed those standards at the federal level Tim will is with us now he's at Columbia Law professor\nAnd they actually coined the term net neutrality Tim welcome to the show or good morning why is this a priority for the department of justice net neutrality\nYou know I think that that they uh uh of decided they really want to have a a a an environment where are you know it's open for business I guess as their argument and the other concern that California's meddling with a federal policies\nWell how effective is California's a position I mean the federal government argues is as an issue of interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point the Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that\nThe the the uh the broadband providers in California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state\nUh but you know but how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California is going to say\nIs listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered ... and it's always delivered locally and when you think about it um you know it's just between it's just that thing in your home and the word the local state that's all they care about they're not trying to control everything and so I think that's what California's argument will be\nWhat is the president this kid says I mean dozens of other states are considering net neutrality laws right\nIn fact dozens of other states have a new net neutrality laws you know it ... it gets to a really fundamental policy question which is one of the states are sort of free to the experiment economically a feeling gaps\nThe federal government has abandoned the neutrality um for reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union in other words we want there to be no rules or for any Internet providers and other states feel differently Internet's a sort of California where it's where much of the Internet was invented\nAnd so I think that that's what's at stake here is really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish in California we should note has is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of fronts on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest\nSo one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum you know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do we know we think this is is dangerous\nSo it's not a case where the Trump or or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word the California law on the other hand it's a question of the California go law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce as the phrase goes\nAnd so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local or really national or international and I think that is a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see uh the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on us\nI mean I I think almost all of them one they've all said they they like in the intro the law they don't like the idea that\nYou know Comcast or or TNT we'll we'll\nTry to charge them extra block their content know most people vast majority Americans wanting to control the laws that sort of the uh it's a it's an audience of to the slow the it's the broadband lobby and the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised so many states are are trying to fill the gaps\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school thinks on what your time\nIt's been a pleasure [noise] how much besides the title is really changing of the north American free trade agreement\nOnce you prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American auto worker\nThat as President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nAmong other things the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets and set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the AFL CIO the largest union in the U.S\nAnd her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages which by the way has a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now they're in such a huge wage differential\nThis is a departure for unions which have historically oppose trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs\nSo it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal but to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement and you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd in less strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting company\nIs operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws there are elements of the proposal wallich cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic\nDrugs that could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid terrorists had bound is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nSays such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now has to be made with workers that are earning higher wages and that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules that balance as and makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper to build automobiles to export anywhere around the world\nAnd that he says could offset some of the labor gains from the deal ...
