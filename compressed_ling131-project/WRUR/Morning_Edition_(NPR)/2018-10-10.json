disappearance of a Saudi journalist democracy in Turkey\nRight to ... is a Washington Post contributor who was laughing entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey eight days ago the post says that it has been told by persons with knowledge of the Turkish investigation into his disappearance\nThat team of Fifteen Saudi men flew into assemble early on October second hours before the show he has not seen as he entered the costs like the team checked into to nearby hotels and then were taken to the consulate by car\nAnd the post is also reporting the Fifteen men departed is stumbled later that very same day on flights to both Cairo and Dubai NPR's Peter Kenyon has been following all of his in his stumble Hi Peter I David so what is standing out to you at this point is more information that's coming in well\nThis focus on the fifteenth Saudis who arrived to Turkish paper today are published both their names and their photos all Fifteen of them\nAre these are the men police say arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday the day ... disappeared a there are a media reports that Turkish intelligence says now identified as some of those men as military officers special forces member\nAnd a forensic expert among them a Turkish TV is aired footage of a black van that was seen leaving the Saudi consulate uh sometime after the show the entered a airport security reportedly X rayed the luggage of at least some of these Saudi men as they prepare to leave this symbol that same night\nAre they also X rayed the men themselves kind of standard procedure and reportedly at the request of Turkish intelligence they also searched one of the planes\nAre they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed to take off\nBut clearly the focus is on these men and what they were doing here that day\nWhen they were to claim the right to that they've only search one of the planes that the less\nThat's right that is a gap at the moment in the story that I'm getting a no explanation as to why one plane was searched and not the other uh there are a number of anonymous tips going out providing other uh sometimes grisly details\nAnd supported this conclusion that preliminary conclusion that the show he was killed a one official tells the New York times at one of the Saudis who arrived last Tuesday was an autopsy expert and that a bone so was used on the body after the murder\nSo where does the investigation go from here I mean Saudi Arabia is denying anything terrible happened here what ... what a Turkish investigators do now\nWell there's two leading theories obviously one that he was spirited out of the country or that he was killed and his body disposed of police seem to be leaning toward the ladder theory at the moment\nAs you say the Saudis denied any involvement and they want to know where to show give themselves they say they can't provide any evidence to back up their claim that he left the consulate with an hour of arriving which is what they claim there's no CCTV footage they say Turkish police are going through their own camera footage from the streets outside the consulate\nThey haven't seen any images of the show the leaving TV is airing pictures of him entering though the first we've seen those uh and they will be searching the conflict building with Saudi permission or that could happen as early as today\nAnd Peter remind us of the diplomatic context here I mean Saudi Arabian turkey ... what does that relationship like and how badly produce damage it\nWell it wasn't great before a Turkey's been siding with Qatar in an ongoing dispute with the Saudis are so far president aired ones being cautious he says we need answers but the main secular opposition party is already calling for an immediate review of Turkey's relations with Saudi Arabia\nSo I think however this plays out it will be to some degree a worsening of ties\nAnd then one of the big question to sell to us relations and how that could be impacted as well\nYeah very unclear at the moment are lots of headlines here quoting Trump saying he doesn't know anything about the ... case so some level of frustration but no sign so far the Washington's exerting pressure in

Roche acting as and all our eyes\n[noise]\nUnleashing the power of the Fifteen to\nCountry all year long\nPresident Trump referring there to his promise to lift certain restrictions on the sale of ethanol in gasoline to do that in ... in order to boost sales that's the point of this whole thing and put more money in the pockets of corn farmers Clay Masters of Iowa Public radio without ... joins us now from Council Bluffs Iowa Hi clay\nGood morning so just lay out for us what President Trump is ordering the EPA to do by lifting regulations on that's now\nSo last night the president laid out his intent to extend the sailor kind of gasoline called you Fifteen year round right now selling it in the summer months is prohibited you Fifteen has basically gasoline with Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based ethanol\nDuring this could prop a corn prices that have been down thanks to tariffs by other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no timetable yet from the White House as to how fast this proposed rule change will go into effect but there are hopes to have it completed before next summer when you know many drivers are hitting the road\nOr certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision there were also Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement ...\nAnd so it is it really going to make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of it does really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect but it was\nUm ethanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the use of fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can you explain their position here\nWell we use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation shut the move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act they said no relief but the change would produce more pollutants that lead to smog in gasoline alone\nAre there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will too over any change through the fuel policy so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term elections are coming up I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here\nRight I I mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agricultural manufacturing in the states so talking about this in Iowa along with this new NAFTA deal or as it's called us in the a as well as other trade deals\nGoing away for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races that were pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes\nA Iowa's governor Kim Reynolds she faces Democrat Fred Hubble\nShe was at the event and the president and she works changing plenty of complements with each other so the Republican congressman who represents the district David Young was also at the rally he faces a tough race as well in the summer youngest said Trump's tariffs were making him nervous and he seemed to be walking the line you know when it came to supporting the president but now\nThere's really no question last night the president said a vote for David is a vote for me\nWhat's the political argument against us move though you said that there are some politicians who oppose it\nWell certainly the politicians are opposing it are from oil producing states and so you know they have oil in mind and so a lot of those senators don't want corn ethanol being of the future in an energy they're more interested in oil\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio thanks so much we appreciate it I think you\nOnly one Democrat voted to confirm Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh or with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia mansion faces a political reality here state is getting more dominated by Republicans\nAnd he's in a tight race against the state's Republican attorney general Patrick Morrisey but there are doubts about whether supporting Kavanaugh is really going to help mansion on election day here's West Virginia public radio message\nAs mentioned stood on the Senate floor to cast his vote to confirm Kavanaugh on Saturday protesters yelled shame from the gallery\n[noise]\nBeen shared unit on order and\nBy that evening assigned saying shame on mansion hung over mansions office back in West Virginia state Capitol Charleston in the run up to the vote Jamie Miller was arrested while protesting at his campaign office\nMiller who's an artist also went to Washington with a group of sexual assault survivors to meet with mansion she says she was a tentative and listen to their concerns but after last weekend's vote she's not sure what you do when election day\nI didn't vote for him um during the primary but\nI have voted for him in the past and now I'm really on the fence about what to do\nTurn Ireland is a Charleston city councilwoman she says she's always recognized that mention is new liberal but has defended him in the\nPast I have been a person who has been the person to say to someone\nThat we need to recognize that West Virginia Democrats are more conservative that we're a state with an aging population and that you know Joe Manchin is better than his opponent\nBut after Kavanaugh's confirmation Arlen so she won't vote for mansion in November Emily ... came to a similar decision she's a public schoolteacher even the west Virginia Public school teachers went on strike earlier this year and the teachers union support mansion comb or social leave her ballot blank\nI absolutely will not be voting for senator mansion in November I won't be voting from Patrick Marcy either I Would never vote for him but um I just we don't have a candidate that is going to fight for us\nAll three women so they hope the next Democratic Senate candidate from West Virginia will be more progressive the mansion he frequently breaks ranks with his more liberal democratic colleagues in the Senate for my computer that voting record is a sign that mentioned is an independent thinker computer was a democratic state lawmaker for mentions home in Marion County\nJoke kind of wait out what he thought the majority West Virginians wanted him to do and and and he did that he acted accordingly\nOr some people can be happy about that and some slowing me mad about it but you know you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater as they say you know we were never going to agree a hundred percent of the time with anybody\nBut computers as mentioned isn't likely to win any votes for more conservative independent or non affiliated voters with his vote for cabinet and computer believes mentioned as certainly lost some support from progressive Democrats after this weekend\nMentions future now hinges on whether voters feel so strongly about his vote for cabin all that they abandoned him or if they want to continue the state's tradition of sending moderate Democrats to Washington

Dawson introduces us to Brandon Scott he just celebrated one year of being clean\n\nIs still there so honestly Brandon Scott is talking about heroin but he's also talking about addiction he grew up in gates and he was a quiet bookish student who didn't drink or do drugs into adulthood drinking became a way to fit in but he became addicted to one night when he nearly died\nBy hiring people who've never been prosecutors would never been involved with the prosecutor's office which are seen as entirely corrupt so we hired ... what he called the twenty against the underworld Nineteen white men plus one black woman Eunice Carter\nNo matter how many pages of your book I read it still seems somehow a little surprising to me in a time of such prejudice that first that your grandmother became a lawyer that she became a successful lawyer and then that she got hired by this white prosecutor how'd that happen\nWe don't know exactly why you're hired her but higher her he did the downside was that after do we hired her he set about again trying to investigate ... but do we want it to investigated for murder\nOr ... what he considered a serious crime but at the same time the only woman in only black person on his staff my grandmother Eunice or do we assigned to look into prostitution even though he made clear that he had no intention\nOf prosecuting Louisiana for prostitution because do he said he was not going to be a narrow crusader\nWow and Eunice Carter faces the task along with these other lawyers have tried to find some way to work her way up to the top man to lucky Louisiana where did she began\nSo after Eunice was hired she was banished in a sense to the furthest cubicle in this special office do we had a set up and when do we asked citizens of New York to come in and talked about organized crime in their neighborhoods\nTurned out that most of the letters and complaints were about prostitution\nAll these much come in they had to be dumped on somebody's desk and they're all dumped on union says there's a sense in which she was sidelined during the investigation\nBut she didn't want to hold her back in fact from the beginning she went over to the attack she actually put together the first evidence anyone had ever had that the mob was involved in prostitution because there was an article of faith among the police\nThat prostitution was run by small time operators and certainly the mafia was not involved Eunice set herself the task of proven otherwise and against considerable opposition including in her own office she succeeded in improving it\nI guess the method here as you start at the bottom work your way up\nSomething like that once she began together the evidence she persuaded Dewey to arrange a police raids which Eunice was in charge of\nOn eighty a bravo one night they brought in the prostitutes the women who worked in these ... there was a reason they arrested only the women because the women\nWere accustomed being bailed out by these men called the fixers but the rest of the fixtures too there was no one to bail them out than it was to keep the women's they would turn against the fixers then to pressure the fixers so they would turn against their bosses will turn against their bosses have helped to only turn against I'm Lucy on oh enter everyone's surprise\nUnisys idea worked wow and how did the trial turn out\nThe trial was actually a lot of fun for the press precisely because the main witness was against Louisiana were prostitutes and one of them for example the one the press had the most fun with was a woman known as Cokie flow brown researchers noticed Cokie flow was because of her cocaine habit\nOr when she arrived on the witness stand to testify that she'd overheard Lucy I Know several times discussing that the prostitution business with his aides [noise]\nShe was so jittery apparently having withdrawal not having had a fix in several days that the judge three times what ... interrupt her testimony in order to have a sip of brandy ... to calm her nerves\nAnd finally the defense counsel that as Lucy on his lawyer demanded that she be tested for drugs to see whether she was high during her testimony so cookie flow was taken to another room with a couple of doctors and Eunice Eunice was the only woman on the prosecution team in Louisiana team had no women\nSo she was there when the doctors examine term return to pronounce that she was a drug free and the jury obviously believe your testimony was the jury voted very quickly to convict [noise] so how\nDoes learning this story changed your understanding of New York city and the Nineteen thirties or America and the Nineteen thirties [noise]\nOne thing take away from it is how similar in a sense America then was to America now my grandmother was on the commission was appointed by the mayor to look into the causes of the New York city riots of Nineteen forty five which began in Harlem\nAnd the commission's report if you read it today it sounds like it could be written today it talks about mistreatment of black men by police\nAbout suspicion of black people as we go into stores it talks about employment discrimination

this NPR station It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm David dream more details are emerging now about the disappearance of Saudi journalist democracy Yogi in Turkey\nBecause she'll gives the Washington Post contributor was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week the Washington Post says it has been told by people with knowledge of the Turkish investigation into the disappearance of the team\nOf fifteenth Saudi men flew into you stumble on October second hours before the show with less seen entering the consulate the post is also reporting those Fifteen men departed stumbled later that very same day on flights to Cairo and to do by NPR's Peter Kenyon is following all of this\nIn stumble and Peter what is standing out to you at this point of view learn more facts here\nAnd it was it a main news of the day is this publication in a in a Turkish pro government paper of both the names and photos of the Fifteen Saudi men who police they arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday the day of the show these disappearance\nAh the paper ah described them in as an assassination squad and other media are reporting that Turkey's intelligence services identified several of them in some they say are military officers including a special forces member a there's a reported Saudi intelligence officer in there and also a senior forensics expert\nA Turkish TV mean wells are airing footage\nOf ... entering the consulate on October second and of a black man leaving the consulate about two hours later a heading to the consul general's residence or there is a report as well that airport security X rayed the luggage of some of the sodium in as they prepared to lead to stumble that same night\nUh X. rayed them in themselves and reportedly at the request of the intelligence service\nSearched one of the planes one of the two planes they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed to take off but the focus seems to be on these Fifteen men and what they were doing here\nWhy search one of the two points on that both to point\nWell that's all we know based on the Internet\nAnd we have so far this is going to need some further explanation it's it's not clear why that would be the case what officials are anonymously talking about are further grisly details or one tells the New York times that one of the Saudis was autopsy expert in the bones so it was used on the buddy after the murder\n... a bone saw 'em talk of an assassin assassination squad it sounds like\nTurkish authorities are are moving towards the theory that that this was a targeted murder\nYes it certainly seems that the theory they're leaning towards I don't think you can rule out the other possibility that cause Yogi was spirited out of the country\nAh I don't think either one has been completely ruled out yet the Saudis of course deny any involvement with the show veep disappearance they claim he left the consulate within an hour of arriving but they say they don't have any video evidence to back that up\nTurkish police are going through their own camera footage this is from the streets outside the consulate uh they say so far they've seen footage of him going in but no footage of him coming out\nUh they've also been invited to search the consulate building with Saudi permission\nAnd that we're told could happen as early as today uh there's no word yet I must say an searching the consul general's residence with it like then when eight days ago\nPeter I mean Saudi Arabia and turkey weren't the best of friends right but what what could I mean if if indeed this journalists were killed on Turkish soil and the Saudi Government something to do with what could the through to the relationship between the two countries\nIt would be a serious blow to relations that were already somewhat afraid I mean there's been ongoing tensions in the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and turkey quite prominently took cut our side so that hasn't helped but this would be on another level completely this is a beyond the pale of anything\nThat would have happened and again as you say if it's demonstrated that this happened and the Saudis do deny it completely but it would be a big blow yeah\nAnd the u._s. always under pressure to but by some to do more to put more pressure on Saudi Arabia which could grow here\nYes a turkey is media here are kind of surprised at some headlines are showing a little bit of frustration the big ones says quote Trump I don't know anything about the ... case so far there isn't much sign that Washington is exerting pressure in Riyadh Cosby us investigators to join the probe are happening uh let's see if something like that occurs\nNPR's Peter Kenyon thanks Peter thanks\nOh\nThe largest oil company in the U.S is encouraging attacks on the dairy products that makes executives at Exxon Mobil and announce that the company will contribute one million dollars of the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this make on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nExxon Mobil contribution will support a group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council\nIts aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere ExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg brutal scent of the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nThat's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurgers and says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why doesn't oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nVerbal since says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions Myrtle ... says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon dividends plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen James Baker the third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House\nOne carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully ... to consumers\nBurton says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nWith Republicans in particular there's an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it is a step\nThat's Vin Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist in political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but ... says with the president and the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way of sugar coating it for a Republican today to embrace any new tax is difficult and since President Trump was elected particularly attacks that focuses on fossil fuels is even more difficult\nGreg brutal send acknowledges the challenges and says the carbon tax has always been viewed as a longer term effort\nNPR's John Ydstie on NPR News\nAnd now ...

Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based ethanol are doing this could crop of corn prices that have been down thinks the tariffs by other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no time table yet from the White House as to how fast this proposed rule change will go into effect but there are\nHopes that haven't completed before next summer when you know many drivers are hitting the road\nOr certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision there are also Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement\nAnd so it is it really going to make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of it does really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect that is\nEthanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the use of fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can explain their position here\nWell we use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation said the move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act they said no release that the change would produce more pollutants that we too small given gasoline alone\nA there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will sue over any change to the fuel policy so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term elections are coming out I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here\nRight I'm I mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agriculture in manufacturing in the states so talking about this in Iowa along with this you know new NAFTA deal or as it's called us MCA as well as other trade deals\nKind of a way for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races that look pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes a Iowa's governor Kim Reynolds she faces Democrat Fred Hubble\nShe was at the event and the president she worked changing plenty of compliments with each other also the Republican congressman who represents this district David Young was also at the rally he faces a tough race as well in the summer young had said Trump's tariffs were making him nervous and\nHe seemed to be walking the line you know when it came to supporting the president but now there's really no question last night the president said of a vote for David is a vote for me\nWhat's the political argument against this myth though you said that there are some politicians who oppose it\nWell certainly the politicians that are opposing it are from oil producing states and so you know they have oil in mind and so a lot of those senators don't want corn ethanol being the future in in energy they're more interested in in oil\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio thanks so much we appreciate it you think you\nOnly one Democrat voted to confirm Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh here with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia mansion faces a political reality state is getting more dominated by Republicans\nAnd he's in a tight race against the state's Republican attorney general Patrick Morrisey but there are doubts about whether supporting Kavanaugh is really going to help mansion on election day here's West Virginia public radio they've missed itch\nAs mentioned stood on the Senate floor to cast his vote to confirm Kavanaugh on Saturday protesters yelled shame from the gallery\n[noise]\nShare in it and it was ordered\nBy that evening assigned saying shame on mansion hung over

Washington with a group of sexual assault survivors to meet with mansion she says he was a tentative and listen to their concerns but after last weekend's vote she's not sure what you do when election day\nI didn't vote for him um during the primary but I have voted\nFor him in the past and now I'm really on the fence about what to do\nTurn Ireland is a Charleston city councilwoman she says she's always recognize it mentioned is new liberal but his defended him in the past\nI have been a person who has been the person to say to someone\nThat we need to recognize that West Virginia Democrats are more conservative that we're a state with an aging population and that you know Joe Manchin is better than his opponent\nBut after Kavanaugh's confirmation Arlen says she won't vote for mentioned in November Emily ... came to a similar decision she's a public school teacher even the west Virginia Public school teachers went on strike earlier this year and the teachers union support mansion conversation will leave her ballot blank\nI absolutely will not be voting for senator mansion in November I won't be voting from Patrick Morrisey either I Would never vote for him but um I just we don't have a candidate that is going to fight for us all three women so they hope\nThe next Democratic Senate candidate from West Virginia will be more progressive the mansion he frequently breaks ranks with his more liberal democratic colleagues in the Senate from I ... that voting record is a sign that mention is an independent thinker computer was a democratic state lawmaker for mentions home in Marion County\nJoke kind of wait out what he thought the majority West Virginians wanted him to do and and and he did that he acted accordingly\nOr some people can be happy about that and so it's going to be mad about it but you know you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater as they say you know we were never going to agree a hundred percent of the time with anybody\nBut computers as mentioned isn't likely to win any votes for more conservative independent or not affiliated voters with his vote for cabinet and computer believes mansion has certainly lost some support from progressive Democrats after this weekend\nMentions future now hinges on whether voters feel so strongly about his vote for capital that they abandoned him or if they want to continue the state's tradition of sending moderate Democrats to Washington for NPR News I'm Dave message in Morgantown West Virginia\n[noise]\nGood morning at seven forty to this is ...

emphasizing success stories W ... introduces us to Brandon Scott who just celebrated a year of being clean the Steelers\nSo honestly Brandon Scott is talking about heroin but he's also talking about addiction he grew up in gates and he was a quiet bookish student who didn't drink or do drugs into adulthood drinking became a way to fit in but he became addicted to one night when he nearly died\nBy hiring people who've never been prosecutors who'd never been involved with the prosecutor's office would receive is entirely corrupt so we hired ... what do you call between you against the underworld Nineteen white men plus one black woman Eunice quarter\nNo matter how many pages of your book I read it still seems somehow a little surprising to me in a time of such prejudice that first that your grandmother became a lawyer that you became a successful lawyer and then that she got hired by this white prosecutor how'd that happen [noise]\nDon't know exactly why are you hired her but higher her who did the downside was that after do we've hired her she said about again trying to win\nI Know but do we wanted to investigate it for murder\nOr some ... what he considered a serious crime but at the same time the only woman in only black person on his staff my grandmother Eunice or do we assigned to look into prostitution even though he made clear that he had no intention\nOf prosecuting Louisiana for prostitution because do he said he was not going to be a narrow crusader\nWhile and Eunice Carter faces the task along with these other lawyers have tried to find some way to work her way up to the top man to lucky Louisiana where did she began\nSo after Eunice was hired she was banished in a sense to the for the cubicle in this special office do we had a set up and when do we asked citizens of New York to come in and talked about organized crime in their neighborhoods\nTurned out that most of the letters and complaints were about prostitution\nAll these much come in they had to be dumped on somebody's desk and they're all dumped on union says there's a sense in which she was sidelined during the investigation\nBut she didn't want to hold her back in fact from the beginning she went over to the attack she actually put together the first evidence anyone had ever had that the mob was involved in prostitution because there was an article of faith among the police\nThat prostitution was run by small time operators and certainly the mafia was not involved Eunice set herself the task of proven otherwise and against considerable opposition including in her own office she succeeded in improving it\nI guess the method here as you start at the bottom work your way up\nSomething like that once she began together the evidence she persuaded Dewey to a range of police raids which ... was in charge of\nOn eighty a bravo one night they brought in the prostitutes the women who worked in these ... was there was a reason they arrested only the women because the women\nWere accustomed being bailed out by these men called the fixers but the rest of the fixtures too there was no one to bail them out\nThan it was to keep the women's they would turn against the fixers than to pressure the fixers so they would turn against their bosses would turn against their bosses and hope to only turn against a Louisiana enter every one surprise Unisys idea worked\nWell and how did the trial turn out\nThe trial was actually a lot of fun for the press precisely because the main witness was against Louisiana\nWere prostitutes and one of them for example the one the press had the most fun with was a woman known as Cokie flow brown reading she was noticed Cokie flow was because of her cocaine habit or when she arrived on the witness stand to testify that she'd overheard Louisiana several times\nDiscussing with the prostitution business with his aides\n[noise] she was so jittery apparently having withdrawal not having had a fix in several days that the judge three times let me interrupt her testimony in order to have a sip of brandy ... to calm her nerves\nAnd finally the defense counsel that as Lucy on his lawyer\nDemanded that she be tested for drugs to see whether she was hide during her testimony so cookie flow was taken to another room with a couple of doctors and Eunice Eunice was the only woman on the prosecution team in Louisiana team had no women\nSo she was there when the doctors examine term return to pronounce that she was a drug free and the jury obviously believe your testimony was the jury voted very quickly to convict [noise] so how does learning\nThis story changed your understanding of New York city and the Nineteen thirties or America the Nineteen thirties [noise]\nOne to take away from it is how similar in a sense America then was to America now my grandmother was on the commission was appointed by the mayor to look into the causes of the New York city riots of Nineteen forty five which began in Harlem\nAnd the commission's report if you read it today it sounds like it could be written the day it talks about mistreatment of black men by police it talks about suspicion of white people as they go into stores and talks about employment discrimination\nAll the sorts of things that people talk about today but at the same time I think part of our forgotten history is that there were people who are against all the odds in that era and even earlier made really remarkable lives for themselves but there were people who built\nA society with in the segregated world in which they could live and move and have their being as the Santa wonderful lives even at a time when so many evidence we're close to them Stephen\nCarter is the author of the new history invisible thanks so much it's been

is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin in Washington DC\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California that are more details are emerging about the disappearance of Saudi journalist ... in Turkey so gives the Washington Post contributor who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week the Washington Post\nSays it has been told by people with knowledge of the Turkish investigation into the disappearance that team\nOf fifteenth Saudi men flew into you stumble on October second hours before the show with less seen entering the consulate the post is also reporting those Fifteen meant departed stumble later that very same day on flights to Cairo and to do by NPR's Peter Kenyon is following all of this\nIn Istanbul and Peter what is standing out to you at this point is you learn more facts here\nWell I'd say the main news of the day is this publication in a in a Turkish pro government paper of both the names and photos of the Fifteen Saudi men who police say arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday as the day of the show these disappearance\nOr the paper a described them in as an assassination squad and other media are reporting that Turkey's intelligence services identified several of the men some they say are military officers including the special forces member a there's a reported Saudi intelligence officer in there and also a senior forensics expert\nTurkish TV meanwhile are airing footage\nOf ... entering the constantly on October second and of a black man leading the ... about two hours later a heading to the consul general's residence or there is a report as well that airport security X rayed the luggage of some of the Saudi men as they prepare to leave this symbol that same night\nUh X. rayed them in themselves and reportedly at the request of the intelligence service\nSearched one of the planes one of the two planes they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed it to take off but the focus seems to be on these Fifteen men and what\nThey were doing here why ... one of the two points and that both the planes\nWell that's all we know based on the information we have so far this is going to need some further explanation it's not clear why that would be the case\nWhat officials are anonymously talking about are further grisly details one tells the New York times that one of the Saudis was autopsy expert in the bones so it was used on the body after the murder\n... a bone saw talk of an assassination squad it sounds like Turkish authorities are are moving towards the theory that this is indeed was targeted murder\nYes it certainly seems that the theory they're leaning towards I don't think you can rule out the other possibility that cause Yogi was spirited out of the country\nI don't think either one has been completely ruled out yet how the Saudis of course deny any involvement with the show veep disappearance they claim he left to constantly within an hour of arriving but they say they don't have any video evidence to back that up\nTurkish police are going through their own camera footage this is from the streets outside the consulate they say so far they've seen footage of him going in but no footage of him coming out\nThey've also been invited to search the consulate building with Saudi permission that we're told could happen as early as today there is no word yet I must say an searching the consul general's residence or where the black then went eight days ago\nPeter I mean Saudi Arabian turkey weren't the best of friends right but what could if indeed this journalists were killed on Turkish soil in the Saudi Government something to do with what could this through to the relationship to be with your country\nIt would be a serious blow to relations that were already somewhat afraid I mean there's been ongoing tensions in the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and turkey quite prominently took cut our side so that hasn't helped but this would be on another level completely this is\nA beyond the pale of anything that would have happened and again as you say if it's demonstrated that this happened and the Saudis do tonight completely but it would be a big blow yeah\nAnd the u._s. always under pressure to buy something to do more put to put more pressure on Saudi Arabia which grow here\nYes a turkey is media here are kind of surprised us some headlines are showing a little bit of frustration the big ones is quote Trump I don't know anything about the ... case so far there isn't much sign that Washington is exerting pressure on Riyadh Cosby us investigators to join the probe are happening uh let's see if something like that occurs\nNPR's Peter Kenyon thanks Peter thanks\nOh\nThe largest oil company any lessons encouraging attacks on the dairy products that makes executives at Exxon Mobil and announce that the company will contribute one million dollars over the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could the snake on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nExxon Mobil contribution was supportive group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg bird will send them to climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nThat's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon though bird will soon as group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBernstein says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nMyrtle ... says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's an unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nIn mobile supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions fertile since says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon evidence plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen James Baker the third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House\nOne carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully ... to consumers\nBurton says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nWith Republicans in particular there's an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it is a step\nThat's Vin Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist and political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but Weber says where the president in the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way of sugar coating it or Republicans today to embrace any new tax is difficult and since President Trump was elected particularly attacks that focuses on fossil fuels is even more difficult\nGreg brutal sudden acknowledges the challenges and says the carbon tax has always been viewed as a longer term effort but he says he thinks his group's carbon dividend proposal will become viable sooner than many people expect John Ydstie NPR News Washington\nThis is NPR News\nAnd now an update from ...
