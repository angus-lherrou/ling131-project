adverse consequences from that warming grow quite a bit\nWith the adverse consequences actually look like\nThere are places where it will become more difficult to grow our crops it'll become too hot and too dry there's places in the world that are already water stressed and that water stress will increase quite a bit with additional warming\nHeat waves we've seen quite a few heat waves in the U.S and around the world this year people die and heat waves\nAs the temperatures go up those heat waves become more extreme than more frequent and unless we take action then the projections suggest more people die and heat waves\nSeveral governments speaking of action several governments asked the United nations to put this report together what will you tell them they need to do\nThe report lays out very clearly where we stand with respect to the risks of a changing climate what those risk how those Russell changes temperatures go up and the various options\nTo both adapt to what's going on and
