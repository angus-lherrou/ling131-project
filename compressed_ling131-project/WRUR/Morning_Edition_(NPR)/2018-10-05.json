confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court now however that vote goes\nIt is certainly not going to be the end of the story exactly a year ago today Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual assault in an investigation into New York times the me too movement is radically changing discourse around women and sexual harassment the Kavanaugh nomination\nHas led to another movement and hash tag the hash tag believe survivors movement now our next guest has some complicated feelings about that Emily Yoffe is a contributing editor at the Atlantic and she wrote a piece titled the problem with hashtag believe survivors and she joins us this morning thanks for taking the time\nTo be here so why did you decide to write this piece\nI Am a big supporter of me to of women especially what we're seeing long silence women come forward and tell their stories\nI think it's all to the good although it's causing a lot of wrenching conversation\nAnd people who come forward absolutely need support from loved one's family friends a therapeutic community if they see that out and they should be believed within that community\nMy concern is that this hash tag cannot apply when a specific man is accused and some kind of adjudication investigation or life altering effects happened\nWe simply can't believe one party over another uh just on the basis of someone coming forward that is not how justice works\nSo ... what are you asking for practically I mean how do you both tell women and tell survivors of sexual assault that they will be believed that come forward but then also a but we're not sure that this man did this you've got to show the evidence like ... how do you\nHow do you handle that\nWell as I say that I that we're hearing a lot of testimony from women saying here is something that happened to me and\nThey're leaving in at that and and they've been interesting stories from women saying I'm not going to name this person this happened a long time ago I thought about it it's not going to do\nA any good to disrupt his life or mine okay so that's one set of uh issues\nAnd that is a fairly self contained but as we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings\nWhen someone is accused\nWe need some way to weigh the two sides because sometimes we have men we've seen in the me too movement saying or as Lucy Kate yep what these women said is right I did it\nUh often times we don't ah and I think we can draw some concerning lessons from campus where over the past six years or so uh there's been kind of a revolution in title nine this is the federal law\nThat ah governs that that means no a sex discrimination on campus and under this has been a a an effort to in an effort to eliminate sexual assaults on campus and what could be more worthy [noise]\nA lot of miss justices have\nAnd systems have been put in place that are fundamentally unfair\nMiss justices you're you're saying most justices I mean that the accused of have not been treated fairly and I know this is something you have written a lot about ah when this happened on college campuses what what what happens to be accused what have you seen happen on college campuses these days you know just\nIf you ...\nForward with a report of a sexual misconduct against you whoever does that is entitled to support advocacy help and the people charged with doing that should the leaf you and help you\nBut that can't to bleed over into the investigation and advocacy process and unfortunately that happened that same point of view the accuser is telling the truth\nAnd we don't believe he accused became kind of a fundamental underpinning for a lot of these uh adjudication\nI'm young men who say they were grossly and unfairly treated had been bringing lawsuits by the hundreds and they've been increasingly a meeting with success in the courts with the court saying wait a minute this is America you can have systems\nAre based on a a pre determined assumption I at the end of the day I mean\nThat the central question really seems to be is there a way to protect the accused will still encouraging women to be able to speak up about what could be painful and humiliating experiences I mean how do you\nProtect the accused without sending a message to survivors that it's basically you've got to prove it\nThat's the question isn't it [laughter]\nI don't have the final answer\nIn some ways we can look at this Kavanaugh wrenching Kavanaugh experience as what we don't want to do and in a little partial way\nMaybe what we do want to do because once I'm Dr Christine Blasey Ford reluctantly came forward\nI think the country was helped by having\nA public process a process where in which she could tell her story now it is an adversarial process and there was attempt to knock her story that's what happens but I felt at the end of the day\nUm they didn't chip away at her and her credibility remained intact in it I I thought it was really helpful to hear the account of of someone who said she has been through this\nI'm equally a lot of people were a distressed by the uh extreme anger and aggressiveness\nA and partisan attacks of Brett Kavanaugh now he was entitled to be very angry I have spoken to many young men who've been through this process on campus\nTheir lives have all been profoundly changed even people who were cleared a say they'll never be the same so it's one thing to express your anguish about what happened it's another to go on an absolute endless attack\nAnd lawyers I've spoken to said if their clients had acted like this on campus they would have been ... bought found responsible for what they were accused of\nEmily Yoffe is a contributing editor at the Atlantic thank you so much for taking the time for us this morning really appreciate it thank you David [noise]\n\n\nThis is NPR News\nIt's now five forty two and now when update from ... News Good morning I'm Beth Adams\nThe city of Rochester has joined a growing number of cities to celebrate indigenous people's day mayor lovely war and made the announcement yesterday indigenous peoples table coincide with Columbus Day on Monday\nBut there is a debate among Native Americans and local Italian Americans over how to celebrate the two heritage heritage is that is\nThat what you're ... making Mac has the story\nI guess we have to peacefully coexist\nWith rising construction and labor costs than less gas being used in more fuel efficient cars the purchasing power of the gas taxes now sixty four percent less than it was in Nineteen Ninety three\nIllinois transportation secretary Randy blanket horn says that stagnant federal gas tax means less money to fix and improve his state's highways bridges in transit systems\nWere losing revenue another day just because of inflation\nWithout new federal money the cap of what we can do is there we are right now simply maintaining what we have so Kevin\n... the national conference of state legislatures says while Congress won't raise the federal gas tax states are taking action themselves\nAnd the last five years we've seen many states more than half of them actually enact legislation to increase funding for transportation\nSince two thousand ten thirty three states have raised their own motor fuel taxes Missouri could joined them next month the voters approve a ten cents a gallon gas tax hike at Colorado voters are being asked to raise the sales tax to boost transportation funding\nAnd many states are also now indexing the gas tax to inflation so it'll go up as construction costs rise\nSome states are also trying alternatives to the gas tax like mileage based user fees that will tax electric cars that also where down roads but don't use gas\nStaying with that Groundhog Day theme Congress does hold hearings from time to time on ways to hike federal funding for transportation but there's almost never vote ears Nevada congresswoman Dena Titus at one such hearing almost two years ago\nWere having the same conversation that same rhetoric named ... structure we need to look at the answer is just a matter of paying for it but there's no substance implant\nSo when it comes to congressional inaction on transportation funding and the late baseball legend Yogi Berra might say it's deja vu all over again David Schaper NPR News\nChicago earlier this year Apple's chief financial officer said the company would buy back shares of stock one hundred billion dollars worth while\nWhen you have a trillion dollar company you can do that this is part of a bigger trend of American companies engaging in stock buybacks to explain what exactly they are and why they're sometimes controversial return to rain or counted Stacey Vanek Smith of the Planet Money team before\nWe get into the whole debate over by that we should explain what they are probably\nOkay it's when a company decides it's going to buy its own stock and it finds that stock from the people who own the stock from\nIts shareholders and the company will pay its shareholders little premium for those shares so why do companies do this we put this question to John Cochran\nI'm a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford and I also have a blonde the grumpy economist\nAnd here's what grumpy John says about buybacks\nA company makes a lot of profits either 'cause they're you know apple and Facebook and money is pouring in the front door or the corporate tax cut increase their profits so they got money sitting around\nYou're seeing a sign of our company will manage that they're not going to take this dream of profits and make crazy investments they don't know how to make they're going to give it back to the owners\nSo they can give cash back to the owners AKA the company's shareholders which is fine right I mean it's better than wasting the money\nThen or Paladino is an economist at the Roosevelt Institute\nShe says that when companies are giving all of their extra cash to shareholders it means they're not investing more money in workers' she looked specifically at what Wal Mart could have done with the money it's planning to spend on buybacks and twenty Eighteen\nShe calculated it could've increased the pay of one million full time workers I about ten thousand dollars per year\nSo when Walmart says they really can't afford to pay their workers so that families can live above the poverty line we have to look at what they're using their money for and say that that's simply not true\nBut John ... says companies are supposed to answer to their shareholders it's actually their duty is not their duty he says to benefit the wider economy\nThe point of the company has to make money on behalf of its shareholders this does benefit workers because when a company is run efficiently it has to hire people and it has to make those people productive\nAnd in the end high productivity is higher wages are are beat up but I think it's a misunderstanding to think that the company makes money and then decides who to give presents to and maybe give presents to workers or maybe give presents to owners or maybe decides to give a bonus to the electric company just to be nice to them [noise] ah it's just not how it works\nSo well this debate has been happening by the accent grown by a lot back in the early eighties ran rules around buybacks wherever lacks by the Reagan Administration company isn't as in the five hundred we're spending about four percent of their profits on buybacks in the past few years when our says that's jumped to more than fifty percent\nIt'll be probably one trillion dollars spent on stock buybacks this year that's more than President Obama spent on the Recovery Act and that's just in twenty Eighteen alone\nStock buybacks have come under increasing scrutiny from leaders on Wall street and even for lawmakers in fact a few months ago legislation was introduced Senate that would restrict stock buybacks and take us right back to the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nRain or going to smoke more support from Planet Money comes from transfer

victim of a conspiracy of Democrats seeking revenge on behalf of the Clintons yesterday the nominees vaguely backed off of that assertion saying that he said some things you shouldn't have and his public testimony although we did not specify what those things were\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal is on the Senate Judiciary committee which has been considering Kavanaugh's nomination which now goes before the full Senate Senator good morning\nGood morning you thank you for having me so\nLet's note that you ever had an opportunity as other senators have to view the FBI report the additional background information are looking into the allegations against Kavanaugh what did you see\nWhat's most striking about this report is what\nAre you do interviews with some of the really key witnesses including occupy the Ford and judge Kavanaugh themselves as well as other eyewitness [noise]\nThere is evidence that should lead should have been followed answers that should have been thought and it has all the appearance is white\nLet let me just ask about that senator because although it is true that there's not a very large number of witnesses who ride to a who are identified and interviewed mark judge was interviewed\nAnd that is the individual that Dr bluffing Ford said was in the room at the time of this sexual assault they hadn't been interviewed before just made a a general statement denying any knowledge now he's been interviewed by the professionals did they find anything\nWell I Can't go into what was found and what's in the report but let me just speak generally\nEvery interview conducted by the FBI\nLeads to additional witnesses and information\nThat actually pursued it is a great journalist with NPR pursue leave after they hear them in interviews so do the FBI is what happened here was that the FBI was certainly a scribe\nAs to who they could interview and how long they add and as a result we have a very incomplete and inadequate forward\nReading granting that is it a correct statement made by Republicans when they say they're still is no corroboration of the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee capital\nThat's incorrect so is the contention that there is no hint of misconduct there is a matter of public record powerful testimony in this interview although it's not in court if in the interview from\nDeborah Ramirez and the specific eyewitness than other leads that should have been pursued about her are nowhere here including by the way at Connecticut constituent who had information about judge Kavanaugh reaching out\nTo some of those witnesses in an apparent effort\nShape their intentions to a New Yorker interview and\nThat will let me just contradicted and let me just to untangle that and the minute that we have left here or there have been some allegations some suggestions that there may have been contact between Brett Kavanaugh people close to him and Deborah\nRamirez and people close to her before that story was revealed a it's our understanding that Republicans have looked at that evidence and not found anything there there's some text messages that are subject to interpretation are you a legendary solid evidence that Kavanaugh himself was involved in some kind of cover up\nThere's certainly evidence of that outreach but here are two important points first of all this report should be made public\nSo you and I can't engage in a real conversation and so that the contention making can order by pointing to parts of the report second this issue of temperament has now come to the fore especially after John Paul Stevens yesterday the former Supreme Court justice\nSaid that his performance at the committee last Thursday was disqualifying the self hitting arrogant\nAcrimonious

not have any evidence to back up their accusation he was put out before the American people to defend himself against really egregious charges and make complete sense that he was upset at

Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual assault\nIn an investigation into New York times the me too movement is radically changing discourse around women and sexual harassment but Kavanaugh nomination has led to another movement and hash tag the hash tag believe survivors movement now our next guest has some complicated feelings about that\nEmily Yoffe is a contributing editor at the Atlantic and she wrote a piece titled the problem with ... believes survivors and she joins us this morning thanks for taking the time\nGlad to be here so why did you decide to write this piece I\nAm a big supporter of me to of women especially what we're seeing long silence women come forward and tell their stories\nI think it's all to the good although it's causing a lot of French in conversation\nAnd people who come forward absolutely need support from loved one's family friends a therapeutic community if they think that out and they should be believed within that community\nMy concern is that this hash tag cannot apply when a specific man is accused and some kind of education investigation or life altering effects happen\nWe simply can't believe one party over another uh just on the basis of someone coming forward that is not how justice works\nSo ... what are you asking for practically I mean how do you both tell women and tell survivors of sexual assault that they will be believed if they come forward\nBut then also a but we're not sure that this man did this you've got to show the evidence for what how do you how do you handle that\nWell as I say that I that we're hearing a lot of testimony from women saying here's something that happened to me and\nThey're leaving in at that and and there have been interesting stories from women saying I'm not going to name this person this happened a long time ago\nI thought about it it's not going to do a any good to disrupt his life or mine okay so that's one set of uh issues and that is a fairly self contained but as we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings\nWhen someone is accused\nWe need some way to weigh the two sides because sometimes we have men we've seen in the me too movement saying a as Lucy Kate yup what these women said is right I did it\nUh often times we don't ah and I think we can draw some concerning lessons from campus where over the past six years or so uh there's been kind of a revolution in title nine this is the federal law\nThat ah governs that that means no a sex discrimination on campus and under this has been a a an effort to in an effort to eliminate sexual assaults on campus and what could be more worthy [noise]\nA lot of miss justices have happened and systems have been put in place that are fundamentally unfair\nMiss justices or you're saying most justices I mean the the accused of have not been treated fairly and I know this is something you have\nWritten a lot about ah when this is happening on college campuses what what what happens to be accused what have you seen happen on college campuses these are but I'm just\nIf you come forward with a report of a sexual misconduct against you whoever does that is entitled to support advocacy help and the people charged with doing that should believe you and help you\nBut that can't to bleed over into the investigation an advocacy process and unfortunately that happened that same point of view the accuser is telling the truth\nAnd we don't believe the accused became kind of a fundamental underpinning for a lot of these uh adjudication\nI'm young men who say they were grossly and unfairly treated had been bringing lawsuits by the hundreds and they've been increasingly a meeting with success in the courts with the court saying wait a minute this is America you can have systems\nAre based on a a pre determined assumption I at the end of the day I mean\nThat the central question really seems to be is there a way to protect the accused while still encouraging women to be able to speak up about what could be painful and humiliating experiences I mean how do you protect the accused without\nSending a message to survivors but it's basically you've got to prove it\nThat's the question isn't it [laughter] I don't have the final answer\nIn some ways we can look at this Kavanaugh wrenching Kavanaugh experience as what we don't want to do and in a little partial way\nMaybe what we do want to do because once I'm Dr Christine Blasey Ford reluctantly came forward\nI think the country was helped by having\nA public process a process where in which she could tell her story now it is an adversarial process\nAnd there was attempt to knock her story that's what happens but I felt at the end of the day um they didn't chip away at her and her credit\nBloody remained intact in it I I thought it was really helpful to hear the account of of someone who said she has been through this\nI'm equally a lot of people were\nA distressed by the uh extreme anger and aggressiveness a and partisan attacks uh Brett Kavanaugh now he was entitled to be very angry I have spoken to many young men\nWho've been through this process on campus\nTheir lives have all been profoundly changed even people who were cleared\nA say they'll never be the same so it's one thing to express your anguish about what happened it's another to go on an absolute endless attack and lawyers I've spoken to said if their clients had acted like this on campus they would have been ... found responsible for what they were accused of\nEmily Yoffe is a contributing editor at the Atlantic thank you so much for taking the time for us this morning

percent less than it was it Nineteen Ninety three\nIllinois transportation secretary Randy blanket horn says that stagnant federal gas tax means less money to fix and improve his state's highways bridges in transit systems\nWere losing revenues other guys just because of inflation without new federal money for half of what we can do is there we are right now simply maintaining what we have\nSo Kevin ... the national conference of state legislatures says while Congress won't raise the federal gas tax states are taking action themselves\nIn the last five years we've seen many states more than ...\nI'm actually an act legislation to increase funding for transportation\nIn two thousand and ten thirty three states have raised their own motor fuel taxes Missouri could join them next month the voters approve of ten cents a gallon gas tax hike at Colorado voters are being asked to raise the sales tax to boost transportation funding\nIn many states are also now indexing the gas tax to inflation so it'll go up as construction costs rise\nSome states are also trying alternatives to the gas tax like mileage based user fees that will tax electric cars that also we're down roads but don't use gas\nStaying with that Groundhog Day theme Congress does hold hearings from time to time a ways to hike federal funding for transportation but there's almost never vote ears Nevada congresswoman Dena Titus at one such hearing almost two years ago\nWere having the same conversation that same rhetoric need to fix the infrastructure we need to look at this is just a matter of paying for it but there's no substantive plant\nSo when it comes to congressional inaction on transportation funding in the late baseball legend Yogi Berra might say it's deja vu all over again David Schaper NPR News Chicago\nEarlier this year Apple's chief financial officer so the company would buy ... shares of stock one hundred billion dollars worth while\nWhen you have a trillion dollar company you can do that this is part of a bigger trend of American companies engaging in stock buybacks to explain what exactly they are and why they're sometimes controversial return to rain or counted Stacey Vanek Smith of the Planet Money team\nBefore we get into the whole debate over buybacks we should explain what they are probably\nOkay it's when a company decides is going to buy its own stock and if that stock from the people who own the stock from\nIts shareholders and gender the company will pay its shareholders little premium for those shares so why do companies do this we put this question to John Cochran\nI'm a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford and I also have a blog grumpy economists\nAnd here's what grumpy John says about buybacks\nA company makes a lot of profits either 'cause they're you know apple and Facebook and money is pouring in the front door or the corporate tax cut increased above so so they got money sitting around\nYou're seeing a sign of our company will manage that they're not going to take this dream of profits in may crazy investments they don't automatic they're going to give it back to the owners\nSo they can give cash back to the owners AKA the company's shareholders which seems fine right I mean it's better than wasting the money\nWhen or how do you know is an economist at the Roosevelt Institute\nShe says that when companies are giving all of their extra cash to shareholders it means they're not investing more money in workers' she looked specifically at Wal Mart could have done with the money it's planning to spend on buybacks and twenty Eighteen\nShe calculated it could have increased the pay of one million full time workers by about ten thousand dollars per year so when Walmart says they really can't afford to pay their workers\nSo that families can live above the poverty line we have to look at what they're using their money for and say that that's simply not true\nBut John Cochran says companies are supposed to answer to their shareholders it's actually their duty is not their duty he says to benefit the wider economy\nThe point to a company has to make money on behalf of its shareholders this does benefit workers because when a company is run efficiently it has to hire people and it has to make those people productive\nAnd in the end high productivity is hell wages are are beat up but I think it's a misunderstanding to think that the company makes money and then decides who to give presents to and maybe give presents to workers or maybe it gets prisons to owners or maybe decides to give a bonus to the electric company just to be nice to them [noise] ah it's just not how it works\nSo well this debate has been happening buybacks have grown by a lot back in the early eighties ran rules around buybacks were relaxed by the Reagan Administration companies in the S. and P. five hundred we're spending about four percent of their profits on buybacks\nIn the past few years Lenore says that's jumped to more than fifty percent\nIt will be probably one trillion dollars spent on stock buybacks this year that's more than President Obama spent on the Recovery Act and that's just in twenty Eighteen alone\nSeek stock buybacks have come under increasing scrutiny from leaders on Wall street and even from lawmakers in fact a few months ago legislation was introduced in the Senate\nThat would restrict buybacks and take us right back to the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nRain or going this is a much\nSupport from Planet Money comes from transfer live a service that helps

Ford and judge Kavanaugh themselves as well as other eyewitnesses\nThere is evidence that should have been pursued leads that should have been followed answers that should have been thought and it has all the appearance of a white water\nAnd let let me just ask you about that senator because although it is true that there's not a very large number of witnesses who ride or who are identified and interviewed\nMark judge was interviewed we're told and that is the individual that Dr bluffing Ford said was in the room at the time of this sexual assault hadn't been interviewed before just made a a general statement denying any knowledge now he's been interviewed by the professionals did they find anything\nWell I Can't go into what was found and what's in the report but let me just speak generally\nEvery interview conducted by the FBI leads to additional witnesses and information\nThat has to be pursued it is a great journalist with NPR\nPursue leads after they hear them in interviews so do the FBI agents what happened here was that the FBI was certainly a scribe as to who they could interview and how long they add and as a result we have a very incomplete and inadequate report\nReading granting that is it a correct statement made by Republicans when they say they're still is no corroboration of the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee capital\nThat's incorrect so is the contention that there is no hand of misconduct there is a matter of public record powerful\nTestimony in this interview although it's not in court if in the interview from\nDeborah Ramirez and the specific eye witness than other leads that should have been pursued about or are nowhere here including by the way it Connecticut constituent who had information that judge Kavanaugh reaching out\nSome of those witnesses in an apparent effort\nTo shape their intentions to a New Yorker interview and that will\nLet me just contradicts and let me just untangle that and the minute that we have left here or there have been some allegations some suggestions that there may have been contact between Brett Kavanaugh people close to him\nAnd Deborah Ramirez and people close to her before that story was revealed a it's our understanding that Republicans have looked at that evidence and not found anything there there's some text messages that are subject to interpretation or you alleging there is solid evidence that Kavanaugh himself was involved in some kind of cover up\nThere's certainly evidence of that outreach but here too important points first of all this report should be made public so you and I\nCan't engage in a real conversation and so that the contention them making can eat the border by pointing to parts of the report second this issue of temperament has now come to the fore especially after John Paul Stevens yesterday the former Supreme Court justice\nSaid that his performance at the committee last Thursday was disqualify a self hating arrogant\nAcrimonious threatening demeanor that he brought to the court in many ways on math\nThe judge and showed us the real man\nWill have to stop the conversation there is so much to say and some of you will get to say it on the Senate floor of this morning senator Blumenthal thanks very much thank you that's Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut\nFirst lady Melania Trump has been touring the
