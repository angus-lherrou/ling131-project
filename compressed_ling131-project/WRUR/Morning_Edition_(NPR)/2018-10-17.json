into recession\nAnd interesting here Steve the presidents obviously an equal opportunity said critic he calls the Federal Reserve loco and out of control when stocks are falling as they were last week and\nHe's just as vocal in his criticism about rising interest rates when stocks rebound as they did yesterday you did hear him not there to the feds independence saying he hasn't taken his criticism to Jay pal or directly but some observers including pals predecessor Janet Yellen say the Fed's outs of say the president's outspokenness on this\nCould make the Fed's job harder certainly the fed has been very transparent in telegraphing its plan to raise interest rates but that does raise costs for debtors\nIncluding the federal government who's deficit ballooned in the last twelve months by Seventeen percent and is on pace to hit a trillion dollars in the coming year\nOh well let's talk about that because Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader Senate Republican leader has been discussing that you suddenly concerned about the deficit let's listen to him talking to Bloomberg\nIs very disturbing and it's it's ruined by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid\nUm excuse me are those the things that have increased the deficit recently Scott Horsley\nNo those are certainly big parts of the federal budget but the immediate cause of a spike in the deficit is the GOP tax cut a corporate tax receipts last year plunged by thirty one percent and a boost in both military and domestic spending including interest on that\nIs there something familiar here Democrats have said this is the essential Republican playbook you cut taxes that increases the deficit and then you say oh my goodness I'm worried about the deficit time to cut entitlement programs\nYes and and Democrats were very critical saying that McConnell was playing by that play book in his comments yesterday worth noting that President Trump's

people in the last week and it's now threatening to spread the Congo's neighbors Rwanda and you've gone to the world Health Organization plans to meet today to determine whether this current outbreak rises to a public health emergency of international concern\nOkay those are just words but they could mean a lot of especially since health officials are trying to find out how to fight this disease you know war torn country NPR's resides in men is covering this story good morning good morning so supposedly go ahead and declare a public health emergency what does that mean in practical terms well\nIt's mostly a symbolic sounding the alarm but it's it's particularly effective way of galvanizing public awareness it's a way to rally international support and focus and even action for on things like funding for example\nAnd it's worth noting that the Daily Show has only declared this kind of emergency on a four times\nSince the start of this alert system I'm most recently in twenty sixteen Wednesday corrupted in Latin America\nAnd then before that on during the twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen Ebola outbreak in West Africa that\nAre infected twenty eight thousand people\nOkay that was an appalling outbreak uh is something happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo the risks rising to that level\n[noise] well one of the the key issues is that this particular outbreak is taking place in a part of the country where there has been\nFierce fighting between rebel groups and the government and there's been an uptick in attacks by rebel groups on on government forces on peace keepers\nAnd also on civilians um and ah and what's happened is that people who for years had felt abandoned by their government and international community because of these attacks\nUm started to turn against the health workers I'm sort of seeing them as a you know an arm of the government that is not protecting them from the violence\nWow so it is not just that it's difficult for health workers to get into a chaotic place or a generally unsafe place they themselves have been targets in recent months\nSo it's not so much yeah at the health workers had been targets by the rebel groups but it's that the population has started to distressed at the health workers um\nSo and and I should say it's you know a small group of people in the overwhelmingly the population is cooperating we've had Seventeen thousand people more than that um who have\nTaken this experimental vaccine um\nBut you know there are these pockets of resistance where you have people who um you know there were rumors that the vaccinators are actually part of a plot to split spread the disease or you'll have safe burial teams come in and I'm In a one or two times a week um there'll be a an attack on the safe burial team um\nAnd then you know when there's an attack on the civil a civilian population by the rebel group they'll sometimes neighborhoods are entire cities will declare a day of mourning in protest where everything is shut down and there's protests and health workers just can't get around\nThe re thanks very much really appreciate it to do it as NPR's ... reporting today on the possibility of

EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I knew well king good morning we're going to turn now to recent developments in the economy\nBecause there have been a lot of them the federal deficit grew to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars in the two thousand and Eighteen fiscal year that's according to new numbers from the Treasury Department and it is a Seventeen percent jump from twenty Seventeen\nAnd President Trump went on Fox Business network yesterday where he said the U.S would start reducing spending but he also turned to a familiar complaint the Federal Reserve he called the fed quote his biggest enemy and said nominating Jerome Powell to lead it may have been a mistake\nIt's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going to visit\nDavid Wessel is joining us now he's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and he contributes to the wall Street Journal good morning David warning or so the president\nHas colorfully criticized the fed before but calling their the Federal Reserve his biggest enemy is something new um is critique is it they're raising interest rates to aggressively does he have a point\nI think it's very hard to argue that the fed has raised interest rates too much so far\nAfter all the Fed's interest rates are around two percent pretty low even though on employment is that a fifty year low and inflation is starting to creep up but I think there are people who argue that the fed is preparing to go too fast or expectations are they'll raise interest rates perhaps another in a percentage point twenty Nineteen\nAnd some people think that's more that's needed given that there's not much inflation and not much of a wage increase going on\nOur end the president appears to be in that camp let's turn to this uh this growing deficit seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars and some lawmakers immediately came out and blamed the Republican tax cuts here's a democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen talking to budget committee hearing last month\nThe story deficits or highly unusual given the fact that the economy has been growing for more than nine years when you look under this you find a number of elements\nOf but one thing uh that jumped out in this most recent report is the corporate tax receipts have fallen by thirty percent in the aftermath of the passage of the Republican tax bill\nI mean David advocates of these tax cuts said look they're going to pay for themselves because cutting business taxes spurs economic growth are we seeing that play out and and it is that argument wrong\nWell look the economy is growing pretty well but revenues total revenue have not gone up an at all so the case that the deficit grew because we cut taxes a lot\nIs clearly supported by the facts it's what the congressional budget office in other um uh you know arbiter say\nI think the case that I'm cutting taxes which for growth is untested because that argument really was a long run one that businesses would invest more of the economy will grow faster overtime and that would offset the cost of some or all of the tax cuts that's not something that can happen instantly\nAre at that that that argument may be jumping the gun a bit Republicans though blame a government spending for the deficit here Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell talking to Bloomberg TV yesterday\nIt's very disturbing images drew in bed at ... programs that are verbal or Medicare or Social Security and Medicaid Dutch Seventy percent of what we spend over here does he have a\nPoint [noise] well I think that uh Seventy percent is wrong at Social Security Medicare and Medicaid or fifty percent of the federal budget you have to throw in all benefits including farm benefits veterans and interests\nThe debt to get to Seventy percent but he does have a point we have a deficit because we spend more than we take in and the big drivers of government spending as a society ages\nOver the next decade are going to be retirement and health programs we're not going to fix the deficit without touching them in my opinion and without touching taxes at the same time David Wessel of the Brookings Institution thinks David\nYou're welcome this fall's election comes in several parts before the fight to win votes there was a fight over who was allowed to vote in Georgia the Republican candidate for governor also has the office that has been purging voter rolls\nAnd then there's the fight over how people may vote early voting starts today in North Carolina and it's so popular that more than half of North Carolina votes were cast early in two thousand sixteen\nFor two thousand Eighteen lawmakers altered the rules in ways that could lower turnout here's Alexandra old and a member station WFDD\nTo prepare for early voting elections director Adam Reagan in Gaston county just north of Charlotte is testing voting machines by running sample ballot through them [noise]\nThese machines were meant to be in five early voting locations throughout the county but the new law requires\nAll sites within a county to be open from seven AM to seven PM during the week and as a result Reagan can only open recites the election\nEarly but he was very popular and gifts to county and and\nI Would have loved to have more early voting locations it came down to having more locations you know helping more voters versus are this year he responsibility to the county\nSome democratic lawmakers see this as another attack on voting rights in a state where a voter id redistricting and early voting rules have all been struck down by the courts at various points in the last few years\nDuring a June debate about early voting democratic state representative Amos Quick said the requirement that if one side is open on the weekend the rats also have to be could discourage counties from having any weekend hours\nWeekend early voting as they were for and has been for a certain population and certain religion Jews right to vote not only in our life has been rejected in recent court decision\nHe's referring to black voters and appeals court ruled a twenty Thirteen law that among other things caught early voting by a week targeted African Americans with quote surgical precision but Republicans who champion this law argue they're only trying to minimize confusion here a state representative David Lewis also during the June debate\nWhat we stood out what to do was to be able to make you more reliable in June ... dog voters would know that the early voting sites or side they're counting was open from ... I'm In the morning on the evening\nThe law has some bipartisan opposition Ron why it is the Republican Party chair of Irish ... county about fifty miles north of Charlotte the county has had to cut its early voting sites and half frustrated just word we'll go we'll use and he says even though this may not seem like an unfunded mandate\nThat's exactly what it translates to being at the end of the\nRural counties with smaller election budgets like ... are disproportionately affected by this change well individual locations maybe open longer they released Seventeen percent fewer sites that election MIT political scientist Charles Stuart the third says that for voters convenience Trump's hours\nAnd there's a lot of research that's been done that suggests that whenever you move a polling place further away from a voter that are less likely to vote there\nStewart says the real change could simply shift turn out to election day which could mean longer lines at the polls in his state or voting rights have become such a political hot potato elections officials say they just go with the flow Becky Gallup Harris the elections director in ... county\nDue to court cases legislation all of that kind of thing factors in and it just seems like we always has something ... and that takes us in a different direction\nThe question remains will voters adapt as easily for NPR News I'm Alex ... [noise]\nIt's five forty to this is double the ... News Good morning I'm Beth Adams\nAccording to the latest pull the race to fill the congressional seat long held by the lately we slaughter has tightened up bad Democrat Joe morality is still leading Republican Dr Jim Maxwell by Seventeen points but that's down from a twenty four point edge in August the spectrum news Sienna college poll released this morning\nSays Maxwell has less than two thirds of Republicans backing him well morale really\nHas the support of a quarter of Republican voters\nAnd none of them have economic us right [laughter]\nThat's my next on Iraq but none of them had ever set foot in a recording booth and interviewed anybody you know so it's like any\nReally proud subculture so that's the backdrop at the center of the story is a Thirteen year old named Stevie things are bad for him at home his brother beats him up he is lonely and looking for some kind of connection\nStevie sees this group of kids hanging out in front of a skate shop and instantly he feels close to their tribe it's the\nKind of closeness you can see from ten thousand miles away it's sort of a idiosyncratic perverse closeness haired with a lot of toxic masculinity and on the surface cruelty but such a deep connection and family situation\nDid you have that did you have that group of skateboarding friends\nI did I've had it in many various ways whether it was skateboarding film\nBut I definitely felt like an outsider I definitely felt like I didn't belong and\nThere's a certain person that skateboarding draws ... you know skateboarding now is such a it's going to be an Olympic sport for God's so mainstream but when I started skateboarding it was not cool and society really look down on you as a nuisance\nOne of the things I loved about it was the non judgmental and this in certain ways escape orders and I think that created a lens that I saw life through whether it was sense of humor musical taste cinema taste it really was an ethic an aesthetic for me that I carry with me to this day\nThere was something about maybe it's just me but it was the Potter of how the guys talk to each other and maybe that's universal like this is how adolescent boys are with each other they are stupid [noise] with\nYeah and the only thing that's ever even come close it's been such a magical experience showing this film because it is my heart it is my heart and my soul\nAnd the point zero one percent were someone views the toxic masculinity or the homophobia as me thinking that's funny right has been heartbreaking because\nIt was done so intentionally to hold a mirror up to how people in this generation grew up in the changes we're having to make in the wrong lessons we've learned to me they speak so aggressively about women and gay people that it's it's\nThat is how it was and I felt it would be way more disrespectful to change history than to show it just as it was and let the audience see how ugly it feels\nOur pop culture critic here at NPR Linda Holmes said this about the film quote it felt like a salute to how toxic masculinity makes boys feel included which is true she writes but not sweet as he'll seems to find it\nHow do you respond to that\nI just disagree I found that it was connective tissue which is unfortunate I still think these people were there for each other even though they had a lot of behavior I don't think is cool the point of the movies that nothing's black or white I'm not a more or less I'm not here to like\nTell an audience how they should feel\nI think the way they speak about women and gay people is really a messed up way to go about that and then at the end of the film they still are there for one another so I don't think anyone is purely good are purely bad I Hope to create complex characters that constantly are challenging what you think of them\nCan I ask you about the casting because they're not a lot of names that people would perhaps recognize I mean the acting is pretty phenomenal especially the star the film and the guys who play the people in his boarding tribe [laughter] oh\nReally nice I mean this singular most moving experience in my life was casting first time are not actors\nAnd they became these people and became actors in art is one of the kids all in the what the long curly hair who's very like white and fun and funny at lunch I was you know all the kids were joke around talk trash and stuff and I thought he looked really offensive and that was\nAbnormal and you feel kind of big brother leader protective over them so I was concerned and then I looked down and he had his rumpled up script under the table and he was rehearsing his lines during lunch you know and as a kid who had never thought about acting before which is so funny\nThe guys the characters are playing are struggling to be perceived like they don't care about anything it's not cool to care\nIn the nineties especially it was the lame missing ever to say that you cared or tried at least in the culture I I grew up in and what I Love about spending time with these kids now is that they are motivated and these kids give such naturalistic performances\nI and just so proud of them it's very moving\nYou got the directing bug now\nYou know my whole dream my whole life was to be a writer director I fell into this Fifteen your acting career where I got to learn from a lot of my heroes\nAnd it's something I wanted to do and would have done sooner [noise] it's just that you only get one chance to make your first film and I really wanted to wait till it was something that really meant something to me I Love this film I stand by it and\nI Hope to just keep making things that I care about that would be a great life I should be so lucky [noise]\nThe film is called mid nineties Jonah Hill is\nThanks so

have been a lot of them\nThe federal deficit grew to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars in the two thousand and Eighteen fiscal year that's according to new numbers from the Treasury Department and it is a Seventeen percent jump from twenty Seventeen\nAnd President Trump went on Fox Business network yesterday where he said the U.S would start reducing spending but he also turned to a familiar complaint the Federal Reserve he\nCalled the said quote his biggest enemy and said nominating Jerome Powell to lead it may have been a mistake\nIt's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast\nDavid Wessel is joining us now he's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and he contributes to the wall Street Journal good morning David good morning I said the president has colorfully criticized the fed before but calling their the Federal Reserve his biggest enemy is something new\nUm he's critique is it they're raising interest rates to aggressively does he have a point\nI think it's very hard to argue that the fed has raised interest rates too much so far after all the Fed's interest rates are around two percent pretty low even though unemployment is at a fifty are low and inflation is starting to creep up\nBut I think there are people who argue that the fed is preparing to go too fast or expectations are they'll raise interest rates perhaps another in a percentage point twenty Nineteen and some people think that's more than ... needed given that there's not much inflation and not much of a wage increase going on\nBehind the president appears to be in that camp let's turn to this uh this growing deficit seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars and some lawmakers immediately came out and blamed the Republican tax cuts here's a democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen talking to budget committee hearing last month\nThe soaring deficits are\nHighly unusual given the fact that the economy has been growing for more than nine years when you look under this you find a number of elements\nOf but one thing uh that jumped out in this most recent reporters that corporate tax receipts have fallen by thirty percent in the aftermath of the passage of the Republican tax bill\nI mean David advocates of these tax cuts said look they're going to pay for themselves because cutting business taxes spurs economic growth are we seeing that play out and and it is that argument wrong\nWell look the economy is growing pretty well like revenues total revenues have not gone up an at all so the case that the deficit grew because we cut taxes a lot is clearly supported by the facts it's what the congressional budget office in other\nUh uh you know arbiter say\nI think the case that I'm cutting taxes which for growth is untested because\nThat argument really was a long run one that businesses would invest more of the economy will grow faster overtime and that would offset the cost of some or all of the tax cuts that's not something that can happen instantly\nAre at that that that argument may be jumping the gun at that Republicans though blame a government spending for the deficit Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell talking to Bloomberg TV yesterday\nIt's very disturbing images ruined by that three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend over here\nDoes he have a point [noise] well I think that uh Seventy percent is wrong at Social Security Medicare and Medicaid or fifty\nPercent of the federal budget you have to throw in all benefits including farm benefits veterans and interest on the debt to get to Seventy percent but he does have a point we have a deficit because we spend more than we take in and the big drivers of government spending as a society ages\nOver the next decade are going to be retirement and health programs we're not going to fix the deficit without touching them in my opinion and without touching taxes at the same time\nDavid Wessel of the Brookings Institution thinks David You're welcome\nYou're listening to MORNING

well and here's a quote from Diane homes said W ... my lifeline for great music and up to date news and human interest stories\nSo she's getting all of it from us and you may be getting all that to you're already a listener you know you're investing your time you know how valuable it is how much are getting back\nI Know I for me I gather you listen to every day you get so much back you know asking you just put a little bit in joined your friends and neighbors people I've talked to about\nWho have called this morning and said\nThis is so important I Need to make an investment myself I Need to be part of this\nUh maybe it's a monthly pledged five dollars ten dollars a month maybe that's easier for you if you consider the value of the news\nAnd none of them have been on the west right [laughter]\nThat's my next door but none of them had ever set foot in a recording booze interviewed anybody you know what I Do\nIt's like any really proud sub culture so that's the backdrop at the center of the story is a Thirteen year old named Stevie things are bad for him at home his brother beats him up he is lonely and looking for some\nKind of connection Stevie sees this group of kids hanging out in front of a skate shop and instantly he feels close to their tribe it's the kind of\nCloseness you can see from ten thousand miles away the it's sort of a idiosyncratic perverse closeness what haired with a lot of toxic masculinity and\nOn the surface cruelty but such a deep connection and family situation did you have that did you have that group of skateboarding friends I did I've had it in many various ways whether it was skateboarding film\nBut I definitely felt like an outsider I definitely felt like I didn't belong and\nThere's a certain person that skateboarding draws ... you know skateboarding now is such a it's going to be the only big sport for God's so mainstream but when I started skateboarding it was not cool and society really look down on you as a nuisance\nOne of the things I loved about it was the non judgmental and ... in certain ways escape orders and I think that created a lens that I saw life through whether it was sense of humor musical taste cinema taste it really wasn't ethic anesthetic for me that I carry with me to this day\nThere was something about maybe it's just me but it was the Potter of how the guys talk to each other and maybe that's universal like this is how adolescent boys are with each other they are stupid with\nYeah and the only thing that's ever even come close it's been such a magical experience showing this film because it is my heart it is my heart and my soul\nAnd the point zero one percent where someone views the toxic masculinity or the homophobia as me thinking that funny right has been heartbreaking because\nIt was done so intentionally to hold a mirror up to how people in this generation grew up in the changes we're having to make in the wrong lessons we've learned to me they speak so aggressively about women and gay people that it's it's\nThat is how it was and I felt it would be way more disrespectful to change history than to show it just as it was and let the audience to see how ugly it feels\nOur pop culture critic here at NPR Linda Holmes said this about the some quote it felt like a salute to how toxic masculinity makes boys feel included which is true she writes but not sweet as he'll seems to find it how do you respond to that\nI just disagree I found that it was connective tissue which is unfortunate I still think these people were there for each other even though they had a lot of behavior I don't think is cool the point of the movies that nothing's black or white I'm not I'm more or less I'm not here to like\nTell an audience how they should feel\nI think the way they speak about women and gay people is really a messed up way to go about that and then at the end of the film they still are there for one another so I don't think anyone is purely good are purely bad I Hope to create complex characters that constantly are challenging what you think of them\nCan I ask you about the casting because they're not a lot of names that people perhaps recognize I mean the acting is pretty phenomenal especially the star the film and the guys who play the people in his boarding tribe [laughter] oh\nThat's really nice I mean the singular most moving experience in my life was casting first time are not actors\nAnd they became these people and became actors in art is one of the kids all in the ... with the long curly hair who's very like\nWhite in fun and funny at lunch I was you know all the kids would joke around talk trash and stuff and I thought he looked really offensive and that was abnormal\nAnd you feel kind of big brother earlier protective over them so I was concerned and then I looked down and he had his like rumbled up script under the table and he was rehearsing his lines during lunch you know and as a kid who had never thought about acting before\nWhich is so funny right because the guys the characters are playing are struggling to be perceived like they don't care about anything it's not cool to care\nIn the nineties especially it was the lame missing ever to say that you cared or tried at least in the culture I I grew up in and what I Love about spending time with these kids now is that they are motivated and these kids give such naturalistic performances\nI just so proud of them it's very moving\nYou got the directing bug now\nYou know my whole dream my whole life was to be a writer director I fell into this Fifteen your acting career where I got to learn from a lot of my heroes\nAnd it's something I wanted to do and would have done sooner [noise] it's just that you only get one chance to make your first film and I really wanted to wait till it was something that really meant something to me I Love this film I stand by it and\nI Hope to just keep making things that I care about that would be a great life I should be so lucky\nThe film is called mid nineties Jonah Hill is the director thanks so much for talking with it yeah it was a pleasure thanks for having [noise]\n\nA great

challenge affirmative action a lawsuit is underway this week against Harvard University is led by a conservative activist who has no past to charge the college efforts to balance their admissions discriminate against white students\nYet the Harvard suit alleges the university is unfair to Asian applicants and should be admitted even more than it does some Asian American groups support this move\nWasher with the New Yorker has been talking with some of them is on the line mourning\nMourning how widespread is Asian American skepticism about anything that is seen as affirmative action in schools\nYou know the data shows that Asian Americans still Barclay reporter formative action but the um the groups I talk to represent\nA growing very vocal faction and our by social media out by their own and diligence is organizers they'd had quite an effectively and affecting the popular imagination of\nWhat what is the case that they make against affirmative action\n[noise] well they they're very much into a kind of number protrude mission or a or pro tradition that isn't actually offered an exercise in reality but are they view the quote unquote penalty toward Asian students\nUm in categories like the personal renting a very subjective rank and the Harvard offers mhm as a defendant cages Asian American\nOr you say numbers based do you mean to say Asian Americans a lot of them do really well on tests and so they think the testing should be the be all and end all\nYeah and some of the folks I talked to create a sort of ... because a lot of them are okay newer immigrants from mainland China or testing is very much a make or break way of social mobility\nOr they do believe that the test scores that Asian Americans get should count for more than I Am shocked features like leadership or um personal rankings\nIs this debate any different if we move away from it all the university like Harvard to a lesser league university or a workplace or housing anything else\nYou know it's an interesting question I think it is unfortunately in a way that the debate around affirmative action has whittled down to this question of Harvard 'cause Harvard is an unusual one hundred years ago string 'em when we look at work place\nA job hiring contracting a lot of people Asian American liquid are very supportive of current that so that's really provides the you'd go into the issue at all\nOkay so there's a there's a relatively narrow group of people with a relatively narrow objection at least right now because they're challenging Harvard all of this could affect affirmative action or what is seen as affirmative action across the country\nI Do want to ask one question about these activists though uh it is easy from the outside to get or give the impression that some Asian groups here are being used because they are teaming up with a conservative activist who was against affirmative action for other reasons for his own\nReasons do the Asian American opponents of affirmative action feel like they're being used\nThe folks I talked it would really bristle at such an accusation um they're very conscious of what they're doing a lot of them weren't involved in these fights far before um\nLinking up with Edward Blum so you know they have a lot of autonomy they're they're really doing what they want to do all along could be able to partner with something someone like Rick blooms sort of serendipitous for both sides\nVery briefly what is it we're bloom the activists give them that they wouldn't otherwise have\nYou know I think he he really has a long term vision he's been working a he was part of the uh the goldfish or Kate University of Texas while their cases are still going on he was already planning his next move so uh I think he's just as a level of strategy that they they didn't quite have themselves\nWash U is a staff writer at the New Yorker thanks very much for the time banks\nAre the CDC is investigating a mystery childhood illness that is on the
