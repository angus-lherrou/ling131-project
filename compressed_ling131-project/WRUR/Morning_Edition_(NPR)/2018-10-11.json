Foreign Relations Committee or triggering an investigation and requiring that the administration considers sanctions\nOn anyone responsible for the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jim ... he was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and Turkish sources say they believe he was killed their Senator Bob Corker says U.S intelligence report give further credence to the fact that the focus needs to be on Saudi Arabia and\nUm and the president as we heard in there say that he thinks the fed has gone crazy the Clinton clearly disagrees he wants to the fed to prop up uh the economy by keeping interest rates low explain why that's not necessarily a great idea\n[noise] well I mean it's not uncommon for for presidents to complain about the fed or to be unhappy with the fed when they raise rates especially if it's any time ... close to an election what is unusual for president to say the fed is going crazy um that's really unusual\nA you know if the fed has a policy where it's trying to keep this recovery going it's trying to keep inflation forget once a steady economy if you keep rates very low there's the potential the economy could overheat and fall back into recession\nRight and of course we know President Trump talks a lot about the stock market as an indicator of whether or not the overall economy is healthy and it is it isn't necessarily the best indicator but as you mentioned the elections coming up so it matters to him a lot um\nIt sure does I mean he's talked throughout his administration how about how great the economy has been or how great the stock market has been he's taken a lot of credit for that now if the stock market does go into a downturn it will be interesting to see how explains that and what what he thinks cost isn't as an\nNPR senior business editor Uri Berliner for I think sorry thanks\n[noise]\nAll right we're learning more this morning about what might have happened to the missing Saudi journalist Jamal ... he went inside the Saudi constantly in assembled assembled turkey last week and he has not been seen since\nAnd here's one new thing we have learned the Washington Post is reporting that at one point the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered agents to learn because she'll be back to Saudi Arabia from his home in the United states Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said yesterday that if if the Saudi Government was behind 'cause she'll be disappearance that would be quote a game changer\nI've never been more disturbing them right now if this did in fact happening at this man was murdered Saudi conflict is simple across every line of normality or in the international community um if it did happen it would be hell to pay\nThe Saudi officials are continuing to deny any involvement in 'cause she'll be disappearing\nAll right we have reached Koreans I came here at the Washington Post correspondent in its gamble who's been following this story closely Corinne can you just explain what exactly you have learned that U.S intelligence officials new\nHigh yeah thanks for having me as my colleague Shane Harris reported\nToday in our paper the the U.S officials\nAre citing intelligence intercepted Saudi officials discussing this plot to lure them out\nBack to Saudi Arabia we don't know for what purpose exactly um the uh and you know Jim out and told friends over the last year about numerous attempts either Saudi officials are people close to the Saudi Government\nConfirming some version of this story that he was offered jobs um or or or a short that he would be safe if he returns to the kingdom\nSo we're still learning more about this but it it adds detail to what we might know about what happened in the consulate here in this stumble\nBecause we should just say he has been a vocal critic of ... of the Saudi Government and had been living in a in the Washington DC area I mean do we know if the U.S intelligence\nOfficials gave him a heads up that they knew that that someone in Saudi was trying to get him back there perhaps to do harm to him no we don't\nWe know that um the details of this plot appear to have been widely circulated around the intelligence community but we we have no evidence yet that she was warned about this plots and there's some debate about whether there was an obligation to tell them so you are reporting\nYou and your colleagues are reporting the basically what what seems to have happened in ... sample his disappearance Sarah test how the conflict in temple may have been plan B if they couldn't lure him back from the U.S to Saudi ... what ... ... a disappearance and assemble may have may have been a the subsequent plan\nThat that's certainly one theory I mean the Turkish officials since the beginning of this case to maintain that what happened inside look to them like a premeditated killing\n'em but others are saying now that some some of the details from these intelligence intercepted um uh make it seem like make it seem possible that it also may have\nBeen an attempt to capture him and bring him back to Saudi Arabia\nI mean this is clearly complicated for the Trump Administration which has very close ties to Saudi Arabia and Mohammed bin some on the crown prince known as NBS I mean in particular you report you've got a really close relationship with Jared Kushner\nAbsolutely the um the\nUh the Trump Administration has had very close ties with a mom and been some men and they really promoted his vision hum of a transformation for the kingdom\nCome and so uh this whole episode has highlighted or the other part of mom and been southern man's rule which has been um and uh escalating repression dissidents I'm an silencing descent\nSo we'll see if the Trump Administration if someone is is it seemed to be responsible for this plot if the Trump Administration would put sanctions on Saudi Arabia [noise] um we still appreciate you sharing your reporting Corinne ... of the Washington Post

DC and I'm David Greene in Culver City California so could really be happening could a Brexit deal will be on the horizon the European Union broke the negotiator says with good will on both sides in agreement on Britain's departure from the European Union is quote with in regions comes the head of a very important summit in Brussels next week\nLots of Newman Linder grant is a former diplomat who worked on the breakfast negotiations for both ... and ... and Brussels your joins me on Skype right now the morning or good morning so is this for real I Know we've heard that the two sides have been close to something in a ... kind of falling apart what makes this moment feel different if it'll\n[noise] uh I think it is for ... and one of the things that makes a difference of course at the time is getting very nigh so it was out there is no choice to get a deal at all the deal is also the prerequisite for any sort of a trance a transition period\nSo if there is no deal then everything's going to happen overnight so I think are both sides have a very great interest in in a deal\nAnd the one thing as the deadline I mean breakfast is going to take place at the end of march but before that you're going to have to rectify the deal in all twenty seven you parliaments and the British Parliament and the European Parliament\nAnd you have to translate it and process it so you would have to be ready during November I think for it to be feasible to pull through\nYears of traveling there and say like two dozen different languages yeah so ... says the a lot of time okay you're going to say there was a second reason to think it's actually happening\nI think the second reason is is that that I mean one of the big problems in these negotiations from the beginning has been that has been taken you case so long to arrive to any position and it's been negotiating just as much much with itself as it has with the new at this summer we actually got this so called checkers proposal from the u._k. prime minister\nAnd when it was the first time that they actually made a a comprehensive package of how they see themselves leaving and what the new relationship could be an although the checkers deal is not acceptable as such I think it was really important that that was a basis for negotiations to go forward you know a lot of people\nIn Europe were just telling the u._k. just come up with something so we can get started in ... acts of working on it will be an\nExtremely frustrating I think for many parties\nCan I ask you about one sticking point um there's this determination\nTo avoid a hard border between Ireland which is part of you in Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. can you just remind us why that is so important not to have a hard border there\nI think many people in in Europe forget and how recently actually the real a peace settlement was made in in regard Northern Ireland uh this is all about the so called Good Friday agreement which is from only Nineteen eighty nine the peace agreement between um the u._k. and and the Irish Government\nAnd many of these elements depend on the fact that both areas are part of the few so if you think about the free movement of people are good across the border people being able to live where they want a all all of these elements which have to do with the integration of the area and they are about the you\nKnow when when if if when and if Northern Ireland is leaving a there is a real risk as to what is happening underground or can can hamper the implementation of disagreement and it can possibly cause a lot of conflict a locally\n... 'cause we just have a few seconds left but I mean there's been talk of maybe a new referendum in in the u._k. backing out of a breakfast if there were vote with you to Britain back\nThe used I mean the u._k. is still a member of that you\nBut it's not the same members said that he was two years ago I think a lot of China has been broken during these negotiations\nShining describe it like a a divorce but um yeah I think I think what we read how badly or out of time and have to stop there\nI mean ... is a former diplomat who worked on the record negotiation thanks a lot I\nThink he's much had to get Democrats have a slender path to take in the U.S Senate this fall they need to pick up two seats to gain a majority but they also have to defend plenty of states including one in New Jersey where incumbent Democrat Bob Menendez is facing fresh attacks about his federal corruption trial last year\nJoe Hernandez from member station W H y y report\nMenendez was fired up as he spoke to a crowd in Princeton New Jersey last month he's cast himself as a foil to President Trump whose approval ratings in the Garden State or in the thirties Jersey and I\nDon't need someone who will stand with Donald Trump they need someone who will stand up to Donald Trump\nContrast that with the Bob Menendez of ten months earlier last November he had just walked out of a federal courthouse in Newark a free man after a judge declared a mistrial and his corruption case those\nNew Jersey you gave me the benefit of that [noise] I think\nJustice Department prosecutors had accused Menendez of taking gifts and trips from a wealthy friend in exchange for political favors\nBut ended escaped legal trouble but he was officially admonished by the Senate and his poll numbers in New Jersey took a hit and it wasn't long after he announced he would run for reelection that attack ads like ... started appearing\nMendelssohn was indicted by Obama Justice department for taking hundreds\nThousands of dollars and improper again and campaign contributions Brian ... New Jersey deserves\nThat ad comes from and then this is opponent Republican Bob ... a wealthy businessman who's funding his own campaign\nYou can as a marine veteran and a political newcomer who says New Jersey should be embarrassed by Mendez earlier this year she stepped down as the head of cell gene uh New Jersey based pharmaceutical company he touts so gene as an example of a drug company that identified the patient need and satisfy to\nSell Gina's on amazing thing for cancer patients turning multiple cancer from a terminal diagnosis chronic disease\nBut critics say so gene is more like a poster child for high drug costs and shady marketing tactics Menendez has seized on that issue to discredit\nHuge corporate greed looks like drug companies ... she's about he said the more people needed drugs are in charge\nJuvenile is running as a moderate Republican he supports abortion rights and gay marriage\nHe is also supported President Trump and donated tens of thousands of dollars to elect Trump and twenty sixteen in a state where no Republican has been elected to the Senate since Nineteen Seventy two you might think you can support for Trump would tank his chances to victory in fact to recent polls show Menendez in the lead\nBut two other public polls have Menendez and you get in a dead heat confirming what some Democrats had feared that Menendez is corruption trial even though it didn't end in a conviction is turning off voters been working runs the ... Institute for public policy and citizenship\nIf you're watching these as you'd think Bob Menendez was convicted and for some reason it's not in jail\nThe question is which Bob Menendez democratic voters will be thinking about when they show up to the polls the one who's skated on federal bribery charges weren't the one who will oppose president Donald Trump for NPR News I'm Joe Hernandez\n\nAnd later today on all things considered some people have been mailing away for their genetic information and then hosting it on line to try to track down long lost relatives here a story about why that is probably a very bad idea to listen to that ask\nYour smart speaker to play NPR or ask for your local member stations I mean this is NPR News\nAnd this is Deborah ... News Good morning I'm deaf Adams it's five forty to New York state law now requires employers no matter how many workers they have to implement new sexual harassment prevention policies\nAnd to enact training for all workers by October ninth of next year the law went into effect yesterday\nEdward Steve is counsel let her see crest and Emory in Rochester he says employers he has talked to are most concerned about how the policies relate to non employees have to work site and how they can notify those workers about the policy\nIn Philadelphia I'm thinking of that old saying that where you stand is determined by where you sit when he was sitting and what we now call the White House he started seeing things differently than the perfect\nWay of putting it in Madison also knew that it would be politically useful to him and Eighteen twelve he was running for reelection to have a war that he was the biggest advocate of sounds pretty modern doesn't it\nSo James Madison is one of the presidents who gives the president a role in war making although they're still asking Congress at that point festivals let's go ahead a few decades to James Cape Polk is president of the United states in the Eighteen forties what did he do\nWell James Cape ... was a liar and achieve and a boy and he wanted the United states to have a big war\nWith Mexico and his hidden agenda was he wanted to\nGet New Mexico he wanted to get California which are owned by Mexico at that time a lot of other land and added to the United states Eighteen forty six he sent American troops down to the Texas border to provoke the Mexicans the Mexicans fought back\nAnd poked says look there's been this terrible attack on us by Mexico we need a big war Congress gladly gave it\nTo I guess we should just explain this a little more he sent troops into disputed territory between us and Mexico right\nHe did and the result was Polk had essentially fabricated an incident would allow him to go to Congress than say we need a big war with Mexico but wait\nA minute here he's still like to ask Congress Congress still had to act how did senators respond when they were challenged by this guy was essentially taking their authority away\nMany senators sad that poker is trying to cheat him they question the reason that we were going to war but they voted for this war overwhelmingly and set the pattern for the future why did they do that\nThey knew that the war would be popular they knew that many people would say the Mexicans attacked us why are we fighting back would be very hard for them to say no and that was a pattern that lasted into the future\nOkay but still at that time in history Congress was declaring war the president would ask Congress would do it if we go ahead a century to around Nineteen fifty Harry Truman is the president of the United states what happened to Nineteen fifty\nI Love Truman Steve but he did terrible thing in Nineteen fifty the north Koreans attacked the south in June of Nineteen fifty and what Truman should have done under the constitution he should have gone to Congress and said\nI had like a war declaration they would have given it to him but Truman was terrified that there'd be a big debate where he might be criticized and that might undermine him in the mid term elections\nOf Nineteen fifty so true and didn't even bother going to Congress he said I'm doing this as a police action under the United nations I don't need\nA declaration and the result of that was that Lyndon Johnson in Nineteen sixty four when he wanted his war in Vietnam said dream and didn't ask Congress I don't have to do it either and we've never had a declaration of war sense not since Nineteen forty two and that is totally in violation of the constitution what\nAre some of the consequences of this evolution increase really and presidential power when we look at the last I don't know twenty Thirty years\nThe result is a modern president nowadays can start\nA war almost singlehandedly and most of them are tempted because they know that if you've got political problems and you get the United states in World War that as popular your poll ratings were rise\nYou write early in this book\nWhere the founders to come back they would probably be astonished and should grand to discover that in spite of their Arden striving Z the life or death of much of the human race has now come to depend on the character of the single person who happens to be president of the United states\nThe founders knew but almost anyone could become president and they didn't want all of our security to rest on whoever happens to\nGet a job when you wrote that line recently did you have any particular individual in mind\nPresident Trump has often talked about starting wars for political reasons in two thousand eleven he tweeted\nPresident Obama's going to start a war with Iran in order to get reelected president he predicted that President Obama would do that that isn't about he makes the connection between war and politics that the founders never wanted to see a president make\nThe other thing is that like other presidents President Trump has ... remarked on the fact that oftentimes if you want to be considered a great president it's easier to do that if you've been commander in chief during war that has a thought that our founders would never wanted to hear from any president\nOf the recent episode I Want to ask about President Obama and two thousand Thirteen seemed on the verge of launching an attack against Syria\nSyria's use of chemical weapons I'm ready to act in the face of this outrage today I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world but we are ready to move forward together as one nation and specifically said I'm not going to do that without the approval of Congress\nIt's seen as a serious mistake and foreign policy of left to push our laws out of Syria was much more freedom would you argue that it was the right choice even though it seems to have been a mistake\nI figured it was always the right choice for president never to get into a war unless he's got Congress in ... take off he belatedly saw that that was not going to be possible and that's why he pulled back\nMichael Beschloss who's the author of presidents of war the epic story from it you know seven to modern times thanks so much fun it's great to see used

about what may have happened to the missing Saudi journalist ...\nHe entered the Saudi consulate in Danville is symbol turkey last week that much we know but he has not been seen since ... wrote for the Washington Post and had been living in the U.S\nThe post is reporting that at one point the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered Saudi agents to lure 'cause she'll get back to the country\nSaudi officials continue to deny any involvement in the show he's disappearance\nWe're joined now by Karim ... he's the Washington Post correspondent in ... who's been following this story closely thanks so much for being with ice\nCream thanks for having me you're reporting\nThat of your colleagues shows that the U.S intelligence community knew at one point the Saudi Arabia was trying to get ... back to Saudi Arabia\nUm why were they trying to get them back and how were they trying to get him back uh\nYeah so as you say the U.S is gathered intelligence that showed\nThat the crown prince ordered this operation to lure them from Virginia and U.S officials told my colleagues that intelligence and stuff that captured Saudi officials discussing this um it's pretty significant and it appears\nTo confirmed as the Saudi leadership highest levels who sees a silenced you'd written columns in the last year in the Washington Post\nCriticizing some of the monarchies policies\nIncluding the arrest of women's rights advocates there on the Saudis have said that they got nothing to do with his appearance you know even if they were friendly with them and they're not worried about the safety of the intelligence\nSo that's obviously a under cut those assertions\n'em and they and they really add to the growing pressure on the Saudi Government now to explain what happened right\nSo let me ask you so basically you and your colleagues are reporting that what happened in his ... his disappearance at that conflict could in some way be like a backup plan it clearly they weren't able to get him back to Saudi voluntarily so allegedly they've kidnap him when he was in Turkey\nI mean certainly those intelligence intercepts and raise that possibility or you know ... there's been very little hard evidence about what happened inside that constantly\nRun there is that there is this theory that that what happened inside may have been\nPart of a a backup plan to capture that somehow withdraw so US Senators have triggered something called the Magnitsky Act which requires the White House to put sanctions on whomever is responsible for his disappearance even if it's the top leadership in Saudi but how do we find that out who was actually leading\nThe investigation to find out the truth is that the Turks does that the U.S so they working together\nThe ... you know the the Turks are leading an investigation um they they are\nA gathering evidence from various locations around assemble and uh they say that they will present their findings\nUm when the time is right um but you know all of this has\nRaised questions about whether the U.S had a duty to warn Jim how about the details of the plot that they've discovered and it's also been embarrassing for the Trump Administration which has cultivated very close ties with the crown prince and held them up as as potentially transformative leader in the middle east\n... of the Washington Post ah from his bureau in ... thank you so much thanks\nGregory mentioned President Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia and speaking of that the president is vowing to quote get to the bottom of what happened to democracy will be this is the president speaking yesterday\nThis is a bad situation we can have lives is\nLet's talk about this more with Ian Bremmer he's a political scientist and also founder of the global political risk consultancy firm that you raise your group but we'll come back to the program ... so\nThe president saying that ah he's not going to let this happen at the bad situation but can you just give us the context here what is President Trump and his administration's relationship with Saudi crown prince\nWell as you remember the first trip the truck made outside the United states wasn't to Canada or Mexico a traditionally what the US President do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel is closure of both to Trump a and a and Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince\nI'm In Saudi Arabia or so it it would really be tough for Trump personally to do anything that would want to damage this\nRelationship with this one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at uh in in another country to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship\nUm UC what he's been saying about the north Korea and Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil uh I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure it will I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's individual meeting with President pollutant in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore\nUm look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific\nUm for the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies conflict abroad by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and in the same way that we've seen 'em a sick it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk\n'em I think the same thing is likely to occur\nThese heavy Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially because Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran or at it after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together is\nThis a government known for intimidating their citizens who live abroad that did this uprising in some way\nUm it again it's it's gotten worse certainly um but he's been threatened before\nUm you know he was forced out of his job um he was defending a a lot of his friends\nWho were opponents of the Saudi regime a he has a lot of friends in the United states in high places but there's no question that he was considered to be a a real problem\nFor the Saudis the Saudis overreacted to the Canadians I Won the Canadian government took umbrage at a Saudi behavior you will remember of course a just a year ago all of those Saudi princes that were detained\nIn the Ritz Carlton there were some reports of torture when that occurred didn't stop the U.S Saudi relationship from being extremely strong\nAnd again I just want you to North Korea I mean Trump expressing his love for Kim Jong loon who is by far the most criminal behavior we've seen\nIn the river will have a ... thanks so much for joining us you heard him on NPR News\nAnd it's now six forty to this is ...

different is of course at the time it's getting very and I have no choice there is no choice to get a deal at\nAll the deal is also that prerequisite for any sort of a trance a transition period\nSo if there's no deal then everything's going to happen overnight so I think at both sides have a very great interest in in a deal\nAnd then what is the deadline thing the deadline I mean breakfast is going to take place at the end of march but before that you're going to have to rectify the deal in all twenty seven ... parliaments and the British Parliament and the European Parliament\nAnd you have to translate it and process it so you would have to be ready during November I think for it to be feasible to pull through\nA translator for like two dozen different languages yeah so I could be taking a lot of time okay you're going to say there is the second reason they think it's actually happening\nI think the second reason is is that that I mean one of the big problems in these negotiations from the beginning has been that it's been taken your case so long to arrive to any position and it's been negotiating justice not much with itself as it has with the new at this summer we actually got this so called checkers proposal from the u._k. prime minister\nAnd when he was the first time that they actually made a a comprehensive package of how they see themselves leaving and what the new relationship could be and although the checkered steel is not acceptable as such I think it was really important that that was a basis for negotiations to go forward you know a lot of people\nIn Europe were just telling the u._k. just come up with something so we can get started and actually actually start working on something\nConcrete exactly it's been extremely frustrating I think for many parties can I ask you about one\nSticking point that there's this determination to avoid a hard border between Ireland which is part of you in Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. can you just remind us why that is so important not to have a hard border there\nI think many people in in Europe forget and how recently actually the real a peace settlement was made in in regard Northern Ireland uh this is all about the took on Good Friday agreement which is from only Nineteen eighty nine the peace agreement between um the u._k. and and the Irish Government\nAnd many of these elements depend on the fact that both areas are part of the ... so if you think about free movement of people are good across the border people being able to live where they want at all all of these elements which have to do with the integration of the area and they are about that you\nFound out when a when if if when and if Northern Ireland is leaving at there is a real risk that what is happening underground or can can hamper the implementation of disagreement and it can possibly cause a lot of a conflict or locally\nAnd among because we just have a few seconds left but I mean there's been talk of maybe a new referendum and the u._k. backing out of a breakfast if there were vote would you take Britain back\nThe used I mean the u._k. is still a member of that you\nAre but it's not in the same members said that he was two years ago I think a lot of China has been broken during these negotiations\nA lot of China you describe it like a a divorce but um it's pretty funny

play NPR or ask for your local member stations I mean this is NPR News\nAnd this is definitely ... good morning I'm Beth Adams at seven forty to\nNew York state law now requires employers no matter how many workers they have to implement new sexual harassment prevention policies and an act training for all workers by October night of next year\nAnd we're Steve is a council it harder secret and Emory in Manchester he says employers he has spoken to are most concerned about how the policies relate to non employees that work site and how they can do to fight those workers about the policies\nI'm thinking of that old saying that where you stand is determined by where you sit when he was sitting in what we now call the White House he started seeing things differently than the perfect way of\nPutting it in Madison also knew that it would be politically useful to him and Eighteen\nTwelve he was running for reelection to have a war that he was the biggest advocate of\nSounds pretty modern doesn't it so James Madison is one of the presidents who gives the president a role in warm making although there are still asking Congress at that point let's go ahead a few decades to James Cape Polk is president of the United states in the Eighteen forties what did he do Well James ... was alive\nAnd the cheese and a boy and he wanted the United states to have a big war\nWith Mexico and his hidden agenda was he wanted to get New Mexico he wanted to get California which are owned by Mexico at that time a lot of other land and added to the United states\nEighteen forty six he sat American troops down to the Texas border to provoke the Mexicans and Mexican fought back\nAnd poked says look there's been this terrible attack on us by Mexico we need a big war Congress gladly gave it to\nI guess we should just explain this a little more he sent troops into disputed territory between the U.S and Mexico right\nHe did and the result was Polk had essentially fabricated an incident would allow him to go to Congress than say\nWe need a big war with Mexico but wait a minute here he's still I'd ask Congress Congress still had to act how did senators respond when they were challenged by this guy was essentially taking their authority away\nMany senators sad that poker is trying to cheat him they question the reason that we were going to war but they voted for this war overwhelmingly and set the pattern for the future why did they do that\nThey knew that the war would be popular they knew that many people would say the Mexicans attacked us why are we fighting back would be very hard for them to say no and that was a pattern that lasted in the future\nOkay but still at that time in history Congress was declaring war the president would ask Congress would do it if we go ahead a century to around Nineteen fifty Harry Truman is the president of the United states what happened in Nineteen fifty\nI Love Truman Steve but he did this terrible thing in Nineteen fifty the north Koreans attacked the south in June of Nineteen fifty and what Truman should have done under the constitution he should have gone to Congress and said\nI had like a war declaration they would have given it to him but Truman was terrified that there'd be a big debate where he might be criticized that might undermine him in the mid term elections\nOf Nineteen fifty so trauma didn't even bother going to Congress he said I'm doing this as a police action under the United nations I don't need\nA declaration and the result of that was that Lyndon Johnson in Nineteen sixty four when he wanted his war in Vietnam said Truman didn't ask Congress I don't have to do it either and we've never had a declaration of war sense not since Nineteen forty two and that is totally in violation of the constitution\nWhat are some of the consequences of this evolution increase really in presidential power when we look at the last I don't know twenty Thirty years\nThe result is a modern president nowadays can start a war almost singlehandedly and most of them are tempted because they know that if you've got political problems and you get the United states into a war that is popular your poll ratings will rise\nYou write early in this book where the founders to come back they would probably be astonished and chagrin to discover that in spite of their art and striving ...\nThe life or death of much of the human race has now come to depend on the character of the single person who happens to be president of the United states\nThe founders knew but almost anyone could become president and they didn't want all of our security to rest on whoever happens to\nGet a job when you wrote that line recently did you have any particular individual in mind\nPresident Trump has often talked about starting wars for political reasons in two thousand eleven he tweeted\nPresident Obama's going to start a war with Iran in order to get reelected president for addicted that President Obama would do that that it didn't even know about it he makes the connection between war and politics that the founders never wanted to see a president make\nThe other thing is that like other presidents President Trump is mark remarked on the fact that oftentimes if you want to be considered a great president it's easier to do that if you've been commander in chief during war that as they thought that our founders would never wanted to hear from any president\nOne of the recent episode I Want to ask about presidents Obama and two thousand Thirteen seemed on the verge of launching an attack against Syria because of Syria's use of chemical weapons\nI'm ready to act in the face of this outrage today I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world\nThat we are ready to move forward together as one nation and specifically said I'm not going to do that without the approval of\nCongress it's seen as a serious mistake in foreign policy it left ... out of Syria with much more freedom would you argue that it was the right choice even though it seems to have been a mistake\nI think it is always the right choice for president never to get into a war unless he's got Congress in with him on the take off he belatedly saw that that was not going to be possible and that's why he pulled back\nMichael Beschloss is the author of presidents of war the epic story from Eighteen oh

station\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene in Culver City California\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin in Washington DC we are learning more this morning about what may have happened to the missing Saudi journalist ... cars Shelby\nHe entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey last week that much we know but he has not been seen since ... wrote for the Washington Post and had been living in the U.S the post is reporting that at one point the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered Saudi agents to lure 'cause she'll get back to the country\nSaudi officials continue to deny any involvement in ... disappearance\nWe're joined now by ... he's the Washington Post correspondent in ... who's been following this story closely thanks so much for being with ice cream thanks for having me\nYour reporting none of your colleagues shows that the U.S intelligence community knew what at one point the Saudi Arabia was trying to get ... back to Saudi Arabia\nUm why were they trying to get them back and how were they trying to get him back uh\nYeah so as you say the the us is gathered intelligence that showed\nThat the crown prince ordered this operation to lure him from Virginia back to Saudi Arabia and U.S officials told my colleagues that intelligence intercepts that captured Saudi officials discussing this um it's pretty significant and it appears\nTo confirm that the Saudi leadership at the highest levels will seeking asylum to novel or he had written columns in the last year in the Washington Post\nCriticizing some of the monarchies policies including the arrests of women's rights advocates there on the Saudis and said that they have nothing to do with his disappearance and you know even that they were friendly with him and they are now worried about the safety of\nThe intelligence intercepts obviously under cut those assertions\n'em and they and they really add to the growing pressure on the Saudi Government now to explain what happened right\nSo let me ask you so basically you and your colleagues are reporting that what happened in ... his disappearance at the consulate could in some way to be like a backup plan it clearly they weren't able to get him back to Saudi voluntarily so allegedly they've kidnap him when he was in Turkey\nI mean certainly those intelligence intercepts have raised the possibility or you know there there there's been very little hard evidence about what\nHappened inside that conflict right there is that there is this theory\nThat that what happened inside\nMay have been part of a a backup plan to capture that somehow withdraw\nSo US Senators have triggered something called the Magnitsky Act which requires the White House to put sanctions on whomever is responsible for his disappearance even if it's the top leadership in Saudi but how do we find out who was actually leading the investigation to find out\nThe truth is that the Turks is that the U.S are they working together\nThe you know the the Turks are leading an investigation um they they are\nA gathering evidence from various locations around assemble and uh they said that they will present their findings\nUm ah when the time is right um but you know all of this has\nRaised questions about whether the U.S had a duty to warn jumbo how about the details of the far that they've discovered and it's also been embarrassing for the Trump Administration which has cultivated very close ties with the crown prince and held them up this is potentially transformative leader in the middle east\n... of the Washington Post ah from his bureau in ... thank you so much thanks\nGregory mentioned President Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia and speaking of that the president is vowing to quote get to the bottom of what happened to democracy will be this is the president speaking yesterday\nThis is a bad situation we can not places but\nLet's talk about this more with Ian Bremmer he's a political scientist and also founder of the global political risk consultancy firm that you raise your group but we'll come back to the program sure have to do here so\nThe president saying that uh he's not going to let this happen it's a bad situation but can you just give us the context here what is President Trump and his administration's relationship with Saudi crown prince\nWell as you remember the first trip the Trump made outside the United states wasn't to Canada or Mexico traditionally what the US President do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel a disclosure of both to Trump a and a and Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince I'm In Saudi Arabia or so it ... it would really be tough for Trump personally to do anything that would want to damage\nThis relationship with this one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at uh in in another country\nUm to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship um you see what he's been saying about the north Korea and Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you were earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure well I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's individual meeting with President putting in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore\nUm look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific for the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies conflict brought by the way\nBut I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course has the ability of the Senate and others chip can\nIn Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and on the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against the Russian that Trump has attempted to slow walk\n'em I think the same thing is likely to occur visa V. Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially\nBecause Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together\nIs the government known for intimidating their citizens who live abroad that the surprising in some way\nUm it it again it's it's gotten worse shortly\nUm but he's been threatened before\nUm you know he was forced out of his job um he was defending a lot of his friends your opponents of the Saudi regime or he has a lot of friends\nIn the United states in high places but there's no question that he was considered to be a real problem for the Saudis the Saudis overreacted to the Canadians on the Canadian government took umbrage at a Saturday behavior you will remember of course a just a year ago all of those Saudi princes that were detained\nIn the rich Carlton there were some reports of torture\nWhen that occurred didn't stop the U.S Saudi relationship from being extremely strong and again I just want you to North Korea I mean Trump expressed his love for Kim Jong loon who is by far the most criminal behavior we've seen in the war\nIn Bremmer will have to stop their thanks so much for joining us [noise] he is founder of the global political risk consultancy the Eurasia Group [noise] this is NPR News\n...
