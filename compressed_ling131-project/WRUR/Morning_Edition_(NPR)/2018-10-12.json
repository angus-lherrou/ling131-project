National Guard troops and local authorities continue surveying damaged areas\nNPR's Rebecca Hersher says a new study finds a number of counties in Florida we're not adequately prepared to deal with Michael\nResearchers at Florida Atlantic University analyzed the evacuation plan for all sixty seven counties in Florida\nThings like whether people with special needs could register with the county whether there were pickup locations for residents who don't have cars whether there was a plan for evacuating pets and whether evacuation maps were available to the public\nThe researchers found that ten Florida counties have weak plans\nMeaning they're poorly prepared to handle mass evacuations before hurricanes or during other disasters all of those counties are in the Florida Panhandle in all only a third of counties and the Florida Panhandle have strong evacuation plans despite the risk from hurricanes Rebecca Hersher NPR News\nThe November midterm elections are three weeks from Tuesday Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says he's more optimistic about Republicans maintaining control of Congress in the aftermath of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm increasingly optimistic that we may hold our majority nothing it makes a huge difference and one of the good things about the Supreme Court fight as it underscores for Republican voters that the sun is a personal business lose the Senate and the project of confirming judges is over\nThe counter was speaking to NPR the impeachment trial of West Virginia Supreme Court justice is being blocked because of constitutional issues and errors in the preliminary proceedings\n[noise]\nAll right let's just ask about this district were in the sixth district what would make this district competitive and such a red state\nWell that's interesting so historically Kentucky follows the pattern of other southern states in that even as these states trend did\nI'm Republican National level particularly for presidential elections Democrats retain strong control at the state level and so we've seen um districts like the ... able to\nLift ... back and forth I've got some more conservative Democrats something else going on here as well we're in a very modern urban place in a city and an increasingly diverse place the teacher we heard from teaches English as a second language and get students coming from all over the world electric to Kentucky yeah\nIs there a divide between rural and urban in a place like this if we just drive an hour to the east in the mountains I feel like we're in a very different world\nIt is we have different types of rural here in Kentucky right we have the um horse industry which brings a certain type of rural and then we have as you move further east a more um impoverished welcoming\nThat's places where you've got small Hallows as they call them small farms or or nothing particularly going on and tremendous problems with drugs and and other issues this there's an economic divide as well right this is a very prosperous city that were in ... and a place of education how big a place to the University of Kentucky holding this or not that you're biased rent is\nNot at all the University of Kentucky is the is the largest industry here in Lexington um along with suppliers like Toyota manufacturers like Toyota and Lexmark and the bourbon industry\nAre now the bourbon industry that's really interesting isn't that industry being affected by terrorists President Trump Trump imposes tariffs and you now have Europeans imposing tariffs on Kentucky bourbon there are concerns about the terrorists yeah so how are the candidates navigating these divides we have Andy Barr Republican ... Amy McGrath a Democrat running for office for the first time\n[laughter] so any McGrath is definitely appealing to that more centrist democratic tendency that we see here I'm trying to emphasize none of the economic issues and how does anti bar pushback by questioning the extent to which McGrath is a center is\nOkay and one final question how popular or does it feel to you that President Trump is in the state of Kentucky it depends\nOn who [laughter]\nDeeply divided but he did receive sixty two percent of the voting and sixty eight percent of the ... congressional district I think that when he voted you of University of Kentucky thanks so much\n\nAlready looking ahead to the weekend on Sunday nearly forty years after he was assassinated while saying mass Salvadoran archbishop Oscar Romero will be canonized by the Vatican\nHas and the\nArchbishop Romero constantly spoke against the violence that was carrying his native El Salvador apart in the Nineteen seventies he's\nRadio broadcast demanding social justice reached hundreds of thousands of people but his words also angered the country's military rulers and the arts Danny ... is with me he's one of our producers at MORNING EDITION he's been reporting on Romero good morning to any hey no what did you learn about Oscar Romero\nWell he was a fighter for justice and they called him the voice of the voiceless this was a time when El Salvador's military regime which was supported by the United states killed kidnapped and tortured civilians many of them the poorest in society\nAnd so Romero ran this commission that investigated human rights abuses and every Sunday during mass\nHe named victims of murder and the countless who disappeared\nAnd it was incredibly dangerous for him to do that I'm In his hobbies were broadcast on the radio and they became sort of like\nA newscast for the poor who am I talked with Franciscan brother of ... and he used to work at the Catholic British station in San Salvador\nEverybody everybody was listening including his enemies and he had many enemies who are they\nEl Salvador's oligarchy um the military uh they were threatened by Romero because he openly talked about these injustices and he empowered the poor\nTo do something about it and he died for that I'm In march of Nineteen eighty well he was saying mass at this little hospital chapel in San Salvador he was shocked at the altar by a gunman from right wing dust what\nWhy did it take almost forty years for Romero canonized\nWill remember has always been controversial especially within the Catholic Church I supported the poor he was critical of the government so he was accused of being a communist which he was not um but his\nCosts were seen had was stalled by the Vatican for years because of that a Vatican official said he was too aligned with the theology that promoted the cause for social justice but Pope Francis finally change that\nAnd this is huge for El Salvador it's a country with one of the highest murder

set aside for dealt with your UK why our member station here\nIn Lexington we are in the sixth congressional district where tightly contested race will help decide control of the house President Trump campaigns in the district this weekend and those who will be in the audience include Allen halls the editor of a rural newspaper called the swift creek courier\nI was actually drove over I was on my vote for him again I'm going to read from the same as we can or maybe I won't get shot\nHe leans conservative though he also says he prefers divided government checks and balances which makes his congressional vote ...\nThis is a time of political ferment and Kentucky teachers staged protests this year against a Republican governors effort to cut teacher pensions and those waving signs and the state capital included Audrey law did those protests cause some teachers to become more politically active than they\nWould have oh heck yeah oh heck yes if I remember correctly it's more teachers running for state office in this year than ever before\nThose are some of the voters we've been meeting and now we'll talk over what we have found with Emily bald you a political scientist at the University of Kentucky and LCROSS journalism professor at the same University of more than guys thanks for joining us early Al Cross how hard fought used this district between Eddie bar the incumbent a navy regrets Democrat it couldn't\nBe any harder for I mean it was almost like a Senate race in terms of the money is being spent a the stakes\nBoth parties see in it or it's just one for the book money being spent how much money are we talking about here well McGrath expects to have a million dollars and a a total\nAge is ... is an amount that used to be huge for a Senate race just a few years ago yeah OK and Andy\nBarr also had I known any bar will have a comparable amount and plus there's all the outside spending\nEmily bow you do you see that money being spent if you turn on the television or you drive around this district\nYou absolutely in fact you hear it on the radio\nBitter bitter radio ads as well as television ads television I've seen tons of television ad bars and restaurants\nAnd online as to you can ignore that\nAbsolutely not let's drill down in some of the divisions in this state and here a couple more voters one of them we spoke with is Laurie Graham she's in camped in Kentucky and wolf county a rural county she is the manager of a newly expanded Jim and she's a newcomer to the states she favors President Trump\nAnd she gave a lot of reasons why she favors his attitude she likes the economy and she also says she doesn't understand why people are talking about racial divisions\nIn this country let's listen\nI played college basketball I went to a majority of black cool um I mean I I have dated a black guy at one point in my life I'm not racist by any means and I thought anything nothing like I I went to a majority black college it's one of the only white girl on the team\nAnd we all got along everybody got along great\nIs that kind of part of the reason to support President Trump because he kinda as you see your calls BS and all this and you kind of agree with that kind of yeah\nI just I feel like I don't feel like a lot of people have made issues and things that aren't really it's you\nKnow I Believe all year when we interview African Americans we hear a radically different perspective there how deep or the racial divisions in this day\nWell I think what's more important to recognize about this state is how overwhelmingly white it is right so it's about eighty four percent white in this way that Kentucky sits at the intersection of a lot of\nDivides in the country it looks more like a mid western state then its neighbors to the south or the east and sell to the extent that there are racial divisions I think what you see more acutely is it is that feeling of marginalization\nFrom the African American and Latino community because they're small\nAlthough there are communities here Al Cross we ate in a in a Mexican restaurant with Central American ah waiters in wolf county Kentucky the teacher we heard from a moment ago was teaching English as a second language to immigrate immigrants is just becoming a more diverse state has the\nIt's becoming more diverse but it's slow you know the African American population is a a single digits are those the Hispanic population a and a ah eastern Kentucky a particle which is in this district is one of the widest places in the United states\nHow real than is the anxiety over race are you surprised at all to go to a very very white county as we did and your multiple people say I don't understand that this black lives matter thing is all about and they're actually actively bothered by it\nTo me this is again a reflection of on Donald Trump's emphasis right that in that style of I'm emphasizing conflict in threat often that's been racialized right quite often it's addressed um towards immigrants and the threat posed by immigrants\nBut there's there's definitely a racialized element to that across\nIn this state I'm a the a racial element has been bad for Democrats or you know the election of Barack Obama was a historic event but it was bad for the Democratic brands and Kentucky\nYou look at the exit polls in two thousand they we have about a Fifteen Percent acknowledged racist electorate will say I embrace to note they said that race was\nEight oh was it ran into a reason for my vote and yeah there would have been some African Americans and that but very few because we've only got seven and a half percent black population\nWell let's hear from a person who identifies as mixed race and lives in a historically black neighborhood of Lexington on the east at April Taylor is her name she's a community activist on the east and\nWe met her outside a farmer's market that she has helped to get going near historic theater there so she's very active politically active has strong opinions and yet she says she doesn't always vote let's listen does your vote matter in two thousand Eighteen in this congressional elections\nI'm honestly not completely convinced that it does for so many people who are who are the working poor right people who are working two and three jobs just trying to make ends meet people who may or may not have transportation or people who may or may not\nBe able to get the time off of work there have been times in my life where it was just not feasible to vote particularly when it felt like it may or may not matter\nWhat to each of you think about as you hear that voice\nI think about um the feelings we've heard across a number of these interviews of marginalization of different flavors the economic be at racial the ideological\nMeaning that that isolation that feeling of isolation Israel for a lot of people out across you get the last word\nI think voters ... voters need to remember that the choices binary and binary choice is gradually move or a U.S through a continuum of history but each election as a binary choice and uh I Hope people don't stay home on either side\nOK LCROSS and Emily ... thanks very much to both of you we're live at room wagon bikes in Lexington, Kentucky and detours to Bruce Lewis has got to take us out\nAnd do it in ... and ... forty\nEight degrees under cloudy skies in Rochester at six forty two good morning on death Adam ... news\nThen Republican candidate for attorney general in New York Keith ... says if he wins he would

about these lightening fast algorithms moving stocks around and you think you're missing out if you're not fussing with your own portfolio\nEven all the more reason it if it's you versus the machine and all these MIT PHD's in computer programming what makes anybody thinks that they're going to log on from their their phone with a little laptop and they'll be able to compete\nWith those those folks listen I I I like football is next is as much as the next person but I don't want to get on the field with these\nGiant guys who were bigger stronger faster than me they're professionals I stay out of their way we should really approach high frequency traders sick way\nBut I've been out on the street you're talking to people and you know the one metaphor I hear is that it's a little like an earthquake the earth shakes a bit and you wonder though is it a foreshock of the big one to come you may be okay with what you lost this week but maybe it's time to take some money off the table is what some people have been suggesting\nWell since the bear market ended in March two thousand nine we've seen twenty days where the S. and P. five hundred was down three percent and during every one of those days it feels like this is it this is the end\nHave you taken money off the table on any of those prior uh events you would've left a ton of upside there and then you run into the real significant problem which is once you sell how do you get back in people are very very bad\nAt objectively evaluating things like markets because\nIt's red emotional it's it's exciting all of your

walking early in the Trump Administration the regular White House press briefings were must see TV for a lot of people they commanded big ratings for the sparring sessions between the White House press secretary and the media\nBut in recent months those things have become less frequent to the point where calling them daily would not be accurate NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith has

showed up in the briefing room and fielded the incoming\nIt just felt like it was a responsibility you know sort of a democratic duty and\nNo one from the Trump White house would go on the record for that story and Sanders hadn't been to the lectern in eight days so there hasn't been a chance to ask at the briefing but former press secretary Sean Spicer defense the White House\nThe idea that the briefing is to be all end all and the standard bearer for the degree of accessibility is rather silly and\nAnd he argues that when the briefing became a rating sensation and the Trump Administration

K. why our member station here\nIn Lexington we are in the sixth congressional district where tightly contested race will help decide control of the house President Trump campaigns in the district this weekend and those who will be in the audience include Allen halls the editor of a rural newspaper called the swift creek courier\nI was actually Trump voter was and I may vote for him again I'm going to read from the same as we can argue maybe I won't get shot\nHe leans conservative though he also says he prefers divided government checks and balances which makes his congressional vote tricky this is a time of political ferment in Kentucky teachers staged protests this year against a Republican governors effort to cut teacher pensions and those waving signs and the state\nCapital included Audrey Long did those protests cause some teachers to become more politically active than they would have\nOh heck yeah oh heck yes if I remember correctly it's more teachers running for state office didn't this year than ever before\nThose are some of the voters we've been meeting and now we'll talk over what we have found with Emily bald you a political scientist at the University of Kentucky and LCROSS journalism professor at the same University of more than guys thanks for joining us early Al Cross how hard fought is this district between Eddie bar the incumbent David McGrath Democrat\nIt couldn't be any harder for them I mean this is almost like a Senate race in terms of the money that's being spent a the stakes that both parties see in it or it's just one for the book\nMoney being spent how much money are we talking about here\nWell Amy McGrath expects to have a million dollars and a a total\nAged ... is an amount that used to be huge for a Senate race just a few years ago yeah OK and Andy\nBarr also had I known any bar will have a comparable amount and plus there's all the outside spending\nEmily bow you do you see that money being spent if you turn on the television or you drive around this district\nYou absolutely can in fact you hear it on the radio\nBitter bitter radio ads as well as television ads television I've seen tons of television ad bars and restaurants\nAnd online ads to you can ignore that\nAbsolutely not let's drill down in some of the divisions in this state in here a couple more voters one of them we spoke with is Laurie Graham she's in camped in Kentucky and wolf county a rural county she is the manager of a newly expanded Jim and she's a newcomer to the states she favors President Trump\nAnd she gave a lot of reasons why she favors his attitude she likes the economy and she also says she doesn't understand why people are talking about racial divisions in this country let's listen\nI played college basketball I went to the majority of black cool on I mean I I have dated a black guy at one point in my life I'm not racist by any means and I thought anything nothing like I I went to a majority black college\nIt's one of the only white girl on the team and we all got along everybody got along great\nIs that kind of part of the reason we support President Trump because he kinda as you see your calls BS and all this and you kind of agree with that kind of yeah\nI did I feel like [noise] I don't I felt like a lot of people have made a few things things that aren't really nice you\nKnow I Believe all year when we interview African Americans we hear a radically different perspective there how deep or the racial divisions in this day\nWell I think what's more important to recognize that doubt this state is how overwhelmingly white it is right so it's about eighty four percent white living in this way that Kentucky sits at the intersection of a lot of\nDivides in the country it looks more like a mid western state than its neighbors to the south or the east and sell to the extent that there are racial divisions I think what you see more acutely is a is that feeling of marginalization\nFrom the African American and Latino community because they're small\nAlthough there are communities here Al Cross we ate in a in a Mexican restaurant with Central American or waiters in wolf county Kentucky the teacher we heard from a moment ago was teaching English as a second language to immigrate immigrants is just becoming a more diverse state is that\nIt's becoming more diverse but it's slow you know the African American population is the single digits Sosa Hispanic population a and a uh eastern Kentucky a particle which is in this district is one of the widest places in the United states\nHow real than is the anxiety over race are you surprised at all to go to a very very white county as we did and your multiple people say I don't understand that this black lives matter thing is all about and they're actually actively bothered by it\nTo me this is again a reflection of on Donald Trump's emphasis right that in that style of I'm emphasizing conflict in threat often that's been racialized right quite often it\nAddressed um toward immigrants and the threat has immigrant but there's there's definitely a racialized selling it to that across\nIn this state um uh the racial element has been bad for Democrats or you know the election of Barack Obama was a historic event but it was bad for the Democratic brands and Kentucky\nYou look at the exit polls in two thousand they we have about a Fifteen Percent acknowledged racist electorate will say I embrace no they said that race was\nEight oh was it ran a reason for my vote and yeah there would have been some African Americans and that but very few because we've only got seven and a half percent black population\nLet's hear from a person who identifies as mixed race and lives in a historically black neighborhood of Lexington on the east and a pro Taylor is her name she's a community activist on the east and we met her outside a farmer's market that she has helped to get going near historic theater there so she's very\nActive politically active has strong opinions and yet she says she doesn't always vote let's listen does your vote matter in two thousand Eighteen in his congressional elections\nI'm honestly not completely convinced that it does for so many people who are who are working for people who are working two and three jobs just trying to make ends meet people who may or may not have transportation or people who may or may not\nBe able to get the time off of work there have been times in my life where it was just not feasible to vote particularly when it felt like it may or may not matter\nWhat you each of you think about as you hear that source I think about the feelings we've heard across a number of these interviews of marginalization of different flavors the economic the at racial the ideological\nMeaning that that isolation that feeling of isolation Israel for a lot of people that will cross you get the last word\nI think voters ... voters need to remember that the choices binary and binary choice is gradually move to a U.S through a continuum of history but each election as a binary choice and uh I Hope people don't stay home on either side\nOK LCROSS and Emily ... thanks
