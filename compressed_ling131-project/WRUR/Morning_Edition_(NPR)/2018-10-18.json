I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Noel King last night the Washington Post published what is believed to be ... last column the Saudi journalist who was a ... regular contributor to the post was last seen walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul early this month\nHe's believed to be a casualty of the topic he wrote about in that piece and an free press in the Arab world\nBecause she'll be G wrote about Arab governments suppressing a free press without consequences\nAre going to read part of that column too you know quote\nThese actions no longer carry the consequence of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence as a result the Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing media at an increasing rate\nHe goes on there was a time when journalists to leave the Internet with liberate information from the censorship and control associated with print media\nBut these governments who's very existence relies on the control of Information Act aggressively blocked the Internet they've also arrested local reporters and pressured advertisers to harm the revenue of specific\nPublications now earlier I spoke to showcase editor at the Washington Post carrying a tia\nThank you so much for having me\nIn a note to readers above the column you wrote that cause showed jeeze translator sent you this piece a day after he was reported missing when did you realize that that it was the time to publish it\nFor me personally you know earlier this week I think with the news reports and of course you know sort of evidence of of ...\nOf life coming I'm from either the Turkish or the Saudis side ah we just decided that now is the week or the time to do it I I think also has the story is moving to a more political story a story about us Saudi relations\nUm goal for relations I think we just decided that it was good to bring the story back um to gym all a huge amount was and and his ideas\nWhen you talk to him about what was happening back home what did he say how was he struggling with that beyond just beyond writing about it what other steps did he want to take\nThem very often I mean this last call them is fitting very often in his pieces that he wrote for the post he would call attention to 'em reformers and activists who are also being detained and and jailed um so\nI think for him um it was keeping a awareness on on these these people and these are just the people that we know about you know there are hundreds if not thousands of others who have been detained or or disappeared under\nUnder crown prince Mohammed bin ... so I think he he's definitely thought that um this is something he he didn't agree with and he he always used to say Saudi Arabia ... was not always like this\nDid he ever talk or you know a man who spent most of his life in Saudi Arabia did he ever talk about having friends or colleagues who still supported the regime and and how difficult that that must have been\nSure and I again I mean Jamal himself even was not this this revolutionary and and none of us pieces that he call for\nYou know overthrow or anything um he was somebody who who even and his his work and his long career believe I'm In in a way working within\nThe system and so you know as far as our conversations about um the pain to people who support that he wasn't really\n... in our conversation he wasn't really paying so much about that he was just sort of in in in pain in general about the direction Saudi Arabia was taking and the ... I think you'd really struggled to understand why people who even supported a public supported um crown prince Mohammed bin ... reforms\nWere still finding themselves surveilled and I'm intimidated and even um detained\nWill will you remember about your friendship with democracy hoped\nThat um [noise] he was just a very very ... very humble and very generous person\nI I'll Remember um being so energized about being able to write freely I think it's just something in this country in America that we take for granted I'm so much\nUm but obviously looking back on it now realizing that he gave up so much everything his his family his his um being kicked out of jobs [noise]\nI I just I'm inspired by his his unwavering commitment to I'm not only you know having freedom for himself but trying to extend that\nTo his fellow um Arab or writers and voices and to to he just wanted the world the Arab world to be a better place and oh I'll never forget that\n... is the Washington Post global

November the president replied no but as NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump may not want to blame if the GOP takes a hit but he's still thinks the election is about him\nPresident Trump isn't on the ballot in November but that doesn't mean he isn't on voters' minds Alan Abramowitz is a professor of political science at Emory University he studied midterm elections and said there is a very strong correlation between presidential approval and the results for his party\nNot only is it always about the president to some degree but there's a lot a lot of reasons to believe that now this year it'll be even more about the\nPresident and why is that well first of all because Trump has\nHas tried to make it about him is Marcia is really a vote for me and everything we stand for\nMe to vote for a vote for me I don't vote for me\nIn origin make America great again\nIn the a P interview Trump explained that he was making this explicit appeal because the people at his rallies are there for him and some have even told him they don't plan to vote in the midterms in twenty fourteen President Obama made a similar appeal\nOn on on the ballot this fall\nShort for every mother [noise]\nBut make no mistake these policies are on the ballot every single one of them\nAt the time it was seen as a gaffe many Democrats were trying to distance themselves from Obama whose approval rating at the time was in the low forties Trump's approval is in a similar spot now again Abramowitz\nYour most probably going to come through at risk of losing their seats were probably rather localized election drawn but more about local issues about things they've done for their state or district and not about the president\nBut regardless of what

years I'm suggesting scaling back to where it used to be\nSenator Chris Murphy Democrat of Connecticut and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee senator thank you\n... it was well known among western journalists who have covered Saudi Arabia and the broader region among them NPR's Deborah Amos dad has been reporting from Saudi Arabia for decades her first tip there was back in Nineteen Ninety One\nAnd she joins us now thanks for being with us Ted thank you what went through your mind as you read this final column from ... in the Washington Post\nYou know in a way for me it felt like an ... for a man who was passionate about free media\nYou know he spent so much of his life in newsrooms and I remember is disappointment a few years ago when a TV station he opened in Bahrain was closed in twenty four hours he put a prominent dissident in his first newscast and so the powers that be shut them down\nYou know what turns out to be our last conversation he wanted to build an Arabic version of public television for the region and he said he had the money to do it\nFor the first time in his career the Washington Post gave in this remarkable platform the post also translated his columns into Arabic which extended his reach\nBut it may have been a reason for his demise\nBecause as you know so he was working for the post and now that his columns had been translated you think that that angered the Saudi regime\nI think it's possible you know it's one thing to criticize in the west it's another thing to do it in Arabic I'm it's much more powerful\nSo as we have heard took us a Turkish officials are pointing the finger or not just that the regime but in in particular at the crown prince of Saudi Arabia uh Mohammed bin Salman can you explain his rise to power what kind of leader he is proving to be\nYou know he came on the scene when he first arrived we didn't even know how old he was\nA his older brothers have advanced degrees from the west but the crown prince he stayed by his father's side in the kingdom when his father was the governor of Riyadh and back then his father actually wasn't enforcer within the family he was in charge of the paychecks for the royals and he knew you know who own money who is in trouble\nUm Mohammed bin someone's rise has been very quick um and his\nSort of his goal is to move the kingdom of conservative religious kingdom into the modern age but he's done it with incredible brutality and a\nA he has no tolerance for critics he has arrested many are in the kingdom he has also a rested royals and a crack down on corruption holding them in like the fancy hotel for weeks and weeks at a time yes indeed and everybody had to pay up to get out\nYou know I think that there was some discomfort about that in the business community and the west but mostly it was like an odd Saudi thing to jail people in a five star hotel he also jailed of Saudi women are these are activists who had been pushing for the end to a driving ban\nOr many of them are still in detention no charges we know nothing about what is happening with them so you know at the same time he was fed in the west he was building this\nUm you know structure for a stamping out dissent but what does the west seeing him and in particular what does President Trump seeing him\nHe is you know there's this myth of the of the young reformer we sought a earlier in Syria or you know we saw with the son of Moammar Gadhafi a you know young men who are about to take over from their fathers they have modern educations\nAnd sometimes it turns out they are as brutal as as their fathers\nI'm In this case I think uh Mohammed bin Salman sold himself in the west as\nA man who was going to change Saudi Arabia who's going to move the economy and in particular open up the social space for Saudis what he never said was he was going to ... politically liberalize the kingdom and that for certain he has not\nAnd I think that that is now dawning on the west as as this story unfolds\nWhat is in his future as far as you can discern I mean some in Congress now what President Trump to reevaluate weapons deals with the Saudis same thing is happening in Europe is is there a chance king sol mon decides that Mohammed bin Salman is too volatile and replacing them\nYou know I still think it's too early to uh see even answer that question are you know on the one hand I'm Talking to a lot of Middle East analyst who when this all started said no there's no chance now beginning to say the crown prince is toxic the king is going to have to consider some replacement\nBut it's also possible that the king and certainly the White House sees that this relationship is too important to us national security\nTo allow the death of one journalist to alter where Saudi Arabia is now I think we have to wait and see how the investigation goes is that tape released what happens in the White House to really see where the king will go on this\nAlright NPR's Deborah Amos uh she's been reporting on Saudi Arabia for years thank you so much debt\nThank you and we close today with the words of ... in his last column for the Washington Post he criticizes Arab regimes for cracking down on the free press saying these actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger
