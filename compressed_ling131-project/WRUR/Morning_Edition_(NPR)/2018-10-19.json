C. Saudi Arabia suspected role in the disappearance of a journalist has thrown a shadow over Saudi money\nAmerican businesses have enjoyed Saudi investments for years only now are executives facing real questions about Saudi Arabia is absolute monarchy it's brutal war in Yemen and above all above the reported murder of journalist ... ...\nMuch Saudi money has gone to Silicon Valley and do some tech CEOs have backed out of a forthcoming Saudi investment conference the investments themselves remain writer ... has just been talking with audiences this week in Silicon valley and he's been telling them the Saudi money is tainted\nIn recent years the Saudis sovereign well fund has become one of the biggest swinging checkbooks in Silicon valley through a kind of open secret of a front which is soft bank a big Japanese fund that launched a hundred billion dollar vision fund\nForty five billion dollars of that first hundred billion dollar fund was the Saudi Government money and recently they announced the second vision fun\nSaudi Arabia if you have a start up and big dreams of changing the world making it a better place empowering women and others [noise] a lot of those people with a lot of those idealistic pretensions have been very happy to open up to Saudi investors\nLet me just ask how big this really is you just use huge numbers like a hundred billion dollars but you are referring to spreading that money among multiple companies in Silicon valley where sometimes now a company can be worth a trillion dollars are they just buying you know I don't know five percent of the stock of some company\nIt's varying but I'll tell you an ... for example softbank is now the largest single shareholder in ... with Saudi having half of that steak and I want to make a really important point about what this gets the Saudis\nIf you're the young crown prince you have a problem which is that the reality of your country is that it's a fairly barbaric medieval kingdom that runs itself in a way that is inconsistent with\nThe un human rights declaration that is based on the degradation of women that ... heads people and that might well have murdered Jamal ... and the consulate in Istanbul that's a big image problem\nIn these investments in Silicon valley and then getting to go to Silicon Valley earlier this year and meet Mark Zuckerberg and meet Jeff ... and others he got exactly what he paid for he got the illusory glow of being part of the future and you got some ... column is to call him a reformer\nSo on and you have given one way that the Saudis seem to benefit from this connection with Silicon Valley the crown prince can go there and get a photo op [noise] but do you have any evidence that when the Saudis invest in a company there are some kinds of strings attached\nNo and that's not my claim my concern is that Silicon Valley is not who it says it is when you spend time out there is I just did you hear an endless parade of platitudes about changing the world empowering people creating community giving voice\nAnd it's almost a parody of the fall city of those pretensions to raise money from one of the worst regimes on earth that is absolutely in violation of every value here thrown around in Silicon valley\nAnd I want to be clear this financial investment is not the only thing that's happened you know as many listeners will remember there was this Davos in the desert conference\nThen you've got this new five hundred billion dollar mega city that the Saudis are creating called Neal and Neal again had all these Silicon Valley people other corporate people on the board and so these folks in Silicon valley\nThey make a lot of very important decisions about what kind of world we live in if these people are basically no better than chemical magnates who'd dumped pollutants into rivers except the digital version of that I think that's important for Americans to understand what\nWas it like in the last several days as you were traveling and the Silicon Valley area and speaking with audiences and this place that relies on the very industry are criticizing and said you people are showing yourself to be a moral or immoral\nYou know like you Steve I have two kinds of conversations with a journalist I have public ones and I have private ones\nEven in the public ones there is a growing sense\nThat they are standing on top of an indefensible mountain that America has been led by plutocrats who are fundamentally motivated by the bottom line but who have spun us all a tale of how they're trying to transform civilization and the things need to change but in the private conversations Steve I Will tell you deep\nIn the bowels of these institutions there is a generation of younger people who frankly do not believe the stories\nThat their elders and their elders are like in their thirties and forties the case of Silicon Valley do not believe their stories a bunch of people coming up in the valley frankly have a much more sophisticated understanding of power the very power they wield and the privileged they wield that some of the people who founded these companies have been catastrophic Lee blind to\nOn a bearded

transform civilization and the things need to change but in the private conversations Steve I Will tell you deep\nIn the bowels of these institutions there is a generation of younger people who frankly do not believe the stories\nThat their elders and their elders are like in their thirties and forties the case of Silicon Valley do not believe their stories a bunch of people coming up in the

I don't think so but it's the full range that we bring you the world here\nThrough NPR every morning and we can only do that with your support it's the final morning of our full membership campaign and we're asking you to call for five four sixty three hundred four or five or sixty three hundred for the next few minutes you could double your contribution a dollar for dollar match is still in effect for about five more minutes of four or five or sixty three hundred you\nKnow you can hear the volunteers in the background they are taking your pledges as you call four or five four sixty three hundred but also you can pledge on line of W ... or or you can pledge and the W. accepts I asked if you have that\nOn your smartphone on your Android or you're an apple phone it's so easy to make a pledge we try and make sure that there was a donate button everywhere here on the last day of our phone membership campaign the dollar for dollar matches going to run out and about four and a half minutes it comes to us from Betsy in Keith Wilson\nThat these on our board of trustees that scene Keith I'd been members for a very long time and they had been very helpful in great friends to us and especially today to inspire you to make a pledge of support for public radio\nThat is in your life every day you know a story like the one that we just heard is fantastic but we also hear\nAs Evan described all of the news of politics health education stories all day long and at the same time in the arts and culture area I also enjoy many of the things that I hear on public radio every day between a book reviews movie reviews on things about the media\nThe arts and culture in life coverage that we have including essays and coverage by around ... a contributor here at W. accepts I Would try and bring you\nSort of your whole life on the radio and in in every way that you listen to audio so if you think that's worth a little something make a pledge now four or five four sixty three hundred\nSo many are doing that we've just got a couple of lines still open so even though the phones are ringing this is a great chance to get on one of the open lines of four or five or sixty three hundred Mary Martin in Rochester says we are sustaining members we start every day with MORNING EDITION\nI'm grateful to hear her say connections as a treasure and shout out to the entire connections team keep up the good work thank you Mary and its Alex ... morning here Laura ... says\nI Love MORNING EDITION I also love Alex Greitens he's a wonderful journalist but also has a wonderful sense of humor that comes to run the air thanks so much for this wonderful service Laura is a proud member and it turns out that when Alex has those sort of a little\nAnd then leave on their side he speaks for everyone\nFour or five four three hundred and what what it shows though is what a community this is because we all sort of get to know each other over the years because we are ... we our western New Yorkers we're finger Lakers and we're all part of this community so\nThere's a real connection and a real sense of of togetherness all throughout this process it only works at a membership campaign when we come together and fund it together at least it wouldn't be called for five or sixty three hundred we're recognizing that we have a part to play in this and without doing that part we're leaving it for others to do it for\nAnd of course when we play that part it helps keep other work that we're doing here in public radio as it is which is independent which is authentic which is highly local your dollars go right back into the local news that you hear every day\nWe're right here in the community were owned by the community and when your dollars support that it enables us\nTo be even stronger in that mission that's what you support when you support public radio so make the phone call right now at four or five four sixty three hundred\nHave your pledge matched that's a great thing the dollar for dollar match and know that you're part of something that really belongs to the community when you do when you make a pledge you make it for yourself of course you listen to the service and use it but you are making it possible for your friends and your neighbors to\nFour or five or sixty three hundred dollar tell you a little story I mean I came to Rochester about Fifteen Years ago\nAnd I was in commercial television news and right around that time one of the local a commercial television news outlets they changed what they did with whether they were they decided and I think their parent company decided\nThat the weather was going to be done from Baltimore now imagine doing Rochester weather from all of them are from Baltimore can't imagine it and they had they had a studio in Baltimore where they're meteorologist would do forecast for\nQuote unquote local news and they would be Mitt around or whatever the local station was so they would do local weather for Columbus ohio\nFor Rochester and it became pretty clear after a while when you mispronounce names of towns and you don't really understand me not their region you're not there\nThat is a real risk here and I want to ask you what it means to be part of the community\nDo you want a community where you drive down your main street and it feels like Myrtle Beach and no offense to Myrtle Beach but it's ... it's all strip malls is all chain restaurants do you want it community that has local character that has looked restaurants and coffee\nJobs and parks and places where you know you can meet up with your neighbors you can sit out have a cup of coffee do you want a community that has local journalists a local station that is strong that knows your community better than anybody else and it's not gonna take orders\nFrom a parent company anywhere else in another city in another state that's what you're supporting when you call for five or sixty three hundred four or five four sixty
