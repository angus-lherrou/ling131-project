I Want to underline that for people who don't follow the Senate every day I'm sure these guys have never really liked each other just as early bought something different now\nYeah I mean they they get into arguments but the Senate has kind of it and it's titled as the world's greatest deliberative body and part of that is that they like to get into debates they talk to each other they work out in the gym together but I'm hearing stories about staff meetings that are becoming public griping sessions where people are complaining about each other\nAnd it's also getting a little bit tense for senators who are worried about their safety\nNow I I Walk around the Capitol almost every day and it's very rare to see somebody who isn't a top leader with a police escort but members Republican members of the Senate Judiciary committee are walking around public spaces with police officers that their side and people are being confronted an airport it's become quite it's it's a big change\nThe fact of the matter though is that the president sees this as a political winner for this message she was asked by a reporter Peter Alexander of NBC yesterday do you have a message for young men in this moment the president responded it's a very scary time for young men in America that is not something I imagine that senators ahead of mid term want to double down\nOn no because Republicans in particular are fighting for the vote of women and we've talked about that and very often but that is coming up yet again\nKelsey thanks for your reporting really appreciate you That's NPR's Kelsey Snell\nOr the embattled prime minister of the United kingdom ... is giving a speech this morning at the annual meeting of her conservative party\nThis week her rivals have attacked her plan for breakfast with what many also see as an idle replacing her as prime minister meanwhile they're just two weeks left before may as opposed to meet with the European Union and come up with yet another new plan that they might accept\nNPR's Frank Langfitt has been at the party's meeting in Burma do they say Birmingham in Birmingham yeah roaming um Birmingham Birmingham, England this week and he's now back in London or what do we expect from the speech right\nWell I think the context is probably the most important thing in the sense that breakfast is the biggest challenge we talked about this before the u._k. is faced probably since the end of World War two\nIs tremendous uncertainty here or a question about the leadership in the direction of the country and people are expecting her to strike an optimistic note but they're going to be I think more focused on her presence or confidence or delivery\nCan she convinced people as it is very difficult time that she can pull off a Brexit deal when he was against it what she's pitch as well as many members of her own party\nUm and last month you know when the huge rejected her breakfast planned people you saw that as a public humiliation states come out and appear strong especially as you were pointing out their rivals who are clearly eyeing the waters here and maybe looking for an opening in of course\nA Steve you remember from last year was going to be a lot better than last year speech because she got into a terrible coughing fit and that was deemed disaster there should be better\nOkay so hopefully she's got some water up they're going to be a Boris Johnson just name one rival uh not not too happy with her at the moment\nNo not at all he actually came out yesterday was what's called the fringe event away from the main venue\nAnd he told the party to just get your plan a witch her plan calls for a closer relationship with the EU a he called it a cheat an outrage these are very strong words at a at a party meeting and not what people voted for back in two thousand and sixteen um she wants a short break and more independent of Britain and here's some of what do you have to say\nIf we get it wrong army proceed with these undemocratic if you made in Hong Kong we will protect these talks ... ...\nFor ... for track the toxic tedious\nWas glass a bar if that's classic bars\nAre although you know um I mean it's just it has been pretty toxic and pretty tedious at the same story over and over again how has driven by responding to this\nWell she kind of put him down she said uh you know ... always puts on a good show but she said his plan doesn't do anything to avoid a hard border a new border on the island of Ireland which is a big issue and people are very concerned about\nUh Johnson is known to be very ambitious but many in the conference actually that I talk to us at the meeting up in Birmingham don't think he's necessarily the right person for the job at this time he's charismatic he's entertaining sometimes will soon as we suddenly a detailed guy and trade negotiations are all about detailed delicate\nI Want to make sure that I understand the bottom line here Frank Langfitt spoke it sounds like Britain's conservatives continue to argue among themselves among variations on a plan all of which are totally unacceptable to the Europeans anyway\nI mean at this point most of it bars is Flynn could be but he creates other protect potentially some very big economic problems for the United kingdom the fear of kind of walking away um so that's that's the big concern here is can they get a plan that doesn't damage the economy and that the un parliament will\nAgree to NPR's Frank Langfitt thanks so much happy to do with Steve and you're hearing Frank right here on MORNING EDITION

you're still standing here um and generally you knew they look at you and they say we were just panicked\nAnd there was no time to act\nIn fact one man said I you know my my sense is just went blank and I turned and I\nI felt the quake and I turned and almost immediately he said he saw a wall of water and he said you may think we sounds selfish I sound selfish to say this but all I could think of

see the wasting thanks so much Julie thank you\n[noise] just days ago\nWhat President Trump said testimony against his Supreme Court nominee was credible in a political speech last night in Mississippi the president shifted to mocking Christine Blasey Ford who accused Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault but didn't recall every detail\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was the president's mockery\nCame at the same time of the FBI was trying to corroborate those charges of possible the agency has been given no more than a week to look into the allegation about the Nineteen eighties how is it possible to do NPR's Martin Kaste reports on what this FBI background check is and it's not\nIf you're following the breathless coverage on cable news you get the impression this investigation is pretty serious\nHappening now breaking news comprehensive pro but listen carefully to how it's being described President Trump fall off a bus with sexual assault allegations within the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nTo catch that this is an investigation into sexual assault allegations what it's not as a criminal sexual assault investigation and that's pretty parents are the people who usually do those the local police\nWere falling at a little bit uh some more than others\nThat Steven Cooper commander of the criminal investigation division for the police department in ... Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the cabin our case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned his sons so any potential witness for victim is um let's say ten\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat's because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing as saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in that case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation and the case that just Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators while it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances hearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this investigation\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax for the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI marching costs the NPR News\n[noise]\n\nThis is NPR News [noise] and now an update from ...

perspective\nUm that was it and understand yesterday he talked a lot about things that that he said the dash cam video can't see like McDonald's face in his you know he describes his huge eyes and in his and you know no expression on his face he was looking through Van Dyke\nAnd then he talked about that action that you heard there in the intro of of McDonalds turning toward him with and waving a knife forcing him to shoot 'em as you said none of those things are on the dash cam video\nAnd is this critical to his defense to try to describe his own state of mind and suggests that whatever you believe from looking at the video I believed I was in danger\nIt's absolutely critical to his defense I mean\nEven if he wasn't an officer acting in self defense a requires that that the person who does it feels afraid for for his or her life\nAs a police officer the bar for conviction is even higher you know it has to be what a reasonable officer would have done in that moment and so what Van Dyke even before he testified what he needed to convince the jury of\nIs that he was reasonably in fear for his license so he's trying to bring in all sorts of other considerations besides that dash cam video to show why he would reasonably be and fear for his life like that look on his face or the turn that that you can't see on the dash cam video\nI guess that [noise] excuse me I guess that

said um where you really have to testify cop or not you really have to testify if you're claiming self defense that's what's going to\nBring it home from the jury we'd all sorts of other people who said oh no that's a huge risk to be to subject yourself to cross examination when there is that dash cam video\nWell how's the cross examination go\nWell um when I lost her Van Dyke was giving his testimony when he was questioned by his own attorney he's very emotional he cried when he describes shooting\nWhen he was being cross examine that emotion and sadness went away the prosecutor pushed him on the fact that his testimony was contradicted by the video and that it doesn't fit what a Van Dyke set in police reports\nAnd I did not have good answers for that he said he didn't remember what he said right after the shooting because he was in shock and couldn't explain discrepancies with the video and he was he was combative with prosecutors he seemed almost annoyed that he was being questioned\nDid his initial reports say anything about that look on the suspect's face or the the turn or anything else\nIt didn't say anything about the look but it did actually described in great

Inskeep leaders of the u._k. is conservative party are meeting today prime minister Theresa May gives a speech\nAnd just as a last year's version of the same meeting she is trying to get her party behind some plan for Brexit in just two weeks she is supposed to meet with the European Union leaders and find a new plan that they will accept\nNPR's Frank Langfitt is covering all of this either Frank ... is this moment any more desperate than all the other times that conservatives have gotten failed to agree\nWell the time is running out as you point out I think that's what it is creating a lot of tension here is there's not a lot of time left on an incredibly difficult and ensure getting negotiations the problem for the prime minister has been\nShe can't get the European Union to agree to replant and many people in her own party up there in Birmingham they don't agree with the plan either ... speech today a lot of it's going to be about domestic policy but she's she needs to appear strong and confident\nAs the country goes into what many stories would say is the biggest challenge making them has faced since World War two ah so that's she's going to be coming on actually very soon and we'll be hearing what she has to say what have her critics said which is a lot of critics but the probably the most prominent was a man named Boris Johnson he's the former foreign minister\nHe's frankly seen as widely gunning for a ... job and he gave a big speech yesterday where he trashed her plan to leave the European Union she calls for one for more closer relationship with the you still be able to trade goods seamlessly he\nCalled this a cheat an outrage not what people voted for back in two thousand and sixteen he'd like to see a sharp break with the European Union a more independent and independent Britain and and here's what he said yesterday if we get it\nArmy perceived as undemocratic if you made it often offer we will put traps these talks\nTedious these toxic tedious business it certainly is toxic how does the prime minister responded well\nShe put him down gently uh yesterday on the on the TV he she said Boris and that's not how everybody refers to him he's a major figure here always puts on a good show one of her criticisms is that the plan that Mr Johnson's putting out there\nUh she says doesn't really address the need to avoid a new heart border on the island of Ireland this is a huge issue we've been talking about right now as as you know Steve the borders seamless you can't even see it people and goods flow freely across in the Irish people in Ireland they they want it that way\nUm there's a real concern that it could change and she one of the reasons she's trying to continue to have good going back and forth with the EU is to avoid a border of any kind\nOf behind these details I have an image Frank Langfitt of an ocean liner I don't know maybe the Titanic heading toward an iceberg and you've got several people jostling for control of the wheels Boris Johnson being one of them what if what rank and file conservatives thinking this well\nI I think that for the moment I think they're going to stick with prime minister may it's it's sort of hard to imagine given the stakes here that they would switch horses in midstream and wall Mr Johnson is a very good performer in terms of speeches there there are concerns that he's not the right guy\nFor such a delicate time I was talking to a man named Anthony Martin he's the chairman of east hamster conservative association and here's how he put it yesterday in Birmingham\nHe would be great to have the big picture break an inspiring people but he would need people on the envelope and deal with the ... would you want to see him as a featured him yes and no I'm undecided\nI Am a supporter of or is he he's a ... character you either love him on the um ...\nCharacter summits as an expression here in the United kingdom Martin ... is this sticky dark brown foods bread and it's probably Britain's most divisive food product [laughter]\nWell I suppose\nThey get on the same page and come up with a plan is there any chance that the Europeans are going to accept the ... [noise]\nWell that's that's a very good question and we what was interesting to see it as we haven't seen a new plan they sent her back to the drawing board to the leaders in Brussels and we're waiting to see what she's going to come up with negotiations right now seems stalled\nUm and we just got to meeting two weeks to go um and the concern is if they don't come up with a deal they could you take a crash out of the you could do a lot of damage the economy here\nNPR's Frank Langfitt always a pleasure talking with his are happy to do it Steve\nThis afternoon at exactly to Eighteen eastern time you can expect to get a presidential alert on your cell phone it's not exactly from President Trump rather it's a test and the new nation wide warning system that a president could use in case of an attack by another country or a cyber attack or a widespread natural disaster\nStill some worry President Trump could abuse the system NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nBack in the days of the Cold War it was pretty common to hear this announcement on TV or radio you know the one this station is conducting a test of the emergency broadcasting system\nThings have gotten a little more sophisticated now but basically the same minute long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so and broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon to but today you'll also be getting an alert on your cell phone\nHas some of us receive alerts already amber alerts for missing children or flash flood or tornado warnings but this is the first time that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University he says testing the system makes sense\nI think having the testing of this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it would be good for the president to be able to speak directly to the war\nBut this is where Dr redlin or has some qualms especially he says when it comes to this president\nWe showed her effect that the president might be using such a shift in for clinical purposes or great I version of the presidency without a threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real concerns here I I liked about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing of the system known as wireless emergency alerts or W E s\nThe suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes that wants to turn people cell phones into government loudspeakers that compel listening\nFEMA says that accusation is baseless in a background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA official conceded while there is no opting out of the alert\nSystem is very well governed and you would not have a situation where the president would just wake up one morning as the official put it an attempt to send a personal message and besides he has Twitter for that Brian Naylor NPR News Washington\nAnd coming up later today on all things considered we'll hear from one of the beneficiaries of the new

notice and leave the agreement as President Trump has threatened to do numerous times but this writing in this explicit language for for leaving this explicit reason for leaving that's now\nWhy is this a a big deal I mean if countries could always leave NAFTA if they want it\nWell critics think that this amounts to giving us veto power over deals that Canada and Mexico might want to pursue what

Julie McCarthy has reached the provincial capital Paolo\nIt's been a long journey into ... but once you get here you start to feel and see the effects and the impact of this earthquake you can detect where the roads are cracking\nI think there's a real concern there you know he spent the first week of his uh hearing for the Supreme Court nomination talking a lot about how judges should be neutral arbiters and calling balls and strikes and he went to great lengths to explain the importance of that\nAnd then he ended up on a this past Thursday a ending with a phrase what ... what goes around comes around\nSo I I found that while you're marrying a surrogate for the future if there's a time when he says Democrats are up to get him he may have been hyperbolic but some Democrats are out together and they really don't want it to be on the Supreme Court\nWell I think that's not really inappropriate role for a Supreme Court justice a candidate let alone a sitting judge to talk like that we expect judges in this country to be above the fray it's why they wear black robes and they sit behind\nA lectern said literally sit above the fray in a courtroom we don't expect judges to get down and dirty where politicians are I think it's bad enough to have senators yelling at each other we really don't expect judges to be politicians\nIf we except for the moment for the purposes of this question his assertion that he's innocent he says he didn't do anything or he doesn't remember doing anything\nWhat is the manner in which you could have defended himself that would have left him on tainted\nI think it would be fine for him to be impassioned I understand it some basic level the defense that if you feel like you're being wrongly accused of something\nOf course you're going to have passion about it but his behavior on Thursday was frankly shocking in an era where not very much a shocking anymore he interrupted senators he answered questions with questions\nUh it it was it was unprofessional and it was a very surprising to hear a judge speaking like that I don't think a judge would tolerate that from a lead again in the courtroom the judge would be shocked um so\nI think um you know there was a way for him to make his case and in fact I think Dr Christine Blasey Ford made her case in a way that was passionate but not overly emotional and now it's somebody who was talking about how she had been sexually assaulted so\nSo if a Kavanaugh gets on to the Supreme Court what would you want to happen in cases involving Democrats whether you have to be refusing himself all the time and could somebody making\nA no one can make him which is a real concern um there's nothing that forces Supreme Court justices to recuse themselves of course parties would filed motions to recuse where they feel like it's appropriate\nI think if you have an issue that concerns women um or liberal politics or even voting cases I think there's a real concern as to whether he can be fair\nIssues concerning women you're saying that you would be making an argument or if you were a lawyer before the court that he shouldn't be judging anything concerning women\nI mean I ... I don't know that I Would make that argument that far but I ... like I think there are certain issues look there were already issues about whether he could fairly judge issues on presidential power and there were lots of discussions about whether he needed to recuse at the beginning of this process\nBecause President Trump might conceivably have some case before the court and over again I'm right\nI think there are numerous cases that could come before the court involving President Trump and a judge Kavanaugh has made lots of comments about the extent of a presidential power so that was a concern already and I think his demeanor last week um shows that there are a lot more concerns about his temperament\nJob at the American Constitution Society it's like so much and\nGet a new State Department visa policy declared that starting this month and diplomats who want to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married Here's NPR's Michele tell them in\nA State Department official says marriage equality is the love the land here in the U.

answers for that he said he didn't remember what he said right after the shooting because he was in shock and couldn't explain discrepancies with the video and he was he was combative with prosecutors
