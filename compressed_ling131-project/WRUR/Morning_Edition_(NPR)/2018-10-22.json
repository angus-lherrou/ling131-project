A. B. E. Johnny Kauffman is here to talk about this he reported the story along with reveal an eight PM reports either Johnny\nHey they're so tell us why this is significant\nWell this is a really close historic race for governor here right now there's lots of national attention on it and it's kind of seen as this sort of test for the twenty twenty presidential contest\nAnd Brian Kemp is running against Democrats Stacey Abrams who would be the first black female governor and the country and her strategy is all about boosting turnout among people of color right Democrats and civil rights groups say that these voters\nOr they don't show up at the polls as regularly as Republicans and so they say to use it or lose it purges disproportionately affect those voters and that\nReally this is a new voter suppression tactic they're Republicans are using to help them when\nIs this an issue that seems to be capturing the attention of voters this election gets closer\nYeah this has become a big campaign issue and uh we went to a small town in southwest Georgia called Moultrie um most people there I in this in the town or black or Latino and turnout is really low\nAnd we spoke to this man and Reverend Cornelius ponder who's on the city council there and he says part of that low turnout is because of all these obstacles devoting including the purchase so here's a clip of ponder from our story that aired on the podcast reveal\nIt almost gives people the ... the mindset that that this is ... now right and so now anything that is a privilege has to get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use his privilege\nIs so when it comes to the purges hunters and actually with someone who was removed for not voting\nShe didn't know at her nephew didn't know it and die her story is kind of that she voted for Obama in two thousand eight she hasn't voted since then and she's thinking about voting off or Abrams but unless she registered before the deadline earlier this month\nShe may go to the polls and and won't be able to vote and Georgia doesn't have same day voter registration unlike some other states now you actually spoke\nTo secretary camp the Republican candidate who actually carried out this policy right I mean what's his argument here\nYeah Ken says he's just following the law and this is legal to Supreme Court actually approved a policy like this earlier this year\nOr that he said the state sends out multiple notifications before rooms people and that this is in part a way of combating voter fraud and Kemp says he has not been more aggressive and purging voters than previous secretaries of state but the numbers show a big jump and people were move we found one point six million had been removed since he took over okay\nW.

migrants is focusing fresh attention on the flow of people from Central America\nThey've been labeled a caravan we're talking about upwards of five thousand people many fleeing violence in Honduras they're moving north and many hope to reach the United states know Mexican authorities spoke of stopping them but then let them pass into southern Mexico over the weekend President Trump delivered a stern message\nThese are heartened to see people and I don't want them and\nNow we should say the president made these claims about these migrants without offering any evidence and we want to turn now to reporter James Frederick who was on the ground and has been following them Hi there James\nI Do so where exactly are you and and talk to me about the conditions of of the people in this caravan\nSo I Am in Tampa Chula Mexico right now it's about twenty miles north of Mexico Guatemala border I'm and I'm hearing the central square where the care of and uh ended yesterday\nUm people here are just sleeping on the street\nUm I mean right now I'm looking I'm you know as a little girl who is tucked under a blanket with her mom right next to them is a little boys is probably three or four years old or with his parents there's a there's a guy just sleeping under a little plastic bags\nHere um these people walk more than twenty miles yesterday to get here temperatures got about Ninety degrees\nUm season just tell they're absolutely exhausted\nYeah I can imagine um so I mean in addition to sleeping on sidewalks and walking is long distances and exhaustion or I mean it's I guess a lot of uncertainty about whether the Mexican government whether the U.S government is actually going to let them continue this journey [noise] yeah\nAnd it's been very confusing to try to figure out exactly what the Mexican Government strategy is sheer\nUm because yesterday I was watching what the caravan do we heard there was a blockade being set up by Mexican police that we went to check it out\nThey have like two hundred riot police ready to stop the caravan and then a couple of minutes later they just took the blockade away all the police left and the caravan kept marching so they don't know if the Mexican government is really going to college there to try to stop them\nOr if they're going to be able to continue north it's it's just not clear yet\nSo we've been obviously reporting on migrants from Central America making their way to the United states for a long time now that this group and correct me if I'm wrong seem particularly large um\nDoes that tell us anything [noise]\nSo ... you're right we we\nHave been saying for years people fleeing countries like Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala there's lots and lots of crime gang crime is very bad there you know poverty is also really bad um\nYou know talking to people about why they're in the chair bound why so many of them have come together they just said they saw the caravan as an opportunity to be safer because this migrant route is so dangerous for migrants and especially if you're traveling with kids travelling alone put you at risk of so many things\nOf cartels and gangs attacking you which is very common here in Mexico\nSo they saw this as the safest way to get out of their country and they think the United states is is the safest the best place they can be\nNo kind of course president from now saying though that they're not going to be allowed into the country so a lot of uncertainty for the group you're following this reporter James Frederick speaking to us about this caravan of migrants moving northward you speaking to us from Mexico James thanks a lot\nThank you\nVoters are choosing more than the U.S Congress this fall they also choose state legislatures and many ...\nThere's Democrats have a chance to gain back some of the governorships they have lost to Republicans only sixteen fifty governors right now we're Democrats Republicans are working to defend their games including and the very red state of Kansas here's Jim McLean of the Kansas news service\nLaura Kelly is a veteran member of the Kansas Senate and the ... democratic nominee for governor she's doing our best to keep the memory of four Republican governor Sam Brownback fresh in the minds of Kansas voters\nParticularly the memory of how the income tax cuts that Brownback champion crashed the budget and forced to cut funding for schools highways and healthcare\nWe can either go backwards and repeat the last eight years from\n\n[noise] Kelly is running against from back who moved on to the Trump Administration but in debates like this one of the state fair she misses no opportunity to talk her Republican opponent Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach to the former governor and his policies\nKris Kobach is making it very clear where he will take us as a state you will take us back to the devastation that we have just lived through\nKelly is getting help from some unexpected sources some big name Republicans at least ... or jumping party lines to support\nLaura Kelly is the only Democrat I have ever offers moderate\nRepublicans do raise was governor of Kansas from Nineteen Ninety five to two thousand\nTwo more to me has all these all the sequels abilities were looking to leave the state during this time\nWe go after graves endorsed Kelly soda GOP stalwart Nancy casual ball she represented Kansas for Seventeen years in the U.S Senate as co box promise to restore the comeback tax cuts convinced her go public\nWe've tried so hard\nShipley let a lot of things she saw\nA spokesperson for the Obama campaign dismissed the endorsements calling grazing casual bum quote tired has been Z and poured into this as the endorsement that matters\nI Want to introduce the next governor of Kansas Kris Kobach [noise]\nWatch as President Trump's initial was delivered on Twitter the day before the primary might've been the difference maker in his razor thin victory over the incumbent governor and he's counting on the president's recent visit to Kansas to energize his base in the final weeks of a general election campaign that's coming down to the wire\nSimply I Want to do for Kansas what President Trump has done for America [noise]\nRover walking Kelly virtually deadlocked that means that race could be decided by independent Greg Orman he's a wealthy businessman from the Kansas City suburbs who's hoping to exploit what he believes is widespread voter frustration\nI traveled through the state of Kansas I find talking to Republicans and talking to Democrats up you know sort of a broad dissatisfaction with what's going on right now and the fact that we don't seem to be solving problems we seem to be having food fights\nIn twenty fourteen was no Democrat in the race Orman through a scare into Republican U.S Senator Pat Roberts but this time around he's pulling in single digits even so says former Democratic governor Kathleen Sebelius that could be enough to tilt the race\nHe certainly can be a spoiler Greg Orman could elect Kris Kobach governor and less Kansas voters are paying a lot of attention\nPaying attention to the likes of graves and casual bum who were urging moderate Republicans in particular across party lines for Kelly NPR News I'm Jim McLean in Topeka [noise]\n\nOh\n[noise]\nIt's five forty two as MORNING EDITION continues on ... good morning on

minutes with us here on MORNING edition welcome it's good to have you here\nMany of your stories are are filled with brutality but there is also a wide vein of dark humor running through some of them which I think might surprise people the story that gives you a book it's title friday black the short story takes place in what we assume is a department store and\nIt's a it's a Black Friday the Friday after Thanksgiving which we all know is is kind of a nightmare of consumerism your protagonist as a young man working in the stores selling fleece jackets\nYou have these just vicious scenes where people consumers shoppers storm\nThe entrance of the store and there are so overwhelmed at the idea of getting a deal that they trample each other they when they trample each other to the point of debt they they show bodies out of the way that is a heck of a way to look at at Black Friday [laughter] what were you saying there\nTo talk about the humor in it for me it's important to\nTry to laugh when you can because\nI think it's healthy but also I think for me to wait to help me say exactly what I Want to say because if I don't add celebrities um humor I probably won't get through on some level for the reader I think it's like the sugar it's health and medicine go down sometimes\nUm you kinda get through a story where there's like ... the state of humor and sometimes I think the punch line is it actually it wasn't a joke after all but with on that story front of a black I did work in retail I really have seen a like a woman step one another woman's like cash for genes\nUm we all know for a fact that pretty much a newly someone gets killed because people in Wal Mart or trying to get TVs in my mind the first time that happened everyone the country the world's would have been like whoa whoa whoa whoa\nYou know maybe we've I'm taking this thing too far but it's that's a scary thing for me to think about what's scary like think how how we can know that happens so regularly still sort of casually participate\nYet the main character in that story and friday black as a young man who wants to get the sales record because he will win a prize and the prize is a code that he intends to give to his mother\nAnd at one point it at a colleague it in the young man can find some and says you know seeing seeing the body string about hearing the yelling and screaming he says this this is just not worth it your mother knows that you love her she doesn't need a cult\nAnd you know what's what's funny about that moment and I didn't have that moment ... ... if you believe that originally really like the original draft and I'm surprised I\nYeah and actually I'm prior to the book being caught fire blackout a previous title and after I made that editorial change after Ira buys it and made that moment I was\nFinally like okay this this can be the title of the book because you absolutely need that moment to moment of self implication in which the somebody said like you know you think you're not in this but you are in it to just the same line of logic I'm going to participate in this craziness\nBecause I'm going to get my mother a thing and the ... and again for me is important because like I said I really did work in retail there where the contest is my story through and giving us more money or something whoever's made the most sales we get um a north face jacket\nAnd I got it from my mom I really did wow I really did do that and um you know I don't know that she wears it any more\nYou are the the sign of of immigrants from Africa Africa yes both my parents are from ... how how do you think that informs the way you see race in the United states and in particular racial tension which makes up so much of of your book in in the United states\nI'm sure it informs me and a lot of ways I Can't even really perceive you know my parents are they're very decidedly I'm African they got me in\nAnd they would sometimes even ... I had a built in thing that I had to work doing sort of just about even my distinction from black Americans which they were like you know you're not from here and I don't think you can act like these people here\nAnd because of the way I started again in Queens New York I was I I understood you know block is different and all you know but because of the way like the sort of pride associated with where my parents come from and I didn't have to default to a feeling of\nWhite is the best which I think is really hard to escape and America and you mentioned something before like some of my characters [noise]\nA lot of them it's explicit that I'd like some of them they're not but in my mind they're all black you know I don't accept the sort of white ... in in\nVery rural days almost like if you don't say they're black or white\nI definitely like sort of tried to resist that and especially because in ... there was some often the way they're racist revealed his do some type of traumatic incidents happening because of the reason I don't want that to be the case where\nI'm readers are owning the characters that of our color having that matter of fact in some kind of pain of trauma for them [noise]\nNone of climbing Ajay ... thank you so much for coming in to talk today we really appreciate it appreciate it thank you so much [noise]\nNew short story collection is called friday block [noise]\n\nAnd this is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene [noise]\n\n[noise]\nSupport for your public radio station comes from our members and from the New York state health department reminding international travelers that there are measles outbreaks in many parts of the world before traveling very young children and many adults may need another dose of vaccine learn more\nAt health dot and why dot Gov slashed travel\nIt's a minute before six and you're listening to MORNING EDITION on member supported public radio W ... a about Chester\nW.

decide whether to protect occupants war bystanders in some crashes\nAnd artificial intelligence good discriminated against women job applicants that story we covered the other day\nWell the powerful trait in tech organization the Institute of electrical and electronics engineers has just come up with a new ethics certification process\nIt's designed to help engineers make technology that on balance helps rather than hurts and is transparent about the assumptions built in John Havens is executive director of the ice ... artificial intelligence and robot ethics project thanks for coming in\nMy pleasure to be here this is about what a putting human needs first when it comes to\nAutonomous robots self driving technology\nWell I think in general it sort of an idea of a contract when you buy a piece of technology and the expectation is it will be safe and all that but with autonomous and intelligence systems there's just new things that people have to understand are trustworthy\nSo for instance as engineers work on autonomous vehicles self driving cars and trucks\nThey have to program in different preferences of self driving car has a choice of saving the occupants of the car in an impending crash but at the expense of killing pedestrians would the certification program demand that we know about that particular choice\nThe logic is to write out all the potential scenarios that could happen but right now a lot of times those conversations happen outside the context of how many humans unfortunately are killed with cars is they are right now\nBut the way the technology answers that question is that something that the sort of a Geisha process wants to know more about or wants to the end user to know more about\nIn the sense I'll give you an example it's more of a cultural thing recently autonomous vehicles were tested in Australia\nAnd the lidar the technology that's used to sense surroundings hadn't been programmed to recognize kangaroos [laughter] so the big kind of like bouncing jumping around motions weren't recognized whereas like squirrel dirt emotions were recognized\nBut the point is is that you have to ask even more questions than you had before when you have these new types of technologies and that actually goes back to safety it's just a different type of safety question than some people may have asked before\nAs the technology advances it requires human beings to decide what are our values and what our values in different countries you have to actually define them and be aware of them all\nEthics questions oftentimes especially in western media is coming from a Greek background of ethics whereas when we have the other side of the planet and the global south\nHas things called Confucian ethics or a boon to ethics and it's a reframing of the paradigm that's how we come to these questions and so it's when you ask those questions that much more this is where the word safety your trust can really be elevated to more global levels and that's what I ... about consensus building globally\nIs to say we don't know we don't know yet but we have to ask\nJohn ... is one of the architects of the ethics certification program for autonomous and intelligence systems at the ...

the flow of people from Central America they have been labeled a caravan we're talking about up words the seven thousand people many of them fleeing violence in Honduras they're moving northward and many hoped to reach the United states now Mexican authorities\nSpoke of stopping them but then let them pass into southern Mexico over the weekend President Trump delivered a stern message\nThese are heartened thing it's the talk of people and I don't want them you\nKnow we should say the president made these claims about these migrants without offering any evidence and we want to turn now to reporter James Frederick who was on the ground and has been following them either James ... so where exactly are you and and talk to me about the conditions of of the people in this caravan\nSo I Am in Tampa to Mexico right now it's about twenty miles north of Mexico Guatemala border I'm and I'm hearing the central square where the care of and ah ended yesterday um people here are just sleeping on the street um I mean right now I'm looking I'm\nYou know at a little girl who is tucked under a blanket with her mom right next to them is a little boy he's probably three or four years old\nOr with his parents there's a there's a guy just sleeping under a little plastic bag here um these people walk more than twenty miles yesterday to get here temperatures got above Ninety degrees um so you can just tell they're absolutely exhausted\nYeah I can imagine um so I mean in addition to sleeping on sidewalks and walking is long distances and exhaustion or I mean it's I guess a lot of uncertainty about whether the Mexican government whether the U.S government is actually going to let them continue this journey\nYet and it's been very confusing to try to figure out exactly what the Mexican Government strategy is here um because yesterday I was\nWalking with the care of and then we heard there was a blockade being set up by Mexican police so we went to check it out they had like two hundred riot police ready to stop the caravan and then a couple of minutes later they just took this blockade away all the police left\nAnd the caravan kept marching so they don't know if the Mexican government is really going to put police there to try to stop them or if they're going to be able to continue north it's it's just not clear yet\nSo we've been obviously reporting on migrants from Central America making their way to United States for a long time now that this group and correct me if I'm wrong seems particularly large um does that tell us anything\n[noise] so ... you're right we we have been seeing for years\nPeople fleeing countries like Honduras and El Salvador in Guatemala there's you know lots and lots of crime gang crime is very bad there you know poverty is also really bad\nUm you know talking to people about why during this caravan of why so many of them have come together\nThey just said they saw the caravan as an opportunity to be safer because this migrant route is so dangerous for migrants and especially if you're traveling with kids travelling alone puts you at risk of so many things of cartels and gangs attacking you which is very common here in Mexico\nSo they saw this as the safest way to get out of their countries and they think the United states is is the safest and best place they can be\nOkay and of course president I'm not saying though that they are not going to be allowed into the country it's a lot of uncertainty for the group you're following this reporter James Frederick speaking to us about this caravan of migrants moving northward you speaking to us from Mexico James thanks a lot\nThank you\nAmerican voters are choosing more than the U.S Congress this fall they also choose state legislatures\nAnd many governors Democrats have a chance to gain back some of the governorships they have lost to Republicans only sixteen fifty governors right now we're Democrats Republicans are working to defend their games

policies\nKris Kobach is making it very clear where he will take us as a state he will take us back to the devastation that we had just lived through\nKelly is getting help from some unexpected sources some big name Republicans at least big cans are jumping party lines to support\nHer Laura Kelly is the only Democrat I have an office moderate\nRepublican bill raised was governor of Kansas

Kansas what President Trump for America [noise]\nDrove ... virtually deadlocked that means that race could be decided by independent Greg Orman he's a wealthy businessman from the Kansas City suburbs who's hoping to exploit what he believes is widespread voter frustration\nI traveled through the state of Kansas I find talking to Republicans and talking to Democrats up you know sort of a broad dissatisfaction with what's going on right now and the fact that we don't seem to be solving problems we seem to be having food fights\nIn ... with no Democrat in the race Orman through a scare into Republican U.S Senator Pat Roberts but this time around he's pulling in single digits even shows is former Democratic governor Kathleen Sebelius that could be enough to to the race\nHe's certainly can

A. B. is Johnny Kauffman is with me another Johnny\nHey David so this happened and twenty Seventeen um why is it significant now why are we focusing on this today\nWell right now we're in the midst of a really close historic race for governor here and there's lots of national attention on it and camp is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams and she would be the first black female governor in the country\nHer strategy to win this year is all about boosting turnout amongst people of color and\nDemocrats and civil rights groups say that these voters don't show up at the polls as regularly as Republicans so they use it or lose it purges disproportionately affect those voters and they say they really this is a new voter suppression tactic Republicans are using to help them win and so what reaction has there\nBeen from voters I mean this is becoming a campaign issue and he's found a way\nYeah voting has really become a central issue in the campaign here and we went to a rural southwest Georgia I and then visited the small town called Moultrie which is mostly black and Latino\nAnd voter turnout is really low there and we spoke to Reverend Cornelius ponder who's a community leader and he explains that low turnout is because of these obstacles to voting liked to purchase on here's a clip of ponder from our story that aired on the pod cast reveal\nIt almost getting people to read my say that this is a privilege not a right and so now anything that is a privilege has to get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use his privilege\nAnd so when it comes to the purchase a ... was actually someone that was a root for not voting she voted for Obama in two thousand eight she hasn't voted since then and she's thinking about voting for Abrams but unless you registered before the deadline earlier this month she may go to the polls and she won't be able to vote Georgia doesn't have the same day voter registration like some states so the idea that\nThis is creating a mindset that voting is a privilege to the idea that there's voter suppression I mean those are incredibly serious I'm Serious charges um\nWhat is secretary Kim saying in response to all of that\nWell ... points out that he's following the last year the Supreme Court has approved this use it or lose that policy they did that this year\nAnd he says you know the state sends out multiple notifications before moving these people he says he hasn't been more aggressive and purging voters and other secretaries of state\nBut the numbers show a big jump and people were moved by one point six million people since he took over that includes all also people who have moved our died and these people who have been removed for not voting\nAnd you've been following a lot of issues like this as of this election gets close right\nYeah there have been at least I I think for lawsuits filed in the last week over voting or the big one is over this policy that's disproportionately holding up the voter registration applications of people of color those people can still vote but civil rights advocates are worried about confusion and people getting discouraged\nUm there's some ... a lot of absentee ballots that have been rejected in one county specifically\nAnd I you know this is a really close race they're few undecided voters both candidates are really trying to motivate their bases and they found that criticizing the other candidate over voting seems like a way to do that\nJohnny Kauffman from member station W.
