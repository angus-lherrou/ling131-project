a kind of personal characteristics test or a valuation that people are given when they apply and that is affected the number of Asians whites or anybody else who goes in hottest Harvard respond to that\nHarvard says there's been no discrimination against Asian American applicants points out Asian Americans now account for twenty three percent of all the students at a hiring event in Detroit

that we learn from our differences that creating a diverse learning environment enriches the learning experience for every student on campus\nAnd feedback out told me that what's at stake here is Harvard in higher educations ability to create that diverse environment which he says the central to its mission\nAnd Harvard is defending this how I rely on understand there's just a little bit when we say that that twenty three percent of the student body is Asian the accusation is that Asians would be an even higher percentage if it were not for this personal characteristics test is that right\nRight if you just focus on academics and test scores alone Asian Americans would would would be significant larger proportion of the number of students at at Harvard\nAnd how significant is it correct that the Trump Administration has weighed in in favor of the plaintiffs here\nRight the Justice Department filed a brief in support of the lawsuit saying Harvard's admissions process quote may

means we're two days from a big Brexit summit and talks between the United kingdom and the European Union are stole\nThe prime minister of the a K trace of Maine is holding a cabinet meeting tomorrow there is the threat that some of the members might resign over this political party that's propping up her fragile government at this point says walking away from the European Union with out a deal is quote probably inevitable\nNPR's Frank Langfitt will never walk away from the story on his on the line from London once again either Frank absolutely nuts so how is this how does go over the weekend\nWell the big problem is we've talked about many times the is is you know how does the u._k. leave the EU without creating a hard border on the island of Ireland and this is so contentious ... working solution is actually just to postpone a solution to kick the can down the road that's her best idea at this point\nAnd have the you can continue to operate inside the use customs area\nSo wouldn't eat customs checks between Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland which is ah the the Northern Ireland of course as a part of the u._k. but the even the u._k. can't agree on how long this customs arrangement would expire and that's one of the main reasons that talks collapse of this weekend\nOr I guess we should just remember so Britain is still for the moment as part of the European Union which means there are open borders people can travel from place to place they can live\nFrom one place to another and the latest idea is that for at least a little while if the British can get the Europeans to go along they would continue to lead goods move across those borders\nExactly well well at least across the island of Ireland yes and in fact yeah the u._k. would actually stay in the customs union the problem with that though is for breakfast ears they say you know they're afraid that this was going to go on forever and this is actually a way that could undermine the whole idea of wrecks it brings it would never happen\nI'm also they want to be able to get out of the was soon as possible because one of their big pitches back in two thousand and a sixteen during the referendum is they would ah cutting new trade deals with other countries and this would actually reinvigorate and help the economy here I'm In the United kingdom\nThe bottom line is that um analysts they may just can't get an open ended cousins arrangement through her own parliament so she's basically having problems in the end problems back here\nWhile so we're still in a place where Britain's Theresa May does not have enough of her own conservative party on the same page that she can go to the Europeans and say we're committed to whatever proposal were just brought you\nYeah and that's and that's part of the problem in in ... I think particularly the idea of this open ended customs arrangement\nIs just not flying here David Davis he's a former Brexit secretary he resigned earlier not too long ago in roe test he's calling for cabinet rebellion against May's plan Northern Ireland democratic union party\nThere propping up a prime minister May's government they're also against this plan and if they pull out they could cripple the government by refusing to vote on any big bills you wouldn't be able to get anything done\nAnd and in the ... the prime minister getting consensus on this so far is proving nearly impossible\nWhat happens over the next couple of days that\nWell I think what we're going to see is a see how they kept it responds tomorrow I mean as they're open dissent to people threatened to resign I think that's the next step\nMay will fly to Brussels on Wednesday um but there are no talks plan between now and then so it seems like it would be much harder to get an agreement there still time left the wants a deal by the end of this year UK scheduled to end a leave at the end of march and there's a possibility the the UK still could leave without a deal\nFrank thanks so much\nHappy to do it Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt in London\n[noise]\nFor your public radio station comes from our members and for him to oil Subaru offering the new twenty Nineteen Subaru was sent an all wheel drive SUV with sitting for up to\nEight and eyesight driver assist technology located on bridge wrote in Webster and online at ...

Americans\nThe group that's suing the school is called students for fair admissions and it claims the university systematically ranks Asian American applicants lower on personality characteristics Harvard denies this charge joining us our reporter Kirk Carapezza of men Boston member station WBUR GBH he's been following this story closely Kirk thanks for being here\nHey good morning Rachel so I just gave the broad brush stokes of what the suit is about but can you get more detail to what is the central allegation here\nShould the group students for fair admissions led by conservative legal strategist Edward Blum is claiming that Harvard caps the number of academically qualified Asian American applicants by using these personal ratings in court the group will need to prove that Harvard is intentionally rejecting the applicants because of their Asian because of their race\nI spoke with attorney ... with the Asian American legal foundation which is supporting this lawsuit changes Chinese American and he's also a Harvard graduate\nHarvard is systematically saying that Asian candidates are not likeable and don't have good personalities by orders of magnitude less than candidates of any other ethnic group which is really nothing but racist it perpetuates and feeds and create stereotypes\n... so just to be clear Kirk is so Harvard uses this personality rating system for all applicants it's just that this group is alleging that Asian American applicants are the ones who get dangerous often\nRight Rachel there the group is claiming that Harvard to using these rankings to racially balance of classes which is illegal it's unconstitutional\n[noise] so uh how are how is Harvard waiting a defense\nHarvard says there's been no discrimination against Asian American applicants ended continuously points out that Asian Americans now account for twenty three percent of all the students and they make up just six percent of the U.S population\nAt a higher education of and in Detroit last month I caught up with Harvard's new president Larry back out and he defended the colleges admissions process\nNobody wants to be judged on their numbers alone he will understand and recognize that we learn from our differences that creating a diverse learning environment in which is the learning experience for every student on campus\nAnd back oh says what's at stake here is Harvard and higher educations ability to create that diverse environment which he argues is central to its mission\nThe Trump Administration has come out I weighed in on this the department of justice backing the plane tests is that going to make a difference\nRight last month the Justice Department filed a brief in support of the lawsuit saying Harvard's\nAdmissions process quote may be infected

Trump's executive order designed to ban refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries\nJudge burrows is known for her independence streak so I don't think she'll be swayed by the Justice Department or the Trump Administration or any other political agenda\nI mean this is about Harvard but it could this case to have an impact on admission policies at other schools\n... civil rights leaders certainly worried about that they see this law suit as a direct attack on race conscious admissions which for the past forty years the Supreme Court has allowed if carefully done\nStudents for fair admissions have explicitly said their goal was to overturn that precedent and that they want selective schools like Harvard to stop considering race altogether ...\nReporter

held his largest maneuver since the Nineteen eighties that included a significant Chinese contingent and NATO was about to hold its biggest exercises in the Cold War in Norway president Poroshenko bristles when asked training with Americans could provoke Russia\nWe are so many independent states and all the Ukrainian people will decide they're redoing our cost of the mission from Russia which we should do and also\nThe commander of the Ukrainian airbase colonel ... says he's happy to be hosting the Americans could not have imagined just drilled just a couple of years ago yesterday I had

years ago Brookings died on Thursday\nW ... has more on broken life and his legacy in luck Sandberg\nRichard Brooklyn's died last week at the age of Ninety six he was a World War two veteran buddies impact as a soldier is perhaps best known for the impromptu decision to have him dress up as St Nicholas on December fifth Nineteen forty four and bring smiles to the kids of the small walks in Bergen County builds\nHopefully remind audiences are you know that this wasn't the sort of gilded easy sleek high tech space travel that um they might have been sold to the public this was a really a\nHard and dangerous a labor and if the insanely risky yeah I mean you know they said we're going to go to the moon before they had the technology to do it and they just had faith that they would catch up in time\nAnd the film is to realize how little the public actually knows about Neil Armstrong demand and this particular loss that you learn about early in the film his infant daughter died of cancer years before he went to the man\nI mean it it's the unfathomable tragedy uh but but but in some ways what's even more striking about it is how many people that Neal worked with didn't even know he had ever had a daughter I mean that's how close to the best he\nHe kept that event he and Janet were fiercely private and um I think in many ways the movie especially as we did more and more research the movie kind of shifted in in my mind and I think in Ryan's mine all of our mind from\nFrom a you know sort of mission movie about the race to the moon to a movie about grief and and coping and Neal's case a man who suffered such a profound loss that\nIn some ways you understand that his thoughts wind up just go into space go into the broader universe and and uh and maybe searching for answers that he just can't find here on earth\nShe Neil Armstrong in Columbus portrayed as a man pretty typical of his generation in his ability to them ... men allies his emotions plus that truth him [noise]\nI I think it was and and um we had to really rely on on people who knew him behind those closed doors people who knew the non public Neal because the public Neal yeah it was pretty reticent I'm pretty uh even seem to reclusive um of course once you get to the private Neal\nUh he was a actually a immensely complicated you know he was capable of\nGoofing off you had a really sly sense of humor and a dry wit he\nWas also capable of a of a real you know almost sort of a scary intensity when it came to the passion with which he attacked his work and his passion for aviation I think we wanted to try to get at that vulnerability that human qualities so that you you know because\nI think he's become and the collective imagination such a poker face almost marble statues hero but I'm the people like his kids he was just dead you know and to people in the neighborhood he was you know he's the guy down the street\n[noise] says you know the movie has gotten some criticism from some on a conservative side of the political spectrum who have taken issue with the fact that the ... doesn't show Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planting the American flag on them in\nSo let me ask you about that was that an intentional omission\nA well you know we we don't um at the American flag on the moon you see it clearly in several shots and I think this conversation about the sort of a mission has been happening or exclusively among people who haven't seen the film so I'm just really excited that the movie is opening and\nAnd that people can start seeing it and see for themselves what um the tribute I guess that we we tried to\nTo pay in the movie to what was undeniably an American enterprise and a a group of uh just American heroes I'm the\nOne other thing I'll say though is is that it's it was really important to us to try also to wherever possible focus on the untold story and and things that people didn't see and didn't know and take a very personal subjective angle on these sort of big historical events\nAre in between the things that you read about in the history books and you were actually seen the sort of stuff ah that again hopefully helps tell the human story and help show that you know these were human beings and not a\nMythological figures these were a ordinary people doing it\nCheap as we've been talking I became a hero and an icon but you've stopped story before we see that happening in the chronology why did you make that choice to and from where it ends with him kind of that but we don't see him emerged to like the throngs of cheering crowds [noise]\nIt's a um we we know about the sort of a\nTickertape parades and what not um I was really surprised to learn about this time in quarantine that the astronaut spent right after coming back from\nFrom the moon and to get to actually visit that quarantine and see how small and on glamorous bedrooms word that they stayed in and and uh you know those government buildings and\nYou come back from the moon and suddenly you're thrust right into the the epitome of the mundane um and I just found that fascinating and it was this tremendous moment of hope that the entire world was given by\nMoon landing but also just a reminder of the loss that it took to get there\nUh it didn't actually feel appropriate maybe is the word to end the movie with just nothing but cheering crowds and and people getting their pictures taken it felt that there had to be some acknowledgement in a way of um just the men's sacrifice and and a loss that will never go away but\nA without which you know we wouldn't have had this tremendous game but the whole world got to benefit from and he never went up\nInto space again no he didn't um yeah I'm In some ways you know it's ... ... Ryan had an interesting way of referring to when we were kind of try to figure out how to frame certain scenes in the movie and in the shooting of them\nYou talked about how you know to him just wasn't a movie about a guy landing on the moon was a movie about a guy landed on earth um and it's that journey to actually truly come home and ever since that word and to land on the ground and to and to be a one with your family it's a much longer journey in a way than the journey to them\n[noise] the film is called first men we've been speaking to that director Damien says I'll Damian thank you somewhat thank you so much for having me [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep\nSupport for your public radio station comes from our members and from Jenna see regional banks supporting businesses and individuals in Rochester community with business banking personal banking and home mortgage services\nJenna see regional bank community banking community building information online at G R B bank dot com [noise]\nGood morning you're listening to MORNING EDITION on member supported public radio W ... by ... am Rochester double you argue our estimate HD Rochester W execs why at the end ho chin and W.

Britain voted on Brexit in two thousand sixteen advocates for that change said there was no downside\nThe u._k. would withdraw from the European Union but the British economy was so big so vital the Europeans would easily negotiate great terms of trade with the British that's what breakfast advocates said that now as prime minister Theresa May prepares to meet European leaders this week was time running out\nThere is a risk of no trade deal at all NPR's Frank Langfitt is covering this story in London either Frank good morning Steve how has the story of all there\nWas no going very well you know uh basically there were talks over the weekend a dominant Robie's the breakfast after he flew to Brussels\nAnd couldn't come up with a deal and there is opposed the premise you may supposed to fly to Brussels on Wednesday with the hope of kind of working this out but it's not going very well and as you're not discussed many times before the big sticking point which was never discussed during that referendum you mentioned\nIs the future of a a border across an eye on the island of Ireland and neither side wants to see a new border um but there's a great concern that that could happen and they can't agree on how to work it out\nBasically with prime minister may would like to do is stay in a customs union with the United kingdom I mean with the EU for a limited time the doesn't want that they were afraid they want to guarantee there'll be no border and basically the talks or they'll make\nUs so what they've gotten to use some way to somewhat extend the free trade between Britain and the European Union exactly\nWhat they're really doing Steve is frankly honestly kicking the can down the road because this is such a difficult problem to solve all\nThough you also noted that even that proposal or is not something the Europeans are legal too eager to grab onto\nNo they're not actually here's the big problem for prime minister may even many members of her party don't like the idea either if you go back to what you're talking about earlier breakfast ears they sold this to people in the United kingdom as he was going to be a brave new trading future for the United kingdom they were going to cut all these new deals with new with other countries like the United states\nIn fact if they stay inside a customs arrangement for a long time that actually would tie their hands they say they would be still tethered to the European Union and they wouldn't be able to cut these new deals that they say and they insist would be really good for the u._k. economy\nWell are there Brexit fears then saying okay fine great let's just walk away from the European Union with no agreement at all which means we end up with a hard border in Ireland and no real relationship with the Europeans everything has to be started over from scratch their our breakfast years who\nSay that to an end even prime minister may has said in the past ah no ... no deal is better than a bad deal and what's happening is we're running out of time here it is possible that there could be other negotiations in November and December but I think the European Union's patience is running\nA and the difficulty for prime minister may is even if she can get a deal with the European Union could you get it through her own parliament there's going to be a cabinet meeting tomorrow where it's going to be probably pretty fractious and there's a there's a rising risk if there would be no ... no deal between the two\nUm and what that would mean certainly to the u._k. economy many economists say would be very bad walking away from this enormous markets across the English Channel\nOkay so prime minister may meet tomorrow with her cabinet and then what happens the next day well now we have\nTo see if she'll even slide to Brussels she supposed to fly to Brussels but if there haven't if there haven't been any further talks\nNo further negotiations no progress what's the point of her going she actually flew to Salzburg this was about a month ago and and actually she felt was humiliated by the European Union they didn't like the deal she was offering and kind of center on her way she's not going to risk that again\nSo we're just they'll mate and time is running out remember at the end of march the United kingdom is set to leave the European Union and there's not a lot of time left to work this out\nFrank always a pleasure talking with your facts happy to do it Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt in London\nBoth political parties in this country have a lot at stake this November some Democrats say they're very survival is on the line well for President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress the prize on election night is not just to stay in power but to stay relevant NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports\nIf Republicans hang onto their majorities in the house and Senate their approach to governing will be validated they can continue to confirm judges take another whack at Obamacare help President Trump shut down the mother investigation on the other hand says former Republican majority leader Eric Cantor\nIf the Republicans are unable to maintain their majority in the house democratic rule no matter who the speaker is will be very much in opposition to the Trump White house\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be a perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a simple majority gives you almost absolute power to infect the agenda and get bills across the floor\nThat will greatly affect their willingness for some who had been at it for a long time and make the decision whether maybe they should retire or not\nCantor things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and embolden there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be a bullet because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans and what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty eight or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning at the election as we're dedicated luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern that means funding them all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security\nAccomplishments that looted them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making at all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\n\nYou're listening to NPR News and now an update from ...

GBH he's been following this story closely Kirk thanks for being here\nHey good morning Rachel so I just gave the broad brush stokes of what this is about but can you get more detail to what is the central allegation here\nShould the group students for fair admissions led by conservative legal strategist Edward Blum is claiming that Harvard caps the number of academically qualified Asian American applicants by using these personal ratings in court the group will need to prove that Harvard is intentionally rejecting the applicants because of their Asian because of their race\nI spoke with attorney ... with the Asian American legal foundation which is supporting this lawsuit changes Chinese American and he's also a Harvard graduate\nHarvard the systematically saying that Asian candidates are not likeable and don't have good personalities by orders of magnitude less than candidates of any other ethnic group which is really nothing but racist it perpetuates and feeds and create stereotypes\nHuh so just to be clear Kirk isn't so Harvard uses his personality rating system for all applicants it's just that this group is alleging that Asian American applicants are the ones who get ... most often\nRight Rachel there the group is claiming that Harvard is using these rankings to racially ballots classes which is illegal it's unconstitutional\nSo how is Harvard waiting a defense\nHarvard says there's been no discrimination against Asian American applicants ended continuously points out that Asian Americans now account for twenty three percent of all it emitted students and they make up just six percent of the U.S population\nAt a higher education event in Detroit last month I caught up with Harvard's new president Larry back out and he defended the colleges admissions process\nNobody wants to be judged on their numbers alone he will understand and recognize that we learn from our differences that creating a diverse learning environment enriches the learning experience for every student on campus\nAnd back oh says what's at stake here is Harvard and higher educations ability to create that diverse environment which he argues is central to its mission\nFor the Trump Administration has come out I weighed in on this the department of justice backing the plane test is that going to make a difference\nRight last month the Justice Department filed a brief in support of the lawsuit saying Harvard's\nAdmissions process quote may be infected with racial bias here in Boston judge Alison boroughs will preside over the trial and she was nominated by President Obama back in two thousand fourteen and she's the same judge who blocked President Trump's executive order designed to ban refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries\nJudge burrows is known for her independence streak so I don't think she'll be swayed by the Justice Department or the Trump Administration or any other political agenda\nI mean this is about harbor but it could this case have an impact on the mission policies at other schools\nCivil rights leaders certainly worried about that they see this law suit as a direct attack on race conscious admissions which for the past forty years the Supreme Court has allowed us carefully done students for fair admissions have explicitly said their goal is to overturn that precedent and they want selective schools like Harvard to stop consider race altogether ...\nReporter Kirk Carapezza from W GBH in Boston Thanks so much Thanks Rachel\nAnd another interesting story but you won't hear anywhere else but NPR high ... president of W ...\nElise Orlando and I are here this morning on new member of Monday to encourage you to make a call go on line but make a gift that will help us and

volunteer or to go on line and to pick something\nThat just kind of resonates with you\nThe most important thing of course is to make sure the funding is here to be able to provide the reporting every day but you count on to make sure that MORNING EDITION and bathrooms your for you every morning\nFive eight five four or five four sixty three hundred this is new member Monday all pledges and kiss you were wandering right now are being much dollar for dollar took advantage of the challenge\nIt's now seven forty to this is Daniel ... News Good morning I'm Beth Adams\nAs the opioid death toll in Monroe County continues to climb the fatality rate is accelerating fast is among seniors W ... has more on how the epidemic is affecting Monroe County residents who are fifty an older\nJohn man a lost his brother Dave to an opioid overdose this January\nWe did a lot of things together I miss him every single day\nHopefully remind the audience is a you know that this wasn't the sort of gilded easy sleek high tech space travel that um that might have been sold to the public this was a really a\nHard and dangerous or labor and insanely risky yeah I mean you know they said we're going to go to the moon before they had the technology to do it and they just had faith that they would catch up in time huh\nAt the film makes you realize how little the public actually\nTell us about Neil Armstrong the man and this particular loss that you learn about early in the film his infant daughter died of cancer years before he ever went to the man\nI mean it it's this unfathomable tragedy uh but but but in some ways what's even more striking about it is how many people that Neal worked with didn't even know he had ever had a daughter I mean that's how close to the best he\nHe kept that event he and Janet were fiercely private and um I think in many ways the movie especially as we did more and more research the movie kind of shifted in in my mind and I think in ... and all of our mind from\nFrom a you know sort of mission movie about the race to the moon to a movie about grief and and coping and Neal's case a man who suffered such a profound loss that\nIn some ways you understand that his thoughts wind up just go into space go into the broader universe and and uh and maybe searching for answers that he just can't find here on earth\nShe Neil Armstrong in almost portrayed as a man pretty typical of his generation in his ability to compartmentalize his emotions was that true of him [noise]\nI I think it was and and um we had to really rely on on people who knew him behind those closed doors people who knew the non public Neal because the public Neal yeah it was pretty reticent in pretty or even seemed reclusive um of course once you get to the private Neal\nUh he was a actually a immensely complicated you know he was capable of\nGoofing off he had a really sly sense of humor and a dry wit he was also capable of a of a real you know almost sort of a scary intensity when it came to the passion with which he attacked his work and his passion for aviation I think we wanted to try to get at that vulnerability that human qualities so that you you know because\nI think he's become and the collective imagination such a poker face almost marble statues hero but um to people like his kids he was just dead you know\nAnd people in the neighborhood he was you know he's the guy down the street\nSays you know the movie has gotten some criticism from some on the conservative side of the political spectrum who have taken issue with the fact that the film doesn't show Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planting the American flag on them in\nSo let me ask you about that was that an intentional omission\nA well you know we we don't let the American flag on the moon you see it a clearly in several shots and I think this conversation about the sort of a mission has been happening or exclusively among people who haven't seen the film so I'm just really excited that the movies is opening and\nAnd that people can start seeing it and see for themselves what um the tribute I guess that we we tried to\nTo pay in the movie to what was undeniably in American Enterprise and a a group of uh just American heroes I'm\nOne other thing I'll say though is is that it's it was really important to us to try also to wherever possible focus on the untold story and and things that people didn't see and didn't know and take a very personal subjective angle on these sort of big historical events\nAre in between the things that you read about in the history books and you were actually seen the sort of stuff uh that again hopefully helps tell the human story and help show that you know these were human beings and not a\nMythological figures these were a a ordinary people doing it\nHeap as we've been talking I became a hero and an icon but you've stopped the story before we see that happening in the chronology why\nDid you make that choice to and from where it ends at him kind of that but we don't see him emerged to like the throngs of cheering crowds [noise]\nWell it's a um we we know about this sort of a\nTickertape parades and what not um I was really surprised to learn about this time in quarantine that the astronaut spent right after coming back from\nFrom the moon and to get to actually visited that quarantine and see how small and on glamorous bedrooms word that they stayed in and and uh you know those government buildings and you come back from the moon and suddenly you're thrust right into the\nThe epitome of the mundane um and I just found that fascinating and it was this tremendous moment of hope that the entire world was given by the moon landing\nBut also just a reminder of the loss that it took to get there uh it didn't actually feel appropriate maybe is the word to end the movie with just nothing but cheering crowds and and people getting their pictures taken it felt that there had to be some acknowledgement in a way of um just the men's sacrifice and and a loss that will never go away but\nWithout which you know we wouldn't have had this tremendous gain that the whole world got to benefit from\nAnd he never went up into space again\nNo he didn't um yeah I mean in some ways you know it's ... ... Ryan had an interesting way of of referring to when we were kind of trying to figure out how to frame certain scenes in the movie and in the shooting of them\nHe would talk about how you know to him this wasn't a movie about a guy landing on the moon it was a movie about a guy landed on earth um and it's that journey to actually truly come home in every sense of that word and to land on the ground and to and to be at one with your family it's a much longer journey in a way and the journey to them in\nThe film is called first man these things speaking to that director Damien says al Damian thank you so much thank you so much for having me\nAnd that story comes to you from MORNING EDITION right here on your public radio station\nAnd right now we are running out of town on the dollar for dollar match we need you to make that call at five eight five four or five four sixty three hundred or to go on line to W. ... news dot org and make a pledge and take advantage of the generosity of John and Cindy with gesture you are offering to meet your pledge\nDollar for dollar but only until the news comes on and it's just a few minutes\nThat's right you have about a thirty five forty seconds left to make that pledge for a dollar for dollar match for five four sixty three hundred\nThank you so much to Janet Cindy ... and all of you who've called in ... already this morning so early this morning to make a pledge of support to public radio you can make a pledge on line at W. ... news dot org and it will be matched it's new member Monday but all pledges are matched until you hear the news\nFor five four sixty three hundred is the number to call and thanks so much for supporting your public radio station and you are listening to members support at ... am out tests\nW are you are FM an HD Rochester W ...
