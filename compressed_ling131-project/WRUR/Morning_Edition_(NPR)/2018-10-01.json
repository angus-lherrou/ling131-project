member station KCUR weedy says the suit is over the state's new net neutrality rules signed into law by the governor over the weekend\nThe regulations prohibit Internet providers from blocking speeding up or slowing down Internet traffic and from charging more for faster service\nThey mirror Obama era rules that the Federal Communications commission voted to repeal last December within hours of the bill being signed into law the U.S Justice Department announced it would suit California over the new rules state senator scout leader who wrote the bill says he's confident it will stand up to legal challenges\nUm remember those those tariffs on a Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminum sure you know there are still in place for now and they're supposed to be negotiated out on the ...\nHow this interesting you mentioned the dairy rules will change this has been like a very public complained to the president he's made a number of complaints\nAbout Canadian dairy practices so you're saying that will change but I Do have to ask this is an immense trading relationship between three nations is it really changing that much\n[noise] well that's an interesting question I mean you know ... parts of it that were in place already when the U.S and Mexico came to an agreement are\nYou know are significant and the ones that really audio with auto manufacturing you know it ...\n... it increases the amount of content that has to be produced within the border of North America and and more significantly even it requires that at least forty percent of the vehicles made in within this trade zone\nHas to be made by workers earning at least sixteen dollars an hour you know this is designed to push up wages in America and hopefully to the Trump Administration move more manufacturing a back to the u._s. it's\nGot a new name though doesn't it which is not insignificant because this is a president who is all about branding so if you've got a new name then something's changed right\nWell you know that President Trump always hated NAFTA you're always call it a total disaster the worst trade agreement\nUm that the U.S has ever negotiated so yeah it's a night in states Mexico Canada agreement exactly right ... smoke right cause it's going to get them enough to smoke you use ... does it goes ... we've got to go there's was made about five\nOr so um what has to happen in order for this to be final this Congress to sign off\nThat Congress has to approve it you know um that would have been very very hard if we're just the U.S Mexico deal alone probably the odds are better if it's if it's all three countries um but we'll wait and see what happens in the midterms if the Democrats take control the house or Senate We're both they could insist on changes and make it difficult\nWell that's interesting although of course there are some Democrats who would favor change just enough to also worry thanks very much You're welcome ...\n\nMaybe you saw the video

online at Carnegie dot org\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep we've been asking the prime minister of Israel about a Palestinian state subject returned to Benjamin Netanyahu's agenda last week\nPresident Trump put it there Trump joined his predecessors favoring a separate Palestinian state on land that Israel is occupied since Nineteen sixty seven war\nI think probably two state is more likely but you know what if they do seem to if they do a double I'm okay with it if they're both happy if they're both happy I'm okay with either I think the two state is more likely\nIt is not clear how the two sides would get to a second state the Trump Administration has yet to reveal its peace plan us diplomats are pressuring Palestinians to settle for less and less\nSome Palestinians have been shifting focus Palestinian analysts ... told us the other day the Palestinians need basic civil rights\nI don't care if the state that represents them is Israel or Palestine or some other science fiction name\nThese are human beings are entitled to live a life of dignity therapy which they've fulfilled themselves as individuals and groups in every possible way that any American a rich person or Chinese person wouldn't\nWell Palestinians today I have trouble going abroad without Israeli permission and have no say about the movements of Israeli forces\nThe demand for equal rights is provocative eat implies that if the Palestinians are denied a state millions could demand voting rights in Israel\nNot surprisingly Benjamin Netanyahu sees this matter differently he wants indoors to separate Palestinian state but now favors something less so when he came on the line friday we asked him about President Trump's endorsement of a two state solution can that happen on your watch prime minister\nLook I think people mean different things when there's two states going into the liberal I'd like to talk about the substance my view of a potential agreement with the Palestinians should be able to have all the powers to govern themselves\nBut none of the power to threaten us keep our the must not be there is the question of security\nIn the tiny area was to the Jordan River up to the Mediterranean it's all about the width of about fifty sixty kilometers mhm we're both Palestinians and Israelis Lou\nIsrael must return the overriding security responsibilities otherwise we'll good what happened already in Lebanon and Gaza when we left\nAnd basically militant Islam came in under by law observing through on or under Hamas and a slum of observing them or do we do if you have a state that of most of the sovereign bars\nBut not the ... security is that if they are not if I don't know you can argue about that that aren't my position a bit of a very very clear both to the previous administration under the Trump and\nWell let's look at it from the other perspective if we can then the question of what Palestinians actually the ordinary Palestinians would get David Friedman the United states ambassador to Israel\nSaid some days ago some weeks ago and a conference call with the American Jewish Congress that there are two and a half million Palestinians he sat on the west bank and quote you either have to let them go in an independent state or\nIsrael is going to have to absorb them at some point Israel is going to have to make a decision he says now you're not willing to put the state's labeled a independent state label or give them full independence what about the other option are you ready to absorb a two and a half million Palestinians and give them full civil and voting rights equal rights in Israel\nYou know I don't want them either ... or subject but I think there is not an either or model I think we have a third model very leave which is basically all the powers of sovereignty\nToday all the bars but not the ones obscurity look in the middle east which was littered with failed states that's often the best you can do to try to do something of you know you've got to Gaza\nBut you're you're didn't work out what\nYou're talking about the situation that prime minister where you don't want them as citizens of Israel but you want Israel to still have affected security control of that area that leads the question are you willing to support that proposal that would give Palestinians equal\nRights civil rights full rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israelis citizen and what form would that take\nWell they would have those rights than their own territory in other words they have their own parliament they have their own government of their own flag on\nWell they have any of them like now but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians don't administer Ramallah origin or no blue governed by the Palestinians but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would endanger Israel\nNow this is a very odd the with the Palestinians are demanding something that would collapse their own authority in their own government but it's not the first time but they do so so I think we have to be realistic\nAs long as the you know we have the middle east on reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best we could we could have\nAnd you you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel [noise]\nUh yes I Want to have that overriding bar and I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question how come you don't see that much terrorism and that was back well first of all we up security cooperation with the Palestinian authority\nThat's good I'm going out with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by off\nBut here's how it's done we have intelligence about I'm a terrorist in a one of the Palestinian do and we would call up typically Palestine security authorities and say why don't you take care of it\n'cause I don't want to send our soldiers there if we don't have to why should we you know and often\nWe have to do because because we're willing to take the within attacked because we weren't yesterday the un by President Abbas\nSo they want us to take care of their security but also you know attack us\nFind internationally final thing prime minister because I Know your time is very ... I Hope you got the irony of what I said I understand I Do\nFinal thing you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you is there also a risk and being so closely allied with such a polarizing president because you would rather as Israel historically has have bipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael values is bipartisan support Israel live at a bipartisan support in I Believe will have a ... in the future it's a very powerful bond\nThere there's no risk with being so close to Trump\nWell I think that ah you know you feel that we could have agreements and disagreements with ministers were ...\nYou know it's no secret I disagree with President Obama on Iran but at the same time\nWe've signed an animal you are in the animal you are the memorandum of understanding going through those are all a very important American security assistance for the coming decade and I appreciate the uh so we can have disagreements and you'd have a basic agreement about the importance of our lives\nBy minister and that was always a pleasure talking with you thank you very much back too good to talk to Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu we also went by the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas to join us in that invitation\nRemains open It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nAt science forty two good morning an update now from ...

I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep we've been asking the prime minister of Israel about a Palestinian state subject returned to Benjamin Netanyahu's agenda last week\nPresident Trump put it there Trump joined his predecessors favoring a separate Palestinian state on land that Israel is occupied since Nineteen sixty seven more\nI think probably two state is more likely but you know what if they do it seems as if they do a double I'm okay with it if they're both happy if they're not happy I'm okay with either I think the two state is more likely\nIt is not clear how the two sides would get to a second state the Trump Administration has yet to reveal its peace plan us diplomats are pressuring Palestinians to settle for less and less\nSome Palestinians have been shifting focus Palestinian analysts ... told us the other day the Palestinians need basic civil rights\nI don't care to state that represents them as Israel or Palestine or has some other science fiction name\nThese are human beings are entitled to live a life of dignity therapy in which they fulfill themselves as individuals and groups in every possible way that any American a rich person or Chinese person would wild\nPalestinians today I have trouble going abroad without Israeli permission and have no say about the movements of Israeli forces\nThe demand for equal rights is provocative eat implies that is Palestinians are denied estate millions could demand voting rights in Israel\nNot surprisingly Benjamin Netanyahu sees this matter differently he wants indoors to separate Palestinian state but now favors something less so when he came on the line friday we asked him about President Trump's endorsement of a two state solution can that happen on your watch prime minister\nLook I think people mean different things when they say two states rather than get into the label I'd like to talk about the substance my view of a potential agreement is with the Palestinians should be able to have all the powers to govern themselves but none of the power to threaten us\nTo keep power that must not be\nIn their hands is the question of security in the tiny area west of the Jordan River up to the Mediterranean it's all about the width of about fifty sixty kilometers mhm\nWe're both Palestinians and Israelis live Israel must return the overriding security responsibility otherwise we'll get what happened already in Lebanon and Gaza when we left\nAnd basically militant Islam came in under whose by law observing to Iran or under Hamas and Islamic jihad and Gaza observing them or do we do if you have a state that has a most of the sovereign bars with the state\nBut not the ... security is that if they are not a state I don't know you can argue about that that are my position I bet it very very clear both to the previous administration enter the dropping them as\nWell let's look at it from the other perspective if we can then the question of what Palestinians actually the ordinary Palestinians would get David Friedman the United states ambassador to Israel\nSaid some days ago some weeks ago when a conference call with the American Jewish Congress that they're two and a half million Palestinians he sat on the west bank and quote you either have to let them go in and independent states or Israel is going to have to absorb them at some point Israel is going to have to make a decision he says\nNow you're not willing to put the state's label the independent state label or give them full independence what about the other option are you ready to absorb a two and a half million Palestinians and give them fold civil and voting rights equal rights in Israel\nNo I don't want them either as citizens of Israel or subject for Israel but I think there is it's not an either or model I think we have a third model at the very least which is uh basically all the powers of sovereignty or nearly all the bars but not the ones obscurity look in the middle east which was littered with failed states\nThat's often the best you can do to try to do something else you know you get a Gaza\nBut you didn't work out what you're talking about the situation that prime minister where you don't want them as citizens of Israel but you want Israel to still have affected security control of that area that leads to question are you willing to support that proposal that would give\nPalestinians equal rights civil rights full rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israelis citizen and what form would that tank\nWell they would have those rights and their own territory in other words they have their own parliament they have their own government outgoing flak they have their own\nWell they have any of them now but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians don't administer Ramallah origin and or not loose governed by the Palestinians\nBut you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would endanger is\nNot this is a very odd or with the Palestinians are actually demanding something that would collapse their own authority and their own government but it's
