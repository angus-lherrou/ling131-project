Rob Schmitz has been following this story he's with us now Hi Rob\nGood morning All right so what do we know about ... among\nHallway is sixty four years old he served as the vice minister of public security bureau which is China's national police are in twenty sixteen he\nBecame the first Chinese head of Interpol and there's an election was a big victory for China's government which under leader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate an extra day Chinese officials at it deemed corrupt to it a scape China\nAs it turns out among himself is under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption\nWhat exactly are they investigating him for\nWhich has government hasn't released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how is the tension unfolded\nHas come from his wife grace among on September twenty fifth the day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mood to even nice suggesting that she was in danger\nA week later she reported him missing to French police on Sunday she spoke to reporters and we own

Paul reminds her that she has the music inside of her\nThey start saying and they find the voice within that uh pacify them and makes the storms seem a little less frightening\nAnd you know catch when I thought about that are basically\nTelling the story of the blues this music where you'd have people with nothing or are close to nothing looking to music within themselves when times are their toughest\nWell I I Know for me that in my darkest hour there's always been a song that has helped me to transcend\nAnd certainly the story of country music and the story of the blues which I really want in the same the story of hardworking and oftentimes impoverished people looking for that boat across dark waters\nYou chose to make your characters African American and the illustrations in this book where and why was that decision\nMade when I first heard this story I heard it from a woman of Cherokee to sent a woman named Lorraine she had a pet crow and she was a kid on her dad's form and this crow used to steal everything and bury it all around the farm and\nThey'd find a little bits of string or or um cellophane or tinfoil so in my mind Lorraine was a hillbilly girl of Cherokee descent\nNow it took a long time to get this book finished um but really the big part of the time was getting it published and uh and then finding an illustrator and it wasn't until maybe four years passed before the publisher said sorry catch we can't really find the right illustrator would you like to search\nAnd I found on the listing of a local art college Higgins bond here in Nashville Higgins is a really important children's illustrator in the Nineteen seventies and eighties and then stops working for a long time\nHiggins is the reason that Lorraine is African American because Higgins is African American in fact she's the first African American woman to design a U.S postage stamp\nI was talking to the actress Viola Davis recently about a children's book that she's done she was saying two things one is there is an incredible need for characters of color in children's books it's been a void that's existed for very long time\nShe also says she loves when you have say characters of color but there doesn't have to be some explanation or reason for it what do you think of that is that something we're seeing in your book\nYes and the thing that was missing and really waited until I discovered Higgins bond is that I I really wanted Lorraine to be an African American girl you know I I Do a lot of volunteer work around communities of color and in one of the places where I'm often reading literacy and and mentorship program for kids\nI'll read any number of book ... with this book I have the opportunity to now read a story in which the characters looked like the

crops and wildlife but many farmers in Arkansas are defying the ban and the states having trouble enforcing it NPR's Dan Charles has the story\nThis year's confrontation actually started with a farming fiasco last year the company Monsanto which is now owned by mayor rolled out a new way to kill weeds it told farmers we've created some special new varieties of soybeans and caught and they can tolerate a weed killer called dicamba\nSo you can spray dot camera and the crops will be fine but you're weeds will die Terry Wohlers a member of the Arkansas state plant or kind of the pesticide police honestly I don't think anybody\nIn the whole world dreamed that ... could create such an issue brings so many farmers against farmers\nThat gamut in stay where it belonged it drifted across the landscape and injured millions of acres of regular crops it was especially bad in Arkansas farmers who sprayed dicamba loved it but Terry fuller and the state plant board decided the collateral damage was unacceptable I talk to them about it last year\nTrespassing known your neighbor and your friend that's not my definition of good for business\nSo the plant for us the most dramatic limits on campus and the whole country no die campus spring during the growing season the summer I called Terry fuller backs the hosts going and he told me it was happening again thousands of acres of crops damaged also trees in people's yards this was not supposed to happen this year\nNot supposed to happen this year ... just been a sad situation and all you know really an unbelievable situation ...\nAnd boards investigators tried to catch the outlaw farmers inspectors drove country roads looking for dying weeds that looked like they'd been sprayed with Ken Buck took samples tested them\nIn at least a couple of dozen cases they found the band chemical those farmers now could face fines at least a thousand dollars possibly twenty five thousand dollars per violation\nI talked to a couple of those farmers and some of their supporters\nThey did not want me to record those interviews or use their names they told me spraying dicamba was a business decision some of them think Monsanto's dot camera tolerant seeds will give them a bigger harvest one said spraying dicamba is the only way to survive\nA couple of them said paying the fine is cheaper than fighting weeds any other way and by defying the band they're putting enormous pressure on the farmers who are farming by the rules\nLike taboo now personally I don't believe is Brian dot camera I think it's too dangerous to spray I mean anybody that says otherwise is dreaming\nSo he didn't plant those new dot camera tolerant crops he got rid of weeds with other chemicals\nI use not one drop ... says it can't be done it's a

I I guess also they said anything about how they might prevent this from happening in them\nSo that they're they took it pretty drastic step which is they not use that earlier they ... they announced they're closing the consumer side of Google Plus which is pretty big stuff there also taking um a number of steps to kind of rain in ah some data privacy\nPotential problems or they make a lot of data available to outside developers on an Android phones um for things like Gmail there are there are a lot of different apps that can you can use to to and those developers can also get your data so they're taking some steps to shut down some of those channels\nIn the short term that could actually hurt some of their relationship to developers but they're saying that in the long term maybe this could prevent\nA situation like this from happening again based\nOn your reporting should people feel safe using Google for care about privacy\nI think that there are some real questions that users have to ask themselves about trust 'em it in this situation there was a pretty serious decision being made about how to handle a situation involving sensitive personal data\nAnd there was no transparency into that decision the you know these people in in a room in Mountain View decided how to handle a sensitive issue around user data so can users can Google Keep the trust of its users

work with Alison green who writes the popular ask a manager blog where you can write to her or to us with your thorny workplace or management issues things for weighing\nIn here Alison Hi David thanks for having me we talked to some people before the last presidential election who had lost clients because\nPolitics came up and they did not see eye to eye and people fired them it's still going on we're very polarized America give us some advice here I mean what do you do if politics comes up at the office and you're the person who don't want to talk about it\nYeah it really is okay to set boundaries if you don't want to talk politics at work you can be directed at that you can say you know we look at these issues pretty differently and I'd rather keep politics out of our work relationship and other people may actually be relieved that someone is setting that boundary\nBut the presumption or your answer is that it can be acceptable to talk politics in some offices in certain situations\nIf everyone involved is consenting to the conversation that's fine I Would say you want to be aware of trapped bystanders who might not appreciate the conversation as well that's a good way to drive your coworkers mad or just make it hard for them to concentrate so you've got to be respectful of that that\nIt also at some levels of diversity issue because if you have a model culture you hire only people who agree\nWith the boss politically that's going to cut out\nSome talent I think that's a problem that I hear that from ... new is that they're working in an office where their political views are very different from most people around them that people are assuming that they agree and they're drawing them into conversations sort of [laughter] making them feel complicit envy points that they find pretty harmful or offensive\nLard these days to pull this off in recent days the Supreme Court nomination hearings I've been going on and even if someone is\nResolved I'm not going to talk about this at work regardless of what side of that particular issue one is you can imagine someone looking at the TV and saying oh you know one way or another and it's a little hard to suppress all of one's reactions\nI think it can be useful to to think about it from the other side of your co worker we're talking about a candidate all the time who you've found frankly harmful or had a big sign in their office promoting them it may impact the way that you thought of that person may impact the relationship in subtle ways\nAnd there's no reason that you need to inject that into

Anthony Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia much are some of the names that quickly roll off a ton of any historian or third grade students\nBut another woman who made significant contributions to the cause is a name you may have never heard gene Brooks Greenleaf on Monday members of the grease Historical Society do their part to change that\nJoyful until a crow got involved\nWhere this mischievous grow he likes to visit the farm and suddenly they notice things go missing mhm namely their musical instruments right so the the crow pinchers them\nAnd so they're they are with no instruments when a big storm suddenly rolls through the rain gets really scared until ... Paul reminds her but she has the music\nInside of her they start saying and they find the voice within that uh pacify them and makes the storms seem a little less frightening\nAnd you know catch when I thought about that\nBasically telling the story of the blues this music where you'd have people with nothing or are close to nothing looking to music within themselves when times are their toughest\nWell I I Know for me that in my darkest hour there's always been a song that has helped me to transcend and certainly the story of country music and the story of the blues which I really want in the same the story of hardworking and oftentimes impoverished people\nLooking for that boat across dark waters\nYou chose to make your characters African American and the illustrations in this book where and why was that decision\nMade when I first heard this story I heard it from a woman of Cherokee dissent a woman named Lorraine she had a pet crow when she was a kid on her dad's form and this crow used to steal everything and bury it all around the farm and they'd find a\nLittle bits of string or or um cellophane or tinfoil so in my mind Lorraine was a hillbilly girl of Cherokee descent\nNow it took a long time to get this book finished um but really the big part of the time was getting it published and ah and then finding an illustrator\nAnd it wasn't until maybe four years passed before the publisher said sorry catch we can't really find the right illustrator would you like to search\nAnd I found on the listing of a local art college Higgins bond here in Nashville Higgins is a really important children's illustrator in the Nineteen seventies and eighties and then stops working for a long time\nHiggins is the reason that Lorraine is African American because Higgins is African American in fact she's the first African American woman to design a U.S postage stamp\nI was talking to the actress Viola Davis recently about a children's book that she's done she was saying two things one is there is an incredible need for characters of color in children's books it's been a void that's existed for very long time\nShows us that she loves when you have say characters of color but there doesn't have to be some explanation or reason for it what do you think of that is that's something we're seeing in your book\nYes and the thing that was missing and really waited until I discovered Higgins bond is that I I really wanted Lorraine to be an African American girl you know what I Do a lot of volunteer work around communities of color and in one of the places where I'm often reading literacy and and mentorship program for kids\nI'll read any number of books ... with this book I have the opportunity to now read a story in which the characters looked like the audience\nI'm interested in your volunteering and and I know you also helped found a private school in Nashville right I mean it it sounds like your commitment to education as part of where this comes what came from\nYeah they all sort of come around the same forces to draw up for me this passion about education as a kid I Lived in all these different towns five pounds by the fifth grade my parents were educators\nSo it turned out that I had it in me to start a school and then these kind of volunteer gigs really helped me to say oh I'm I think I could see a school in the parking lot by the shores of this rushing interstate with the two expressway spurs and the the shoney's in the wake shop\nThat parking lot's got to school growing in it we just need to plant the seeds\nIs that where you put the school is it by wakes up in his ... yeah that's what I thought what better place to put the newest Episcopal school in the nation [laughter]\nI'd love it was this a different experience reading a book compared to reading some\nI think writing songs and writing a children's book are really kind of one in the same you want to get a tagline or a refrain you want to have language that's easy to remember there was a sing song quality to this book it's in ...\nIt makes me want to ask you and I don't know if you'd be comfortable or not but if would you sing a page of the book like even the ending if if that's something I don't know if you've you've thought about putting it to music\nI'd love to go ahead and let's see what should our melody be I'm going to leave it up

has no information the personal data was misused but it's only disclosing the vulnerability now Wall Street journal reporter Douglas McMillan wrote about the breach he told NPR's MORNING EDITION there is no clear law that Google broke by withholding the news\nThere is a a patchwork of laws there's there Patrick state laws and there's a there's a new European\nLaw that address is is the problem is the laws hinge on whether or not the company knew that data was improperly access in this case Google has pleading ignorance they're saying we don't know we have no evidence the data was access so we therefore have no obligation\nHe also says Google was worried about damage to its reputation and about government scrutiny Brett Kavanaugh takes the bench today for his first arguments since the Senate voted narrowly to confirm him to the Supreme Court Saturday NPR's Carrie Johnson reports the new justice spent the weekend working\n... well let's talk about President Trump for a moment

President Trump seems to be taking a tone when he's out there campaigning about this\nYeah well a cabin is going to be on the spring is on the Supreme Court at President Trump is trying to win a mid term and are trying to keep his party in power and what they discovered is that Republican voters were fired up by the fight\nAnd you know the emotion of happiness and contentment is not as strong as the emotion of anger and frustration and and resentment and President Trump and Republicans want to keep that feeling going keep their voters upset and angry because they believe that will get them out to the polls and get them voting Republican\nI mean you know as well as I Do we're living in a world where you never know when a what seems like a big stories of them are going to go away and there's going to be the next big story but\nAny sense of of whether this Kevin a fight is going to remain a kind of in the talking points and agendas of both parties in in this one month that we have left or or the other issues that are gonna be coming up the voters gonna really can be thinking about\nWell there are absolutely other issues up in the end\nIt's hard to say whether issues will will decide this or whether it will really just be a battle of enthusiasm and and and the fight over President Trump and and Trump ism but one thing that keeps coming up that hasn't gotten a ton of attention is health care\nAnd and that is an issue where you have a Republicans are coming in and saying well we don't want to take away a pre existing conditions there affirmatively going out there and doing ads about pre existing conditions because democratic candidates have made it such an issue and it's it's resonating with voters\nAnd purist hammer Keith Tam thanks a lot You're welcome [noise]\n[noise] state regulators in Arkansas have banned the use of a weed killer that's popular not just there but across the country this chemical often hurts other crops and wildlife but many farmers in Arkansas are defying the ban and the states having trouble enforcing it NPR's Dan Charles has the story\nThis year's confrontation actually started with a farming fiasco last year the company Monsanto which is now owned by Bayer rolled out a new way to kill reads it told farmers we've created some special new varieties of soybeans and cotton they can tolerate a weed killer called dicamba\nSo you can spray dot camera and the crops will be fine but you're weeds will die Terry Wohlers a member of the Arkansas state plant or kind of the pesticide police\nHonestly I don't think anybody in the whole world dreamed that ... could create such a nice you bring so many farmers against farmers\nThat gamut in stay where it belonged it drifted across the landscape and injured millions of acres of regular crops it was especially bad in Arkansas farmers who sprayed dicamba loved it but Terry fuller and the state plant board decided the collateral damage was unacceptable I talk to them about it last year\nTrespassing known your neighbor and your friend that's not my definition of good for business\nSo the plant board passed the most dramatic limits on campus and the whole country no die campus spring during the growing season the summer I called Terry fuller back see how it was going and he told me it was happening again thousands of acres of crops damaged also trees in people's yards this was not supposed to happen this year\nNot supposed to happen this year scripts ... just been strange situation and um you know really an unbelievable situation\nThe plant boards investigators try to catch the outlaw farmers inspectors drove country roads looking for dying weeds that looked like they'd been sprayed with Ken Buck took samples tested them\nIn at least a couple of dozen cases they found the band chemical those farmers now could face fines at least a thousand dollars possibly twenty five thousand dollars per violation I talked to a couple of those farmers and some of their supporters\nThey did not want me to record those interviews or use their names they told me spraying dicamba was a business decision some of them think Monsanto's dot camera tolerant seeds will give them a bigger harvest one said spraying dicamba is the only way to survive a couple of them said paying the fine is cheaper than fighting weeds any other way\nAnd by defying the band they're putting enormous pressure on the farmers who are farming by the rules like taboo now\nPersonally I don't believe his brain dot camera I think it's too dangerous to spray I mean anybody that says otherwise is dreaming\nSo he didn't plant those new dot camera tolerant crops you got rid of weeds with other chemicals\nI use not one drop of ... says it can't be done it's a myth\nAnd then he solved the leaves of his soybean plants curling up that can bud blown in from some other farmers field\nDo I go out and try to which people and find out I'm not doing that but I have the legal right as a farmer to keep a crop that is not damaged by somebody else's sprayed\nThe legal right may not be enough though if other farmers insist on spraying dicamba he may have to also plant those new dot camera tolerant soybeans because they won't\nGet injured and then he'd be tempted to spray dicamba to\nDan Charles NPR News [noise]\n\nThis is NPR News support for your public

Noel King in Washington DC\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California Good morning Google is shutting down its consumer version of Google Plus it's social network but some sauces and sort of Facebook\nThis comes after a flaw was discovered that might have exposed personal information of hundreds of thousands of customers according to the wall Street Journal that flow was discovered in March but the company\nDecided not to disclose it with us in our studio in Washington DC is one of the reporters who broke the story Doug McMillan thanks for being here hiker morning so can you start by telling us about this flood of you and your colleagues at the wall Street Journal discovered I mean what what information could have\nGotten out here yes over a two year two to three year period from twenty Fifteen until earlier this year or people who entered their profile information into Google Plus um information like their gender birth date\n... ... email address all that data could have been available to outside developers if basically if your friend had signed up\nTo some Google Plus at those developers potentially could have gotten access to this data\nThe number to potentially affected number is of user is small it's only about half a million users which in the world is kind of potential data breaches that is not a member of the real questions that are reporting focus on our kind of what Google did\nWhen did find out this this this uh you know the security patches flawed existed or didn't\nDo right I mean they didn't go public and let people know that that their privacy might have been at risk why\nYeah so there's sort of the story that they're telling which is they took a look at what happened they investigated these apps to some extent they found that there was no suspicious activity and they decided that there is no evidence of a misuse of data so they had no obligation to tell you users\nBut our reporting shows that there was another factor at play which was they were worried about the repercussions of coming\nForward with this information or you know earlier this year right right of the time they discovered this the Facebook Cambridge Analytica data breach in just happened um there's a lot of regulator scrutiny\nFacebook in tech companies and how they're handling data\nAnd internally they were worried about being pulled into this conversation in a bigger way\n... what have they responded to your reporting and I I guess also they said anything about how they might prevent this from happening in them\nSo that they're they took it pretty drastic step which is they now you said earlier they ... they announced they're closing the consumer side of Google Plus which is pretty big stuff there also taking um a number of steps to kind of rain in a some data privacy potential problems or they make a lot of data available to outside developers on an Android phones\nFor things like Gmail there are there are a lot of different apps that can you can use to to and those developers can also get your data so they're taking some steps to shut down some of those channels in the short term that could actually hurt some of their relationship to developers but they're saying that in the long term maybe this could prevent a situation like this from happening again\nBased on your reporting should people feel safe using Google that care about privacy\nI think that there are some real questions that users have to ask themselves about trust\nOn it and the situation there was a pretty serious decision being made about how to handle a situation involving sensitive personal data and there was no transparency into that decision the you know these people in in a room in Mountain View decided\nHow to handle a sensitive issue around user data so can users you can Google Keep the trust of its users\nGoing forward I think that they're going to have a lot of work to do to to get that trust back\nDoesn't villain covers Google for the wall Street Journal who joined colleagues and writing a story he was working with fellow reporter Robert McMillan thanks much for joining us when it's very much for having me\nIn Alaska a

iconic fish walking along the creek would says he thinks it's a long overdue change\nFish scale is fence tip too far in favor of of development and industry and and we're just trying to pull it back towards the center\nAlaska as some of the most valuable salmon fisheries left in the world but wouldn't other ballot supporters say the state's laws protecting salmon are weak putting them at risk especially with a number of large new mines in oil developments in the works if it passes Alaska would enact a much tougher permitting process for big projects in salmon habitat\nAmong other things it would set strict standards for restoring salmon stream if they're disturbed and the companies don't follow the rules they could face criminal penalties\nWould acknowledge is that in states like Alaska it's a big ask\nWhen you start doing something like this is really kind of some in your nose at the big guys you know\nFor decades Alaska's economy has depended on industry dollars and oil and mining companies hate this initiative banded together under the name stand for Alaska they're backing a campaign to stop it running a blitz of that like this lawyer\nIt clean to protect fish habitat place

Mobil they'd know raised more money than all three of Alaska's gubernatorial candidates combined turn Matthias is with the council of Alaska producers the group that represents mining companies and she argues the state's salmon fisheries had so far ... existed with minds that oil developments just fine\nCompletely changing the way we regulate fish habitat at a time when we don't have a clear problem just seems crazy\nThe funniest things the initiative prioritizes standing at the expense of the state's biggest economic engines and taxpayers\nWe couldn't have the Alaska government that we have if it was only dependent on fisheries it just wouldn't be possible\nBut for many Alaskans salmon are more than just a living or the occasional meal here they represent something deeper their
