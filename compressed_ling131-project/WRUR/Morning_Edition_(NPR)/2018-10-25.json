to court foreign investment in his country\nYeah that's right there is a major conference going on in Riyadh right now it's called the future investment initiative\nAnd it's part of this attempt by Saudi Arabia to position itself as a modern open place for new investment under this young energetic crown prince let a lot of high profile business in finance leaders pulled out after ... death\nI've been to the economics editor of the British newspaper the independent news at that conference in Riyadh and joins us on the line now either been\nHello David will talk to me about how the crown prince is handling this moment obviously wanting to position is country as as an open modern place\nBut with these allegations that it should be complicated ... what is he saying\nWhat it was a day of high drama anticipation yesterday because these were the first comments by the crown prince since the murder of a hassle Jay earlier this month\nAnd then I guess we should say we should say killing is is the way many are describing it but I'm okay with murders and yeah\nSo these were the first comments on the incident since um since it came to light\nAnd the whole here in ... at the convention center was absolutely packed not a new report says but we have\nUm Saudi officials and business leaders or waiting for him walk the crown prince who's the de facto ruder of Saudi Arabia was going to say on the subject to while to get into it and eventually when he did he condemned as you would expect to the heinous crime he said that there would be\nA old that those responsible would be brought to justice and I think very interestingly he said that there are those who are trying to drive a wedge between turkey and Saudi Arabia over the issue of course because\nI thought she was killed in the at the embassy in Istanbul and he struck a very defiant saying that those who were trying to drive to sweat will not succeed not while I Am crown prince while my father is king\nWhile president education is president of turkey and I think the context of this is that there are those who feel to his position in Saudi Arabia as the de facto ruler is under threat I think this was a message sent to those people saying that now I'm here to stay\nWell well I mean it it sounds like it was um a crowd that was receiving what he said well but we should say a lot of people who are expected to be there were not there I mean there were high ... profile speakers officials who pulled out of this conference because these allegations is that absence being filled\nThe absence is being felt in terms of some of

also have spoken to some of them and they all sticking to the original vision they think that\nThis is a passing storm and a old I was a mistake and the uh the the ... just as the confidence that must be brought to justice than not losing faith in the original vision that he laid out two years ago\nIs this event really important to Saudi Arabia this investment conference\nI think it's hugely important it's a central positive in Solomon's vision that he wants to get foreign investment into Saudi you'll see for next season to Saudi is go to five hundred billion dollar project to build a

President Trump's political career is in part defined by his willingness to openly mocked people he disagrees with now Trump is calling for civility after at least seven apparent pipe bombs were male to his political opponents\nYeah that's right at a rally in Wisconsin last night Trump condemned the act and then he turned his attention to the press\nThe media also has a responsibility to shed a civil town as you stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do [noise]\nSo far authorities haven't released any information about a possible suspect\nOr we're joined by White House correspondent Tamara Keith and NPR's national security correspondent Ryan Lucas to talk through all of this morning to you both learned more than I run I Want to start with you it seems like there were at least seven of these devices mailed out um who are these suspicious packages meant for well the first was\nPhone Monday outside of New York home of the billionaire investor George Soros who of course there's also a big contributor to democratic causes a the others were then discovered address to Hillary Clinton a former president ... bomber\nObama's former attorney general Eric Holder and his former CIA director John Brennan now the package that was intended for Brennan was actually sent it to see in an office in New York and discovered in the mail room there yesterday\nAnd then late last night the FBI said that it had confirmed to more suspicious packages that were very similar in appearance of the other five\nOf these two were addressed to Maxine Waters she's a California Democrat in the house who has been a very short critic of a President Trump so officials\nAre already talking about these things as pipe bombs are using that term what what exactly are those and and who would have wanted to send pipe bombs to to these people\nWill in terms of who would have wanted to send them we don't we don't know at this point uh there is no word on a possible suspect uh this is still very early in the investigation now as for the the the packages themselves um we\nKnow that they were sent in identical bubble wrapped manila envelopes uh they were the address is on them were all computer printed\nOn the return address on every single package was that a democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida are each package had six us a postal service stamps\nThe one that was actually address to a former attorney general holder didn't make it to his office it was a return to sender the FBI says so in that case to the address of Wasserman Schultz she of course did not send these packages\nShe has said that she's a very troubled by the way that her name has been using all of this and it actually her own office in Florida was evacuated yesterday or because of a suspicious package there\nTen let's turn this over to you for a minute I mean this is a pretty unusual moment in the country's recent history how is the president and reacting the president has\nBeen reacting in the way that you would expect the president to react he has a condemned or any acts or threats of political violence saying that it's an attack on our democracy itself\nI'm ... and in his rally speech last night\nAnd he also said quote we want all sides to come together in peace and harmony he he's talking about wanting to turn down the temperature on some of the political rhetoric maybe not at attacking one political enemies in moral terms now the reality is that he has done just that\nAttacking his political enemies in moral terms but he didn't do it last night\nAnd it's interesting because the president's mood at these rallies is usually pretty upbeat pretty combative I'm it sounds like he was in a different kind of mood yesterday yeah so this rally was at and\nAirport ... aircraft hangar in that in Wisconsin um and there was a big crowd of people and it had all the trappings of a usual Trump rally\nAccept that then the president simply red from the teleprompter and uh he he does is it ... it was almost like he went to a rally and he delivered a speech that you'd see in the East Room of the White House um and he was um he was self conscious about that sort of\nCalling it out to his supporters they're saying hey look I mean here's a clip by the way\nYou see how nice of like [noise] very well [noise] and we can keep it that way right\nHow long he keeps it that way is not clear ah off and he will become teleprompter Trump for a while and then he will switch back to rally Trump\nAnd and you just don't know when it's going to happen in the same anything directly about the people who were targeted have any of them said anything yeah that's right he didn't say any of the names of the people who've been targeted often they're features of his rallies is a Hillary Clinton was speaking yesterday at\nAn event and she said that she is fine thanks to the secret service she called it a troubling time

about the cost of climate change to the company's bottom line New York's attorney general Barbara Underwood is suing the company for defrauding shareholders and NPR's Wade Goodwyn has the story\nThe lawsuit doesn't hold Exxon Mobil liable for helping to create climate change it accuses the energy giant of misleading the investing public about how global warming was affecting the value of the company's fossil fuel assets around the world\nWhat the attorney general is essentially saying as you kept two sets of books\nTom ... the director of finance for the Institute for energy economics and financial analysis and former New York state comptroller ... says the allegations are about Exxon refusing to write down the value of its fossil fuel assets that are still in the ground\nTwo sets of books one internally that they were um keeping so that they understood what reality was and another more nuanced reality if you will for the investment public\nThe allegation really is that the company is not as big as it says it is and it's not worth as much as it says it is\nExxon declined to comment to NPR but released a statement that said in part\nThese baseless allegations or a product of closed door lobbying by special interests political opportunism and the attorney general's inability to admit that a three year investigation has uncovered no wrongdoing\nExxon Mobil is moved to for the investigation by attorneys general and three states\nAlleging it's a conspiracy involving the Rockefeller Foundation ... lawyers environmentalist and democratic ... g's Michael burgers or professor at Columbia Law school who specializes in climate change law\nBurger doubts axons conspiracy theories are going to hold up in court\nThis is about climate change it's about the risks that

essentially have to go back to square one I mean how much had you already started to think about the upcoming season or even I think I read you'd started shooting at right Melissa put you on spot\nWe had started shooting it and we we'd throw at it through um really by just about the whole thing [noise]\nBut all of the DNA was was there at you know she's in five ended with a rabbit character Claire turning to the camera and saying my turn so that was the what we continue to serve and explore and I will say just because\nThe character Francis Underwood is not on the screen doesn't mean whose absence is not on the screen and that doesn't mean that is not still being dealt with and in his options became a dramatic opportunity to see who would try to fill that space\nRight we needed to deny the existence of Francis Underwood would be dishonest you know to the history of the show um there's no way that Claritin and dialogue with her past with him as she's forging a future for herself and she may\nBe comfortable in this position but\nOthers around her or not and there's this scene early on when ... character this D.C power broker he has could Joel old Clare president Underwood into signing the bill and when she finally agrees he\nPhysically grabs her hand and covers it with his as she signs it and I found this so disturbing to watch\nMaybe because of everything else it's around the show but like this idea that he feels he could manipulate her what was that seemed like for your wallet there's a lot of discussion around that remember\nWhen her husband which she asked for\nA man\nAnd the decision behind saying yes to let him do that ... was because in politics and what so much of the backbone of the show is about is you always have to sacrifice something to get what you want\nI mean we always knew that we wanted this season to be an exploration of who owns the White House so no matter what and this was a physical menace benefit station of a of a scene we were working on\nAnd you know Melissa ... is this country [laughter] you know within the world of the show ready for a female president huh [noise]\nUm if I could ask you Robin just about your relationship with

and that's what I said and in that instance then you should be given a second chance in life\nIf they're true change that occurs so I wasn't pinpointing any specific human being I was talking about

Riyadh at the convention since I was absolutely parks Miller new report says but we've\nUm Saudi officials and business leaders who writes in the ... the crown prince who is that they felt to ruin her of Saudi Arabia was going to say on the subject to talk for a while to get into it and eventually when he did he condemned as you would expect as a heinous crime\nUm there would be a old that those responsible would be brought to justice and I think very interestingly\nHe said that there are those who are trying to drive a wedge between turkey and Saudi Arabia and the issue of course because I thought she was killed in the embassy in Istanbul and he struck a very defiant they're saying that those who were trying to drive to sweat will not succeed not well I Am ... my father was king while

that his most important legacy will be the judges he appoints not just to the Supreme Court but to the lower court says well\nLower court nominations don't get a lot of public attention they usually fly below the radar but they've long been governed by an elaborate series of Senate rules and traditions that are aimed at ensuring that presidents don't have carte blanche to pick nominees\nNow those traditions are being tossed aside at a rapid rate NPR's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has the story\nPrior to the Trump Administration there was plenty of tit for tat and the escalating partisan war is over judicial nominations\nBut the tactics were aimed at blocking nominees since President Trump was sworn in however the GOP Senate leadership has moved aggressively to speed confirmation of new judges in the process ignoring our tossing aside rules that have long existed to ensure that there is some consensus in picking judges\nGone for all practical purposes is the rule that preventive action on a judicial nominee who was not approved by his or her home state senator\nGone is the practice of not holding a confirmation hearing until the American bar association has completed its professional evaluation of the nominee\nGone is the general practice of not piling up nominees in one hearing and now for the first time the Judiciary Committee is holding confirmation hearings during a Senate recess over the objections of the minority party\nNo other Senate committee has been holding hearings during the recess but for judicial nominees the Senate confirmation train keeps on running even though and likely because Senate Democrats are defending a near record number of seats in the election and have to be out on the house thinks\nIndeed just two Republican senators Orrin Hatch of Utah who's retiring and my ... of Idaho showed up at yesterday's hearing for two appeals court nominees\nHearing that lasted just Nineteen Minutes and featured one controversial nominees talking for several minutes about his wife parents children even his cat\nI asked Senator Hatch who never agreed to such a recess hearing when he chaired the Judiciary Committee why Republicans went ahead this time\nWell I don't know a lot of conservatives that the you know we have to move ahead and if they're not cooperate and you just go ahead ... and so far we haven't had a lot of cooperation\nGoing ahead has yielded important results for Republicans over the last year and a half\nThe GOP controlled Senate has confirmed twenty nine Trump nominees to federal appeals court compared to confirmation of just two nominees in the last two years of the Obama presidency in all Trump has managed to win confirmation for an astonishing one sixth of the sitting\nActive federal

suspicious package this morning it was sent to the home of the actor Robert De Niro in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood\nThis comes after seven apparent pipe bombs were sent to top Democrats political opponents of President Trump now we should say the president's political careers in part defined by his willingness to openly mocked people he disagrees with Trump right now is calling for civility\nThat's right at a rally last night in Wisconsin Trump condemned this act and so far authorities haven't released any information about a possible suspect\nAre let's turn now to NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith and NPR's justice reporter Ryan Lucas to talk through all of this morning to you both learned more than I run I Want to start with you it seems like there were at least seven of these devices mailed out um who are these suspicious packages meant for\nWell the first was found Monday outside the New York home of the billionaire investor George Soros who of course there's also a big contributor to democratic causes a the others were then discovered address to Hillary Clinton a former president ... bomber\nObama's former attorney general Eric Holder and his former CIA director John Brennan now the package that was intended for Britain was actually sent it to see in an office in New York and discovered in the mail room there yesterday\nAnd then late last night the FBI said that it had confirmed to more suspicious packages that were very similar in appearance of the other five\nOf these two were addressed to Maxine Waters she's a California Democrat in the house who has been a very short critic of a President Trump so officials are\nAlready talking about these things as pipe bomb they're using that term what what exactly are those and and who would have wanted to send pipe bombs to to these people\nWill in terms of who would have wanted to send them we don't we don't know at this point uh there's no word on a possible suspect\nUh this is still very early in the investigation now as for the the the packages themselves um we know that they were sent in identical bubble raft manila envelopes uh they were the address is on them were all computer printed\nOn the return address on every single package was that a democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida are each package had six us a postal service stamps\nThe one that was actually address to a former attorney general holder didn't make it to his office it was a return to sender the FBI says so in that case to the address of Wasserman Schultz she of course did not send these packages she has said that she's a very troubled by the way that her name has been using all of this\nAnd it actually her own office in Florida was evacuated yesterday or because of a suspicious package there\nTam let's turn this over to you for a minute I mean this is a pretty unusual moment in the country's recent history how was the president been reacting the president has\nBeen reacting in the way that you would expect a president to react he has a condemned or any acts or threats of political violence saying that it's an attack on our democracy itself\nI'm ... and in his rally speech last night um he also said quote we want all sides to come together in peace and harmony he he's talking about wanting to\nTurn down the temperature on some of the political rhetoric maybe not at attacking one political enemies in moral terms now the reality is that he has done just that attacking his political enemies in moral terms but he didn't do it last night\nIt's interesting because the president's mood at these rallies is usually pretty upbeat pretty combative [noise] um but it sounds like he was in a different kind of mood yesterday yeah so\nThis rally was
