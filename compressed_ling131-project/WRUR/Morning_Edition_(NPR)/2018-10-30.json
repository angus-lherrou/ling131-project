Pittsburgh synagogue President Trump held a campaign rally\nWe cared less evil change our lives and change our schedule he\nIs changing his scheduled to be in Pittsburgh today but not everyone wants to embarrass I'm Ari Shapiro reaction to the president's trip\nExactly as you said there's been some analysis that looks really the first mentions of this and and the various ah you know it's just sort of fake news essentially use to promote as you know people will take a picture of someone with boils and then they'll say oh you know this is someone in the Caribbean is completely unrelated but it kind of ramps up the hype about it\nAnd you end up with someone on Fox News which I Believe happened yesterday saying gosh these people might be bringing any number of diseases they had letters or what have you with us and the president the United states talks about this since this happened a lot with the president\nAbsolute is far from the first time a you know I think the most obvious example is when the president claimed after the twenty sixteen election that three million illegal votes were cast and causing the popular vote that was an idea he clearly got a it's a through various channels from into wars and he sort of use that to then create the presidential voter fraud commission\nWhat are some of the influential sites hear the word gab I think is new to some people because the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting had been active or making anti Semitic remarks on ... what are some of the other ones that are Q\nA shirt so so there's various uh ... it's almost like a mirror world\nFor all these various site so you know YouTube would obviously be the main video say well if you're kicked off YouTube you might go to a website called like ... or something and so there's various versions of Facebook and Twitter and\nSo on and they don't say where racist we're here to be racist rice\nWell you you know it's interesting some of them do actively court the alt right some of them have positioned themselves more as a broader free speech platform in the case of gap I\nThink they definitely did a lot of outreach to the alt right and that was sort of part of their business model I'm\nEither becoming more influential\nOr you know it's interesting I think they're very prominent within their niche I mean these sites are still like fractions of a fraction of what a a mainstream social media site without\n'em and did they get directly to policymakers or is there some intermediate a\nWell you know we've seen the president's a campaign manager Brad par scale mentioned gab before I say you would join if there was some technical issues so so there are some links to the mainstream Republican Party\nWill summer thanks for coming by really appreciate things rather than he reports for the Daily Beast\n\nAnd let's get an update now on one of the news stories that can be driven by conspiracy theories the U.S will deploy more than five thousand troops to the border with Mexico in an effort to stop a caravan of migrants some of whom say they eventually want to reach asylum in the United states\nYou know last night in an interview with learning from the president said there are quote a lot of bad people and the care of in and he called it an invasion\nThousands and thousands of people in the bridge when you looked at that bridge loaded up with maple that's called an invasion of our country\nAnd in a tweet President Trump said quote our military is waiting for you and quote Mexican authorities estimate that the caravan has about three to five thousand travel\nLet's check that out with freelance journalist David ... who has been traveling with the caravan he's now back in Mexico city he was with them just days ago welcome to the program a good morning I'm\nA first I Want to get a sense of how far away this caravan is from the border we're told that us troops will be at the U.S border Mexico border within days\nUm is the caravan within days of the United states\nNo not at all they still are probably close to a thousand miles away from the closest us port of entry and also many in in a caravan are saying that their destination teeth wanna which obviously across from San Diego and that's a quite a bit more distant\nOr with any luck they would make it to Mexico City probably around ... uh the first ... the end of the first week of November and that still quite a ways to go\nUnless checked the size of this because um yesterday we heard on NPR News from the Mexican ambassador to the United states who said that Mexican authorities are trying to keep tabs on this group and edited a declined and size considerably and he thought it was about thirty five hundred people do you have any way to\nTo to estimate that yourself\nNobody knows for sure that obviously the official number a that was given at the time of the last week was thirty six hundred with a and just yesterday cheering minister said Eighteen hundred Eighteen hundred Ninety five people\nHow to apply for asylum another five hundred asked to go home of voluntarily mirrors along the route and put the number it closer to six thousand or not which is a because on the number of people that they were serving a because you're obviously providing a lot of food and uh\nObviously assistance for the migrants so nobody knows for sure but it would probably be hired enough\nOkay so it may be higher than thirty five hundred of according to the best information that you have I guess the next question is how many of them are determined to reach the United states as opposed to accepting this Mexican offer of asylum or taking some other course\nWell the ... the migrants themselves at a a nightly they have it couldn't have innately family were they when they live in a in a in a village what they'll do is deal they'll set up camp and they'll they'll be in the town square and uh\nThey will have an assembly which they will vote on proposals usually that meaning when they will leave the next morning what route they will take and the proposal was read to them and they voted she'd not except that I spoke with migrants who just simply said their goal is to reach the United states felt\nThat we still both of them will do their best to get to\nThe United states okay so some of them some of them are coming to the border could be here could be any other states eventually\nEventually yes I mean there's no nobody's really sure how how quickly they'll get to you'll get that they're probably moved and moving about forty miles a day some days more somebody left\nUh but that still putting them uh probably late November at the earliest that they would get to the border at coupon\nOkay David Akron reporter has been traveling with the caravan thanks so much

David Greene in Culver City California how to fake narratives and conspiracy theories make it from the far right corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed\nThis question carries new urgency after the events in recent days including after a gunman killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend\nThe suspect posted explicit racist comments to social media and extremist conspiracy theories can also end up driving official policy will summer thinks about all of this a lot he reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast and he's with us this morning either will ... so what's a good example of how this for a short so for example I mean\n... the most obvious example right now is the the care of and the so called caravan coming out of Honduras or this is a the idea that this was some big men as a you know an invading hoard a it is something that really sort of bubbled up ah on on the sort of the darkest a edges of the right wing Internet\nOr with a lot of sort of hoaxes behind it and uh you know they've been pushing this idea for a couple of months now it's only really this month it's caught on so much so that the president is now sending troops to fight off as sort of non existent invasion\nNow I mean of course the president would say sending the military somewhere is a very important decision but but you're you're saying that you've been able to actually track this that the idea that this so called caravan is a menace was on some of these fringe sites and you could watch it work its way into the conversation and and sort of mainstream politics\nAbsolutely people don't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for channel ... which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these places and they kind of hit the hit the mean enough and the message and then just in in the past week or two it really has caught on\nA you know a a represented map gates from Florida was one of the big promoters of it and then from there it really took off\nAre there are other examples where you've actually seen these sort of there's work their way is as high as you know top officials even the White House\nYeah I I think some of the most fascinating stuff happens when these weird hoaxes and conspiracy theories effect actual policy so ah the president or claimed after twenty six you know election that he had lost the popular vote because three million illegal votes were cast\nAnd you can draw a pretty direct line to that from that too and infowars article that had originally made that claim and then that claim then goes on to that part of the president to create the presidential voter fraud commission\n[noise] what what what who does something about this if if anyone I mean if if these conspiracy theories are not true if if some or all or many of them are not based on fact who rains as soon as the job of of the press to knock these things down should fall the social media platforms to regulate what's being shared their\nYou know I I think it's an incredibly thorny issue I mean we've seen in the past when at a press rise to fact check things you often end up amplifying the hoaxes and spreading them around and you aren't really convincing the people who believe in them already a you know at this point I think people are kind of decided the ball is in the court of the social media companies\nBut you know they've been very reluctant to step in understandably into adjudicating political controversies so it it I think it's very sticky issue I think the companies right now are airing more on the side of a uh banning people and stuff like that and they were in the past\nAre we seeing a lot more than than we used to or has has always been going I mean it seems like something that is\nReally accelerated obviously we've had conspiracy theories for decades and and even before that a but it it is really exhilarated with social media and also I think ah the Internet and social media allows people to connect and reinforce wanted others believe in a way they couldn't really in real life\nWill summer reports on

milk I drink it all the time and prices on things started going up and it's like why is that happening\nIn fact milk prices have largely gone down in Missouri since Trump became president but if Alex is paying more at his store and he uses that as a measure of this president it goes to show the kind of expectations he has\nYou know this man was supposed to be able to fix everything make everything

weeks away from the U.S border and moving slowly through Mexico\nBut within days President Trump plans to move roughly five thousand us troops to the border at rallies for Republican candidates this fall the president has explicitly port the distant caravan at the center of the election campaign on election seemed to be continued last night on Fox\nThousands and thousands of people and the bridge when you looked at that bridge loaded up with maple that's called an invasion of our country for president\nWas apparently referring to a bridge more than one thousand miles away from the United states with that said there is a group of several thousand migrants with varying descriptions of its size and purpose to check the latest facts we called journalist David ... who was recently with that group and we asked first if it is getting near the U.S\n[noise] no not at all it's still a probably close to a thousand miles away from the closest us port of entry and also many in in the caravan are saying that their destination is to wanna which obviously across from San Diego and that's a quite a bit a more distant\nOr with any luck they would make it to Mexico City probably around uh the first the end of the first week of November and that still quite a ways to go\nI must check the size of this because um yesterday we heard on NPR News from the Mexican a bastard the United states who said that Mexican authorities are trying to keep tabs on this group and edited a declined in size considerably and he thought it was about thirty five hundred people do you have any ...\nIt to to to estimate that yourself ... ...\nNobody knows for sure the obviously the official number a that was given at the time or the last week was thirty six hundred with a and just yesterday the interior minister said about Eighteen hundred Eighteen hundred Ninety five people\nHad applied for asylum another five hundred asked to go home of voluntarily mirrors along the route had put the number it closer to six thousand or not it was just based because on the number of people that they were serving\nA because they're obviously providing a lot of of food and uh obviously assistance for the migrants so nobody knows for sure but it would probably be higher than\nThe okay so it may be higher than thirty five hundred of according to the best information that you have I guess the next question is how many of them are determined to reach the United states as opposed to accepting this Mexican offer of asylum or taking some other course\nWell the ... the migrants themselves had a they tend to have a nightly assembly where they when they arrive in a in a in a village what they'll do is they'll\nThey'll set up camp and they'll be in the town square and they will have an assembly one which they will vote on proposals usually that meaning when they will leave the next morning what route they will take\nAnd the proposal was read to them and they voted to not except that I spoke with migrants who just simply said their goal is to reach the United states so that was so both of them will do their best to get to the United states\nOkay so some of them some of them are coming to the border could be here could be on the other states eventually\nEventually yes I mean there's no nobody's really sure how how quickly they'll get they'll get that they're probably move their moving about forty miles a day some days more some days less\nEvery one at a I spoke with was determined to reach the United states of all the people I spoke with only two said they were interested in staying in Mexico one person can cross the border and just wanted to be closer to us children or the others were ... were wanting to work in northern Mexico reporter David I run thanks so much you're

service so do whatever we need to do to help everybody get through this\nRabbi Chuck diamond who once led a congregation that tree of life says rabbis had been going to the more to be with the bodies in the days since the shooting\nWas so we're we're not supposed to leave the body alone and we have people who come in and guards them can be with them while they're there they pray they say songs and so it was just somebody should pass from the world by themselves and ... it's an honor some on it for everybody who's who's involved in it\nDiamond says a ritual washing up the body is also part of the Jewish tradition to prepare for burial\nAnd that's what we call the great myths of the great commandment to great good thing that we do it's very difficult thing to\nBurial traditionally takes place quickly in Judaism ideally within a day or two that timeline has been pushed back slightly because of the criminal investigations surrounding the shooting\nThere's a real desire to return to a sense of a routine and normalcy\nRabbi Aron business is the senior rabbi at congregation wrote us alone which is hosting the Rosenthal funeral today he explains the thinking behind a quake burial which is traditionally followed by a week of intense morning\nEven as that won't be immediate we want to get that under way that process so they're not wallowing in our grief or we're not stuck in

federal deficit up Seventeen percent in the accounting you're just ended Stephen Moore thank you for joining us here\nThank you many worry that Republicans have gone soft on deficits and the quest to cut taxes are you going soft on if it's\nIf you don't get the economy growing faster than one half to two percent you're not going to bring down the trade deficit you're not going to get new jobs get business is growing and a lot of these other problems are much easier to solve\nBut that's the answer to people who are particularly focused on the deficit is give it some time now editor oath will bring it down yup\nBut Trump has given us a lot higher growth already now look Republicans have done a terrible job of controlling spending and I'm the first one to point the finger so Republicans for that and Democrat\nAnd you don't think the president should be leaning on those Republicans a little harder on\nHis well yeah I think he should've beat out some of those spending bills Trump takes a lot of criticism from conservatives for not talking about Medicare and Social Security which is you know it was a big part of adding bicycled entitlement programs my feeling as one of the reasons Donald Trump won the election is precisely because he said he wasn't going to cut Social Security and Medicare\nSo I mean when you step back from this though is the Trump Administration everything you'd hoped for when you through and you're a lot\nWith the only time during the campaign is it that way okay and\nAll that look I mean the proof of the putting us in the eating we've got the strongest economy in Thirty years and I think it took the tax cuts and getting the government off of the backs of business\nOn the tax cuts I mean there's certainly cheered up the stock market but I just saw before he came in a new survey from the national association for business economics and this is what they asked\nHas your from adjusted plans were hiring or investments as a result of the tax cutting job act a majority said no eighty one percent said no we haven't changed the amount of hiring or investment\nThat most were you know that I share that info our biggest goal in this tax cut was

L. dot edu\n\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California so how do fake narratives and conspiracy theories make it from the far right corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed\nThis question carries new urgency after the events of recent days after a gunman killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend\nThe suspect was an active user of the social media sites gap where he posted his anti Semitic thoughts gab bills itself as a free speech alternative to Facebook and Twitter and is hardly the first place on the Internet where anti Semitism white nationalism and other extreme ideology spread\nWe spoke earlier this morning to will summer who thinks about all this a lot he reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast and he's actually tracked how conspiracy theories gained traction either well thanks for having me so what's a good example of how this works a shirt so for example I mean ...\nThe most obvious example right now is the the care of and the so called caravan coming out of Honduras or this is a the idea that this was some big men as a you know invading hoard a it is something that really sort of bubbled up ah on on the dark as a edges of the right wing Internet\nOr with a lot of sort of hoaxes behind that and uh you know they've been pushing this idea for a couple of months now and it's only really this month it's caught on so much so that the president is now sending troops to fight off as sort of non existent invasion\nNow I mean of course the president would say sending the military somewhere is a very important decision but but you're you're saying that you've been able to actually track this that the idea that this caravan is a menace was on some of these fringe sites and you could watch it worked its way into the conversation and and sort of mainstream politics\nAbsolutely people don't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for channel ... which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these places and they kind of hit the hit the me enough and the message and then just in in the past week or two it really has caught on\nA you know a a representative Matt gates from Florida it was one of the big promoters of it and then from there it really took off\nAre there are other examples where you've actually seen these sort of there's work their way is as high as you know top officials even the White House yeah I\nI I think some of the most fascinating stuff happens when these weird hoaxes and conspiracy theories effect actual policy so ah the president or claimed after twenty sixteen election that he had lost the popular vote because three million illegal votes were cast\nAnd you can draw a pretty direct line to that from that too and infowars article that had originally made that claim and then that claim then goes on to his part of the president to create the presidential voter fraud commission\n[noise] what what what who does something about this if if anyone I mean if if these conspiracy theories are not true if if some or all or many of them are not based on fact to rains as soon as the job of of the press to knock these things down should fall the social media platforms to regulate what's being shared their you\nKnow I I think it's an incredibly thorny issue I mean we've seen in the past when at a press rise to fact check things you often end up amplifying the hoaxes and spreading them around and you aren't really convincing the people who believe in them already a you know at this point I think people are kind of decided the ball is in the court of the social media companies\nBut you know they've been very

Steve Inskeep in Washington DC days before an election in which he wants to immigration to be a major issue\nPresident Trump has a new way to talk about immigration he gave an interview to actually goes in which he said that he is interested in the idea of ending birthright citizenship that's the legal concept that someone born in the United states or to a U.S citizen is also entitled to be a citizen\nIt was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member guessing line and you don't need a number one number one you don't need that nobody can nothing just human lessons well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas it's ridiculous and it has to end\nA NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley joins us next morning Scott\nGood morning Steve why is the president focused on this\nWell ah it seems to be conveniently time for the midterm elections which are just a week away today\nThis was an idea that was floated by Donald Trump and and some other candidates during the twenty sixteen a campaign and here we are in late twenty eight team and we have seen a zero public activity towards actually acting on something like this\nUntil now we are all week out from the mid term elections the White House counsel who would presumably play a role in\nDrafting an order like this is just a left his post the new White House counsel hasn't taken over a there's an acting person in that slot so it it seems suspicious that something like this is actually going to serve as it may be a little bit of April where like the president's ten percent middle class tax cuts oh a conveniently arises before the midterm and that has never seen or heard\nFrom again I I guess we should fact check a little bit of what we just heard the president say there and it is something he said during the campaign complaining that someone who was known as an anchor baby would come here and be born on us soil and therefore get eighty five years of benefits uh the reality is in many cases of course that person grows up and goes to work and work the job and creates a value for the economy correct\nWell that's right and we're talking about all that sort of two phenomenon one is a babies born to people who are living in the U.S illegally and then secondly there's a a a nation\nA phenomenon known as birth tourism where you have wealthy immigrants coming to us specifically for the purpose of of having children we should say the fourteenth amendment is very explicit all persons born or naturalized in the United states\nAnd subject the jurisdiction thereof are citizens or whether you can challenge that through an executive order as it is a pretty constitutionally dubious ...\nThat's what I Want to ask about Scott Horsley the president says there on the video he says okay so it's in the constitution but some people think you can do it with Congress so I'm going to try and executive order that seems to me like he was saying\nUm you need a plane to cross the Pacific ocean but some people think you can do it in a row boats so I'm going to try a scooter\n[laughter] you may try it and this certainly face a quick a constitutional challenge\nAlthough as you point out he hasn't done it yet is the thing he's raising his discussing days before an election\nAnd this is cutting it to the anti immigrant faction within the GOP\nAll right Scott thanks so much really appreciate it You're welcome to That's NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley both\nServices are the victims of the mass
