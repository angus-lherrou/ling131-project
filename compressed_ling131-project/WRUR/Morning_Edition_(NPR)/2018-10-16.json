NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith we also heard from NPR's correspondent based in Istanbul Peter Kenyon thanks to you both You're welcome thank you\n[noise]\nAll right there is the sense among a lot of people that there's a deep divide between rural and urban America that rural America is poor and in declined ball the cities in this country in the suburbs are thriving\nNPR's own reporting doesn't really bear that out and neither does a new poll from NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation at Harvard's th Chan School of public health\nOppose up today and it finds that rural America looks like a patchwork of economic and social issues better in some places worse than others some errors are struggling others are booming small town Americans face real challenges according to the study but also have optimism for their future\nNPR's Alison Kodjak is in the studio with us this morning to talk about this poll thanks for being here\nThanks for having me All right what is the survey find\nSome of the thing was that the biggest two issues among rural Americans which might not come as a huge surprise are opioid addiction and the economic situation but what was interesting was that they were on equal footing now we asked people if they personally know someone who struggled with addiction and almost half forty nine percent said yes\nSo we called around and I talked to a woman named Brenda who answered our poll she lives in this tiny Virginia town right on the board of Kentucky and Tennessee\nAnd she says addictions everywhere in our community including in her ... immediate family so here she is\nMy daughter and her husband I'm about ... and he walked off all of them because they couldn't give up his truck it\nBurned it told me her niece has died of an addiction her nephew that ended in diction its really hit her heart so brand new lives in coal country where the economy's really in distress and there aren't just aren't very any job opportunities there\nIf you come out of college with a degree are you more than likely going to leave this area to find work\nSo she was hit by the opioid crisis she's hit by a bad economic situation there but the poll interesting enough despite those issues found that a lot of people are actually optimistic\nYeah and that was it was interesting about half the people surveyed said they are doing better than their parents were economically at that at their ... their age and even more surprising they expect their kids to be better off financially than they are\nAnd so you know they just why why do they believe that well that rate I think that's what we found is as Steve mentioned earlier it's a patchwork so despite the problems in coal country\nA lot of rural areas in this country is actually doing really well the agricultural zones and the Central Valley of California in Iowa the unemployment rates really love the oil patch in North Dakota\nSo I talked to Chris former and he's an economic forecasts are in Los Angeles and he says rural areas are really tied to one single industry so if the industry is doing well the community is probably doing well\nWho might have a cold town in an oil town well the whole town is doing terrible because coal can compete in this era of cheap natural gas\nOn the other hand because of fracking these rural community sitting on oil are booming and incomes are up dramatically as a result of all that new money flowing into the region for oil exploration and drilling\nSo you're outlet when you're in rural America which is just not one thing Frank gonna depend on the end when it right yeah exactly so it's pretty complicated all America\nIs made up a lot of different people of different situations NPR's Alison Kojak given the latest on this new NPR

medicines and TV commercials the move effectively sets the stage for months or even years of battle with the drug industry\nKaiser Health news senior correspondent Sarah Jane Tribble covers drug pricing and she's here to walk us through what this means morning good morning what is this new proposal what exactly will it mean\nSo what secretary aides are as a health and Human Services and to the Trump Administration he took to the stage yesterday and he announced that any drug that costs more than thirty five dollars a month we need to have advertising on TV ads and the rule is rather specific it says the advertising needs to be on a contracting background and needs to be easy to read\nUp so there are a lot of questions embedded in that um what what price are they going to list in the TV commercials because based on how much people paying insurance the prices are different for different people right right\nExactly so when you go to the pharmacy counter and I go to a pharmacy counter our co pays maybe different depending on our insurance and\nUm we may have a detectable we have to fill so the question is what price will be up there um the secretary did note that they want list price up there which is I'm also a good question what does it mean um he clarified later and said it would be wholesale acquisition cost which is a an industry term where\nUm nobody really pays that often and assays are made a point of saying that the price does matter and he did this big analogy with the auto industry on cars and so forth\nAnd it does matter because it's a base for a lot of negotiation and it can be a base for what people who are uninsured pay but would it matter to consumers though it can be off often confusing consumers right so if I'm told that my drug it's five thousand dollars a month just for example but I'm only going to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month or\nMight adoptable covers it are my my health plan covers it and only paying fifty dollar co pay\nIt could scary away from getting a drug right\nSo um even though it's it's kind of confusing it's still demanding a level of transparency that I imagine the pharmaceutical industry isn't so keen on\nYeah and um and it is getting a lot of attention it's something that um it's kind of a populist thing that people can grasp on to\nAnd it is just a few weeks before the midterms um I Want to point out for the November elections so the timing is a very exciting because people really care about prescription drug prices right now recent polling shows that a ... price friends' parents and prescription drug prices polls well with American voters\n... just the idea of it for you you start companies to be more a forthcoming I'm so is it what's the likelihood that it actually is going to go into effect\nSo let me back up just a minute and say in the form it from sickle industries response because I think that helps lead us to the likelihood of that going into effect\nSo yesterday morning before um the secretary took to the stage and made this big announcement the pharma industry through their trade group format I made a big announcement as well and they said hey we're going to do a voluntary measure where we ask our companies to\nHelp educate you about your price and we will help you know direct you on our website to information about the benefits and costs of our drug ... and they're going to put together a Web portal that you can go and look and look at your insurance options and so forth okay so that was a kind of the farm industry on the offensive\nDuring the press call for that um somebody asked me ... is there is a possibility for litigation here and the industry didn't say no and I think it's a legitimate question and several law scholars that I spoke with yesterday um did note that this is just asking for litigation\nSo um even if the rules comes into being which you've outlined is kind of a long shot of because of litigation what tools does the Trump Administration is administration how to enforce that\nSo they don't have much at all not really anything in there they say that they're going to put together a list of companies that don't meet the standards and shame them and then they're going to expect the other companies to sue each other or consumers to sue\nThe company so no ... more political than substantive I'm Sarah Jane Tribble senior correspondent with Kaiser Health news thank you so much thank you\nThere is no firm indication that the United states will act against Saudi Arabia for the suspected murder of a journalist but the Saudis may already be paying a price NPR's John Ydstie reports on what it means the businesses are backing away\nIn twenty sixteen crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon Saudi Arabia is effective ruler invited us and global businesses to a conference he unveiled a plan called vision twenty thirty\nHad called for a transition of the Saudi economy away from oil and toward a more diverse market based model and the crown prince invited the companies to participate\nJacob Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for international economics says the ... year fair is undermining the crown princes vision\nNamely that the world's most advanced than competitive companies come and establish themselves in Saudi Arabia\nThat scenario is fading as the CEOs of large us and global companies one after another announced they will not attend the second vision twenty thirty conference scheduled for next week Jamie diamonds C. E. O. J. P. Morgan Chase has said he wanted to end again Jacob Kierkegaard\nI think the fact that as CEO as prominent as you know J. P. Morgan Jamie diamond not going to the summit and saying so publicly and linking it to the ... disappearance means that many other CEOs will probably pull out\nTo other prominent Wall Street CEOs Larry fink of black rock and Steve Schwartzman of the Blackstone group also say they won't be attending\nAccording to the New York times the trio of CEOs tried but failed to get the Saudis to postpone the conference the CEOs also reportedly failed to convince treasury secretary Steven ... to stay home\nThe ... the allegations along with previous behavior of the crown prince are making companies nervous says Kirkegaard\nSays remember that back in twenty Seventeen the crown prince rounded up four hundred Saudi princes and business people detained them at the rich Carlton in Riyadh on corruption charges and force them to pay the government as much as a hundred billion dollars I mean he\nBasically sends the signal that the root of law in Saudi Arabia is amiss when you're trying to lure foreign investors into your country that is about the worst signal you could possibly send them\nBut Karen young a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute says U.S companies who ... the Saudis will likely pay a price because the Saudis will take it personally\nThat decision on the part of the U.S corporate to walk away from this conference and to in some ways you know turn its back on the Saudi Government as a partner will not be forgotten by the Saudis\nYoung says it could be two decades before the Saudis will re engage with these companies young also says us sanctions against the Saudis could be tricky\nThere's lots of Saudi money and us tech real estate and stock market she says and the Saudis own lots of US government bonds not to mention the country's key role in the oil markets so the Saudis have ways to retaliate John Ydstie NPR News Washington [noise]\nForty degrees in Rochester under cloudy skies good morning it's five forty two I'm Beth Adam ... news Rochester

slavery in terms of the loss of black bodies\nBut you know we don't really stop so much to think about the loss of of ah [noise] of potential of blacks greatness of black genius\nI have to ask because I'm hearing you saying that you start the novel um don't exactly know where it's going I don't think it's giving away too much to note that\nThis young enslaved man and his older white companion are gonna skate Barbados they're going to get out of there or did you need to get out of there get out of a slave situation as a novelist for your on Saturday\nWasn't so much that is that I felt that with this novel what it really wanted to explore was his life posts slavery and to show how\n[noise] you know by being physically see\nWe think of that as being kind of the end of slavery well she's not in chains he's gotten away he's physically free but I really think that you know there had to be a huge psychological ramifications to having been a slave even while your free in body that obviously you're carrying with you a great trauma\nAnd probably a great sense of the will to him into your place in the world and I really wanted to express that\nI'm thinking of two ways that comes across one of the young man is constantly thinking he's going to be recaptured her church though uh another one there's a there's an observation late in the book when it becomes apparent that\nYou know way he resents being freed you resents the white man or freedom ah obviously you gave him so many opportunities but also took away from everything that he knew and dislocated I'm In a way\n[noise] yeah but I also think I think the main thing that he represents is the feeling that the men who freed him did not\nRespect him as an equal and this is really the crux of what what starts to eat at him is that this man made this great gesture of of helping him be free and yet she really has\nThe sense that this man thought of himself as an abolitionist and and your great crusader for good in the world that he didn't actually recognize the humanity of of Washington [noise]\nWhy does this feel like a irrelevant story to you and two thousand and\nI think we're still dealing with a obviously a lot of the themes in concerned that come up in the book things like racial injustice racial inequality the idea that some lives are are more worthy than other lines but also this idea of um people\nKind of being galvanized to do something in the world if you think of the abolitionists and um\nAnd how they [noise] they really had to [noise] not only is sort of\nChanged their own thinking about slavery which would have been just a very sort of ... an everyday thing I mean the sugar arrived on your table\nIn the mornings you put it in your oatmeal you understood that this was the product of slave labor but it wasn't going on in a part of the world that you would probably never and you're like see a you know done by people who you really had nothing in common with\nSo to be able to change their own thinking about that and then to galvanize the whole society to\nChange public thinking that this is something huge and an amazing\nSo I was interviewing American voters or the other day in the state of Kentucky and there were a couple of folks and heavily wide areas who brought up black people a couple of times and expressed baffled by the central is a I don't understand\nWhat it is that black people are complaining about I don't see prejudice in my own life\nAnd they're they're saying I don't I just don't get it I don't get this black lives matter thing ... what would you say to somebody who here's a little bit of the history of the ... out and find that to be old news\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] that's very disheartening to say that but of course I Know I Know that to this exists\nUm to me that's it's quite shocking because I mean how can one watch\nVideos of um police officers gunning down unarmed citizens\nHow can anybody watch the videos and still contend that there's not a problem and and some that we have racial equality and fairness and justice baffling to me [noise]\nUh feel that there's been regression that there's been steps backwards in terms of\nPeople wanting to understand each other's experience and really being open to it and I think one of the things that novels can do is to bring a reader into the characters experience\nEspecially a character who was nothing like them you know we're dealing here with a boy in Eighteen thirties or betas who's this late but if you can read that and start to see maybe how you're like him a similarities ah and and also\nTo feel for him as he is going through these hardships if you can do that uh perhaps that can be the beginnings of some kind of empathy [noise]\nBessie or do drugs is the author of Washington

the suspected murder of a journalist by Saudi Arabia but here's a question when you're listening closely what did the president really say his language showed this was not really a threat he spoke of punishment if\nThe Saudis were responsible and by Monday he leaned into the you know raising doubts about Saudi involvement and blurring the issue NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports this is how the president often handles awkward news\nStanding on the south lawn of the White House President Trump described the conversation he had with Saudi king ... about what happened to take a showcase\nBecame firmly denied any knowledge of it he didn't really know made me I don't want to get his side but it sounded to me like maybe they should have been rolled jailers bowed out getting to the bottom of it very soon but as long as a flat denial\nIn just twenty seconds Trump hit a trifecta phrasing and logic he comes back to frequently first when an ally or someone he's inclined to believe denies something he first did they did not\nFive ass firmly denies that while he denies that mean Roy Moore denies it and by the way it gives a total denial\nI Will tell you that President Bush was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today\nThat was President Trump referring to the denials have king selmont Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore who was accused of inappropriate sexual contact with teenage girls and Russian President Vladimir Putin's Donald Trump is\nAll of us we all do this I mean I Do that you do this\nEmily ... is a professor of political science at Syracuse University she says it can be somewhat jarring coming from the president because traditionally American presidents have been more restraint but with Trump the filter as off my sense\nIs that he's relying on some stock phrases that he pulled out again and again especially when he's called on to make a statement about an issue that perhaps they haven't done a lot of research on or doesn't have a lot of information on\nWhich gets to the second thing Trump says regularly when confronted with potentially uncomfortable information or a difficult situation\nWe're going to get to the bottom of it and it will be severe punishment a filet is certainly acceptable we want to get to the bottom of rivers are if Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections I think it's a

such a big deal President Trump brought them up after the Saudi Government was suspected of having a journalist killed the president said he would look into that accusation but he wasn't willing to hold us weapons deals over it\nJennifer spin dollar's an expert in the international arms transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma from which he joined us ...\nGood morning thanks for having major ... what does the U.S sell this out as exactly\nTo the U.S sells a lot of different weapons to Saudi Arabia on precision guided munitions helicopters missiles jets ... a wide range of weapons that we've sold to the Saudis in the\nPast you know we were recovering the Saudi involvement of the war in Yemen someone put us at one point honestly one thirty transport plane which that American transport planes right so it's American stuff all the way through does this make the Saudis dependent on the United states or is it the other way around\nYou know I think that there is a little bit of both Saudi Arabia definitely gets both military power and the degree of political support from being able to receive arms in the United states and equally I think the U.S in the past has been hesitant to stop arms sales for fear of angering Saudi Arabia and having that effect other U.S foreign policy goals in the region\nYou know they're not the world's biggest country but they're one of the world's richest countries does that make them are really lucrative market for weapons\nYou know you might think so but in general what we've seen is that arms sales are up pretty inefficient employment mechanism part of that because sometimes weapons are given on grant or unfavorable credit terms um but you know in general this isn't like selling oranges are chairs or some other good there's a very different logic of both trade\nThat means that arms sales aren't from this lucrative big deal for the United\nOh if you're talking about jobs which is what the president says he's concerned about you're saying there aren't actually that many jobs at stake\nThat's what we've seen in the past you know in a previously Saudi Arabia had signed a six billion dollar deals for Lockheed Martin helicopters and and that was supposed to support four hundred jobs so there isn't quite the direct correlation between the amount of money that we're told that these arms deals um amount to and the number of jobs that we see at home\nFor for ... important to those four hundred people but not not world changing for the U.S economy so so is it possible if the president wanted if he thought it was in us interest is it possible to halt arms sales to even to an ally like Saudi Arabia\nYou know I think it absolutely would be possible and thinking about the broader political context that could be really important signal for the United states to send you know that the abduction and murder of ... is not acceptable that Saudi or human rights violations in Yemen with continued aerial operations are are not something that the U.S supports\nAnd there's actually precedent for the U.S doing that to friendly states and allies\nI'm under President Obama and August twenty fourteen the U.S actually stopped the transfer of hellfire missiles\nPrecisely because of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip that stoppage was supposed to signal us displeasure and that Israel they didn't have a sort of blank check to keep asking for us weapons\nAlthough President Trump has said hey wait a minute if I stop us arms sales because of concern about ... ... ah the Saudis will just buy them from the Russians or somebody else is that really possible\nI'm fairly skeptical that that could be feasible um opportunity for Saudi Arabia in arms sales you know us and Russian or Chinese systems don't talk to one another which means that would be really costly and time intensive for Saudi Arabia to buy and then learn new weapons systems these things aren't interchangeable\nOh because they've already got so many of us weapons systems they would have trouble backing out of us weapons systems at this point\nExactly so the dependence works both ways they're\nJennifer ... thanks so much\nThanks for having me\nShe is an expert on weapons transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma\nPresident Trump talks about slashing regulations as one of his greatest achievements a lot of those regulations are connected to the environment Congress has largely largely gone along for the ride that may change though this November NPR's Nathan Rott reports on what a new look Congress could mean for the environment\nThe environment is not typically a top of ticket issue for voters but this has not been a typical year\nMendocino Complex fire in northern California and now the largest in state history\nThree million people at risk for extreme heat heat index is hurricane\nFlorence is already making his presence along the Carolina coast\nNo none of this push the environment over issues like health care or immigration in the minds of most voters but it does make for easy messaging in states where the effects of climate change are already being felt cue the role of a raging wildfires\nGetting hotter but won't fire and smoke choke or air dinner warmonger is radically opposed to efforts to fight climate change global warming is a fraud\nAds like this have been appearing throughout California Florida and in swing districts across the country targeting Republican lawmakers it's part of a multimillion dollar effort by the league of conservation voters to flip the house Democrats Tiernan sitting failed is a vice president with a conservation group\nIf we had in mind our allies leading the house of representatives they could do badly needed oversight on the minister Asians efforts to cater to polluters every day over our communities\nThat word oversight is one you hear a lot from Democrats in part because there's not a whole lot else they can do\nMost of the robotics and environmental policy are happening in the executive branch under Trump appointees a shift in house leadership won't change that Democrats can't force interior secretary Ryan Zinke you to restore Bears Ears national monument for example or to crack down on methane emissions but they can force him to explain himself\nArizona congressman role ... is the ranking Democrat on the house natural resources committee\nI Want to change the narrative of this whole thing where the Resources Committee is not just the past the part of the Trump Administration that the independent and that they have responsibility is co equals for oversight and accountability\nTranslation expect hearings lots of them if Democrats retake the house Tom pile heads the American energy alliance which supports Trump's agenda he says a Democratic majority in the house would be a setback for the administration\nAnd they would be able to tighten up mercilessly so that they would cut to be able to slow walk a lot of the good work that's being done with respect to these issues\nDemocrats already have a working list here's Colorado congresswoman Diane and to get the ranking Democrat on the oversight committee for energy and commerce\nI think you will be seeing investigations in hearings around the next day in rural and clean power plant and they think car rules you're going to be seeing us look more in debt\nConflicts of interest in corruption at the EPA\nAnd the list goes on to get says this year's midterms reminder of what happened in two thousand six when Democrats took back the house under President George W. Bush for the following two years Democrats called hearings and investigations and crafting legislation that they knew would not passed under Republican president\nBut that when President Obama was elected in two thousand eight we were able to move a rebellious legislative agenda because men spent the last two years developing it\nNo of course Republicans could keep their majority in Congress which would mean continued support for the administration's deregulatory agenda Nathan Rott NPR News\nAnd later today on all things considered the outcome of the mid term elections could also have a

confirmed these reports rural Americans are as concerned about drug addiction as they are about the economy NPR's Alison Kodjak reports on a new poll from NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Harvard's th Chan School of public health\nThe poll shows that about a quarter of the people living in rural areas said drug addiction or abuse is the biggest problem facing their communities\nThat's about the same share that side of the economy is their biggest worry those two categories overwhelmed all the other responses in the survey of Thirteen hundred people who live in rural areas but even with those worries people say they have a positive outlook about their future\nRobert Blendon is the professor at Harvard th Chan School who directed the pole\nIn terms of the future at least half of people are quite optimistic\nMost of the people who responded to the survey said they are doing better than their parents and the majority said they expect their kids to do even better Alison Kodjak NPR News\nYou Amy genealogy and sent back to people who were legally part of the Cherokee Nation at one time why is beginning irrelevant to that\nWill DNA at best will tell you if there are markers and your genetic code the trade issue to native peoples\nIn North America and South America it's not going to tie you to a particular group of native peoples to particular tribe keep in mind as you noted uh Indian tribes in this country are sovereign nation we existed before the United states\nOr was was exist in existence and so\nAs a sovereign nation we can determine our own citizenship rules and laws course those are tied or in parts of federal treaties but this is a legal status say politically that is not a genetic status and that is very important for folks in this country to understand but one of the reasons we're concerned about\nBut let's talk about what it was worth Warren said she specifically said I'm not enrolled in a tribe she says I have native ancestry and she's one of a lot of people who will say well ah family stories as I have some Indian blood and people who apparently can take a DNA test\nOr does it bother you or when someone like Elizabeth Warren says I'm not a member of a dry but I have Indian ancestry\n[noise] it does I mean first of all it it I don't begrudge anybody for having family stories are being curious about their their DNA but you have to take Senator Warren statements in the larger context I mean she has told stories about being a Cherokee hearing those stories growing up\nAh and then she is in a back and forth with the president United States of course is taking taking some personal shots at her for her family story\nUm and then we're now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about and so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have very specific\nA means by which you are a Cherokee citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for a senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight to talk about DNA ah it really undermines tribal interest frankly because we're a sovereign nation\nThan it was a couple of couple of questions that are raised by that one of the general one of them specific and the general question is just about the really large number of people that\nAh many of us have encountered in everyday life who say they have some some native ancestry or they are they taking advantage of you in some way by not being members of the Cherokee Nation or whatever nation but saying that they have this this background\nWill often it is about a appropriating our identity and our culture um you know we thought long and hard for this status it's a legal status that was nearly extinguished by the government you know states\nIt's a legal status that we used to fight for the rights of native children to protect our lands and when someone comes in and boast that they took a DNA test so there Indian\nWe think that our roads what it means to be a Native American in this country even if they don't claim a specific tribal nations citizenship\nThen there's the specific question of Elizabeth Warren you're mentioned that she has been criticized by President Trump has referred to her as Pocahontas to Pocahontas who challenged her to take some kind of DNA test should she not be able to respond to that at all\nI don't think she should go down to the level of that kind of name calling and that\nKind of attack what we want from leaders of this country has people to advocate and fight for Indian country to understand our issues she's in a great position to have a positive impact on the Indian country that's where her focus should be the president United States should not be calling her Pocahontas he should be looking at what the needs of Indian country or because the needs are there\nAnd we need folks in Washington to listen to that and to stand up for us\nOkay so what's wrong with the president of the United states calling her Pocahontas then\nWell we think that it's a Pocahontas first of all was a was a real person that had a real identity with a real tribesmen in if you listen to the tone it to the very drifts of tone\nA it's a very critical tone I think it's a political back and forth that has little to do with the interest of Native Americans in this country has more to do with the political spat at so I don't think he uh does what he ought to do is the president to raise the level of discourse in this country maybe to take the opportunity to to talk about Indian country instead of just attacking senator\nWhile this is an opportunity to raise another issue that I think hardly has gotten talked about at all because there's so much news around the country are there are a lot of Indian nations in this country you have close relations with the federal government dependent on the federal government and and in many ways how has the Trump Administration done for a for the Cherokee Nation last couple\nOf well in in some ways it's been positively made a lot of strides in health care um but there's a lot of uncertainty for\nExample in the bureau of Indian affairs and whether the United states is going to consult with us over changes to that agency that's so critical it concerns is at times when there's proposed budget that reduce things that are important to us things to protect the environment that uh go to job creation\nOr education and things of that matter so\nUm we need we need a federal government that will listen to tribes\nThat will consult with tribes that will live up to its end of the bargain these are treaties these are trust obligations are and so we think the federal government could be doing better but it certainly doesn't help when the president United States attacks US Senator or if a senator gets bogged down in DNA a DNA results\nWill miss Roskam thanks very

from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin the Trump Administration announced plans Monday that would require drug makers to reveal the list price of their medicines and TV commercials the move effectively sets the stage for months or even years of battle with the drug industry\nKaiser Health news senior correspondent Sarah Jane Tribble covers drug pricing and she's here to walk us through what this means morning good morning what is this new proposal what exactly will it mean\nSo what secretary aides are as a health and Human Services and to the Trump Administration he took the stage yesterday and he announced that any drug that costs more than thirty five dollars a month we need to have advertising on TV ads and the rule is rather specific it says the advertising needs to be on a contracting background and needs to be easy to read\nUp so there are a lot of questions embedded in that um what what price are they going to list in the TV commercials because based on how much people paying insurance the prices are different for different people right right\nExactly so when you go to the pharmacy counter and I go to a pharmacy counter our co pays maybe different be depending on our insurance and\nUm we may have a detectable we have to have ... so the question is what price will be up there um the secretary did note that they want less price up there which is I'm also a good question what does it mean um he clarified later and said it would be wholesale acquisition cost which is a an industry term where\nUm nobody really pays that often and assays are made a point of saying that the price does matter and he did this big analogy with the auto industry on cars and so forth\nAnd it does matter because it's a base for a lot of negotiation and it can be a base for what people who are uninsured pay but\nWould it matter to consumers though it can be off often confusing consumers right so if I'm told that my drug it's five thousand dollars a month just for example but I'm only going to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month or might adoptable covers it are my my health plan covers it and only paying fifty dollar co pay it could scary away from getting a drug\nRight so um even though it's it's kind of confusing it's still demanding a level of transparency that I imagine the pharmaceutical industry isn't so keen on\nYeah and um and it is getting a lot of attention it's something that is kind of a populist thing that people can grasp on to\nAnd it is just a few weeks before the midterms um I Want to point out for the November election so the timing is a very exciting because people really care about prescription drug prices right now recent polling shows that a ... price friends' parents have prescription drug prices polls well with American voters\n... just the idea of it for you when you start companies to be more of a forthcoming I'm so is it what's the likelihood that it actually is going to go into effect\nSo let me back up just a minute and say in the form it from single industries response because I think that helps lead us to the likelihood of that going into effect so yesterday morning before um the secretary took to the stage and made this big announcement the pharma industry through their trade group pharma\nI made a big announcement as well and they said hey we're going to do a voluntary measure where we ask our companies to\nUm help educate you about your price and we will help you know direct you on our website to information about the benefits and costs of our drug and they're going to put together a Web portal that you can go and look and look at your insurance options and so forth okay so that was a kind of the pharma industry on the offensive\nDuring the press call for that um somebody asked me ... is there is a possibility for litigation here and the industry didn't say no\nAnd I think it's a legitimate question and several law scholars that I spoke with yesterday um did note that this is just asking for litigation\nSo um even if the rules comes into being which you've outlined is kind of a long shot of because of litigation what tools does the Trump Administration is administration how to enforce it\nSo they don't have much at all not really anything in there they say that they're going to put together a list of companies that don't meet the standards and shame and then they're going to expect the other companies to sue each other or consumers to sue the company so\nNo ... is more political than substantive I'm Sarah Jane Tribble senior correspondent with Kaiser Health news

News Good morning on death Adams\nNew York Democrats and Republicans are accusing one another of condoning violence after a weekend vandalism at the G O peas metropolitan club in New York City protesters from both far right and far left groups were arrested W ... reports\nThe trouble began when the leader of Proud Boys gathering McGinnis was scheduled to speak at New York city's metropolitan Republican club on topics including deep state socialist and western values that's according to the club's website\nA friend of mine said that you know we tend to think of slavery in terms of the loss of black bodies\nBut you know we don't really stop so much to think about the loss of of uh [noise] of potential of blacks greatness of black genius\nI have to ask because I'm hearing you saying that you start the novel and don't exactly know where it's going I don't think\nIt's giving away too much to note that this young and slave man and his older white companion are going to skate Barbados they're going to get out of there or did you need to get out of there get out of a slave situation as a novelist for your own Saturday\nWasn't so much that is that I felt that with this novel what it really wanted to explore was his life post slavery and to show\nHow [noise]\nYou know by being physically see we think of that as being kind of end up sleeping well she's not in chains he's gotten away he's physically free\nBut I really think that you know there had to be a huge psychological ramifications to having been a slave even while you are free and body that obviously you're carrying with you a great trauma\nAnd probably a great sense of the will come into your place in the world and I really wanted to express that\nI'm thinking of two ways of comes across one of the young man is constantly thinking he was going to be recaptured her church tone or another one there's a there's an observation late in the book when it becomes apparent that\nIn a way he resents being freed you resents the white man of freedom are obviously you gave him so many opportunities but also took away from everything that I knew and dislocated I'm In a way\nYeah but I also think I think the main thing that he represents is the feeling that the men who freed him did not\nRespect him as an equal and this is really the crux of what what starts to eat at him is that this man made this great gesture of of helping him be free and yet he\nReally has the sense that this man thought of himself as an evolution is and and your great crusader for good in the world that he didn't actually recognize the humanity of of Washington [noise]\nWhy does this feel like a irrelevant story to you and two thousand and\nI think we're still dealing with a obviously a lot of the themes and concerned that come up in the book things like racial injustice racial inequality the idea that some lives are are more worthy than other lines but also this idea of um people\nKind of being galvanized to do something in the world if you think of the abolitionists and um\nAnd how they [noise] they really had to [noise] not only is sort of changed their own thinking\nAbout slavery which would have been just a very sort of ... an everyday thing I mean the sugar arrived on your table\nIn the mornings you put it in your oatmeal you understood that this was the product of slave labor but it wasn't going on in a part of the world that you would probably never in your life see a you know done by people who you really had nothing in common with\nSo to be able to change their own thinking about that and then to galvanize a whole society to change public thinking that this is something huge and an amazing\nSo I was interviewing American voters or the other day in the state of Kentucky and there were a couple of folks and heavily wide areas who brought up black people a couple of times and expressed baffled by the central is a I don't understand\nWhat it is that black people are complaining about I don't see prejudice in my own mind\nAnd that they're saying I don't I just don't get it I don't get this black lives matter thing ... what would you say to somebody who here's a little bit of the history of the ... out and find that to be old news\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] that's very disheartening to say that but of course I Know I Know that to this exists um to me that's it's quite shocking\nBecause I mean how can one watch say videos of I'm a police officers gunning down unarmed citizens\nHave anybody watch those videos and still contend that there's not a problem and and some that we have racial equality and fairness is is baffling to me [noise]\nUh feel that there's been regression that there's been steps backwards in terms of people wanting to understand each other's experience and really being open to it and I think one of the things that novels can do\nIs to bring a reader into the characters experience\nEspecially a character who was nothing like them you know we're dealing here with a boy in Eighteen thirties Barbados a who's a slave but if you can read that and start to see maybe how you are like him a similarities ah and and also\nTo feel for him if he's going through these hardships if you can do that or perhaps that can be the beginnings of some kind of empathy\n[noise] that'd be a new job is the author of Washington

the suspected murder of a journalist by Saudi Arabia but here's a question when you listen closely what if the president really say his language showed this was not really a threat he spoke of punishment yes\nThe Saudis were responsible and by Monday he leaned into the you know raising doubts about Saudi involvement and blurring issue NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports this is how the president often handles awkward news\nStanding on the south lawn of the White House President Trump described the conversation he had with Saudi king selmont about what happened to showcase\nBecame firmly denied any knowledge of it he didn't really know maybe I don't want to get ... but it sounded to me like babies instead of being rolled his ... getting to the bottom of it very soon but as long as a flat denial\nIn just twenty seconds Trump hit a trifecta phrasing and logic he comes back to frequently first when an ally or someone he's inclined to believe denies something he first did the denial\nFive asset is firmly denies us while he denies that mean Roy Moore denies it and by the way it gives a total denial\nI Will tell you that President Bush was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today\nThat was President Trump referring to the denials of king selmont Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore who was accused of inappropriate sexual contact with teenage girls and Russian President Vladimir Putin's\nDonald Trump is all of us we all do it that I mean I Do that you do this\nEmily ... is a professor of political science at Syracuse University she says it can be somewhat jarring coming from the president because traditionally American presidents have been more restrained but with Trump the filter as off\nMy sense is that he's relying on some stock phrases that he pulled out again and again especially when he's called on to make a statement about an issue that perhaps they haven't done a lot of research on or doesn't have a lot of information on\nWhich gets to the second thing Trump says regularly when confronted with potentially uncomfortable information or a difficult situation\nWe're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment a delay is certainly acceptable we want to get to the bottom of rivers that if Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections I think it's a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it and I want to make sure it will never ever happen\nThat was Trump talking about to showcase disappearance saying he would be open to an FBI investigation into allegations against justice Kavanaugh\nAnd responding to a question about the intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the twenty sixteen election which leads to the third thing President Trump sometimes does offer as theory\nFor instance that wrote killers may have been involved in ... disappearance even though it happened in the Saudi conflict or the climate change will just fix itself\nOr that the hacking of democratic campaign emails wasn't done by Russia at all this with Trump and at twenty sixteen presidential debate\nCould also be lots of other people would also could be
