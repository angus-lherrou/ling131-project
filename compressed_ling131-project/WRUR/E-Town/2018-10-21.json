New York and it's a remarkably vibrant music scene in that\nPart of the world that most people aren't aware of trying to think if you go into those shows you know with the horse flies\nHorse flies big inspiration for me um my dad was a music fan late in play anything but he was an avid listener and music lover or he's from Ireland and he's a big fan of of old traditional federal music and everything so she uh\nIntroduced me into that stuff when he saw that I was into Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan and that focusing he took me out around town and we went to some Irish pubs and I also went to a a horse flies shows\nAnd I saw richest earned and Judy Hyman and Judy was she kind of does his head bang saying when she plays in their eyes roll back into her head [noise]\nUm and I thought that was the coolest thing and I [noise]\nSee not every teenager gets to have that experience of the division of the two worlds like head banging you know electric trance music and ... you know it all came together right there [laughter]\nAnd I mentioned your early ban and I'm assuming that was probably you know my guess is that you would have been trying to emulate that sounded\nSo absolutely yeah and ... were a big influence on that been it's funny that you mentioned that no one knows about the funniest ... name was actually a game that we made up of so it started with snow when snowballs or maybe ice blocks\nAnd he just staying in a circle and throw something in the air and hope it doesn't hit you [noise]\nUm [noise] that that was that was the front of a lot of the good too yeah [noise]\nWe should mention that the music scene is both a an antidote to enter a reflection of the fact that the weather is pretty rough in his ago so I think people get to spend a lot of time in the wintertime practicing\nAbsolutely it's like eight months of the winter yeah yeah yeah it's a trip\nAnd so it must have been amazing experience when the early incarnation of old crow medicine show got together and you've got some buddies knew had some kindred spirits and shared interests and you decided to\nTravel yeah well when I met those guys catching critter they came up from Shannon dougher valley in Virginia there from Harrisonburg, Virginia we got the rest of the guys together and we went to Canada played street corners ended up in Ottawa for a while right and we couldn't get across the border because they wouldn't let us so we need to go to the mohawk reservation to get across\nYour part of this whole immigration\n[noise] oh I was thinking about back there [laughter]\nSo the first day an honorable we played at the farmer's market and they made a hundred Canadian dollars what we thought oh yeah and thought we would just keep on going west yeah wow [noise]\nWow\nAnd the story about this the ... meeting Doc Watson in Boone North Carolina that's just a legend that couldn't have been scripted more generously for you\nGuys are one of those right place right time things that was the story of that band any good things that happened sort of came from just being in the right place at the right time\nTo Beijing so you rode that wave you played big Venus playing on the ground a lot redoing the whole thing yeah and then struck out on your own do you miss the infrastructure of having people help you carry stuff and set stuff up and to and your instrument\nAdolescence Lou [laughter] I got\nThese heavy guitar cases you know you're going to have you heard my shoulders I'm way too important for that [laughter] [noise]\n\nIt's also interesting because not everybody who's been in a band can do this whole thing\nI didn't know I could do it and I didn't think I could yeah I was so used to being in the band and being in a band was was what I'd always wanted to having that camaraderie and having a gang of guys\nThere was a learning curve for sure and I was so scared but I just took a few shows like being up there on stage and having people tell me that it was good yeah it gave me the confidence I needed to go on you know well\nI think you've chosen well you've got your something that I think is is I'm just a remarkable sound great great energy\nTo those songs to congratulate banking appreciate well let's get back to one of these well come back we're", "year": "2018", "show_name": "E-Town", "city": "Rochester", "day": "21"}
