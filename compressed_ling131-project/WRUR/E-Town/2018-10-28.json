they were and they saw an opportunity to make things a little better and they actually took the first step and did it and those steps almost always add up to something pretty special that's really the case this week\nUh we get to recognize these folks and best on their stories give them something called the treatment or near comes home and to tell you about this week's winner\nThank you Nick [noise] listen you're Judy less of San Francisco California turned us on to this week's story featuring mark gold of\nWell basically Berkeley, California but all over the world\nAnd work as a founder of a really cool effort called one hundred friends which was inspired by chance encounter with the Tibetan woman he met while traveling in India she had a simple ear infection but she was poor and could not afford the proper treatment\nSo by the time mark met her her infection had become so advanced that it was life threatening\nMark was able to secure antibiotics for her which saved her life\nAnd it cost him all of one American Dollar another thirty dollars bought her the hearing aid that then able to her to hear again and that's when he realized two things first\nThat so little money could go such a long way and second people were suffering and even dying in the world because of lack of simple resources Well Mark has been helping people in need one by one around the world ever since here\nWith us from person to tell us more about what one hundred friends is all about is our winner mark gold\n[noise]\nHey mark welcome thinks that's an amazing story they don't share with us about meeting the woman and being able to make such a big difference yeah amazed me too did you feel the impact of that transaction immediately did you just instantly know that you were going to have to explore this further\nInstantly right away it was like wow there's potential here now and then I had the idea I could go once a year twice a year\nAnd a eventually ah I wrote a letter to a hundred friends and then a couple of thousand dollars game in which is sixty thousand rupees and I started going every year and then eventually I Will eleven months a year\nWell so that first group of ... hundred French or did it and then you share the results of your efforts and then that group started writing to their friends is that what happened\nTalking ten percent of our donors are children from schools around the world and uh it just kind of grew from there and it's still going yeah you still just go to India where do you go no we've all over Asia we've been to Africa in the middle east but it's mostly Asia Tibet a Afghanistan Pakistan\nVietnam the Philippines well over sometimes is not money it might be taking them to a clinic right or some resources or something like that but I tell them this is not charity I'm going to help you and then you can do whatever you can to pass it on to help someone else and I have literally hundreds of stories\nOne would be quickly or a fisherman in Indonesia after the tsunami\nAnd he said I have nothing to give a lost my family that lost my vote\nI've lost my home I said do you ever have extra fish he said sure uh throw them away I said okay I'll buy you a boat will get you to materials to build a house and you promised me that when you have extra says she'll go your way to get away and I came back and actually met them a year later he was doing it\nWhile well basing and so this was all funded by the ... the word of mouth contributions from friends how big are the donations have bigger the contributions usually\nA about a hundred dollars a often around the holidays but all year round that comes in the smallest was fifty cents from a little boy that we actually do something with ... and up from there yeah\nAnd is it a pretty lean organization does most of the money go to the\nYou know to benefit these various communities around the world it's eighty five percent ... percent which is huge yeah yeah and then the rest just to run it yeah and when did you start this Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty nine was that day that you actually had the opportunity to help that women and he writes right wow how many people do you think you've actually helped so far\nWell if you include like schools were a whole school got school supplies to fix the roof it's roughly thirty thousand people thirty thousand people a lot of people [noise]\n\nWhen you say schools and other things have you actually built structures are facilities and some of these communities\nYeah we built about seven schools and created about thirty forty libraries well\nLot of the I'm a medical equipment that we just find out what is needed and then provide a bicycle a fix the roof that sort of thing leader brought one girl here from Tibet she's from a village and she's now got her college education and she's here working she's\nOn her way well so you still do these strips once or twice a year\nI go six months a year or I Will go longer but my wife becoming citizen so we have to be here six yeah [laughter]\nWhere did you meet your wife facilities seemed to fill up our first date was a garbage dump [laughter] well congratulations good these are all up hill from there yeah let me just remind our listeners about the name of the organization one ... one hundred\nRent and once you one hundred friends dot O. R. G. and I'm I'm willing to help anybody with information contacts anybody can start their own little project could be in their own community could be in Afghanistan\nAnd you really get to see the tangible results of your effort it's just so obvious you go to these places and you really make a difference\nYeah and I get off and go back and see the people many times\nWhat a beautiful story marvel thanks so much for coming out to share the story was in person congratulations winner this week see cheapen word Mr ... one hundred friends look them up on line and helping out that your goals [noise]\n\nOne hundred\nFriends got Edward G.

I mean we're both freshly out of Iowa and so it was a perfect place for us to\nKind of be free and we would just go down and play every night at this little place and we could do that here right\nAnd also I mean the Minneapolis you know it's like you want to go close to home but you want to go back where you used three [noise]\nSo that safe distance yeah spider John critter and\nTony Glover and these great Minneapolis now ... and this legacy of folk music you know from the time before Dylan on all the way through that kind of brought us to a new world of many and oh it's a\nBeautiful musical community Minneapolis yeah and um\nYou know I I Want to mention that on your new record you also included a judge who does\nReading a poem of is how did that come about what led to that being an addition on your record\nThat was a huge experience for as we actually drove south of Rapid City just today and we pass through costs Pine Ridge where I met John and got to hear him speak many years ago\nSomething about the honesty of his world view and the openness of it just Jewish so intensely and we always in the back of our mind just a man the kind of music we make\nWould be a nice backdrop for this message you know for these lyrics and I would never thought it would happen necessarily it seemed like worlds away and then in Minneapolis the American Indian movement\nWas started in the seventies and they had this strong presence and we met some friends of Johns and lo and behold we brought him to town to do a concert\nAnd he said why don't you pick a poem and writes music for will do something together and that was time dreams which just wrote it and it felt like it has existed for a thousand years and it was brand new at the same time\nYeah it was really special tissue just tuned in using the tone ear with David ... Ramsey from the pines [noise] um you know I have this idea that in watching small towns sort of lose energy you know I ... I suspect happens sometimes as people move away\nThan the natural world around them becomes louder and bigger and maybe you're a little more connected to I don't know if that's what happens there or not but\nMaybe a little bit but for sure our towns that we grew up gun unrecognizable and I think doing what we do in order like\nI don't think ... sort of like profound guys or whatever but I think if you sit around and and you have enough time to think which John tri del did mhm you know he started out in the American Indian movement but by the time when we brought them in Minneapolis and he was talking to his whole message it changed it was just like\nYour human you know and you're good enough in like the way we mine the earth you know we're mind in our spirits in our bodies and we forget that we're human and there's pollution from that just like there is from the pipelines or whatever right\nYeah and every every geography has their microscope and their telescope but when you're in Iowa and you're surrounded by farms that have become factory farms and there's not you can actually get any of that food\nAnd grow food for you right you know they're growing corn for fruit syrup and and all this stuff you know and it's it becomes is you know whatever you thought of as a context the life\nSlips on a dime and then you wonder why and then I think when we look for solutions the music is very important the music can offer solutions because it brings people together\nYeah [noise] and um because I Would get to have their primary so early like every politician goes and ... yeah for sure you know did you see when you were a kid but it always presidential candidates would always come every little corner of Iowa yeah for sure what\nDoes though I think as it develops your sense of humor in Iowa\n[noise]\nI remember and I'm not saying this to offend anybody but my grandmother was eighty five years old and she was washing dishes on our family farm in Iowa and she had told me stories about coming to see different presidents when they came through town a big deal that was today as a grandmother\nThat like I said north as day but as I said did you say was that if George W. Bush came to tell you wouldn't go see this you have to go see him as he was no liquor over\nI just do whatever your political feelings though that's a funny thing to say\nA very I Would say the sharpens your with you know\nLike the fact that our conversation is kind of like Iowa [noise]\nThere's a lot like it or you can drive through this conversation you might not kitchen you turn off of one of these wrote me a lot\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\nWell listen I I'm really again I really I really enjoyed the record I'm really glad you guys could stop by it's really fun with it back to the ... the pie\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nThat road Brad what you know sitting low\nAnd below ah the way\nYou know but a man to\nMan oh yeah Mm\nMe me and the way genes burn\nMuch man\nMeant yeah for me um how\nThat I Know they pay me\nMan man died", "show_name": "E-Town", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "28"}
