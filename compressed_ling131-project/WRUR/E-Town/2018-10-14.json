of your youth you're growing up at those traditions or whatever that was a bell definitely so is there more than yoga and love and bliss so was there was sort of structured ritual whatever\nWell my parents didn't run our household like an awesome or anything like that [laughter] it's pretty American I did learn what the fish pose was and the butterfly and I used to do handstands on the wall all the time and we used to stretch while watching TV you know what I mean it wasn't like\n... wouldn't meditate now ... tried to teach me how to meditate at a very young age but I'd definitely rejected it was like what I'm busy right now I Can't [laughter]\nBut it's been a brief onto your books right\nThere really wonder if people yeah they have the spiritual principles that they share which is great because you know I was taught in any deep truth is a really young person which I Believe fully like\nThere are many path to the same destination you know all the rivers lead to the same notion that kind of thing you the truth is one the passer many\nAnd it kind of made me open my eyes when I saw the different religious dogma that are out there and can just take the best parts and you can realize that we're all human and we all have parts of us that are not great but we all have parts of us that are great\nAnd all the religions I think have great elements to them and if you look deeply there's truth and light and beauty and bliss yeah\nUm I Do want to ask you about going to study music in meditation in India so you don't really recently where you go over there and to have a combination of silent meditation for a number of days and um music was\nSo it was January of last year\nAnd my husband Dominican I he agreed to go on this crazy journey with me really quickly I just suggested it and he said I'm Down and we we decided we'd take the first month of the year to rewire our brains or at least start the process\nSo it was a ten day the Pashtun and meditation retreat\nAnd no talking right so there's no talking you and your husband\nOh it wasn't just us like a hundred of us we were out in the middle of nowhere in like by a cow pasture in the field out in rural area I don't think this is what I'm Talking about like I wanted to experience the stuff that the\nLocals would be able to afford and go to and that was what we did and it was like he they hand you a wool blanket they say this is where you're sleeping and you won't see each other again for the next\nDays and okay that's it well give us your computer and your fiddle\nSo when you went from when you went from that\nMeditation retreat to study with a musical teacher did you find the words to act as a musician changed in some way or more open to hearing or listening or feeling music\nDefinitely I mean what we both just missed music so much and so after compassion and we went back to ... and met up with ten musician friends and\nStudied the scale systems of the one of the eastern ... practices and it wasn't necessarily the most popular lineage but it's a really a scientific one that explores every possibility of note creation which\nCan take a lifetime or three to really get too so it was just more like a foot in the door of a toe in the ocean of the possibility of creation I see\nAn feeling like we're gonna silly your reputation a little bit by playing music
