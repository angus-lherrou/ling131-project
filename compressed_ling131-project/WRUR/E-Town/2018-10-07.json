Jeff Gordon lousy key and from Hawaii rushed by a recording artist Jack johnson\nJoined me now and welcoming the what are you Nick force [noise]\n\n\nEverybody think and what could be coming home\nAnd we uh have got three guests\nWho are adventurers and we're going to get to go on a journey with our fellow travelers this week they are ah go into the four corners of the earth and reporting back to us through their songs they are noticing what's going on around them\nWe've got a filmmaker who literally went around the world looking at coral reefs we got an actor singer and poet who's chronicling her changing personal landscape we've got a world class surfer\nWho's also a filmmaker oh young musician too who has long been committed to the health of the oceans but he loves to play in [noise]\nAnd I think it was about Fifteen Years ago the first time the Jack johnson came to each town we'd heard about it from Ben Harper and um we discovered a common love of a guitars and music and we all share to desire really to try to lift things that make things a little better\nAnd that was the very beginning of his career course he went on to sell millions of records and a ... billion tickets do is live shows at arenas in huge Venus all over the world\nAnd he tapped into something real universal along the way something kind of accessible songs about love and friendship who's committed to the health of the oceans continues with the new film he's involved with any other new record also called all the light above it too\nSo please help me welcome back to eat Jack johnson [noise]\n\n[noise]\nOr to keep Nick up here to play much music with us today from the [noise]\nThe first the first song is about a when a reality t._v. show tries to move into your town and then\nYou and all your friends are too happy about it and then the producer of the show find do it a little community get together tells you maybe you should write the theme song for the show and ah you try to tell them they don't think it's very good idea\nAnd they persist and then you go home and you write this song [noise]\nTo the you know things like a cover shot right I don't want to be people over the head with it but I felt like that was a nice combination where it was um you look at it for a minute just beautiful colors all around my body on the thing and\nUh it takes you a second to zoom in and look and realize there are all little things that we have in our lives toothbrushes little bits of plastic all around me but it will come out of the ocean yeah yeah and stuff that's been there was all from the you know all that stuff was collected within a hundred feet right there it took five minutes just to bring all that\nThe only reason the beach was clean very worst 'cause we went after the tide was going on it was going lower tied\nAnd we're ... we're going to put out a video I think a couple of weeks actually of a time lapse of that shot being made ... we found the spot where there is no plastic but if we were to zoom out and look around\nOn the shore of any beach in Hawaii is just plastic like crazy I feel like growing up there and stepping over the high tide line as a kid and then watching the increase in the amount of plastic that's out there now I feel like I have to kind of tell that story\nHow do you deal with the tension between wanting to motivate and inspire and make a difference and knowing you you're there to entertain\nThe balance of it for me is making sure that it's a\nThere's a place for people that are shows and there's a conversation that can be had if people want to engage in that conversation but it's not forced on them so we have a place we called the village green and that's where we have all the nonprofit boots that are from that town so we try to find this balance where the air for people who want it and it's um\nBut it's not always coming from the stage and it makes it into a song naturally than I'm happy to sing that song sure but I find there's two different types of songs that have environmental issues for me there's ones that I'll sing in elementary school cafeterias\nThat are like single use plastic is not so fantastic we use it for a minute or two that sits around for a few thousand years maybe even more washes up on the show just bring your own bags to the store\nThere's no need to be such a fancy pants put down the plastic water bottle give the kids a chance to go to the next generation is grow when we got to be no it it will consume and we got to do with what we can do to reduce our ways and that's what I like I'll play a cafeteria [noise]\nLittle BFA in there but there are there like that idea says you know um are we to cynical here that song generally is that the now I don't think that maybe you know it's it also feels a little bit like a PSA I mean I use that term in a good sense but there's also\nThe version of it that I don't want the songs to feel like a public service announcement right so the other kind that I feel are even more important or things like I have a song called only the ocean ah for me it's about visiting my dad who is not here anymore but\nWhen I go on the ocean I feel his presence is where we spend a lot of time\nAnd it's about falling in love with the ocean and if I could remind people of that connection they have with the ocean let's say and if it helps to make people fall in love with the ocean or nature in general then people will protect the things that they love so in a way that's a different kind of environmental sound to me is is uh just remind people about sacred these things are\nTissue just tuned in you're listening to eat them here with Jack johnson you know your dad of course was a a really good surfer and uh\nYou know just sharing the thing with your dad being a surfer living in the ocean and being connected and and as you said you're talking about single use plastic items washing up on the shore you're involved with the film called smog and to see how that project come about\nIt was through those nonprofits there's one in particular five dryers are great group where I Love about them as they're just do a straightforward science they're going out and doing the data collection finding out\nHow much plastic is actually in the ocean so they go out with these trolls basically and they drag 'em next to the boat and I got to go on the trip for those guys and it uh it was something we're already doing working on trying to eliminate that single use plastic but it really made me more passionate after doing that trip and seen\nThe realities even when you're out there and the blue is blue association you know days out to see where you couldn't see land anywhere for days and the ocean was a couple of miles deep worry were and it was the blue is blue I've ever seen and\nWe put the thing and we'd wait for an hour and we'd say there's no way we haven't seen one piece of plastic there's no way\nEvery time in Florida and there'd be a handful of micro plastics in there you know so it's just very widely dispersed that's hence the name of the documentary smuggle the sea is depressing as it was to go out and learn a lot of these facts was also very uh encourage you to keep working on these things that we're doing it shows\nYou um you do have the ability to\nKind of connect the dots in ways that very few people do so I think it's really cool to a congratulations on your success thanks and be the fact that you're able to keep your values and and introduce those into your community in ways that are meaningful and not\nYou know you're not preaching you're nuts scolding you're inviting people to discover these things you're discovering and it's a delicate balance not a lot of people can pull that off half for sure\nWe'll look for ways to improve or what we're doing you guys are amazing I did a tour of the solar panels over the whole thing here and it's the whole ship is run an amazing well we'll keep trying I Want to mention one more thing before we go back to music I think you're one of the only people we've had on the show recently who has ever played on a Saturday Night live show that was hosted by Donald Trump
