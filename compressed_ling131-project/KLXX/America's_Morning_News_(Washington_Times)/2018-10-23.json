that what he's doing here is perhaps not throwing out the treaty maybe that's his first bargaining position and what he might be able to do is negotiate a better deal as he did with the NAFTA\nAh with Mexico and Canada you know we're pulling out of this so you have a chance if you want to come in and give us some better and better deals but it's hard to think how you could do this with the Russians because building up weapons and national defense there's a lot different from trade because you have lives at stake here\nSo the first thing we're going to do this morning before we take your calls and by the way our number is eight hundred seven three six three six six six and I want to know what you think about this\nAre you willing to trash a treaty and return to the old arms race in the past and put more and more billions of dollars into using weapons or to building weapons that hopefully we would never be able to or have to use or would you rather save that money for domestic needs build some new bridges in airports and training and infrastructure and\nElectrical grids which is your priority call us at eight hundred seven three six three six six six so now Fred pike and has been following this infrared is based in Moscow for us and he brings us up to date on what this is being said on both sides of the Atlantic on this issue\n[noise] or the U.S Russia headed for a new nuclear

if if we don't if you don't straighten up we're moving out of this and I hope that the ... the ... going to be able to figure out a way to stay within the trading\nMoscow denies it's reaching the ins and it turned blames America for violating it by developing missile defense technology\nWe don't get to target missiles used in the U.S to test the defense systems are identical to intermediate range ballistic missiles they exist and they are in use their production in the U.S could be a sign that I ended up prohibited technologies are in development\n[noise] several of America's European allies say they're concerned about the Trump Administration\nTo tend the deal fearing after decades of calm [noise]\nNuclear weapons research once again\nLot of concern among America's allies in Europe or other places as well of course a lot of anger here in Moscow and the tough meetings continue for the national security adviser John Bolton he is meeting none other than Vladimir proven himself today the Kremlin has already said who also wants them to exactly explain what the us plans to do how the U.S plans to move forward\nAll right thanks to front plate in reporting from Moscow for first flight this morning we are at Eighteen minutes before the hour on for like give us a call at eight hundred seven three six three six six six and you know this is not just the story between the United states and China\nI mean the United states and Russia China is also involved in this because uh right now U.S officials are the U.S has been relying on other capabilities to balance China and places like the south China Sea they're using missiles fired from ships or aircraft\nAnd are advocates for us land based missile response which would be prohibited by this say that's the best way to deter China and\nTheir use of their land based missile forces experts are warning that China would put pressure on countries in the region to refuse any requests from the U.S to position their missiles there China kind of like this whole thing because they say hey you know this this will allow us to to do a bunch of things and we're going to stop you from Beijing basing missiles in this part of the world and that would give them an advantage\nWe also hear from a Soviet the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev this morning he's the one who signed a deal with President Reagan he says that President Trump is being very very irresponsible and he fears a new nuclear arms race\nSo let's take you back now to December eighth Nineteen eighty seven president Ronald Reagan is in the East Room of the White House standing next to Soviet premier and Mikhail Gorbachev and getting ready to sign the treaty\nDid was over six years ago in November Eighteen Nineteen eighty one by first proposed what would come to be close to zero options was a simple proposal one might say disarming really simple [noise]\nUnlike treaties in the past it didn't simply codified the status quo or a news arms filled up it didn't simply talk of controlling an arms race for the first time in history the language of arms control was replaced by arms reduction\nIn this case the complete elimination of an entire class of us in a Soviet nuclear missiles\nAnd that brings us to today and by the way that the that treaty\nEliminated thousands of land based missiles or with a range of between approximately three hundred and thirty four hundred miles so that's a pretty big wide swath of a nuclear arsenal and as I said that brings us to today President Trump threatening to withdraw from the treaty would you like to see that happening are you concerned that that will\nTip the balance of power in the world will ... will eat up all the money that we need to rebuild our own country our infrastructure our bridges are

phone lines I mean really they're mad\nThat really mad at that people are running around right now and and I saw a flyer and one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you guys is is they're sitting there running around saying look at how much infrastructure we're going\nTo bring back looking at I mean we could we could we're going to bring back all these you your opponents talk about that while their their district the one they're they're paid to represent is losing highways shops\nRed Laurie how do you do that how do you say this and then the next day sale by the way the snow plows sixty miles away good luck to you well\nYou know they actually have to take ownership of the fact that they didn't keep the tea shops open they they say it was about the buildings they were older and stuff well how long these guys have been in office that happens then they're sixteen years Ken Pollack twenty Terry ones at Twenty one if those buildings are old and they can't hold the machinery\nIt said they didn't update it they they do not have a progressive thought where when it comes to emphasize director except to Joe dollars out at the last second hoping to buy if you hold\nIt and it shows that I mean they've got all of these cities all of this town is that now they're going to sprinkle this around in and say look what we delivered when their cause or the other way shops I mean this isn't brain surgery the the one thing government does need is a snowplow\nCounselor if we can get to work for ... all the great training you're doing developing jobs people skills those type of thing thinking they're going to be very good if you can't get to work\nThe exactly and to show up to my training events so I'm totally with their I'm Laurie I'm not one it's a little bit a few years too late but you know we really need to focus on how we can have continuous funding that at one time spent emergency spent but ongoing maintenance and that's why we're running as well we need we need to have folks in there with some\nNew ideas I'm with the truly restoring the voice of the people in Bismarck\nMarriage last year I got to ask you this your family has\nLong been involved in the fight to stop corporate farming in North Dakota\nThat's been something that I've known your family for for years uh when this all went about when the legislature started doing that and you know and you know Daryl lies from the north Dakota Farm Bureau was pushing and pushing and pushing this and it just I knew that North Dakota wasn't in favor of this\nAnd you said that's one of the reasons you're running what are you hearing from your constituents out there they must be awful upset that this almost got Graham down their throats\nSleeping knocking a lot of doors during this summer I'm about three thousand personally just us candidates alone and almost everyone well Seventy five percent of North Dakota this did not want a corporation farming but\nThe theory wanted to introduce the legislation um cricket when was the co sponsor and said Pollard voted for it\nThey knew that Seventy five percent of the people did not want it but they pushed to to any way I think they were had their own personal agenda and I'm afraid that if they get in what are they going to do next time if they're not listening to the people and they don't care what the people\nAnd so did they get a check for months after a cargo out this workout and in a way that's the whole ethics still number one is ever going to have\nIssues like that at when we come back we're going to talk about ah we're going to
