now the only level one trauma center between uh basically Minneapolis Seattle down to Omaha ... or Denver so when you look at the upper Midwest there were no level one trauma centers at all\nSo hall I mean you know how do you get to be that\nSo there's a lot of different things that you have to do um a lot of criteria to cause many years to get here but um you have to have certain specialties available of physicians you have to have trauma surgeons readily available so that is for seven twenty four seven so that they're there to respond and take care of an injury any injuries that you have\nUm you have to have things like you know adept of neurosurgery so lots of neurosurgeons so that they can cover each other for head injuries and that kind of thing um orthopedic surgeons who can take care of you know how it really really bad pelvic fractures\nThings like that you also have to um have a certain number of patients every year so that you um do a lot of of trauma and you have to do research about trauma\nOkay so you know one on one level\nFor me ready neurosurgeons not easy to have somebody at three in the morning being narrow surgeon and say yeah I'm here I'm ready with all due respect to the ... surgeons whoever you're sitting here talking to a guy to fake news\nAnd the guy that cut me up is actually my buddy but but you can find it I Would think orthopedic surgeon is a little bit quicker than you could find neurosurgeons how do you have enough here to meet the criteria\nWell you know when we began our journey the level one trauma and we just kinda laid out a timeline and said you know by this time we need to add so many trauma surgeon so many neurosurgeon so many orthopedic surgeon by this time of need to add some more by this time we need to add some more and then it's basically you know a recruitment process\nUm it is attractive for neurosurgeons trauma surgeons obviously ... to work in a level one trauma center and uh I'm so we've had great success and and bringing pace I'm bringing this position then\nWell and if you're the physician who my suspicion would be number one they're in it because they want to help people right and so it doesn't matter to them that it's three in the morning number two if you're a trauma center and you want to challenge yourself you're in a great place right now is it about facility at ... at all is well\nYou know we um we were able to plan that facility than you medical center\nOn for a level one trauma we could have gone for level one trauma and the old facility\nBut I'm really were able to build a huge trauma rooms with the capability that we need to everything we need state of the arts take care of trauma patients operating rooms that are large and I'm able with lots of technology and that kind of thing so it really did help to be able to build a new medical center\nRun out of actors of all this is this at all warned about getting them here quickly\nYes absolutely so and that's one of the reasons that you know with with a big hole in the middle of the upper Midwest with no level one trauma center and trauma we talk about the golden hour I'm so really when you have a traumatic injury you know a gunshot wound or a stabbing are really bad car accident or anything like that where\nUm you know there's bleeding and that kind of thing involved you need to get to a definitive treatment within the first sixty minutes\nAnd so it's important to have um a transportation process like Sanford airmen that we have like a cop again helicopter and it's also important and then just to be physically located close enough to be able to get injured patients and quickly\nWhat would this mean because I have a couple of buddies from down and the Forbes area which for them if they're going to go buy a pair of shoes tomorrow they're probably going to go to Aberdeen and and yet I live somewhat and the flight path between Aberdeen and you\nSo I see the helicopter going so what does this mean for the other facilities like in Aberdeen you know like an Alexandria like a you know I mean does with the close proximity to Fargo\nI mean what does that mean for other people trying to do what you're doing for a living\nSo what happens lots of times especially because we're so rural as that patients when they are injured end up going to an ... or ... in Alexandria and then they're transferred to us\nAnd so they would get to them say they will stabilize them as quickly as possible and then they would call for the helicopter to transport them to us so that we can get them as quickly as possible pressure so as its support for for the rural hospitals as well\nYour facilities amazing when those two gentleman from Ford so I won't user name but you know when when they were in at the same time on different floors I went visiting that day and and just hadn't been in there before I mean it's it's pretty awesome\nWe we're so fortunate and and with the community and the region so fortunate that that we were able to build such a state of the art facility\nUm and some of us that have been involved you know from the very beginning just it was it was for me I'm like the highlight of of my professional life to really be able to be involved in building such an awesome to\nSomeone my grandkids are my age they're going to be going oh yeah I mean they're just going to think of that as the way I used to years ago about my hometown area hospitals Susan Jarvis anything else we need to get out there so people know I mean in terms of jobs is has to be good for the community\nOh absolutely and you know we um there's so many things around becoming level one trauma center trauma ICU you know I see nurses things like that um that we've been able to build and and and it is a great thing for the community and um and really it's it really is all about making sure that patients get care quickly so that they have better outcomes\nYou know congratulations I mean it just shows what a metro area this has become absolutely ah that that people with the skill set that you just described\nWalk to live here yes because quite frankly they're marketable anywhere they Asia and I do instead of the fact that they want to be here says a lot about the community and the facilities so Susan thank you face coming on thank you so much when we come back\nJason ... is going
