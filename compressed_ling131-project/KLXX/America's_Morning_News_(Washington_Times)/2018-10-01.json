nominee Brett Kavanaugh so and the FBI is investigating now but at its\nMost basic this is not illegal situation is not really a court of law it's a battle for public opinion so how does an investigation fit into this let's ask retired FBI supervisory agent James deli James Bell\nSo people have said that it is it is not a court of law and they're they're a hundred percent accurate they are but look our laws are predicated on our social mores on our culture on or you\nKnow how we how we live as a society [noise] um I Believe as I Know every FBI agent every prosecutor beliefs that people are entitled to the presumption of innocence and due process I understand that this is a job interview it is not you know this is not a criminal case\nBut I just fear that going forward you know if something like this if you can make an allegation and he did it cannot be it cannot be substantiated we're going to move into a\nPretty dark place because nobody remembers that the FBI investigated it needed he'll charges back in Nineteen Ninety One they put together a report and the reports that they could not substantiate any of them\nThey interviewed people department of education where she and Clarence Thomas work they interviewed people at equal Employment Opportunity commission we're both them work and they could substantiate it it was given to the White House and obviously the proceedings move forward and Justice Thomas made it to the court\nBut people still recalled those days and say well people just didn't believe or order that she wasn't given you know\nShe wasn't taken seriously but no one gets the charges and that's going to be what's going to happen here nothing even if the FBI investigates is and nothing comes of this are not able to corroborate ... any of it I fear that\nYou know justice Kavanaugh is going to be is reputation stain or solely in perpetuity whether or not he makes the court that's a political decision and I don't weigh in on those things\nBut I think it is going to be not a good idea going forward if we move into this realm now where the presumption of innocence is taken for granted and we don't give people due process so that's just my opinion is an old\nSeasoned wise and FBI agent looking at this now as a as a as just a U.S citizen\nAnd I guess you have that right Andrea also injure appreciate the fact that you are speaking with the voice of experience retired supervisory FBI agent James ... coming up on six\n... they couldn't go on as long as it has to All right just laid out mounted a brass facts that\nEasy they're innocent or guilty of this a sexual assault that he's been accused of\nAll right thank you David in Washington ... she had to crawl quarter before the our good morning Jesse you are in the Lone Star state in mourning\nMourning they you're on the air sir Yes sir I wanted to say this is a ridiculous\nMan for this woman to be coming up with these charges thirty six years ago I mean it's just ridiculous\nI think I mean it it ... it is a long time but you know it seems to be the the generally accepted opinion now by people who study this thing's legal people people who work in the ... as health professionals mental health professionals\nAnd even most of society now is just coming to grips with the fact that this is how this kind of thing works that it takes for women a long long long time to be able to deal with this and come forward with it and so we know we may not those of us who have not suffered may not understand it but I think we have to appreciate it\nAnd that's where we are that's the that's the world we are in now and uh for better or worse that's the situation that the FBI has to do or even you know they're up against it because they've got to track down thirty six year old leads which is which is difficult they do have a bit of a road map now with the calendar and that ah\nThat ah the nominee a judge Kavanaugh turned over so maybe that will give him give a given some help so anyway thanks for the call appreciate it let's go up the coast of Massachusetts Good morning Richard\nHello Richard you're on the honor the money yes going well I think that the the uh\n... continue even if it goes tests the week I think that ah Christine Blasey Ford was incredibly credible and I ended them in the Republicans knowing they absolutely knew it and that's why they dispensed with the Arab prosecutor about asking questions\nThat okay we're going back and we're going to go after the\nDemocrats with a meat cleaver and talk about how this is a conspiracy but say six year thing or thirty eight yeah thank you know I mean all these priests accused seems a bit of push that accused of sexually molesting boys and a lot of cases that's twenty to thirty is\nAll or even more but didn't\nEnd so look ... none of that's not the way it works she's a woman and she was a very credible evidence a\nWitness and I but I certainly believe her and I think it's absolutely would posit that people have said we shouldn't ... you know we should just have the the low and and then put them on the court when in fact he may be somebody who are certainly somebody who attacked\nHer and he may have been involved in some of these other cases so I think they absolutely need to do the level best to investigate\nAll right appreciate the call let's go to South Dakota
