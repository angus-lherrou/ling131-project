emergency landing after the booster rocket carrying them into orbit for the international space station failed after launch\nThat's not good they were to dock at the orbiting outpost six hours after take off but the booster suffer the failure just minutes after loss and a rescuers did see a parachute descending with the vessel after the emergency so it looks like uh\nSo uh you know we are sometimes you have to apply different\nDifferent uh standards when you look at people from the past who don't live the way we do now Columbus was very much a man of his time do we take that into account it's a very very difficult thing now especially because schools have to figure out\nHow do we give a balanced approach to teaching about Christopher Columbus and then of course gets into the larger picture of how do we deal with the way white Europeans treated this continent when they got here and turned it into their own backyard never mind that there were people already here with their own culture\nAnd we just pushed them west pushed them west pushed them west\nKilled a lot of them subjugated others tried to wipe out their culture and of course on the other hand we created the United states of America so how do you balance all that how do you teach it what do you think your group tells us now about how Los Angeles traded in Columbus Day this week in favor of indigenous people's day Jim\nMichael it's a long time coming says Rudy or take the tribal president of the ... band of mission Indians a long time coming because he says it involves\nTelling the truth that hurt\nBy now most understand that Christopher Columbus did not discover America he wasn't even the first European to come here the Vikings arrived on these shores some five hundred years before but Columbus is credited for opening the door to European exploration colonization\nAnd says Ortega the exploitation of the land and indigenous people he says these are truth that are taking a long time to be recognized or take us as were many in our nation including our leaders these troops are hard to admit\nKnow how can someone who felt that there were so right all of them had\nFor many in our nation including our leaders these trees are hard to admit\nYou know how can someone who felt that there were so right all of a thumb had errors in their history\nAnd so into we remove that part from ourselves and those leaders and the theme of remove themselves and say okay this was an air and this was an issue and they cause\nPain and suffering for a group of people um and they can acknowledge that and then move on and then make those passage so it can be corrected and we can all game uh and and be livable among each other and that's what people are looking for is that acknowledgement\nAnd that's the idea behind indigenous people stay admitting that the European explorers and even the missionaries were not always right\nIn honor of the people who were here first dozens of cities like Los Angeles San Francisco Cincinnati to name a few and even entire states like Minnesota Alaska Oregon and Vermont scrapped Columbus Day for a day to honor Native Americans\nWe are now in a new generation and we can make things correct if we can admit to those errors and mistakes in the past\nOr take it says we can still acknowledge Columbus his contribution to the European influence here calling attention to a past presidential proclamation that said while we reflect on the adventurers who sought new heights we remember the communities who suffered so let us embrace the multiculturalism that defines the American experience Michael\nAll right thanks Jim ruby Eighteen minutes before the hour on first lied call us at eight hundred seven three six three six six six lines are filling up apparently people are interested in this subject\nI was doing a little history research a few minutes ago on this Columbus Day by the way was part of our reaction to the Ku Klux Klan\nA part of their anti immigrant or a efforts earlier in the last century and they were they were focused on Italians and then they focused on Columbus because he was Catholic he was a Taliban he was an immigrant sailing under the Spanish flag\nAnd so the ah Nineteen thirty for recognition of Columbus Day was seen as a loss for the Ku Klux Klan so history is so interesting anyway we'll be back with

that the further west you go on those and they're saying Joel do forget about state highway eleven\nUh and so when you get in from that folks to more to to you know that area actually it's before that\nA ... and then go west you're going to run into crap all and and we're going to get to a little bit later in the show\nHow\nHow this is you know the problem that we have now with the roads and and yes whether you can't control whether but how ridiculous it is to close the state highway shops\nI mean think about what happened here and what happens for those farmers who were trying to get a crop home and how important those roads are right now and we're sitting here debating whether or not to close state highway shocks if we can't afford that\nI mean you know ... so anyway that get the governor's take three to eight twenty two hundred that's his phone number called tell them don't closed down my state highway shops All right Jonathan Judge is in the house and he is running for\nMayor of the great city of Moore had Jonathan good to have you back on the news of is like you for inviting me Fisher okay how's your race going\nGoing well uh I feel like we're gaining a lot of traction uh people are still excited a and everybody's been giving some very positive feedback some very very blessed\nAnd some of your families and volunteers been going door to door at all absolutely\nAnd everybody's mean give me some very positive feedback some very very blessed\nYou in some of your families and volunteer has been going door to door at all [noise]\nAbsolutely that matters doesn't it it really does it I I think the more that you can build a personal relationship in upfront a face to face contact is always a good thing\nOkay so you know for people I've asked you this before but a lot of people are hearing you for the first time so I have to ask you again why are you running\nI'm running a because for one I Love my town I Love them or had a I have a have a variety of experienced volunteer in the community uh I've served on a city commissions I've worked in the community for years uh I've tried that a a a ... an attorney for a number of years working with the youth\nAnd so I'm running because I have a passion of my community and also I think when I learned through my experiences er and take him to another level\nWhat do you do you get the job somebody gives me the keys to what's going to be your main focuses mare\nBilly community and also with that would encompass also making sure that we have business growth economic growth making sure that our neighborhoods are a well kept\nA also continuing on high quality of life regarding our our city services so I Would probably want to empower a city staff and build a collaborative team or as we look for a vision towards our future\nYou know one of the things I've really noticed in my time a all coming to the communities and and being on radio here del Rey really put a focus on making sure more head is in a suburb of Fargo and and I just loved that about the current mayor I\nI did I Love the fact that she was willing to advocate point out the differences and point out what you have a you know how do you go on that what do you do to make sure that that continues to grow\nWell I continue to have have a very strong voice [noise] excuse me\nBecause I think what happens and I think I mentioned this uh and uh I have a video a all three candidates do on the Morehead talks a show and that you know we're very loyal to our community I mean the people who I talked to will always\nTry to spend their dime in Morehead before they cross the river and those businesses who appreciate that also intern give back and volunteer and give economic resources to our Morehead based groups\nWell I think that's important I mean first off Morehead isn't some small communities second off it's growing\nYou know so how do you do that I I had um I had a good friend that I worked with for years moved to Morehead he told me it was the best thing ever did taxes wise school why she loves the school system there and he wasn't beating down any other school system but for his two girls Morehead was a perfect fit Johnson\nAbsolutely and [noise] excuse me and I think we need to build upon that those those things that that you just mentioned a I mean not many people can boast that we have a national champion a speech you know what team I mean ... and we have that in Morehead I mean our our academics\nArts um our program's really our second to none in the community and so I think that that's going to resonate that's a part of our more more his story that's going to resonate with a lot of people who are looking for a place to live\nI think you're right I I think that you've got some a great story to tell a there's no question about that in fact a cow they were doing this ah right here right now and and we're pretty tickled that more engineer is a is sponsoring a you know on point with Derrick what point so we're going to have an opportunity to do just that\nI'm just saying I got to ask you something because politics can be a dirty game I I I've got to put this out here a and by the way that are on point with Derrick a low point courtesy\nWednesday we'll hit that again but Jonathan yesterday it was made aware by a a student from MSU him and by and a member of the Morehead City council who is who is not on the costs are currently that\nThe the polling places\nHad changed and it had changed through the the Morehead City council and that changed by by a consent calendar\nThat didn't change by a public vote in the sense that hey this is up in front of full view of the public you know very few people\nAre going to go in the consent calendar and look at those routine things and say okay this is something to do this because there's a reason for consent calendar its its months and months out here's how we deal with it let's vote on it so we don't take all the oxygen in the room and we focus on the big issues\nThat's the reason for consent cutter um they put in in ... del Rey Williams was in the hospital okay\nThe acting mayor at that\nMeeting was your opponent Brenda Elmer that was put on the consent calendar to change these voting precincts\nAnd so by a vote that night of the Morehead City council that was enough for public debate and I would argue this Jonathan that not every councilmember read because there are so many routine things in there this this past\nAnd it's going to change the face of this election those students are going to have a much harder time voting\nOr in your not everybody has a car and they took away their polling place and and get this they put a polling places you know down at blue stem\nBlue stem I mean what ... that's ridiculous that you would have people go to vote at blue stem\nIt's not just south of more head it's considerably south of what goes on in Morehead so how do you counter that I mean\nThis was clearly a base of support for you a young ambitious base I mean John assumed that the truth is you're running against a couple of diehard Republicans Brenda ... Republican and I'm not trying to inject just party into this but she is she lives in the ... Republican circles I saw her at\nThe state capital kind of hiding away in a room was Shannon roars or you know from ... out in Bismarck you know doing the double secret meeting on on how they can plot about all that stuff\nBut my point is the ... how do you deal with that\n[noise] [noise] okay [noise]\nThere was a lot of things that will come into that [noise] that I'll have to break down but I Will tell you this full disclosure and you know\nI found out about the about all this talk probably about ten o'clock last night because I was uh in my office during my day job trying to catch up on that so it wasn't until I went to a friend's house to have some piece of patrol pizza\nThat I've found out that all this was going on and so\nYou got to listen to capture the story broke here Matt [laughter] hard and all of the ... did a great job I was working I was in court if you're if you're doing a job as a lawyer I'd write you know I Know\nI Know I Know uh so I think how I Want to break it down this way\nSo\nBefore I or when I started my campaign I have talked to I wouldn't necessarily call this person a friend but an acquaintance that I see on a routine basis and I asked him about what some of the challenges worm overhead and this was back like I said months ago\nHe was he did not approve of the polling places being on campus and this was a voter\nAh and he said that his concern was that he felt that students should not be able to influence local elections because they don't have a vested interest in you know the referendum spawns things of that nature\nSo that was a point with him that he would probably make his decision or who he was all for based on that so I let it live because I was still doing the education process", "show_name": "America's Morning News (Washington Times)", "year": "2018", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "11"}
