that's my parents\nMy my question is is my dad is Seventy five years old\nStill work the work and the steel plant\nMakes up for fifty to six fifty a week um [noise] about couple of years ago he got sick I found out that he hadn't paid he's behind\nOn a lot of itself had a somehow ... got a fifty thousand dollar loan\nFrom the bank and ah he doesn't have them attention he gets about Fifteen hundred and some of the security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do\nAt this stage for him um I Do provide him so I took over other bills and I did provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that for him to buy food\nAnd what are you doing with the rest of the bat I'm Sorry what are you doing what the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying on and on paying all his bill the sale has about a Fifteen\nK left on the equity ... two thousand on a credit card mhm\nEight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd how much are you able to put on the edge [noise]\nI'm putting everything\nWas a turning out to honor [noise] everything on on the that much money does that amount to\nWhat is it\nA month [noise] mhm [noise]\nI think it amounts to about [noise] four thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nIf you will have on the car eight on the house and chew on a credit card\nOkay All right and it ... you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done and the year [noise] okay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a dead an ear right\nYour ankles get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and they still work in a steel plant that I understand that right\nYes that was going to come a moment and it will come suddenly that he just can't do that [noise] and I'm afraid of my prayer is at least that he gets through this year mhm\nAnd that way you that free and if he's a hundred percent that free house and everything you can probably make it on a Social Security if you had to\nWrite okay mom yeah not ideal not what we want but we can probably get there and uh\nThen the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get debt free than let's build an emergency fund a three to six months of expenses but we get past that than let's start building some mistake for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement is to clear that dead and to have that emergency fund and Bush\nIf I'm unemployed\nAnd he is still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay my parents get asking if a bank loan um come run at his age the K Anna ... you know four and a and it could be paid off and twenty forty three and knowing that\nHe went to live that long\nWhen two reasons one is they're stupid\nAnd the second reason is is they're counting on the house I've got a lien against the house right now that there\nAnd show the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on that upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is you know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry\nI mean they'll they'll loan anybody this were either not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nAnd ... and so the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes we will go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it was like no they would've offered a dog that credit card\nSo I mean and dead people get credit card offers so it you know it doesn't mean anything it doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off or it can happen so I mean you can be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how are you\n... I got to require retirement OK\nI'm here about a year ... and um I have to have a while we pay off for the good mhm I quickly there are at fifty two it'd be better to file for Social Security and weight while before it starts with a a cake for we pay for\nThe whole entire movie or\nYou can run the math out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it to see other words if you wait from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more than a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes up you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking after four O. one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier\nUh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation\nOh that would definitely say\nThat well [laughter] yeah so you got you got to kind of gas and you got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... deaf age of a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that and those numbers included infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety according to the stat tables right now\nAnd think through in the process so good question man thank you for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Todd is in New Hampshire I taught how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you better than I

Nineteen fifties\nThe U.S incarceration rate wasn't especially distinct in fact it was in between incarceration rate of Finland and Denmark\nSo this has been a decades long process to get to this title of the world's incarceration a leader and started really in the seventies eighties through the nineties and it was mostly due to political changes policy changes in terms of\nChanging mandatory sentencing so crimes that previously didn't carry a prison sentence having a mandatory sentence extending the life of sentences\nRules like three strikes laws where a third convicted felony could lead to for example in California twenty five year to life sentence these changes in how we punish certain crimes are the main factor in the rise of mass incarceration\nAnd says that now there are about to

E. they've got football they got cheerleaders\nCheerleaders they guy lockers man if I could get over to middle school I'd be happy then you remember that\nSaid I'm One that fall thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nA few years ago I resigned our children I'm from Florida prepaid college planned and my husband and I were both making more money at\nThat time and since then our income has gone down and we added another child and we've gotten into our credit card debt and they had a ... now\nAnd we can take the money out there even over the past three years without the chili that or certainly ... path right that can lead that money and continue contributing to their\nHow much is in there [noise] um about eighty six hundred eighty six hundred dollars and how much do you own your car we gotta kinda runny and what do you own your credit cards off by that time\nAnd um are you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nWe started at ... and that's and I realized that he got out of order like having that Peter Pan ... I don't know like a good point gotcha okay I'm\nIn your household income as well [noise] um has been explained high and I have a small business that Frank and about Trump out in the year\nOkay so about sixty thousand give or take All right [noise] yeah um no I Would not cash would stop adding\nTo it um and um you do need to get on a budget and follow through with what you're learning in financial ... University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to its you'll be fine the other thing I probably wouldn't do a new emergency\nAh no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of their enroll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college and a five twenty nine or an E. S. A. in mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plants here is the reason anytime you pre pay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\nAnd so if I prepay a an item I pay a thousand\nDollars and increases in price to twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right\nSo how much of the increase in price because that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an interest rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now tuition for the last\nSeventy odd years as average about seven point two percent\nInflation right\nSo that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent\nAverage annual return over that same period of time minded and so are you make more\nBy putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is a ... and it's a blanket\nStatement but ... and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans and the process I mean they're just horrible administrators\nNow some states are well run my state happens to be well run show in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration\nWith a with the stability of the final still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say a row you already six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned to call to vacation because you're broken you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card\nDebt so you're\nOn track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthews whether it's in Fort Worth Texas hey Matthew how are ya\nI Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas hey Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent or want to thank you first off or a a ... I was going through ... for the last seven years and we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ...\nMy question because this was a wonderful thing it's fixing that happened or we were at my family my parents have received an inheritance of mineral rights in West Texas mhm a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a few oils but not not a tie mhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter]\nOr over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell ... and cash out or hopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom and we want him out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly\nMhm [noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual ah oil prices that sustain a drilling a and and that's one of the reasons west Texas is struggling right now prices are so far down that there's no boom okay I mean when gas was five dollars a gallon it was a boom baby him I mean\nBut uh and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue\nAll of that to say uh I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all they get just about everything I Know just in a [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more uh I'll let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell all those at all or none\nNo it's not an all or none ah what do you it's it's a centrally or they're looking at the three million for all and uh and uh or you know obviously one point five for half\nOkay so you just don't want ... [noise]\nYeah and my biggest concern is a risk yeah and we are not oil people\nYeah I think the only thing I'm asking is women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling house\nWe're deciding on how much to sell\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it would I go by oil rights with it my answer would quickly be no mainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay\nBut that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars by the middle kitchen table would I go go by our rights in West Texas with it if the answer is no then it's time to sell\nFor the same reason I say you know that you wouldn't know why and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know when we're afraid the stock market crash\nWell it might but I got to tell you start getting less rock markets less risk than drilling holes\nYeah we're a hundred percent sure that you don't ... I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be all persons to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just sell like years off\nUh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just felt like yours off\nYou know this is I'm I'm helping or my mother and father and I could have said\nOh I see so it's just that they they can make the decision for the whole thing or not yeah All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least sell Seventy five percent of it\n\nI probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they're just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death so phone ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that you know if it struck out right after I sold it I regret it the rest of my life\nYou know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that\nSome advisors set of families entire portfolio three million dollar networks we caught\nI wouldn't do that personally and if somebody asked me\nAs a financial coach should they do that I Would say no\nI Would take the majority or all of that\nThis is the ... [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\n\n\nMm Mm\nMm Mm\nMm Mm\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nMhm\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nFirst reading genesis chapter two verses Eighteen to twenty more than the lord God said\nIt is not good man should be alone\nI Will make him a helper at just part of the ground the lord for every animal that deal in every bird of the year it brought the to the man to see what he would call the\nWhatever the man called every teacher that was it ... the men get names all cattle and\nAnd whatever the man called every living creature that was his name the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of the air into every animal of field but for the man there was not a ... was was not found to help her as a partner\nCivil war caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man and he slept then he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh\nAnd the ribs that the lord God has taken from the man he made it into a woman and brought her to the man than the man said\nThis outlast his bone of my bones and flashing lights flashed this one she'll be called woman\nFor out of man this one was taken therefore a man who leaves his father and mother and claims to his wife and they become one flashed the word ...\nOur song today is ... please read responsibly oh lord our sovereign how majestic is your name and all your\nYou set your glory above the heavens out of the mouths of babes infants us founder ball work because of your froze to sign as the enemy and the avenger one I look at your heavens the work of your fingers the moon and the stars that you have established\nWhat are human beings that you are mindful of them more than that you care for them yet you have made them a little lower than God in crowned them with glory an honor you have given them dominion over the works of your hands you put all things under their feet all\nSheep and oxygen and also the beast of the seals\nThe birds the air and the fishes or see whatever passes along the pads and the sea\nOh lord our sovereign how majestic is your name and all the urine\nPlease stand for the gospel averse\n\nGospel is from Mark Penn versus two through sixteen some parakeets came in to test and they ask\nIs a lot of for a man to divorce his wife he answer them\nWhat the Moses to manage it they said Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of dismissal into divorce or\nBut Jesus Says and because of your heart and his heart he wrote this demand for you but from the beginning of creation God made them male and female for this reason they managed to leave his father and mother it'd be joined to his wife and the two she'll become as one flush so there are no longer to about one flesh\nTherefore what God has joined together let no one separate then in the house the disciples ask him again about this matter he said to them whoever divorces his wife and Mary's another commits adultery against their initiate divorces her husband and married and other she commits adultery\nPeople were bringing the little children to him in order that he might touch them and the disabled spoke sternly to them but when Jesus was indignant and said to them let the little children come to me do not stop them for just two such as these that the kingdom of God belongs\nTruly I tell you whoever does not receive the kingdom of God is a little child will never answer it and he took them up in his arms in late hands on them and blessed and the words at all or\nWe used to be seated\nUp in his arms late hands and then it blasted the word liberal or like\nWe see that\n", "show_name": "America's Morning News (Washington Times)", "year": "2018", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "07"}
