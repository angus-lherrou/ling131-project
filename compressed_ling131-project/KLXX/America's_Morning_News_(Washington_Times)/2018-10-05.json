[noise] well uh you know if that\nCould cause them to change the hours and fly him back I mean that anything could happen we've had situations before they hold held a crucial floor votes open\nFor hours and hours while they're waiting for a senator to fly back home district oh one one such case a senator a lost a parent a pet ... passed away it was at the funeral and they waited for him to come back on their plate so do you have\nTo yeah so you know um this is a this is a ... situation and I'm getting stranger by the minute\nYeah he he said here and I quote a that a GOP leaders caught have literally not said how they will manage his absence for the vote now the clock is ticking so they actually have a schedule that they're supposed to follow so we have a I guess a tell us about the first procedural vote today\nThe first procedural vote isn't about five hours for now and\nEr here on the east coast five hours from now\nYes yes and uh it it's called cloture it's procedural it's a ah it's\nIf what they can go to the final vote and culture is basically a motion to end debate\nIn other words it sets the parameters for the debate set the hard in time and the heart and time is thirty hours they like to say thirty hours posts cloture rise if we do the math that means that the final vote then after the thirty hours will come on\nSaturday but now with the steep Dane situation or that kind of throws a monkey wrench into the whole\nThing maybe now they're going to be doing the wedding during the Saturday morning brunch or something and hop on a plane so the thing about cloture votes is now it happens I mean it's not it's not like a regular thing but it does happen often enough where they have to be concerned\nThat somebody might vote for cloture just to move the process along but not then go vote the way the leadership wants them to on the final vote so it's possible we could see\nYou know all the Republican senators vote for cloture just to keep this process moving and then maybe still vote against Kavanaugh when it comes to the final vote so maybe people shouldn't get too excited about what happens today\nThe only thing that would uh be very interesting in terms of culture of keeping in mind what you just said is if they don't get enough votes\nOr ... when it fails ... then what is the what do they do have to Venice just isn't just over at that point\nIt is over at that point they cannot proceed to a final vote if they do not get cloture first\nNow you've been up on the hill and you've been I guess a feeling the feeling the heat and all the uh the strife up there and the tension now\nI've heard some people say that the Democrats want this thing over more than the Republicans do do you get that feeling\nI think everybody's tired of it um I think that the Democrats are are in a situation now where they're still vehemently opposed to this nominee that if if he does get confirmed that they can use that in the midterms\nI'm as a campaign rally if he doesn't get confirmed they can use that in the mid term says campaign\nRecover well it seems like a this whole nomination thing is turning some Senate races around and it may cost them there was a small chance but they at least I've had a shot at taking control of the Senate if seems to be hurting that because it's turned out the Republican base the Republicans their their\nEnthusiasm are used as him grapple Democrats as pretty much closed which means that\nIf you are in some of those swing states they'll probably not swing this time if the Republicans turn out as much as the Democrats will\nAnd maybe they're just hoping that people will forget about this and go back to being complacent by the time or the election comes along [noise]\nWell yeah I mean anything is possible that it seems like you know this whole thing has energized both the conservative base of the Republican Party and the Democratic base of the Democratic party because they really really are very emotional and have very strong feelings about the situation\nCylinder we're coming up at about sixteen before the hour or so I Want to quickly have you describe how this a reading of this and it's not really an investigation it's really just a supplemental investigate a supplemental background check report it's not really an investigation they just took some information of course the Democrats say well you did an interview about twenty or thirty people who are witnesses and have things to say\nSome of these people have actually been calling in and writing and trying to get in our waving hey FBI over here you got to talk to me I Know stuff and the FBI of course did not do it not because they probably didn't want to but because it seems as if we're getting conflicting reports\nThe White House is saying that well you know there was a senator has told us to to do and who to interview and the senators are saying we had nothing to do with him so we'll\nWe'll find out when the books are written what's the what the story is there but but tell us how when this information was transmitted up to the U.S up to the Senate what senators have to do to see this\nIt's a very unusual situation or because of the uh heightened emotions in this particular nomination they've decided that the senators uh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we're softer fatter
