because I I'm applying for other jobs I've been applying since you know I lost my other one [noise]\nKimberly welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDay thank you so much for taking my call sure was hot [laughter] that's my ...\nMy my question is is my dad is Seventy five years old\nStill works He works in a steel plant makes not\nFor fifty to six fifty a week um about couple of years ago he got sick I found out that he hadn't paid he's\nBehind on a lot of itself had a somehow got in a fifty thousand dollar loan\nFrom the bank and ah he doesn't have them attention he gets about Fifteen hundred and some of the security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do\nAt this stage for him um I Do provide him took over all the bills and I did provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that for him to buy food\nAnd what are you doing with the rest of the ... I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying on and on paying on his bill ... has about um Fifteen\nK left on the equity ... two thousand on a credit card mhm eight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd how much are you able to put on the edge\n[noise] I'm putting everything\nWas a turning out to do everything on on that much money does that amount to what is it\nA month [noise] mhm [noise]\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get the right\nTo aid on the car eight on a house and chew on a credit card\nOkay All right and it you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done and the year okay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a dead an ear right\nRankles get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and they still work in a steel plant that I understand that right\nYes that was going to come a moment and it will come suddenly that he just can't do that and I'm afraid of you know my\nPrayer is at least that he gets through this year mhm and that way your debt free and if he's a hundred percent that free house and everything you can probably make it on a Social Security had to\nWrite okay mom yeah not ideal not what we want but we can probably get there and uh\nThen the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get debt free than let's build an emergency fund a three to six months of expenses but we get past that than let's start building some mistake for retirement but the fastest way to build a mistake for retirement\nOr just ... and he is still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay that sounds good I'm asking if a bank [laughter] now [noise] um come run at his age K. and uh you know four and a and it could be paid off and twenty forty three and knowing that\nHe wasn't that long\nWhen two reasons one is they're stupid\nAnd the second reason is is they're counting on the house I've got a lien against the house right now that you know\nAnd so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on that upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is you know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry\nI mean they'll they'll loan anybody this were either not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nOn ... and so the industry is you're stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it was like no they would've offered a dog that credit card\nSo I mean and dead people get credit card offers so it you know it doesn't mean anything he doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off or it can happen so I mean you can be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've\nGot to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how are you\nOn that empire they've got to require retirement okay\nI'm going to hear about a year ... and I'm well thank you and then I'll have a four weekends off of what you good mhm I quickly there are at fifty two it'd be better to file for Social Security and weight while before we take for we have for\nThe whole retirement age\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it see now whereas if you wait from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know and what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes up you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking after four O. one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation oh\nThat would definitely say that [laughter] yeah so you got you got to kind of gas and you've got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... deaf age of a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty is higher than that because that and those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety according to the stat table right now and so um\nDrew in think through in the process so good question man like you were joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Todd is in New Hampshire I taught how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nWell I'm I which I when I spoke to the lady she said I could ask your question and I just got the starter pack off of your website for myself for my for my daughter who's thirty one I'm fifty two and\nUm I've been a dreamer I guess for a free spirit is you would say from listening to your show addictive Lee now for the last two weeks [laughter]\nI Know who you were before that it's All right but um my wife and I sat down and we've never been able to agree on money um she's the shaver um the spender and just I don't you know I don't know what the money situation is where I go and spend it [laughter]\nAnd um [noise] five we've set aside step one we've got a thousand now we've put aside to the shaving she wants to say more than that but [noise]\nShe I'm she's always ran the show and I've been kind of just kind of go along with her at this point um we paid off to credit cards and we paid off on the credit card my question is is\nBy doing so many things right now I'm In the one thing I'm concerned me it's about down the road is my retirement and I worked for a company for Fifteen Years and I've got\nAbout

agreement that we're going to work this plan together okay and want you to do that then you're first gold you squeeze out of your budget as you say but that was in dollars if you've already got money

it wasn't it was John Wesley on Martin Luther what am I thinking was famous manual is I got that part right Wesley said\nIf you'll give ten percent and saved ten percent and live on eighty percent you'll always be okay and you know there's not a bad formula but that's also putting God first few seconds and then living on eighty\nAnd figure figure out there to live on your income after you're giving in you're investing and you'll always that money that part is accurate and then we you know we have involved that a little bit of the baby steps where when you're on baby step one you don't do anything to you save a thousand dollars in baby steps to you're not saving any money and baby step too including stopping all your investments temporarily\n[noise] because you're completely doing your debt snowball and you're focusing on the debt why so we can save more later so that's the technical parts of the answer but in general you've got to put your giving and you're saving at the top of your list at the top of your\nLife priorities because you're gonna have a better life if you always give him safe\nOf speaking baby steps Wesley formula whatever you're going to do something along
