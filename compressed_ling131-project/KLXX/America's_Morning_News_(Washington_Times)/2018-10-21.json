something the point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business is the point is not the business\nThe point is what the kid is learning\nThey're learning work they're learning interface with customers and how to treat people ah they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality\nThey're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit the capitalism is not evil ... that these are the lessons are what is important\nTo understand the accurate or if she make some money that's just a bonus\nRight but what ... what are you what do you identify as you've identified the way this kid is wired\nAnd a lot of us that are entrepreneurial are are a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much you know pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know since\nI'm sure you know but I ... if you start may start to make a hundred thousand dollars a year or something you

eighty thousand a year spread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of colleges of same costs it's just not and it's the number one mistake people make when they don't\nHave a lot of money in a kid is going off to school it draws people in the student loan debt 'cause they simply go to school we can afford and as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars in student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education\nThat puts a curriculum and the high schools and in the colleges across America we are now and forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stuff of staying out of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nAnd what happens from time to time as the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come along side in the community of business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations and personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've had about four million students go through one of the coolest things that's happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it dang dang touchdown baby that's how that happens the\nCollege university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good now Tyler Moore is with me on the line and\nTile is from the University of Wyoming he's the associate vice provost of enrollment Kyle White uh go man thank you for doing that\nWell it's a it's a pleasure to be with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday

grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the satellite so like you were cheaper than my University of Tennessee you're you're cheaper than the University of about ... dot that's correct wow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was behind this\nI immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you where am I doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nThat so that our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys we're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enters fear we're talking about a curiosity independence of boldness\nAt pursuit adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and books for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people examples by the spirit of the underdog\nYou know it's not a cowboy isn't\nWhat you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right that's correct your football\nTeam your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so as as good I play on words but you you guys got you got to the table first for this way to go man I Love it it's a great motto\nOr does it says so much in unjust are so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you gotta sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is it going to have\nAs of coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool Kyle thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are a state that is very practical where state that very\nMuch um applicable in terms of being smart with our money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the rains the education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're\nYou know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that I'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college\nBecause sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line\nI've talked to a lot of Provo is around the country I'm my own chancellor and vice chancellor of the ... Tennessee and it's a constant thing and then ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nSir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in\nTheir own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state but you have to be\nSmart you have to do your due diligence in that process at searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition Doctorow ranting institution\nWe are near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south\nWe can be a solution that provide students an incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping\nA student be successful not just students success and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nI meant so how many students on your campus\nWe have we have a little over a twelve thousand so it was twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that are called himself cowboys\nNow that's a good size school it's not too big and small and so that's something that's just right those are ... just right very cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again rather thank you for coming on with us\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and ah we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nAnd I love it I Love the motto and I think the world does need more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a little picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but a bottom line is lesser mascot and so now it's ah that's very cool stuff I Love it\nAnd what a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high school now if you're a business or a university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the states some states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know but uh um\nYou know maybe you just want to do it to be to the hospital used to go to\nUm I went over spoke to them in the
