constitutional right to citizenship for babies of non citizens and illegal immigrants born in the United states now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order Trump made his comments

the fourteenth amendment pretty clear\nThe fourteenth amendment ratified in July Eighteen sixty eight reads in part all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction

Bush and and that was in large part because Ross Perot was in there yeah\nAnd and so it was like well what do you expect you have a very popular third party candidate if you look at an area I go deer hunting and they always proudly look at me because they don't have a Democrat\nThey'll look at me and go to Ross Perot did better\nAt an area I go deer hunting and they always proudly look at me because they don't have a Democrat they'll look at me and go to Ross Perot did better near man out here [laughter] exile laugh but in a way I realize there wasn't two votes cast in that\nBut the more candidates you the argument that you can't have enough votes to have a majority I think isn't always that important is my point\nOf it yeah so number one it's important to understand that there isn't always the majority in a population on you could just have a voters voters and see voters and there's just no one group that gets over fifty percent and so that's certainly possible population but\nUm it's important understand that sometimes there's overlap between those candidates in between those groups and they need to be able to show that there is overlap show their support fairly to the groups that they support\n'em and he brought up Clinton a pro and Bush I mean we also look at a Gore Bush and nadir in two thousand [noise] um I Believe even Teddy Roosevelt was considered to have you know kind of a third party things going on around with the bill is a party or\nNot I think and and and tell me if this is another example of really what you're trying to get at um you can have for house members running for two spots okay yeah when I really wanted a one person to to end up in the legislature\nI'd only vote for one sure 'cause if I voted for too you know I really was taking away a vote from the one who weren't taken away\nFrom the one but you're we're saying you know you know we can do and you're just saying I'm willing to have either that's all you're doing you're you're still a strong voter yourself as much power as anybody else is still one person one vote one person one ballot but your just saying you know what I Would be okay with multiple candidates\nEither one doesn't matter like I don't know about you but when I vote I care about the policies that these people have not necessarily the specific politicians\nAnd if they have policies that I Want I'm going to vote for him and if they don't I'm not going to and that's what it should really come down to I shouldn't be forced into these situations where it's like well they're all these politicians that have these ... policies that are like which one's the one that's going to win which one's the one that I'm going to vote for to not throw my vote away\nI I don't want to do this lesser evil thing every time\nWell let me explain to my position when it came to my example for people running for two spots in this case for people running for two positions in the state legislature calling themselves members of the house if I vote for one uh and the other one let's say I vote for two\nAnd that the number two is not my favorite Okay Number one is my favorite but number two beats number one because that individual got more votes obviously yeah than I have no business voting for number two fair\n... if you don't actually want them to win then yeah don't do it that was my point yeah and I absolutely agree with that if there's only one person you might just vote for one but if there's multiple ones who like you should be able to vote for him\nIt's still up to you it's still up you to be educated still up to you to make that determination that individual decision of how you're going to vote but\nIn the end because my phone's he likes to be able to vote for him if there's only one you like this vote for one\nIs this a lazy way to vote I think we really not a whole lot I can go in and I can not do my homework but just go in and say oh I like him I like her I you know okay I didn't have I Want to be able to run into that person and say I voted for you solve all for sex symbol\nOf if they're actually six that you think would be good and governance than vote for sex but I don't think most of us out here voting they're going to do that we are going to look at the policies that these politicians have I Know she's saying\nOh this is the situation of a lazy voter well a lazy voters going to vote for the person that they've heard of probably anyway so you know it still comes down to working hard as a candidate\nIm out there to get your policies known among the populace and it's still up to you as a voter to make an informed decision when you vote\nJet land is our gas he's a band the organizer behind approval voting that the genesis of the debate on approval voting here in the Fargo community yet tell people how they started\nAll right um so we have a special election for a single seat and twenty Fifteen for city commission on the winter there one with four or five people not voting for him\nOn the following year uh we had a regular election um the winters there are seven oh ten people didn't vote for the first place finisher seven ... did not vote for the second place finisher\nUm after that task forces foreign ministers Tony garr again Tony Greenberg I was a member of the task force we met a dozen times we had two recommendations to go to the people at the ballot box one was increase the size commissioned by to the other was switched to approve of owning\nThe commission declined to refer either of those to the ballot boxes so we took it upon ourselves to do a ballot initiative in order to get this onto the November ballot and we succeeded and while we were collecting things we had another election\nWhere seven ten people didn't vote for the first place finisher seven all tend to not vote for the second place finisher\nAnd we believe that\nIt's not fair to the people to not know if our leaders have a mandate and it's not fair to the leaders because they can't honestly claim that they have support of a lot of the people either\nSee I'm not big into forming commissions if I'm not going to listen to them yeah and so I struggled with that I'm not going to lie to you or they certainly should have taken a position whether or not you know yes or no themselves on some of these issues instead of our we're not going to listen to the commission or\nLet's it's obvious that um they expected us to recommend different things and we didn't recommend those I can tell you don't have to but it is held more like they wanted us to be a rubber stamp on their ideas than to actually do our own homework to our own due diligence\nAnd come up with ideas or after our hours this study and they just weren't happy with it and they decided not to refer to the ballot\nOkay out of your commission as I understand it if I'm wrong you go ahead and correct me jet ... out of your commission though the ... the one thing that was unanimous was expanding\nThe city commission threat to the one that wasn't unanimous was approval voting why did you feel passionate enough as a group to take approval voting out get the signatures and get it on the ballot and not the one that you picked unanimously\nAlright so first off I'm five out of seven or did vote in favor of a referring to the ballot plus I'm just recently the one or the other members who didn't vote for it came out and said that no actually he changed his mind and he would support it\nUm I'm Patty that sticks out as soon as we got six or seven now I'm I'm passionate about it because it's such a simple straightforward change our equipment is already I'm able to handle it it helps to solve that problem of votes splitting where there are multiple candidates that are good from an individual voters perspective and they can't show support for them\nI'm expanding the size of the commission I also agree with I really am flabbergasted that the commission didn't refer to the ballot I understand why they didn't\nUm because then there are more people in that room that they have to discuss with and I'm deliberate with an order to make these decisions in the city like I get it from their perspective but from our perspective of the people um that's pretty unfair and\nWe didn't do a mixed initiative where it was expand the size and switch things have been a factor yeah that will that could mainly ... exactly and you know we didn't want to collect multiple initiatives at once simply because there are a lot of things about the sea of Fargo voters\nHave six things to think about actually there's four state measures one county measure and a city\nI Want one more but I Want Stephen to get on with your first\nGo ahead and I think the conversation over the last several weeks of style and my question is\nHow old I mean if we don't have to go or how does how do we move on each", "year": "2018", "show_name": "America's Morning News (Washington Times)", "city":
