project done in Morehead history so it's a massive massive undertaking a we have a total and funding that's put into it so far is about Seventy three million dollars massive just\nPeanuts pocket change but uh you know obviously there is a lot of conversation about this project or just a few months ago before it started about trying to find the funding you know when it was all said and done there was about forty eight million dollars from the state of Minnesota\nA massive amount of money of that that project that was coming in from the states and when you have that much money coming in from the state\nAs well as about six million coming in from the railroad another five and a half coming in from the federal government you make it happen locally in Moorhead was able to come up with a well Thirteen million dollars to to get that project going which was massively needed you know one important fact that a lot of people don't understand too is\nA this intersection at twenty twenty first and Main we're close to the school or close to the hockey arena\nIt's one in about twenty diagonal at grade a sections are are crossing and the state of Minnesota it's a dangerous dangerous intersection or that needed to be looked at needed to be undertaken\nI'm obviously there's a lot of money that gets put into there's a lotta inconveniences around that this the transportation the road to getting around but\nUh when it's all said and done people are going to be proud of this people are getting to be safe bringing their kids to school at Morehead high\nA wire letting their kids drive to more had to hide it was well they're scared of more right exactly but um\nFor for us in in downtown specifically\nWe see that quarter as a gateway entering our our downtown right I mean that's a visual impact you know when you've got trains crossing that at multiple different places you kinda got a a large intersection you're not sure where to kind of go\nThis kind of cleaned that up is that signature kinda enter into that as it comes into downtown Morehead as well as exiting as well I'm\n... I'm excited about it I think it's going to spur economic development around that court or as well as bringing economic development and development opportunities into downtown\nYou know what's gonna happen and you know because this is your home this is you're going to look back about ten ... and others are going to be sitting around a coffee shop and they're going to be saying I don't remember what life was like before it\nYou know how did we ever do things before that and and I think of it all the time because you can get caught so bad and and you need this I mean you absolutely need this dark\nBut without a doubt we do I mean ... ... you mean you see it right now we're not only just about intersection where you get stopped and you're waiting for the trains that kind of clear out but what this project also has a part of it is um there's a a junction that's being built that will actually allow that trains to\nTo make that transfer and not have to stop and start backing up which affects downtown Morehead but it also affects downtown Fargo to\nWhich also affects your language because if you're sitting in your pick up and you think you're going to win and pretty soon and all of a sudden it starts backing up the verbal skills get in half\nWhile you're looking for every way to flip a U.S somewhere [laughter] but no this is a this is greatly going to transform just the way we get around but they also the way we do business uh people can have a more reliable system of okay if I'm getting from point a to point B I can I can take her out and that can get there\nYeah or to the point is sponsored by more air engineering to the point by Derek will point we're going to talk a little bit about development ah not just you know the the sheer infrastructure but do you look at like a ... do you look at something like a piece of clay and say All right\nI mean okay like block eat walk me through where you see that being in ten years\nWell you know this is lucky is there a project that's a pretty unique I mean it was an old kind of gas station say ten minutes out of the signature court or again where we're at a thin and Maine are coming together there's a lot of traffic you know this was a and a six million dollar project that was put in by a a great development group an African and get its construction kind of doing it\nMakes you such a signature court or a signature I'm a building um they're already looking at phase is a two and three and you name it so I mean they're looking to expand upon it but when you got the Dairy Queen right across the street to me and that's an icon now you add another building that's ready to craft and\nKind of bring the cop any given day\n[laughter] that's right that's right and and you know there's a lot of concerns about parking and other things I think those will work itself out there's some some different arrangements that bad construction group and the management group of has a has a range\nSo I I think it'll all work out for the best you know there there is some things you know myself personally from a downtown perspective we want to look at that intersection and make sure we're we're having a safe crossing a for pedestrians if we're going to see a lot more people living and working you know going to assure his restaurant going to Dairy Queen\nOr we want to make sure we're we're looking at that intersection and making sure it's safe for people to to get around\nYou're always welcome to go ahead and call in or text and if you have questions of Derek ah here's one is there ever a discussion about an underpass on a thorough eleventh Morehead well\nI'm Glad that ah got brought in because we are looking at a another underpass and that will be at eleven street or a street was I'm considered I think just the logistics of it connecting the north side of more head to the south\nA eleventh ended up being identified with uh with that and was with the twenty twenty first and Main a underpass project things take time you gotta you gotta ...\nThe uh got approved by the city council a couple of weeks ago so they are undertaking this study\nAh I can reassure the public and the businesses along that court or that nothing will start until the the twenty twenty first and Main underpass has done\nA which is going to be about three construction seasons give or take so it's going to be a little bit of time but there's a federal grant in\nUh the see if we can get funding for for um uh the eleven street underpass as well as trying to get them a state money allocated so we're working towards that it's needed um ... it's a it's a major court Arthur our downtown as well as just connecting north self\nUh so we're we're already gearing up working with the engineering department department to see if we can try to secure so funny moving\nForward city gonna look like in two thousand thirty I mean is it going to be a lot of people are saying less cars more bikes more ... I mean what is the city gonna look like here in the upper plains where snow is a factor and all this\nWell it it's a really good question because there is so much of a of a an unknown with ah just transportation or how people are going to get around is it a ton of messages that um you know how it how to our snow plows work how does our infrastructure look so\nIt's hard to kind of really estimate for for me what I really see it as as\nWe have so many missing teeth and our downtown what I'm saying by missing teeth is\nUnderutilized parcels we have a lot of parking lot center just sitting there waiting to be developed we wanted to see that infrastructure rebuild up with with buildings you know get people there get get businesses there that's what we want to see and and that kind of really dictates but we also have to have to be smart about how we're we're planning this rate I mean you have to look at\nHow is our industry going to change how is a a transportation gonna change so we're creating a flexible space that when that ... which comes or not having to reinvest millions upon millions of dollars to to really you know allow that future to happen\nOr let's get to John John has a question for you there go ahead John\nAnd I was wondering that my head back to school\nHow do we spent fifty two million dollars and we don't set up a temporary walk away for a high school students coming from that case I Would watch your kids see them going on that side rock in the middle of the construction site\nWhere I've seen this I pretty much guarantee you you're going to have the talent that project before it's over ...
