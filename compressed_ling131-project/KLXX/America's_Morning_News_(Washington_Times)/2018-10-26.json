is that's probably the case Joel is you know but you know getting McGill scenario at Byron boxed in to the to their to their their limits of excellence you know get a manager do that\nWell ... they're gonna have to find some other way but Rocco about deli met the media met the public yesterday and and uh let's say or some other stuff from Rocco he says assembling his staff\nAs I sit here right now this is one of the most important if not the most important initial topic for I think all of us to spend time on I Believe the construction of a staff is it is essential to a major league baseball team having success and a\nNumber one you are a connoisseur of the game you play the game through the college level what what is the most important a position that he has to fill of that stuff\nWell I mean you know you you gotta you gotta hitting coach so you've got some ties to Tampa Bay on that staff\nRight now uh by sheltered and the guy that was going after the same job as he was said that he got but do you view would monitor you brought in some some new pitching coach brought in you know you've got to do ... hitting coach that's in there I think guys like ... some of the old guard Joel that was\nThat was here over the years gene Glen\nYou know I I Would doubt that maybe they will be part now above the regime and everybody\nShould have to it's no different than a a a different administration or whatever you offer your letter of resignation then it's up to him whether or not he accepts you know and then then my point is then you are not fired he just chose not\nTo re hire you know but I Believe that the most important position that any manager has no matter whether they're experienced or not is that the pitching coach because you have to be able to look out there see him in the eyes that pitching coach has to work with them on a daily basis there's two weeks there's this I Know the bad and coaches important I Know that\nBut most of those guys got there because they know how to bat\nSome of those people just lose their way\nAnd man that when you have a good pitching coach you have a lot\nYeah it is that and and and that's and they're all working you know and all these guys even Rocco ball deli Joel is really under and I was curious Derek solve a use the term a a partner so\nYou know a lot of times GM's or baseball officers you know you could use these the guy that's our manager he's the one that's going to pull the strings that's not the rhetoric and Minnesota partner partners so that tells you that they're kind of all in that decision making\nTogether so how much will you let now the youngest manager baseball have it be his team I don't know so much of its his team Joel I think it's still this\nThis pretty fluid situation between baseball officer Derek Bobby the manager everybody got to work it in unison in this new age of baseball that you call analytics\nWhy did I uh analytics is exactly right\nIt got to work it in unison in this new age of baseball that you call analytics yeah\nWhy did I uh the analytics is exactly right why why did I feel that this was like a a Billy Beane type moment\nTo do that and if you like that and you bring in Iraq about LA is it looks like kid ourselves about LA is a good guy got great history he's gotta he's gotta\nA good pass rich in in a visa to tighten American or about hall of fame guy he's worked

jury smart he's got all the tools to translate to the young new game of baseball so to speak bill ... and he's he's personally I listen to the press coverage\nEvery question that game as white answered generally through or throw it all that so you know it's a good start it's a good start\nI I got in trouble with the news the news listeners because my position on the twins about three quarters of the way through the season was that not only had they kind of moved on on the season which you can't blame them for it's time to bring some guys up and find out whether or not they're the future but they really changed\nFrom a team that thought they can Pete could compete next year up to a team that is rebuilding because they're one of those markets where\n... you know once every ten years they can make a run like the royals\nHe was part of big Tampa Bay unit that at a payroll probably Seventy eighty ... million dollar range that had success yeah so he's taken a small market boat

parking right next to the rat us and\nWe're going to evaluate can weed out a couple of levels to that because that's our most full ramp almost all the time so that's a first option just to see what the costs and if that's possible and then also\nUh we did an evaluation a few years ago about where would the next big ... and so the roll call ramp if you've ever been there it's very nice ah but we it's fall and so we need to start looking at other and then on top of that\nOur concern is we're going to be redoing main avenue and sold you you're taking away parking when this construction is going on and so we've got a lot of issues we need to resolve this Fargo broke absolutely not we are booming\nSo votes but part of it is singles fall off your house and he had money put shingles on what do you do\nBut you got you have to be careful where you get the money from an you don't you don't get over extended and so we do have revenue coming in for parking and things like that but but the the ... it's a lot of things you have to work together to get so what'd you get elected again tomorrow if you voted for and push for and there ended up being parking meters\nSo the parking meters as the legislature but I Want to know landslide either a hundred votes\nEarly so clearly clearly you out of there ought to\nGet it yet is getting a test that the legislature I was there okay full disclosure I Can't be a hypocrite here well\nActually I wouldn't support parking meters anyway but Judy or you know cared a bill to the floor of the north Dakota say that I was there opposition but on the floor to the parking meters I was I Won that day when all because\nMy theory was all these people that come from out of town you you're charging a sales tax what the heck we got to pay for though are more highly agree\nAnd I do think we have to be careful that when people come they don't\nThe charging a sales tax what the heck we got to pay for the ... and more high agree\nAnd I do think we have to be careful that when people come they don't feel like they're they're getting nectar every time they turned around\nBut on the on the I'll just give me my flip side from the parking commission or it's a management tool and right now [noise] Fargo's downtown it's not a small town anymore and and it's so I come at it from your local control and it is it's the legislatures call not the city commission and so\nAre tough enough in it and I'm like man I don't want to let me put it this way if you can see it you can set your clock by it they they're just like dairy cattle they they come out of their buildings at a certain time of day they wire across the street in Bismarck\nThey park on the other side of the street because Bismarck if you you get an hour to park on a side street\nAnd you park for an hour in one minute you're going to get ...\nAnd they're fine schedule it's harsh where we were we didn't let you know for sure you want to go back in my checked market Australia so we ... we aren't as harsh but but part of it is you don't want people to feel that way\nThat that your own to get 'em and so I like your attitude better trust me it's a it's a challenge and so we do have some issues but the only thing I Will say this is all good stuff because our downtown as vibrant and so\nA ... in anyway so it's it's an issue that we know there's it's a very complicated but we have to address it\nOkay for the new way that's being proposed a voting or where you go in and it's called approval voting or what do you think of this\nI think it's on American or one person one vote that's that's ... United States of America was based on and if you don't mind I got a couple of quick topics first of all fifty thousand dollars from an outside group that's more than all the nine candidates are raised together\nAnd none of the people in this out say general approved to push approval voting yes okay I was just so we know and it's an outside group none of 'em are from North Dakota none of 'em are from Fargo and that concerns me greatly and so I Would encourage people not to vote for approval voting because I I think one person one vote that's what our country was based on\nOkay you say that but I have two votes or three votes on any given election right\nYeah no but if there's if there's two open spots then you get a vote for each spot but but but what does ... it did values the value of your vote if you're one vote and now you have nine votes the values your your vote\nWhy are we still afraid of trying to run off you know instead of eleven candidates and then to win you know why not get it down to the four or five and then let them run off I don't\nMind that but but approval voting it's it's never been used and this is not the junior high student council this is a city commission we're we're we're in terms of millions of dollars were the board of directors of the city of Fargo this is no joke should anybody get elected with Seventeen percent of the vote whoever gets the most votes should get elected\nYou getting good at this day and got her always good to talk to you but thanks coming in thanks for having me on the when the uh the U.
