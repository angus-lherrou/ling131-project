on uh on on Twitter over the weekend is there anything real happening there\nWell she did kind of surprised people and she said that she would she would someone said let's put put someone else up against ... and a ... attack against us is because it says rice went\nAbout me and everybody sort of took it seriously um for about a New York minute until she treated again it said you know basically you know I'm just I'm just kidding but\nShe may not be she may not be\nShe knows her parents are family has a home in Maine so she does qualify\n... that's interesting well you know there's there are a record number of women running for Congress this year so I guess it would be no surprise of Maine has a another woman running against a woman senator Collins who's been there for quite a few years now\nSo you know on television we can see what was happening on the Senate floor things look fairly normal\nUh I guess the TV cameras up in the gallery looking down don't really pick up a lot of interpersonal relationships and how that works what was it like up on Capitol Hill are our people did they did do they have contact with each other across the aisle do they slap each other on the back of his all that just gone right now\nA little of both um this particular vote on a confirmation was unusual in that well in many ways but it was unusual in that the senators all were in the chamber at the same time and they were voting from their seats so everybody could here\nNormally they just go out to the recording clerk and uh you know just talk to that person or raise their hand a thumbs up or thumbs down and then they leave the chamber this was one of those very high profile votes and everybody was required to\nBe there in their desks and stand up from their desks will say how they were going to vote [noise]\nUh I did watch a lot of the inter personal communication that was going on and of course the Republicans were huddled with the Republicans the Democrats were huddled with the Democrats there was a lot of conversation going on uh but uh you know that not many people talking to says why certainly Murkowski a which is interesting body language\nA but it was it was a one of those rare occasions\nWhere there was a lot of milling about and ah and also just uh\nEverybody in the chamber at the same time you you may not know that this will you may Michael but a lot of people uh think that the chamber's full when they vote usually do or even when they speak from the Senate floor but they actually tend to be speaking to an almost empty chamber\nBecause everybody is monitoring the proceedings front on closed circuit or in their offices in the office buildings so ah they\nAll these fiery speeches et cetera usually given just to the recording clerk in the uh the presiding officer\nSure well I guess they expected that there would be a lot of people watching at home on television and plus there was a weekend so there are probably more people available at home to sit down there and just wash this for hours I Know that\nI kept running into people who are who are saying people who would not normally be interested in politics thing or even during the week the week before when when the hearing was on that they were recording it on DVD are just to make sure when they got home and be able to watch the intense public interest in this\nIt's a Eighteen before they are known for his libre talking with our Capitol Hill correspondent Linda ... so what happens next I mean a Congress has not in today's holiday plus it's a Monday\nSo I mean they don't have any work days left before the election do that\nVery few in fact the house has already off the house just the entire month of October off so they could go back to their home districts and campaign the Senate probably would have done very much the same had it not been for this Kavanaugh fight and uh they still\nHave a few things on their agenda to do and then they need to cross the I's dotted the a tease if you will on the um on taxes they're hoping to to bring that up again\nSo then what they want to this is another round of tax cuts is that correct\nAnother round of tax cuts that's right that's right and that bodes well for the uh\nFor votes during the elections but you know all spending package is generally we're supposed to begin in the house and house has gone so it's going to be a lot as a placeholder legislative items in the Senate agenda\nOr not the least of which will be a number of confirmations as well nothing is high profile as the Supreme Court nominee mind you but still she lowered jet lower a level judge ships and things of that nature some some more a lower level um\nAh administrative positions federal agency positions there's always those to go through 'em\nSo not a lot of high profile stuff left because keep in mind you know the Senate\nA lot of those folks are up for re election and they they really want to get to their home districts as well\nSo when they come back when river ... highest who might be a lame duck session\nWhere we've been to take up some things van and I'm Wondering how the election returns mind you know affect that because say the Democrats take the house or maybe even take the Senate which doesn't seem likely but it is a possibility but if they take the house\nAnd do the Republicans at that point try to ram through everything that's on their wish list or do they look at the election returns and say maybe we better mend our ways a little bit more in touch or if the Republicans maintain their hold on the house and under they just ram everything through and what happens to money for them\nDucks Russian might get the money for his border wall but he watched\nWell they have until December seventh to figure out that issue because that's part of a C R A continuing resolution or funding\nA that was passed up before the house went home for the tar but the October and it also it will take some defense money so they do still have to work on that uh they deliberately made sure that the C R would go past the mid term so that it wouldn't become an election issue\nAnd so that is going to have to be dealt with but other than that and that you know the last of the appropriations which are also in part of it the are uh that's really the only thing that they're going to have to do and they will probably try and read that through knowing that they risk a government shutdown that they don't\nMhm oh government shutdown while that would be interesting if it happens in a lame duck session because what happens if they if they can't get it finished before the before the calendar runs out on them I don't think they want to be there on Christmas Eve Christmas would not be a good time to have a government shutdown one would not think\nWell we've we've been there before on Christmas Eve although as I recall it was for health care not shut down but we just tend to go very close to the line on the shutdown\nThat someone or think about All right what else was going on we before we let you go anything else we should know about as as a as we look to see what Congress does and you know for the next couple of a couple of months before the before the new new Congress comes in and whichever form\nOr they get better question would be what Congress doesn't [laughter] it is it a little joke\nUp on Capitol Hill we don't know which is worst Congress being in session of Congress being out of session\nOr you know that we're not sure yet what they're going to do it's mostly going to be a case of passing she are and are mostly getting just getting used to the constant campaigning between now and election day and then afterwards cleaning up the message that might be left behind\nAll right thanks so much Lynda

I always default to this Joel ... it's kind of who you play\nWhen you play them and how they're playing\nWhen you play it you know what I mean it it is every week it goes to what you're saying every week or somebody could be out they may not have a running back might not have it all up tackled by not having a a rash and it all the Vikings could play that card to they don't end up developing cook ever some government didn't make the trip\nI think we've got being up there earlier that year so there are no guarantees in the national football league out all the other thing I Would add because you understand the game and and I know how you watch the game\nThat the Vikings have a center again now I mean the Vikings have Iraq and the middle of that line and that and it shows that really shows yeah it does and then let's not kid ourselves Kirk Cousins or that that eighty four million guaranteed is paying off of the Minnesota Vikings cousins was\nIn my estimation boy I Can't think of many poor things he did\nHe throw a ball high to Adam Salem one time maybe mother now those two boys look like they were they look like they were college roommates for goodness sakes that's so much into into\nWindsor ... cousins in Adam ... and Adam below the other one hundred yard receiving Joel five in a row to start the season about any foreign or oh to start laughing at me or does cousins who I'm starting to trust don't get me wrong by my question here but he's so some dangerous boss\nI mean he throw some balls in some areas where there's only one place that can be and he's able to pull it off I had you know he's the he's scares me I guess is what I I don't know he felt he looked pretty good to be thirty four thirty\nHe and he's able to pull it off I I you know he's the he's scares me I guess is what I yeah I don't\nKnow he ... he looked pretty good to be thirty for thirty seven\nThree hundred and one yard sort of touched on that that I hear what you're saying but I did he is a steep trust big she trusts the ... you know he was good enough to roll out these good enough to you know that ... that he threw down to Adam\nHe was there was a lot of heat on him but he knew that there was some coverage is one of one of the outside and metals you to do is get that ball out and let out and go get it so now I think you should trust ... cousins I think he's going to be just fine\nI Do it's just that you don't have that feeling is when when you're a quarterback throws the ball and then you see the coverage is like oh this is bad and then all of a sudden pluck it's right where it needs to be and I'm like how did he do that yeah I mean he he was both a softball and a lightning strike\nJust incredibly accurate and and I believe me I Know that he's got some ... she's got to the horrible at us at times but this guy's a leader this guy's going to be a good quarterback barring injury and the NFL for a long long time\nI got to highlight just to prove that there are back to our conversation about there are no guarantees in the NFL [noise]\n\nYard [noise] oh my goodness\nHumus for fuel goals and an extra point yesterday they called Carlson did you did you see that in the news that go as soon as sports goes up because what are you going to cut it means Mason Crosby this is that this was one but it's it's one bad day at just a bad day everybody that day\nAbout that are really bad day though that that yeah and their daily didn't exactly light it up when when when he lied that point he lined up for that last field goal\nI started honking and screaming and everybody driving by me on the interstate because it was snowing out a way out here in ...

looking on the local experts like\nThey were like snow covered so they were kind of blend in with an outline and exactly\n... what we should open air show and say what the potholes need to be fixed in the metro area\nAlong calls you take we're going to feel like they do to keep six sixty wasn't it use it told me that they use people used to drive around and say hey if you're listening to keep his six sixty our crowd had ordered hikers react 'cause of all he had regularly Andy is what is\n... ... if you're coming up or from the south and you come up and then you see this little building and that was the the old radio station and ... would be in there and\nThey're happy heart I regret having no Judy or maybe we're truly good\nReally good right I Want to get to the University of North Dakota as a ... it's going to join us a little bit later that the new boss up there man so yeah and so they're headed to which Montana team to they have\nThey had the graves at home and here's a little interesting twist on that first of all twist on the AFC yes Joel James Madison\nLosing the ... not a major upset me the lines of top ten\nTeams but now you got to do James Madison falls at number two we'll see of South Dakota ... a state who nearly got by a their game as we can slip to number to advise and being number one then Montana here's a Montana team jolted sitting there in the middle of the pack you know they've been that they've been fluctuating fourteen to Nineteen\nThey lose the Portland State\nHere's what makes this intriguing Montana now comes to a Grand Forks to take on North Dakota\nAnd that his family weekend and you and do this ... this upcoming weekend Montana after the game next week and go to UC Davis was it was obviously a very very solid team of the big guy so the group has got to feel that this is a must win for them in Grand forks North Dakota meanwhile sitting at three in too\nBig guy so the group has got to feel that this is a must win for them in Grand forks North Dakota meanwhile sitting at three in to Joel knowing that they got\nWhat six games left or to play probably got to get at least to seven and if not aid to maybe secure because they're an independent team can't afford to let me think game slip is certainly not ones at home collide it makes for a big collision\nOn Saturday and plus it's a border battle Montana and North Dakota so that's what you need to know about going into this weekend\nYeah but that's that's what makes it so much fun you know and and the crowds at the University of North Dakota had been doing nothing but girl I could feel it walking through the parking lot with a\nYou know with some of the excitement tailgating I mean they're they're making that transition you and I both knew this was going to take time sure uh but but bringing above a swagger then is going to make it a shorter distance to being competitive\nTo the point where you win the big sky conference already so you know he has a team that is coal shovel and that's what I noticed that I I think you see I think he's going to have some fun on Saturday body\nIs going to it's always great when Montana rolls into town and it's also a hockey here's a curious thing about University of North Dakota Joel ah because they have a team that skates that's pretty popular\nCalled a highly who's at hockey [laughter] so we're the hockey's in town and and I'm not going to get down on the student body or the fan base on that\nUh it it tends to draw a little bit from the football crowd I'm In a spot where saying do both why can't you treat it like a date I double header in baseball and get a football game in the afternoon and then recharge those batteries and get out much hockey but that's that's a that's why when you mentioned attendance that's what I'm hoping that folks can\nFlood the or the ... center and understand what that North Dakota Montana robbery is all about and then do catch a hockey game in the logging team won over time against the Manitoba ... it was thrilling I listen to tell them how to see on that road gardener got the game winning gold so\nIt's all good and uh it's gonna be a action packed weekend are coming up this week the budget on the road a western Illinois and uh McKown\nGreat place to visit wouldn't want to wait a minute to use that one today [laughter] no I wouldn't live there but\nThey're the perfect example of how everybody you know and ... because we have a air service right into Fargo because we have a you know the facility we have because of all of those things you think of\nThat conference as being at times something that conference really isn't\nOn the University of northern Iowa this weekend the vice and went in there had a bad start it came back proved how good of a football team they are and I thought kind of proved how well coached our showed a little bit in regards to where some of their weaknesses are on the defensive side\nBut but my point would be this you've got the national champions what used to be your arch rival and it's like they gave up because there was a lot of room left in that stadium at you and I do know that they\nCould have come out and plus after a quick start as you talked about the Panthers then Boyd if you've got a you've got to play all for I Know that's a shame that stripe\nBut if if uh you don't play all for that team is going to play all for it and then you saw what happened in the fourth quarter were just got to get my Bergen on my ... my partner the hall of famer for football\nThat my color commentator is he and I talk about this law and often about North Dakota state it's not so much that that the winner national championship and that's hard to do\nIt the fact that they stayed on top that is that anybody will tell you there's Joel ... look at you not to not to pad you on the back for your radio writing just chill but it's not that you get the highest rate it's that you continue to it\nLet's look at you not to not to pass you on the back for for your radio reading just chill but it's not that you get the highest rate it's that you continue to it is a it's it's harder to stay then it probably is to get even though getting there is tough you understand what I'm saying\nAnd I I I totally get what you're saying and it and you know you think about if there was just one hits in the guinea up there you know and and the that ended up being in the ... and the vice and could easily have won that game and went on to to when\nIt's your right to strike a right to say and and the one thing that you have consistently told me which you know I agree with is the fact\nYou've got to be more than one deep you've got to be ready for somebody to step up and the Lucas situation last year was to me the epitome of this ... and football program because there's not a lot of guys that could lose their local like that and then just have somebody step up\nAnd with all due respect to him you didn't notice it also\nLed one more to that Greg minard on the Russia Russia and side too yeah so it's that you have to have developed a some teams are trying to add to theirs and other teams habits\nAnd those that have a A R and better better shape but yeah it's all good I'm I'm looking forward to Montana coming into the ... center Joel that's a one o'clock kick family day I Hope everybody gets in there or the ... the dragons\nWell they fought hard job and they felt be fined early to men Kato\nMan cattle rank number one of the country and a former school love Adam feeling and Medicaid or took down the dragons but that makes you I'm a kind of held their own I get the score obviously looks looks a little more lopsided and the Congress fall on the road and the goal for spelled her Iowa but they're growing\n[laughter] they're grow grow at that point is it is it fair to judge a PG I mean I Know at what point do you say okay now it's now it's yours now you're on it when he doesn't have\nMaybe the youngest team in the in college football I I get it this year you could say it's true and they'd been injured so they've they've got the\nCurse of bolt they're extremely young kids that were in ... a year ago for goodness sakes and then and then they've added injury so I think to your question uh I think we could start probably judging BJ and the third year for the earth certainly one recruiting class\nPlus one really start to ask okay is this thing trending up or is it plot toy or is it different doubt that's I think you've got to get my hands till you let these uh let these little ... get a little bit the\nPast two years three years removed from from\nOkay so let me ask you this and and I don't mean to put you on the spot a disclaimer but you you follow the box cars a lot how did how did the uh the coyotes to this week you know how did\nYou know my my will often coyotes or the south Dakota ... the south Dakota ... as I thought they got plummeted they beat Missouri state thirty five to twenty eight of all this other guy got the wrong one okay so then how did the Wyoming cowboys do\nThe Wyoming cowboys let's see what they want to say that Craig bowls bunch out there they are about ... ... ... lost to Hawaii that many I think they lost ... with the kicker on that is you're out Hawaii but anyway you laws than\nLike the early lose what do you play on Hawaii uh Hawaii Seventeen Thirteen or is the title of that and if no Craig's club is now on to win the conference and two and four overall but I get old said do you really lose if you play at\nTheir plan or why not ... you know they love you and and well less than you are they they have a statue of you which has done nothing but in the ...\nJack you know they love you and it
