Capitol Hill where it's tick tock tick tock\nThe clock starts there is now we vote scheduled for some time on friday likely friday morning that'll be the first test of whether or not Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nIs able to get the fifty or fifty one votes he needs to actually move Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for his final confirmation vote if they get the votes on friday what then happened on Saturday Brett Kavanaugh could be elevated at the Supreme Court by the end of the week and\nHere's the reality right now obviously they decided to start the clock even before Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats received the FBI supplemental background investigation senators will be able to start reading\nAll one hundred senators will have access to that background investigation basically what they're going to do is go in waves of eight am Senate Republicans will be able to start reading it\nThere'll be able to read it for an hour then said Democrats will come in for an hour and they'll rotate back and forth until everybody has an opportunity to read the report or be briefed on the report by a limited number of staffers who will have access to it looked the bottom line here is the same as it has been for the last couple of weeks this all comes down to whether five senators\nAre three Republicans into Democrats remain undecided on this issue see what they need to see in that report to either vote yes for a vote no I can tell you right now\nThat the majority leader does not have commitments from any of those five senators now a number of them have been leaning towards that they want to get to yes Jeff Flake voted yes in the committee when I Can't overstate enough how important this background investigation will be\nMultiple senators multiple those five senators have said what they see in this investigation will go a long way to deciding whether or not they can get to yes an enormous day not just for the Senate not just for background investigations in general but for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination\nUnfilled tells us that there has been some talk that portions of the background report could end up being read aloud on the Senate floor\nIt would be a surprise and a definite breaking decorum ... there's no question about it but I think one of the one of the issues that centers have been trying to figure out is\nIf this is all to be kept private if this is all to be kept only through a small group of technically a hundred and nine people who have access to it how will you ever be able to prove it exonerated Brett Kavanaugh or approved Christine Blasey Ford correct or any of those things the only the best metric I've been given up to this point is\nIf they get fifty plus votes than there wasn't anything that was to damning to Brett Kavanaugh said look I I I think it depends on the individual member there are senators Jeff Flake being one of them Susan Collins to some degree who have certainly been more\nA

penalty for not reporting it's boards that gender ratio to the state's secretary of state Michael\nAll right thanks Jim Root for coming up on Nineteen before the hour now and there are a lot of issues related to this it's not even clear that we would get women to actually joined boards in California about thirty business groups and as you mentioned the California chamber of commerce oppose the law\nWhich may or may not pass legal must here and there are questions about how many companies in California it would even apply to not still this bill is actually based on a requirements in a number of European countries that they have passed\nAnd uh it is actually has worked fairly well over there evidence suggests that are having more gender and racial diversity in the boardroom is good for business\nAs a group called the Peterson Institute it found that the presence of women on corporate boards and into the sweet I may contribute to from performance and that among profitable companies move from no women leaders do thirty percent representation\nIs associated with a Fifteen Percent jumped in profit some European countries like Germany Sweden Iceland Finland and France they have quotas and finds requiring that the companies have to add women to their boards\nOr Norway I think requires companies to give at least forty percent of their director seats to women\nAnd they say that some of the folks over and those countries who resisted it initially said that once they've actually experienced it a change their minds and they've kind of warmed up to quotas but that's in Europe quotas have a different a different reaction in this country we are not crazy about being told we have to do things even when we know they're right\nBut we all know that when you bring in women and and people of color anybody who's got a different life experience into perspective\nThan just the same old viewpoint especially on things like boards it makes a difference and a lot of companies on their own of course understand that they're looking outside of their own companies maybe to bring in candidates who are a little more diverse and my uh you know refresh the gene pool a little bit and that's what this was about but the question is\nWhen you start mandating it\nOne size doesn't always fit\nAll well you know just just doesn't work all the time\nAnd we don't know if this is going to be good for women will they be looked upon as serious members of the board if they're on there because they are quote quota hires so it could be is that can be bad for them all and make some women who feel like\nI worked hard to get to this position I'm qualified for this position I've been here a long time I'm On the board but now people looked at me as if I'm a quota higher they may not like that\nSo we have a lot of questions to go through we had a lot of opinions to go through and of course this is a time when uh the relationships between the sexes are fraught with all kinds of issues that have such a difficult time this is just one one more thing\nAnd of course I Know a lot of folks will say you know what we do need to have diversity but we should do it only as the marketplace depends and others will say well if you wait for the markets to come around and\nAnd grand for corporate culture to change that's not satisfying for women who want their equal representation now not
