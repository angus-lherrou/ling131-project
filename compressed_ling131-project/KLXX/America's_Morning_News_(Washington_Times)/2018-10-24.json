idle not mentioning that I'm just telling you last night house in Boston\nRed Sox goes yeah he did not tell them why you're cheering for because of what you said the Monday\nTim about who you cheer for and what happens I don't think I'll do that I care for two teams\nThat year and sometimes it's the same team I chair for a year for the yanks him as ever playing the red Sox\nDoes try speaking of which I enjoy your gun you probably heard the news that like the biking fanatic about lost his battle with brain cancer or you know but you know those of us that have done sports talk shows\nA for so long in my darling Derek Hansen is yesterday in my\nRadio program I said you know when you get into the talk show business not unlike news interviews or anything but certainly nighttime sport shows which we used to have and still do you would you'd you'd put together your notes you develop the lead you'd you'd throw it out there and then you sit and hope for calls\nYou don't see you hope that you develop something that's good and you'd hope for called love remember twenty some years ago it gave Joe do sports I think you have a good thing you hope for getting to the phones it'd be crickets

Vikings\nUnprecedented will not be denied there is no greater biking fan out there than my drum\nI thought at two things right away when the end and wait a goal cafe geo news for for pointing out that

oh yeah yeah and you know and and then the other thing I I I thought of was Derek\n... because the way Derek handle that and you know it just was so it defines Derek ... he's such a class guy when it

Jefferson who else I Do those three of them\nWere really important guy Kelly's do and the girl who was a pilot\nBut I Know Thomas Jefferson because he's one of my favorite president Coolidge or hurting or somebody you don't say ... well sort of not cool they simply not college are so life life at the base in air that Wilson base instills producer evidence I kind of decorate buddy while it's a\nIt's pretty amazing you know when they got to start shutting down production because we're getting too much too much good gas flaring than just an eye on the other you know self imposed restrictions of oil companies don't like to do that and also there's a lot going on out there and it's going to get\nBigger and better I don't know what the recoverable reserve number is right now but the last one I heard was Harold hands of twenty four million barrels recover ...\nWith the existing technology at that time which was at least two three years ago so I'm guessing that's even higher\nAnd it's the best oil in the world is just like are there and we have the best Durham and the world we have the best couldn't all around the world we have the\nBut I Want to go down the road with you that a very white Siberian oil there you go that also ah it it's a it's a great thing you've been around the community you've seen the vitality you've seen the the infrastructure is beginning to catch up pretty good [noise]\nUh there's some there's some holes or you don't me I'm Still a proponent for if it takes all the five percent growth production\nSo North Dakota then that's the deal well that was a deal deals ... an ideal hasn't been made we all know that [noise] ... yeah ... I I I Would add is that in in a short period of time\nYou went from being a middle aged and elderly town\nTo being a very young and vibrant town from ... and a lot of towns you know if you look at Fargo west Fargo west Fargo being probably the the biggest example though that west farm it used to be this blue collar\nYou know and now it's this young vibrant where should we will that strip mall kind of a town it's it's a different field and from what I understand incredible school system yeah from what I mean they ... they value on that they're voting with their money but they do that you know that needs to get fixed here that's got to be on the big checklist for people\nI just never gone at why that a brick and mortar school building is not considered a legitimate unjustifiable impact oil and gas development I mean come on and everybody in the state wanted them to bring families and stuff now they did and now we don't have any school reform how many\nDots does it take to get from worst short workers to we need a good school [laughter]\nI mean how many how many dots does it have to say okay this affects workers coming in here\nI think it's a comma more than ... life quite Frank well and you know you don't want to and that puzzles me is is you don't want to go to does bill brick and mortar schools than on the on the higher ed in now where you got to get them there you got to get them there so\nThere there are so scared opening up that gate and then all the horses getting out say what do you want to\nBe known for a giant check book at the common schools and trust one account of what what is it four billion our three point eight or ... it was a lot of money you want to be known for that or a world class education system altered number two\nI ah when you look at that they've they've done a very good job of making us feel like we're broke\nA very good job of making us feel it on me because you out here you're smart enough to look past that but but they they're very good at saying you know the state revenues are down we've got to cut the snow plows you know yesterday um you know I was in Jamestown\nAnd I found it really interesting as an infrastructure guy that vehicles on the radio every day and tries to talk about infrastructure that\nThe candidates and district twenty nine these three wonderful ladies that are sticking their neck out there to try to get elected they talking about snow plows\nThey talked about highway department a hubs you know they they talked about where you put the shops out in the country\nThey you know there was that big snowstorm which you and I and Brad and Dallas we're talking about less and and so you end up with a couple of feet of snow earlier than what you thought you got some power line poll snapping a you've got you've got guys working day and night to get there to fix these\nAnd you know you're looking in the ditch and one of the our SARS or or the rural Electric's a boom trucks as land tipped over in the ditch 'cause there's so much on the road what better indicator do you need that it's time to dust off some of those crane cans of all the money out of them\nAnd you know we're North Dakota we love big tractors we love big trucks we love lots of big wheels you know so let's get what we need yeah it's I like it is it's no surprise winter around here it's no surprise\nNo it and it's really didn't surprise to many people when we saw it in October we've seen it before in October has really happy it didn't happen you're also Polk and heart already valley city Polk and hardy that's all very and hurting oil at one of them\nHarding wasn't hurting the one that died like a couple of days in office or something like that or they are telling me he was he was very short term as president hang on hard times so yeah I mean a brick and mortar for the school but then there's there's another issue that need to solve it\nA very short term as president a hard time so yeah I mean a brick and mortar for the school but then there's there's another issue that needs solving right I mean I'm not going to involve some of the other guests have coming on\nBut the the the conversation between district date district one here needs to continue fare\nWell I think so just just because of the geographical status and or the ... the socio economic impacts is you know some of these kids that are in\nActually that will listen to the limits we'd like to go to district one yep a percentage of limits and its its cumbersome to get that to happen a\nKitten then in district and everybody's going high camps going back to sports again can they end district eight play ball is junior high like a seventh graders already and district one\nYou know one on on that question I I 'cause I I don't think I've ever seen it drove lines\nIt drove me nuts and mandatory Amanda there was a when I was there it went up to K through six later on but it was K. through eight when I was there and we couldn't play sports and I think that that might have been more of the matter school districts thought or maybe it was Hank sing but we couldn't play sports so her freshman year and it just drove me nuts\nAnd you know back east you have a lot of me wants a class B tournament in the [noise] the letters that show up on the screen Montpelier but we'd be bad I mean right down the line so you guys are really well versed on school consolidation in the east and I don't you know\nTo me it makes sense but we have people in those positions that are going to make those decisions but I think you're too was the right one it's great to be talking about this and and finding solutions because quite frankly both districts are convincing barrel\nYeah we drove by um yesterday you drop me around and show me with a new airports going showed me where a district dates school is very impressive mhm I mean very impressive facility and they're investing in\nThemselves as well as ... as well that's a good problem to have you know I there's a lot of school districts listening to you right now that that that are saying man I Wish I had that problem instead of saying you know at at my school district I was in a graduating class forty five\nNow to you that's like forty five you know my daughters were graduating classes of like\nTwenty five or twenty two or something like that so I imagine that that that's a fifty drop that in a in a short period of time\n[noise] it it's pretty incredible you know I've talked to a legislators about the common schools trust one tonight on all the exact numbers but if it's three to four billion dollars in there that's in that a fund\nAnd they they parse out what about two hundred and thirty million every by any of 'em or something like that or if it's not a large amount but do you literally could tear down every school in North Dakota somebody told me ten rebuild them all up with that fun money left over\nAfter I you know the ... what's more important in North Dakota than their kids and a\n... it's lacking in infrastructure if we need it let's let's do it it's kind of what North Dakota do but the legislators say well it's constitutional thing we can only do will change it\nBut yet we're willing to change the constitution this time to adhere to a law we already have which is you have to be a citizen of North Dakota devote North Dakota\nEmail there's marsh he's all about Tim these law and Becky ... law and the ... law every one of these kids needs to be educated so let's do it really\nStarted out of our says let's say a little break and come back seems welcome and I will be talking about what it's like to be a quarter or right after this out her out [laughter] [noise]\nAnd views", "year": "2018", "show_name": "America's Morning News (Washington
