I've been out for Eighteen years and I are you know it just started a turning my life around and then I knew if I could do it any more to do it so I was bad\nOkay it was about okay so ... you started this where where did this\nSo I moved to Fargo like four years ago and the first year was I was in start up in there and uh we've been officially redemption road for three years\nSo before we get to redemption road life after doing time you know how hard was it to find tells you the footage job to find your face\nAnd it was a pretty hard it was a you know you're you're\nYou know um it it's a title I mean it's you know it'd be Ninety\nI Would I Would guess it is high because of the various things we're talking about somebody giving them an opportunity\nYeah that's a big thing is uh you know if there is no one there to give people opportunity to get back on their feet you know they just go back to where they know you know I did\nSo let me be naive in terms of what happens in a prison my assumption is is that you didn't have access to drugs or alcohol is that true\nOr there's some and Mary ... you know inside the walls are outside of the laws you know so you can get in just as much trouble behind the walls as we can outside so\nI I guess what I'm really up to his I have people all the time telling me well because my argument is not everybody that's in prison belongs in prison was and in one of the things that people say is maybe that's the only way to get them silver or to get them clean and I'm curious what you think about you know it worked for me I was a\n\nWhile there are all for one dollar a dollar for that than\n\nThemselves so redemption road if people come out at night they want to hear it they want to help what are they going to see that night or so\nOr you know a we're going to share a little bit about what we do and we're going to give some testimonies of some people that have been in the program that have graduated in a kind of moved on in their life or um or sell them to leadership themselves and are giving back within side or the program that you know it's helped him so much\nI I'm going to include a man that I have a lot of respect for this conversation a police officer Mike Blum or he's one of those individuals in the community that are set to reach out to the community or he's an individual promoting\nThis Mike good to have you back on news the news and thanks for having me man I appreciate it tell me why if you were the public you'd go to this [noise] um because I think the public\nDesires to see change but uh you can't see something unless you participate in it I mean that's really where you're going to see changes if you had a hand in the game and\nI think if you come out and uh promote ... or or support redemption road\nA year promoting and supporting people and getting out of addiction getting into employment um and and really becoming the people that they're they're supposed to be there called to be but addiction has set them back and so I think you know David heart is right and that's why his program is right you know he's got the right heart he's not in it for himself\nHe's really in it for people and uh that's to me a special um so I just I I I really just want to promote his program and praises program for the work gets a new one in our city 'cause it's making the community as a whole a better place\nSo Dave oftentimes again I guess you have to help me that this is ... ... individuals get out of prison my suspicion is they have no place to go in terms of housing and so they end up being in one place collectively together which again isn't good\nYeah so basically the individual gets out and if ah they don't have anyone or family or they burn those bridges\nOr family members don't want anything to do with them they have nowhere to go\nSo that's why they are actually came up and said this community as I visited this this city for a while\nA couple of times and I I realized there wasn't any service there so I felt like I can make are a big impact in this community and to be honest we started with two guys in a motel room in Jamestown today we have over fifty people in the ministry and we have\nIn this community and to be honest we started with two guys in a motel room in Jamestown today we have over fifty people in the ministry and we have over ... properties so basically a guy gets out or girl gets out now and uh they have no place to go uh were able to give them a safe and sober bed to come to\nAnd then I start working in developing developing them on more social skills and on soy Mitt uh we work on their spiritual development\nAnd we just kind of get them on their feet and our goal is to see him get to the next stage of life and that's what I'm passionate about\nFor the ones that when and you're not going to win every one of these but for the ones that you see turn their life around and become members of society in a community like you have you know how big of a role does face playing that\nPlays a big part I'm you know when I started off with my addiction and I didn't know anything about what recovery was\nAnd I came in I got involved in a a program and um they told me that there was a spiritual aspect to this disease and uh I didn't have really like a spiritual mentor to help me kind of navigate through that\nAnd uh it's taken me Eighteen years to get where I'm at today but the goal of what I'm trying to do with these guys and these ladies is kind of touch base on that spiritual aspect of what your disease does to that and a kind of give them a leg up a lot lot lot better than what I had when I got out\nDave ... is our guest a he's a convicted felon he's in the community right now trying to change or other individuals who went through what he went through so on November second there's an event at the delta or how on earth OK I'm OK at the Avalon how are you go [laughter] so we're going to be there um\nWell how can
