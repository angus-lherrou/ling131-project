yourself as a you know a single young twenty eight year old guy that doesn't live at home or no shame in that game right now\nBut a long term you'll want to be out right just like you want to have the dignity of your whole life\nUh so if that's a cool thing uh but you know the basic stuff we talk about here saving for emergencies investing being generous avoiding that\nUm you know living on a

that that actually that's the guy I was making paint it on my pre painted finally tell\n'em right now I Need to start on like that that full collection but to get out I think ... dollars\nMhm [noise] and I've already received a lot of like settlements in the mail mhm last like I had a federal keen hundred dollar a barrel that there there are are from David take family hired for a friend of mine like telling me that that thousands of dollars that we're getting\nMhm that I have to pay taxes on that at the end of the electric funding true\nThat is true definitely given us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that day for gays a cashier what's your\nTo come and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that they forgave oh okay so what's your household income\n[noise] um [noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand a year\nOkay let's say let's say you're out only ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight okay so it's still a good deal but\nYour yeah your I have about two hundred dollars per thousand for that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but at the end the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so\nYeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have in addition to that now if you had a large returning coming because you're over withholding\nWell then in that case so you're just going to lower your return because you need to change

would be you're meeting and I only share with people who are emotionally mature enough to handle the numbers I don't tell a four year old that you're worth ten million dollars because they will go to kindergarten and tell it\nOkay and they're not emotionally capable of handling that information our children in our case did not know\nOur wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did unveil it and they were in their early twenties it was shocking to them because they were raised\nLike regular people but\nHad a lot of wealth in the background\nAnd um so I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't need to make assumptions about [noise] but then as we presented to them it was presented as a responsibility\nNot I will do we hit the lottery has asked for me in my house we sort of more\nMeaning that you don't know anything you're just managing for God\nAnd that takes a little of the ... who all of it\nSo they need to be emotionally immature

three to four months it looked like from the from the I mean almost gone to we're going to turn and try there's there had it had to be pretty bumpy\nYeah was it was hard hard to trust her saying\nShe spent her whole life living this way with just chaos with money and in debt and and I did it take you to trust her\nIt probably took a year or so really to to see that hey this is she's she's I'm seeing the action not just the words right\nWell I mean that's a hundred percent but I mean probably within a few weeks you kind of how to raise your eyebrow and go wow she's really doing this I mean

for the week while the march contract was down a penny and a quarter\nCorn for December gained five and a quarter censor five and a half since rather well the march contract gained five and a quarter November soybeans were down a pentium three quarters for the week mark soybeans were a quarter of a penny higher\nUSDA release the crop production and just supply demand report on Thursday for the most part Martin ... risk management owner Randy Martin since the report was friendly to corn\nHere the came in and made some adjustments to the whole crop numbers which increase stocks are we did the imports drop by three million but experts were increased by Thirteen million bushels\nThat left in any facts estimate increase of about a hundred and thirty eight million bushels which everybody was expecting to see it will be increased by half a bushel an acre it actually dropped six tenths of a bushel down to one eighty point seven\nAre leaving at about one point one lower than expected\nStewart Peterson senior marketed riser Bryan Doherty thinks the importance is what this report didn't say\nIt in college whopper berries figures they saw last month or even the stocks number and in fact core number ... curved and we're just a little bit a yielding corn now estimate of one hundred and eighty point seven so still record hailed\nA democracy looking for one eighty one point eight last month one eighty one point three so so it does make one really pause and wonder if the biggest number from last month or the VIX numbers on the table which was last month's number there\nA soybeans though boy you know like to be friendlier to beans but you've got a big carry out its still rose above the expectations eight hundred and eighty five million versus eight sixty\nBolt marketing marketing analyst joined boss the said he is slightly surprised with that corneal number\nWe saw a one eighty point seven for a national yield versus last month was a one eighty one point three I was kind of worried he would creep up just a little bit like the rest of the trade so that was a pleasant surprise on corn\nOn any stock for corn of one point eight one three is a lot better than the treatment of the one point nine one nine so basically you could say one way from the trade as soon as we lost a hundred million bushels\nGlobal commodity analytics some consulting president Mike ... thanks suite isn't the best position to rally with Australia's production being cut by USDA one and a half million tons Russia's production was also cut one million tons\nWe ended up getting a to sixty million metric tons carry over that was lower the last month and it was well below the average trade gifts and almost near the bottom of the pile as far as trade guesses so I really would look for more out of the week marketed we don't get more out of the week mark and I'm like I guess it's because of the currencies and these outside markets\nCorn production was forecast at fourteen point seven billion bushels down forty nine million from last month average yield is out of one hundred and eighty point seven bushels per acre down over one Bush will from last month\nI'm forty nine

December till the temperatures get into the thirties\nRoots continue to develop so that's the plants shut down on the top they know for the roost at that time to start to develop more\nSo when you
