night at a concert in her honor\nAnd Abraham Lincoln and it is fascinating I mean just in in one day yesterday just driving home from work I was thrilled I was having such a thrilling experience running up San Juan hill with Teddy Roosevelt and the rough riders and the Spanish American war and then by the time I got home and I was making some lunch in the kitchen I was tearing up\nAnd and having goose bumps listening to her account of Franklin Roosevelt coming back from polio and having to make a nationalist parents had a democratic convention to place the name of somebody in

to both of those things thrilling and and being moved immensely all by the same book in the space of an hour only books can do that for us but are we still reading books well the Pew Research center says that um\nOverall Americans read an average of twelve books for a year but that's kind of misleading because of the real figures show that a lot of us are reading a lot of books and a lot of us don't read it all so when you average it out for the average American the average American reeds for books every year and that's it's been that way\nDon't read it all so when you average it out\nFor the average American the average American reeds for books every year and that's it's been that way for about a\nA goes back to twenty eleven so I'm you know that's that's a that's a good digested or that ... that we are still reading but I Wonder about our kids are they going to read that got the shortage attention spans if the Twitter generation\nOr you know doesn't exactly London one cell to wanting to read a book that takes you know maybe a week or twenty or thirty hours of your time to get through so we'll have to see what happens\nSo apparently this is a series of books I did not know about\nAnd uh it's called the before you die series and uh there's one of the latest I guess maybe the latest one is called a thousand books to read before you die and a\nMan named James most ditch us voted his life to books I guess he put together a list of a thousand great books right there but he describes in his pictures in the whole thing it took and fourteen years to do this but he put together this list at a thousand books to read before you die and James ... himself joins us now and James in order to\nTo recommend a thousand bucks just how many of these that you have to read or otherwise become familiar with\nWell I've been reading you know for six decades now so uh it's it's a thousands and probably you know the baby Fifteen thousand by now so there's a lot of books that I've read that are not in here and many of those I've enjoyed\nAh but ah so but that's what I Do I've done for a living that's what I Do as well for pleasure so I Am a I Am a book or\nSo for the person who wants to delve into this how is this organized for the reader\nWas organized a alphabetically by author because I wanted I didn't want to do it by subject or by chronology or by age of reader because I wanted people to\nNot get lost in a silo like if you like mysteries which there are plenty of mysteries in here for a few like a military history or if you like uh novels a literary fiction contemporary literary fiction [noise] uh I\nDidn't want people to go to that category and not get out of it because they thought they didn't like the other ... I wanted people wanted to encourage people to explore\nAnd so alphabetical by author allows an interesting juxtaposition in of titles so that if you're reading about Flora Thompson's book lark rise to a candle for which is a lovely\nStory of growing up in the English countryside very sedate um that's right next to hunter Thompson's fear and loathing in Las Vegas which is exactly the opposite [laughter] and then after Hunter Thompson is a K Thompson's Ella ways at the plaza wonderful kids picture book\nBecause there are plenty of kids books in here as well as really meant for lifetime reading you could start with a good night mood and where the wild things are\nPicture books the parents would read to children and then go up through chapter books and teen books and so on I have all of that of the book\nSo that's a very eclectic list but is there something in common than all the books have that you're recommending\n[noise] yes I think the one thing that's a common for me I'm the real the real thing that's most important is that is the kind of book you want to pass along to her friend might not be every friend but it would be a if you've read something really good at it you say to yourself you know Michael would like\nThis or Jane with like this uh that's what I really look for in in a book that that I'm recommending to other\nNow I've read here that you've set a thousand bucks is not even enough that you think you should be recommending more so is it going to be on another edition coming out at some point\n[laughter] I don't I don't know if I have the stamina but um there's a this book as a thousand bucks there also I write little essays about the books\nAnd uh other books to try if you liked that one too even in this book there's about fifty five hundred titles\nAnd what I'm hoping to do is to spark a conversation with other readers\nTo uh have kind of updates to list that we built a website for that purpose glow the thousand books to read dot com and people can go on a comment on the list and add books that they think I'm other readers should know about so I'm hoping this is going to be an ongoing conversation in one form or another\nAll right thanks James must itch author of the brand new book just released one thousand books to read before you die a life changing list and books can change your life they really really can you know they take you into another world\nThere's nothing for the imagination like going off into a world created by an author or especially if they were recreating the real world perhaps a book of non fiction I Love to read history and\nPolitical science and I love to read biographies of interesting people I even like to read autobiographies especially now when you can have the author read the book to you one of the most interesting books I read in recent years is a an autobiography by Steve Martin and you know he's\nHe started off as a stand up comedian but he's he's almost a renaissance man he's got such a wide range of interest and his book\nIt's sort of about his life but it's not like I did this I did that and then I met this woman I met that woman\nIt's more of how he developed his art form the art form how he developed his comedy style which is very you know it's it's a unique style and how he did that it's fascinating and he's also as he's gotten older you know he writes plays and essays\nAnd uh other books it's very interesting man and he read the book to you and it's like spending you know a a couple of days in the company of Steve Martin and which I Know I Would love to do is a very interesting guy only a book can really do that for you especially now that you can take the book with you wherever you are you know that's the great thing about listening to books on\nOn a recorded books but you know actually relatively few people actually I'll listen to books digitally that includes audio books or e books a thirty nine percent of Americans according to the Pew Research center say they only read print books\nTwenty nine percent read in digital format and also read print books\nSeven percent only of Americans say they only read books and digital formats and if not read any print books in the past twelve months so there's not as much changes I had a I might've expected before I looked up a few fingers this morning on that I Would have thought more people were listening to books that are still reading\nYou know all the bookstores are gone\nAnd used to be you could go to so many bookstores and I hated going into bookstores because I Would always end up spending too much money and come out with a giant stack of books\nAnd now the big bookstores the chains are gone they may be having some online presence there a couple of good bookstores here in Washington DC area that are also places you can get coffee and stuff like that they're a nice place to hang out but I Want to know about you are you reading what do you read do you like to read would

four on Saturday December eight seed vendors from the upper Midwest\nThat's correct Joel and and and I know um [noise] you know there there was a um a march in an interview with the family that the great with family last night\nAnd first of all I you know my my heart goes out to them and and I understand those emotions are those emotions are completely understandable um you know\nThe case with Sylvana we uh we put everything we had into that investigating that case and you're right we put the facts together along with supporting evidence\nAnd we felt like we have pretty good cases on a cruise and William Holden and presented that information to the state's attorney's office and then you're right they they take\nThat information they gleaned through it and then they they decide what the appropriate charges\nWell and was there anything in your investigation that that came up during the trial that you saw you missed in the investigation\n[noise] you know not really and and um this is just speculation on my part Joel a purely speculation cause I was not in the jury room when they're having their deliberations\nBut the only thing I can think of that maybe cause them to have some type of doubt is\nPerhaps um the question of when a savannah died did she die from loss of blood or did she die from strangulation or wait we know William I'm\nYou know did something with that roll around her neck and then\nHelp corrupt says he made the comment while she wasn't that before she's dead now and so maybe the jury has some\nAnd they helped Brooks says he made the comment while she wasn't that before she's dead now and so maybe the jury has some doubt their mind as to whether I'm William kill or or or savannah was already dead from from our boss\nYou know question comes in my tax to do you believe that a law enforcement did an accurate job of uh of searching the apartments\nSo that's a great question and I know WBAI interviewed me on that and I wish they would have played more of that interview they they edited out quite a bit there there is a difference between a consent walk through\nA and a and a search warrant and when we first got called\nUm do you need to remember that a savannah was in that apartment about three hours and forty five minutes before we ever arrived on scene to take a report\nSo in that three hours and forty five minutes as when the crime was committed and I think he was committed almost immediately when she was in that apartment\nThey then had time to clean things up and and then hide her body so when we get there were there to take a report of a missing person um\nAnd we went up to speak to work crews um of course looking for in a live in well adult female who is eight months pregnant\nUm got permission or consent to walk through the apartment to make sure that Samantha was not in there which we did\nAnd uh of course we're look as I said looking for an alive and well adult female\nYou know not having any idea or realization that she had been killed several hours before you know wrapped in plastic\nAnd stuffed into a small space so I I'm just asking people to understand the context of that situation um you know so we we did actually a couple of more walk through as as\nAs we gain more information but again not knowing or not having any idea that a homicide had taken place just simply looking for someone who has not returned home\nWe're now we're there please she pleads a chief tied for from the father of savannah to to look through your crawl space\nYes yes we did look through it or what they thought would be a I'm I'm guessing their apartment must be similar or something to that effect they asked us to check for a false wall um I'm at which we did we didn't find anything there um\nAnd and I I Want people to remember that when we're there at ... percent of the criminal next as we have to have consent to get into that apartment from for crews and William home which which we got\nAnd we have to be careful about pushing too far or they withdraw that consent and we can't even get into the apartment in the first place so it's always a balancing act when we're doing a consent search out what course leaders through the investigation we get more information and it's enough to get a search warrant\nWhich then allowed us to go in and really in forensic legal through that apartment and you know and of course at that point in time we we find the baby\nI Want to go back to determinations of charges that prosecution brings a ... you know I realize that decision is made by the prosecutors themselves the one that are going to be in that courtroom making that case do you you and your departing\nWhy is that decision is made by the prosecutors themselves the one that are going to be in the courtroom making that case do you you and your department have any influence over that if you think they charged or crime wrong or you think that they've diminished the chance of the conviction you're looking for\nThe you know do you have any any power any ability to go and say look you know you're doing this one wrong we really think this should be the charge\nYou know the state's attorney's office to their credit is always willing to listen to us a ... and take what we have to say and to advise meant when they when they do their charges I'm and I'm sure those discussions took place\nA ... and three of those discussions and all the determination has made that this was\nWhat fit to the evidence and the information the best I'm you know I'm again I wasn't privy to that conversation but that's the way things are normally done and and but ultimately are said they're the ones that make that decision\nSo [laughter] you know be because of all of that it's your job as law enforcement to come in and and support that with the investigation that you have and and that's you know chief I'm just going to lay it out there that's what I'm struggling with the most year I think that when people are frustrated\nOr that that somebody was found not guilty that is clearly very guilty of a crime here\nI I Do think at times people think that this individual will never be brought to justice yet that that he will not be spending a lot of time in jail and I want you to speak to that a little bit because I think a lot of people believe that William Hone is just going to be walking around\nNo that that's not the case uh I and I need people to recognize that he's already pled guilty to the conspiracy to commit kidnapping which can be up to a twenty year sentence and quite frankly I Hope it is a twenty year sentence 'cause that guy does not deserve to be out walking around\n'em in and broke\nAnd I'll committed a horrendous act\nI'm a cruel and vicious act and you know he deserves every amount of time it can we can give him so um if I have any ability to have input and that that's that's certainly what I think\nAnd uh yeah maybe he he got off a that maybe there was a reasonable doubt as to whether he was the one that actually killed\nUm savannah or dead but uh it will be going away for the kidnapping\nAnd you know from from my standpoint ... when I look at this there okay let me just say ... chief do you go I think that something could have been charged here other than a conspiracy\nTo commit murder\nThat they could have been charged that would have gotten him or greater penalty\n\nI ... I don't know all that joy and and that's you know more and the expertise to the state's attorney's office I don't know the outcome would have been\nDifferent even if there was a slightly different charge or you know again I'm I'm guessing that doubt comes\nIn the jury room as to whether the strangulation done by William is what kilter or if she died of lost a lot before that so that might have ... perhaps spin or that reasonable though was\nI Hope that in all of your lifetime as one of the leaders of law enforcement in this community I Hope that you never have to investigate something is is gruesome and his brutal is is I mean\nI I Do too it's heart wrenching it's a it's heart wrenching to think what this this young lady went through\nAnd his brutal is is I mean\nI I Do too it's heart wrenching it's a it's heart wrenching to think what this this young lady went through its heart wrenching to think that that kind of evil and exist in our community\nUm and and but and I would ask the community to understand the gray when civil shows or what they've gone through and and they're going to have those emotions in those emotions are legitimate to have and end up the understanding that\nUh do you believe it Native American women are and and what happens to Native American women that the investigations leading to the the things that are happening in their life are any less of a priority than others", "year": "2018", "show_name": "America's Morning News (Washington Times)", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "12"}
