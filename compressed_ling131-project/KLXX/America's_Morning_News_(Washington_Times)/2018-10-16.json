perhaps that might have been closer to our home but the thing is about a hundred and forty two of them are closing and also k-mart stores now there are also closing a bunch of k-mart stores Kmart doesn't seem to ...\nI'm not sure why that is maybe because it wasn't around as much or maybe it was more regional sometimes at least in years past but the Sears owns Kmart and the k-mart stores are

Johnson is here he's a political science in history\nFaculty member at em steak technical college jet land kids here he's with reform Fargo that's a group supporting the measure obviously mark is the individual against the measure approval voting um you know what a judge Jed you're the one that brought this forward so just give them a brief explanation of what a ...\nUm yeah so it's a simple changed or election system which says that you know if there's some people running any like for you can vote for if you like one you can vote for ones most votes wins it gives you the building to say thumbs up thumbs down each candidate said just one and make sure that to get elected and we have broad support and we have represented the winner mark why is it back\nUh [noise] All right so why it's bad is it it makes them of sanctions about how people vote it assumes that the voter looks at every candidate and can make a simple yes or no decision and most people don't think that way most voters say okay I like these three candidates but I like\nThis one a little bit better than that one and then the third one maybe less so and if you vote for all three of them\nThat it's highly possible and there's been some some political science study on this that says you can actually manipulate you can actually cause your favorite kind of to lose\nBy casting I'm a by by casting a ballot for your lower ranked choices so it it can be easily manipulated there's been a it's one of these systems first of all this has been used anywhere\nA it's an is using primary positions that used to be used in Swedish parliament the pope's used to be elected this way back you know five hundred years ago but in private elections where it's been used it's been demonstrated by some data that it's very easy to manipulate\nA small group of voters to get a desired result\nJet your answer to that um so he's wrong um as far as not being able to vote for your favorite uh that's\nOne great thing about promoting in the past and somebody called the paper trail criteria which basically means you can always vote for your favorite\nAnd um yes it has been used in lots of organizations and governments across the world is not currently being used by any US cities but I think that we should be the first as far as organizations goats use across the country to by Texas Libertarian Party it's used by the NDSU staff Senate um they're having great success with it and I think that it's time for Fargo to try it out\nMark you've been involved in politics a lot in your life I I served in a legislative session with you um when when house candidates Ron ... you've got four people right and often times if I wanted one of them to win a versus the other one maybe from even the same party for you\nIsn't that similar what we're talking about here\nWell that that is certainly one of the strategies of order could use a and I've got some data on on our current system both city and legislative you mentioned the legislature there's\nA the voters can do that are in North Dakota at least in cast also to cast kind of in this respect because that's sort of the population we're talking about is the city of Fargo and the surrounding area in legislative elections depending on the year depending on the district somewhere between five and Fifteen Percent of the voters say I'm going to pick one\nAnd I'm not going to vote for two in city elections the last couple of cycles since we've had these city elections with your own mind and what eleven ... to Lebanon twenty four\nTwenty sixteen we had nine and twenty Eighteen um the the they call it a ... they call it bullet voting for one the bullet writes about five percent okay and and there are some evidence from some of the private organizations have used this dark with college used to use this to elect its borders trustees their bullet rate was as much a sixty percent\nThat mark give me the worst case scenario of what could happen\nWorst case scenario is it drives down turn out\nThat drives down uh it it drives up the number of voters who say I'm not going to utilize this I'm only going to vote for one candidate because it's it to my advantage to only vote for my one candidate really really want and it drives down a a participation\nJihad give me your answer I find that kind of ridiculous ... you're going to tell me that if we have a system that said you could vote for more than one if you wanted that suddenly those Perot voters or those Nader voters would say\nWell I'm only in for her own our I'm older you only voted for Nader now instead of waiting for Nader and go are voting for her own Bush\nThat's not how that's going to work if you have the flexibility to vote for all the candidates you approve of you're gonna do it a jet go ahead mark\nI was just as well the problem is that there's evidence from prioritization sort of use this that that's exactly what has happened in the mathematical association of America for example which uses this uh they've had in the ... election or what was it yeah Seventy nine percent\nOf the voters said I'm only going to vote for the one because it's too my disability realizes the disadvantage to offer more mentioned the Dartmouth college elections of fifty nine sixty percent\nAre consistently and they use it for Eighteen years and there will love and I were asked in two thousand nine should we keep using as they used it for an Eighteen years and two thousand nine the alumni Russia we keep using this method in eighty two percent of them said no get rid of it\nSo I'm trying to figure out why ... why that would be ... and I'm I'm\nNot deciding how I Would vote I don't I don't get a vote on this for me personally I Wonder if I'm not in the middle where I Believe that a run off elections should happen I I'm not really big into the whole you can get elected with Fifteen point one percent of the vote I I don't like that\nYou know what I like as you get down to four candidates you run another race then you find out when and that now that it's narrow down\nYeah so it sounds like what mark is saying is that uh with prove all day and it's just going to degrade to a sincere version of what we currently have a and that that's what he's saying and um if if we switched to a system that makes us more sincere or if we're willing to prop up his argument than what's wrong with that but\nThe truth is I don't think people are going to do that and and also why\nWhy wouldn't you vote for all the candidates you approve of in these cases like that just in a runoff also isn't on the table for us the real question right now is new like our current system or do you think that we should try approval it's not so we try our current system or run off or should we try current system or rains choice it's should we try current or approval\nWhat would you say to those people who said look every day all your life when you had the privilege of voting you know the right to vote is probably a better way of putting this when you go in there and cast your ballot you knew the number of people that you're going to elect and stuff\nThey you know the right to vote is probably a better way of putting this well when you go in there and cast your ballot you knew the number of people that you're going to elect\nAnd so that's a decision you have to make that you as a as a voter have to make a tough decision you made like five people on the ballot but don't fall need to get elected you only get to vote for two and so you have to ... you have to hold the voter responsible for not getting to say all of the above\nI'm so absolutely I think the voters should be responsible but the fact of the matter is is that often there are similar candidates who are running and if we say to the voter you know the similar candidates to you even if you rank on internally oh this is a little higher than that when you still need to make a judgment call you need you still need to say\nYes or no to each one of them you still need to be responsible as a voter under the system this has nothing to do with trying to allow voter to be lazy or an educated it's to allow them to say you know what\nThese candidates are similar I think that I'll be fine I don't want to have to play this guessing game of who is everyone else going to vote for who has similar viewpoints to mine so I don't throw in my vote so I don't waste my vote when I bought him that's what drives people nuts that's what drives the turnout down is when they feel like voting doesn't matter this can help to make sure that when they go in there they can say yeah I can vote\nFor those candidates that I liked and give them a legit chance to get elected\nMark this is a this is something that I've always thought about that never part of a discussion like this earlier you said that it would it would encourage lower voter turnout that again falls to the responsibility of the voter themselves ...\nOr ... and certainly you want voters would be to to be in the age being Ajmi involved but when you create systems that give them incentives to be less involved\nWhen you create barriers you ... and barriers and how does this do that or is this is one of those complex things how to explain this on the radio I don't know what are trying to get listeners to understand so [noise]\n\nIf you've got three candidates and you're only role you know like to see a surge but the kind of you like and you you perceive\nYou'll receive those candidates as being somewhat similar say okay I'm In uh I like these three 'cause I think they all run extent for roughly the same things I stand for you still have to anticipate how other voters are going to act because other voters don't perceive those\nCandidates and the same way I'm going to give you a concrete example from this last election I'm going to name names and I hope no one takes offense to this uh there was an article that was published in the forum a couple of days after the June election and Jack was quoted in there and some of the proponents record in there and the ... and the the the story was laid out is that there were four progressive candidates\nWas my other jobs and uh when the Boyd pellet pressed into my ... and then they got fifty one percent of the vote and that there were three conservative candidates to implacable Tony garrick and ah they have a corner that they got forty seconds of course every forty eight percent here those to\nHear those two other candidates ... who got you know half a percentage or something\nAnd the problem with that is that presumes that the voters also those candidates on the same way so I've done I've run some numbers on that election and wear loose Johnson or when we're ... Johnson did well Mike Williams actually quite poorly in in those same parts of the city's weren't Johnson did well and vice versa and there's very little\nStatistical correlation and this gets re statistical but there is very ... you can't really find any evidence\nThat voters were perceiving type Gordon Gehring as being similar or pipe corn and Flaco is being similar um and then I also rented against partisanship you know we have lots of personal actions in the general elections over certain parts of town a very Republican certain parts of town a very democratic\nAnd again almost no correlation the only two candidates where there's really any relationship between partisanship wallet pressing Tony Derek [noise]\nCorrect and again almost no correlation the only two candidates where there's really any relationship between partisanship wallet pressing Tony Derek judge you answer that\nUm yeah so even if you don't see 'em different groups of candidates as being similar", "show_name": "America's Morning News (Washington Times)", "year": "2018", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "16"}
