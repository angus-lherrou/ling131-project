has become a very big distraction for the national football league\nOr when some athletes thought that they would respectfully show that they thought that our country needs some improvement they weren't necessarily a concern about the pledge or the flag but just saying that you know if we're going to pledge allegiance to the flag we also need to pledge allegiance to living up to our ideals a lot of people did not like that including the president who\nVery quickly turned it into a political brush fire and so that has hurt everybody\nIncluding people who like to watch football games without politics so it's you know it was that inappropriate form\nBats in the eye of the beholder I Will leave that to you to decide but that those are the issues that we are talking about this morning\nAnd it was sort of brought to our attention because there's a case in Texas where a student has refused to recite the pledge of allegiance to the state has cracked down on it saying it's the law and so now there's a lawsuit challenging the rights of Texas law to mandate that you have to say the pledge of allegiance in a public school\nClinton novel has some background on us run that Michael\nIn Texas it's up to parents whether or not their child recite the pledge by state law parent or guardian can sign a waiver to let their child opt out of it but at the student then still can't\nSchoolchildren cannot unilaterally refused to participate in the pledge\nMark rye lander with the Texas attorney general's office says the law gives parents or guardians of fundamental interest in getting the education and upbringing of their kids\nTexas is among twenty six states with similar statutes that make reciting the pledge of allegiance a regular part of every school day furthermore sixteen other states have statutes do allow for a time to be set aside for students who wish to say the pledge of allegiance on their own\nKids he Landry sued the Houston area district after she says the principal kicked her daughter out of school for sitting during the pledge of allegiance she says the law violates their free speech right according to write lander the cases about respecting the country and parental rights requiring\nThe law violates their free speech right according to riot lander the cases about respecting the country and the parental rights\nRequiring the pledge to be re sided at the start of every school day\nHas the laudable result of fostering respect for our flag and a patriotic love for our country this case is about providing for the saying the pledge of allegiance while respecting the parental rights to direct the education of children\nThe cases that for trial next year Michael\n... thanks that's Clinton that will reporting on this case in Dallas and as I mentioned earlier there are some folks who are trying defies all are trying to find alternate methods of\nUh expressing some appreciation for our country by not using the pledge of allegiance in San Francisco's Unified School district the last week well if they had a change they have a brand new president of the school district his name is Stefan cook\nAnd meetings that always open with the pledge of allegiance but he opted instead for reading that he says expresses a love of country\nWhen you learn teach when you get give he credits that to a poet Maya Angelou who ah did go to a high school in ah in San Francisco and uh this guy cook says this is not a demonstration and the same way that um the some of the NFL players\nAre kneeling during the national anthem they're talking about police brutality he says\nI was looking for creative ways to express admiration for the people that make the country what it is\nAnd uh so he said it had nothing to do with President Trump or anything like that but of course it gets controversy because some people do not like you messing around with the pledge of allegiance or there's a there's a schoolteacher in Indianapolis [noise]\nUh I have that information here and ah his name is John ... he teaches history in Indianapolis and ah [noise]\nHe says that what he's done is to kind of spruce up um the the flag every day he'd get somebody different from the community to come into the school to lead us or the lead the students there in the in the pledge of allegiance so they're doing the pledge but they're finding a way to make it interesting so that you don't just do it by memory or by rote or because you're told to do it\nBy having somebody different a leading it he says it it makes it a something that you pay more attention to and maybe by paying more attention to what you think more about it so he's got a different approach to reviving our pledge of allegiance now the thing is can you can you mandate allegiance doesn't allegiance have to be earned kind of like respect\nAnd you know we we just heard the attorney general from Texas saying he believes respect is learned by making somebody recite the pledge what do you think about that call us eight hundred seven three six three six six six when we come back in two minutes\nWe will hear what you have to think this is first light [noise]\nIf you

in Juneau as western Illinois found out against North Dakota state how 'bout that five turnovers\nThat divides in God's well North Dakota force four turnovers that game they Kettering him through a couple of pigs which I bet you they were sitting with us he shouldn't have to own that one I should've thrown that way but they were already up by somebody so Montana during the ... all over the kind of had a great game plan they dialed up a lot of nice pressure\nUh they just they ran the ball hard Kettering him through the ... the poll Rudolph I thought it a good game offensively\nThe when I when they didn't you I think this team is really taking on the personality above a strike it is I I liked that because that's the personality you want them to have\nHeading there they're hitting it is a a team that can make it difficult for you to run on they've got guys that are really having good seasons Evan home being one of them at the corner\nThe sad and unfortunate and we'll find out more tonight with Bob on his show here in ... with me at six o'clock or ... senior Joel walked on I don't know if anybody's side or the ... if you don't they\nThey have geo with me at six o'clock or ... senior Joel walked on I don't know if anybody's side or the bubble if you don't think bill but doesn't care about his and we all know he cares about his team obviously but it was all your social media with tears in his eyes\nBecause Tanner was rushing don't say the quarterback from Montana he kind of pulled them all down and took off in ten or stopped\nThen next thing you know full he's down yeah so you're fearing the worst and and it doesn't look good for tenderness would stay in jail and above his eyes that was ... it would stay because the kids are senior captain and looks like who knows might not be there but big win for the program now he'll just be part of that ah you know sharing those boys on\nAt Sacramento state and you go to foreign to begin with next week you're five and two\nAnd then we were state that town and Weaver is\nAnother one of those ranked team so\nAgain the FCATS because there's been so much movement there is a clear number one\nThere's probably a solid to through five but it is really a free for all Joel I think after you get out of that that one or two spots so and I can upset from that overdo it they just didn't get in get into the tournament get into the tournament and then see where you go from\nThere I Hope I had so many people talk to me over the last week about ... and football in about where ... and football as that and here's to me what my overall take of what they're telling me as their Bork\nAnd went too much when they're bored and I said man what a great thing to be bored yeah if you cut their board everyone kept telling me you should be so lucky yeah their their ... their biggest concern is they want to be out at halftime tailgating or because usually the game's over they they when they talk about it they talk about it in terms of\nWhy aren't we moving up a and according to that is a huge huge thing to move up they know that as much as what they just don't believe that there are conferences anywhere as tight as what it used to be the\nIllinois state is solid obviously was thrown noise now even though they're they're under five hundred that's a very good football team South Dakota state is is a very good football team Missouri state has shown rough I but I don't and with all due respect to those that are quote bored\nI'll tell you who's not Chris climate tell you who's not met in ... nothing how ready Hepburn the players that they're not ... thank you and I you have to understand what it takes to get his role out and win games\n[laughter] you know you have to just put the Oregon so I I had it for I understand the sentiment but it is tough to when\nI'm just telling you what they told me that it is they look at this ... domination in and they just look at it as though they expect it it's like you know whole hum\nYea it is doesn't mean they're not passionate about it I mean ... ... you know look at the buys in here you see all over the country lining up here now what what I'm getting at is that\nThey they expect to win and when early in the game\nYeah um and that's a different thing that's a really difficult as an NDSU had been out to slow starts in the last couple of weeks and even to get ahead in ... Illinois the leather next came out and actually made some plays and and made it interesting for a while I was still a game at half time\nAnd then of course as you know that depths and that and even mine is a couple of players and the issue at some things going on ... so it is a it all to win at northern Iowa\nAnd in Cedar falls into winning McCollum Illinois where they're just not a lot of fan participation from the home down to him and then to face in Illinois state team that trifecta I'll tell you something about North Dakota next year the two thousand Nineteen schedule you want a little try try to uh\nIn fact I'll tell you something about North Dakota next year the two thousand Nineteen schedule you want a little trifecta\nA University of North Dakota is at North Dakota state then they have a a game against Sam Houston state and that are at eastern Washington how 'bout that three\nOh that's that three in a row early seas exact so you know what's cool about this is ... ... that\nThe fact that both of them are playing there I mean I\n... the biggest thing that just just hurt was I knew that the decision\nTo to and it was ... it was Phil arm is and that was whispering to them we're hockey school we're hockey school that the north central conference itself could have made this move I realize August Stan and some others want the made that move they would have picked up a school now August data is very much\nWorking for that ... cars because it's not where they want to be that are central conference easily could have made this move collectively together had un dethrone in U. N. D. made some bad choices and it set them back to back\nDown in North Dakota state took their lumps and then went through that process it now or where they are setting up it is that how about this for a little in your pocket by the way they would have paid blue bombers\nOr had a connection yesterday this weekend western wrestler legendary longtime they'll see a bell player collects of a great touchdown pass from Chris traveler who's the former South Dakota quarterback and treads river Minnesota strap were\nTo slurp for adults though there is that you had to us the guy getting or do you see about\nYou know flash at the Philadelphia Eagles that could happen at any given day I mean it was the got it yeah that's that's pretty good it was a pitcher after the game that was put out on social media by Adam feeling and some others\nOf all of these small town schools\nYou know the man came to states so they all these guys were playing in the cardinal game yesterday um you know sell so it was one of these and and they take this picture and it's like you know what the teams that their players that play at that level can be in the NFL\nThinking about the Vikings game had a kitten from Minnesota state man kid or as we remember it man caters state\nOr putting up what he's doing and then the cardinals got a guy in their bag build David Johnson and MCS player you know and you see this Carson Lance Goddard all these fc as I was talking to Bobby how could Montana and he says yeah that doesn't shocked me so I'm always thinking how many people missed in college\nCoaches recruiting these kids that they they just don't I didn't get all the time of day or maybe overlooked um or is it I can maybe\nWalk it's a new world do in terms of you know what what's the average lifespan of an NFL player and I was ... it's not three years\nI write because for many years it was like three years because I I don't know I guess that I have to Google you know I mean it's it's\nYou know we're just I was reading about Ellen Page's wife and you know the foundation that she had set up and they they honored her yesterday at the game and and so I'm sitting here thinking okay Allen page played for X. amount of years which wasn't all that shocking in those days if I look at now you know it's like oh man I got to get to know\nThis person off they're gone they're gone yeah yeah there are many Phil Hanson played for good decade if you're getting a decade out of the NFL's especially if you're a physician like down in the trenches were nice blowout and leverage and all that yeah that sounds a lot of areas where the dance was when I have and they don't want in Tyler\nAccidents said to me today yes what they called the debt armed dance well he said that was the ugliest white man dance he ever saw was a little ...
