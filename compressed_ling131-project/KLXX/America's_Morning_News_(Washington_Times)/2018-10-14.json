that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that

thousand sixteen much has been made about the divide between urban America\nNews pundits and social media users have wondered like if there isn't irreparable divide between the members of these two dramatically different waves of life American cities and American farmland have so little in common when it comes to the daily grind political leanings and their views on money and\nWorking hard in this curiosity has come up ... books about the residents of rural America the latest is by author and journalist Sarah ... marsh\nSo I grew up on a wheat and cattle farm thirty miles west of Wichita and in some ways I was a child in the eighties and a teenager and the nineties and by then there were some major technological shifts going on in the country but\nBecause of our economic station we didn't have any of those things so I didn't have air conditioning I didn't have cable TV and have a computer in the house or access the Internet going come with my upbringing on that farm was more like a Nineteen fifties childhood than a kick out of the child and maybe\n... writes about her upbringing and life in rural America in her book heartland a memoir of working hard and being broke in the richest country on earth\nIt was actually a pretty beautiful thing I was a pretty solitary kid by necessity to start sort of geographic isolation but I always had animals and nature\nAnd I was a pretty solitary kid by necessity to star sort of geographic isolation but I always had animals and nature to interact with meanwhile within the walls of our house there was all sorts of strife and dysfunction much of which had to do in my view with\nEconomic struggle and so that's part of the story too but you know I it is an experience this thing we call rural America that I actually feel quite privileged to have lived in that is an increasingly rare experience an urbanized country\nSmart ... book is about growing up on farmland in Kansas but more than being a book about geography it's about what do you just don't like to grow up poor she says she was inspired to write her memoir because of the way she sees America putting such important son Wilson status\nI Can't say that in those moments let's say as a child qualifying for free school lunches or as a first generation college student not knowing what the term graduate school man when someone talked about applying to graduate school\nNot having the right clothes and so on those are things that I see now looking back that I did feel discomfort Shane embarrassment I was not necessarily conscious of that I wouldn't have necessarily articulated it that way\nBut the thing is we live in a society that is full of messages for people who struggle financially that that your value and worth is somehow tied to your financial value and worth and if that's the case in the context of capitalism that in my family and I are pretty worthless\nThat's of course the impetus for this book is to provide a sort of corrective of that deeply ingrained social attitude I think that even politically liberal and progressive people I find sometimes hold\nSmart said it was her experience as a college student but really taught or what a disadvantage being from a poor family living in rural America truly was\nI was a first generation college student I had already been working as a teenager for years and really also hustling as a student to work hard for the scholarships that I knew would\nBe my only ticket to a college education so by the time I showed up on campus at age Eighteen I was already tired [laughter] and then those years they're double majoring working to make ends meet keeping my grades up to maintain the scholarships that paid for my tuition and and all those things as a financially independent Eighteen year old\nWas you know wild for some of my friends they might remember college as the most carefree years of their lives for me they were really the hardest years of my life and that's the class divide in this country sort of manifest in my life\n... book is about much more than having to work her way through college and not having as much fun as her classmates she says some members of America as upper class don't recognize the full scope of what it means for others to live in poverty\nThe most crucial thing to point out would be just a very\nPhysical nature of poverty and the dangers often mortal ones actually that come with that life so\nI when I was in second grade my dad who was a farmer and a carpenter still couldn't make ends meet and those two industries for all his hard labor so he took a side job driving ban for a company that basically picked up industrial waste and then dispose of it ... percent whatever laws and regulations\nAnd so he would go around and said to places that the oil changes and pick up their spends oil and such and somewhere along the way you know nobody knows exactly what had happened but likely one of these\nUh businesses that he picked up the chemical waste from had improperly mixed things that weren't supposed to be mixed and so that was in the back of this than my dad was driving\n... van and and nearly killed him so he was in the hospital for weeks and for probably three years after that was in a kind of mental pays\nAnd you know this is just being a human being on planet earth comes with dangers that you can't necessarily escape with money but so often people who need money than most are the ones that do the least desirable job and they're the least desirable jobs because they're the dirtiest than most dangerous work\nSmarter indicated that there are two particularly destructive causes of the wealth divide in America first the way our capitalism can push those living in poverty for their own to the fold\nNo I'm not a political scientist and I'm not a policy expert but I Do know that the regulation of private industry has\nBasically over the course of my lifetime I was born in Nineteen eighty has led to a country where okay perhaps we have smaller government but in its place we have bigger business that can be just as potent of a force in people's lives and when it's geared toward profit rather than the public

certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit\n[noise] um and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically a show a is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that\nWe tried to get the other way we went to to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one once you get ready first mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of that because when you don't have any payment you know what you have\nMoney the bar or a slave to the lenders so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar\nPaul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the core worn out to the point is going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is\nThe more the miles would affect it in other words\nA hundred thousand miles dodge neon would be different than a hundred thousand ...\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point\nI don't even know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay it's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built that say a higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well built I mean ... again Honda Lexus a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac\nUm the larger body Ford products forge building a great product a truck a Chevy Truck for truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing about that\nIt's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and depending on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we kind of depends on your budget and how nice car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought I drove until I got about sixty or no I got to got about fifty something on it\nThe um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the the I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't know how can I just I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how are you\nHey de la ... what's up\nI'm Seventeen years ago on a high school senior I've got about three thousand dollars and I mean the count out donating should I in bed and I knew what China than\nYou're going to college\nYeah community college with and I caught fire and then paint love and the olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd years and then ending on how the program ... maybe ... served five of the Caribbean I keep them at the community colleges is either a new ad out in the dark horse\nYeah no I Will be true if you get some search some certifications and stuff and I the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that\nOn crime so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer or you want to be an hour or whatever mhm okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus\nUm you can invest it ah\nHere's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to ten and a nine point nine\nFinish college and all your education was he wrote that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and has a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know may I talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account at this stage\nUh with\nThis amount of money in your situation because again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree\nIn your field of study whether it's a two year whether it's certifications and the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream without any that\nAnd that three thousand dollar spin on that is more important than than the mutual fund and so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route\n[noise] if you need to thanks for calling open phones at AAA eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nOn Gray Davis an honor to speak with you you too sir what's up in your world\nOn my wife and I are currently on baby step forward if they can prepare for retirement and we're using the access our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension take nine percent of our gross take home pay\nOur dilemma is when we say an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we already contribute we don't have much left over from all the beauty of coloration so when we say ... percent were able to save a lot for a mortgage toleration though is it okay to do that or am recommend saving their twenty four percent now\nAre you ... are you vested in that is that uh uh you choosing an investment for that or is a pension\nGet the answer no options yeah I just mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct correct\n... I probably would split the difference because I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nTrue it's a horribly run state and now we're bending on those guys [laughter] huh yea no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah some of it I'm not going to count it as a full nine what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we can do this before then that means we need to put it in ten percent\nRight you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit our show and just round numbers was put in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it you know it's a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so um\nThat that's that's what I Would add backing off a little bit\n... thanks for the Gulf appreciate your joining us today Ramsey show [noise]\nAll big John extraordinary things start\nFrom ordinary things and they start from changing the ordinary habits in

little snapshot of stories and images of how a God's ministry of this place how your generosity is changing life so can we have that played\nChurch school what's up what about your school [noise]\nAnd I got a chance to hearing\nI think that there have been so\nAnd it always feels like\nTell him to my mind\n\nNice little snapshot about some of the things happening here or as a show used to say though to begin with now for something completely different I'll come back to that\nUm but I wanted to start by talking about something I saw recently and it reminded me about how when people are feeling pessimistic Dallas often say the world's getting worse everything is falling apart it's all going to hell in a hand basket up and I was recently watching a PBS and they have on this one show a commercial that always plays\nAnd the commercial company is always with at the store region travel company called biking revert cruises and uh so I was watching the before the show the Viking river cruise commercial\nAnd it was kind of a beautiful commercial it has these beautiful panorama of mountains and rivers and castles and then over these scenes you hear this voice which really caught my attention voice of a Norwegian fellow saying something about the meaning of travel and\nAnd then over the scenes you hear the voice which really caught my attention voice of a Norwegian fellow saying something about the meaning of travel and he says this he says traveling gives you the experience of other people in other cultures but it also helps other people experience you and I think this makes us\nKinder\nSo Viking river cruises comes out with this message and hearing it I have to kind of responses one is what a nice sentiment you know meeting people from around the world and makes us kinder or there's truth in that right so it was kind of his heart warming message but my other response was kind of this\nThis is an ad campaign that's drawing connections between two things Viking ships and kindness that's kind of an interesting connection to draw\nIsn't that right I mean alluding to Vikings who are the quintessential pillars of history and then saying kind this is kind of an interesting thing to do I think the people who experience the original Viking river cruises or weren't especially noticing kindness among the people there are meeting\nSo that's good you know maybe there is an example Scandinavian culture has made progress from his days of pillaging and killing so I guess some things do get\nBetter speaking of Vikings\nYou know the whole Viking medieval swords thing is in right now or in you know you can find shows of this sort of medieval feel\nThere's a fantasy based on that so popular game of Thrones there's one just called the Vikings there's one I've been watching on Netflix called the last kingdom and it's about the Viking invasions of England in the nine hundred\nAnd one of the interesting things is this clash not just between kind of armies but also between religions and the cultures that accompany them\nAnd it's and so you see this clash between the north people the Vikings and the religion they had and the Christianity that had already a permeated England\nAnd they kind of play this out in the show or in kind of a dark way but almost a funny way the English missionaries amongst come along and they say are God died for us and the Vikings kind of look at him with confusion and said our guys into pillaging I don't know about your God\nAnd the English say you know Jesus forgives arson and the Vikings say something like\n... crushes our enemies with a mighty hammer\nSo it's kind of a disconnect between religion of these two people coming together\nViking religion was not for the faint of heart\nIn seminary I made friends with the Norwegian guy who was an exchange student named moist Stein and the seminary invited him to come and talk about in the region history and culture and he decided to talk about the conversion the\nActual story of conversion of Scandinavia to Christianity and he talked about how it fundamentally changed their culture when it finally did come into it\nSo what happened was there was these Christian missionaries who are being sent mostly from England to Norway and a and the king at that time was a guy named king all off\nAnd king was kind of curious guy you'd like to learn about new things and so rather than just getting rid of him he allowed these missionaries to come in and share the story of Christianity\nIn overtime as you learn more and more about it from these missionaries king all off started to feel very much drawn towards Christian faith\nThe problem was these Christian missionaries looked around at Viking culture and religion and what they saw it was pretty brutal in incompatible with Christianity\nLike I said the Vikings as we all know we're in the pillaging or they were big into inflating their enemies and for another thing the Vikings practice human sacrifice again Viking religion was at one for the faint of heart\nSo these Christian missionaries eventually come to ... just about ready to be baptized and they say you know we would really like to baptize you but Jesus is a God of love and mercy and freedom\nIt'd be baptized and they say you know we would really like to baptize view but Jesus is a God of love and mercy and freedom so we're gonna have to ask that you stop pillaging and sacrificing and inflaming people if you're going to become Christian\nSo king a law stands up\nAnd maybe in a surprising move he says so be it and on the spot he outlaws slavery and human sacrifice and he gets baptized which back then was in an individual as thick thing it wasn't just he got baptized but he declared we're going to be a Christian people and everybody becomes Christian Christian kind of overnight", "show_name": "America's Morning News (Washington Times)", "year": "2018", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "14"}
