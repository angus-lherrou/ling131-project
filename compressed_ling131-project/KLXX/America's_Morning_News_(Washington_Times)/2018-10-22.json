more\nThough I think he did it yes I think he did it\nPowerful words from Senator Bob Corker the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he CNN's State of the union he believes the Saudi crown princes story defies belief\nBut it's just not a credible story for somebody to walk in with Fifteen other people and get into fist fight and lose their live\nSenator Rand Paul towns Fox News Sunday he doesn't believe it either\nAbsolutely not I think it's in it's insulting to anyone who's in analyzing this with any kind of intelligent background to think that oh a fist fight led to a December met with a bow and saw so no\nSaudi Arabia's foreign minister Adele algae there defends the crown prince during a Fox News interview\nAs nice as this is another winter this even the senior leadership of intelligence service was not the way it is is\nHe goes on to say this was a rogue operation conducted by people who exceeded their authority and responsibility\nThat's not right accurate or do we know that Senator Ben Sasse on CNN's State of the union I think the cover story from the Saudis are they don't bring them in bowling Assad to an accidental fistfight\nSenate minority whip Dick Durbin tells NBC's Meet the press the crown prince has his fingerprints all over the death of ...\nAnd the fact that he is heading up the investigation makes it totally incredible\nSo what should the u._s. do in response Senator Corker channel CNN state of the union\nSaudi Arabia as a country that is a fairly important country and so we got to figure out a way to have a nuanced\nResponse Congressman Adam Schiff the ranking member in the house intelligence committee tells ABC's This week there were several things the U.S could do\nWe ought to suspend military sales we ought to suspend certain security assistance and we ought to impose sanctions on any of those that were directly involved in this murder\nSenator Durbin tells NBC there's even more the u._s. can do\nWe are expelled formerly expel the Saudi ambassador from the United states until there is a completion of a third party investigation into this kidnapped murder and God Knows what followed that occurred in Istanbul\nSenate Apollo towns Fox the U.S could go even further\nI feel certain that the crown prince was involved and then he directed this and that's why I think we cannot continue to have relations with him and so I think he's going to have to be replaced frankly and he says the U.S should use its leverage the Saudis need us much more than we need then we have in front of a leverage their air forces entirely American planes\nThey can't last a couple of months without parks and mechanics to help them run their air force\nWe train their pilots they're completely dependent on us when we need to tell them to have\nMichael All right thank you Linda Kenyon reporting for first light from Capitol Hill Eighteen before the hour now when we were just hearing from Senator Rand Paul when this story first broke a couple of weeks ago\nThe senator or a put together some legislation to block this arms sale at that time when very little was known he was only about four votes short of getting the Senate to pass a cancellation of that arms deal\nAnd I would imagine that by now with such stalwart are supporters of Saudi Arabia as Lindsey Graham now turning completely against them that\nThat that Paul uh legislation would probably pass and kill the deal of course President Trump says he doesn't want that to happen the president talks about it as a one hundred ten billion dollar arms deal\nUh actually it's not really a deal it's really a memo uh intense saying that well this is what we would like to do over the next you know ten Fifteen Years this is what we'd like to do as of yet they've only signed letters of uh of intent there is no actual contract so this is the deal is kind of a femoral at this point\nAnd there'd been widely burying interpretations of the benefits of that job the president says ah it would create five hundred six hundred thousand jobs the Pentagon says maybe a couple of ten thousand maybe twenty or thirty thousand of the president says five hundred six hundred thousand dollar jobs are available\nAnd so far the Saudis I've really only agreed to about fourteen and a half billion dollars in sales and ask for things like helicopters and tanks and chips and weapons in training\nAnd uh and but of course that the deal would allow them to purchase up to a hundred and ten billion dollars over the next ten years but whether they do or not is not actually spelled out in that so it's kind of an ephemeral thing\nThat's what's at stake though and that also is at stake is the role of America as a beacon of democracy around the world what do we do do we sell weapons to a bad guy even if sometimes that bad guy helps us out\n'cause sometimes you know the enemy of my enemy is my friend so there are no easy answers here so [noise]\nYou know what would

N. D. history\nNot division one or two beset by a very close personal friend of yours without joy Adelson had Ninety are run it's not the longest running\nBut he had very close personal friend of yours now Johannes in how to Ninety or run it's not the longest run in the history of University of North Dakota it's gotta be Mike her village nicely done and it's the latter Billy Billy to build a\nWest by the way five times running\nSo Mike burger that are talking on the air and I was bringing these names up and makes races all you're breaking up with ... ... these are they is but the Ninety are dead set a record\nFor the longest running the FCATS or division one era which he surpass John Santiago did it like last year had a new one yard run so it was kind of neat to see some of those those marks go down obviously Baba knows his team didn't play perfectly\nBut it was you left or the way up the next five and two\nBut we go back to what you and I have been talking about this year which is the personality of the team and the personality that team is becoming a bothers tee up they're not satisfied for all you un defense you know and I realize Idaho State got away from us and let you go\nBack three four years ago the team had no personality\nYou know two years ago they ran the table on the big sky conference then last year was the injury and flexed year this year we're seeing a little piece and it has a sense of what it was a couple of years of the pre bubble years\nYeah ... yeah it had no ... you had some individuals that will stand that was kinda golladay who's now a wide receiver for the lion jihad some guys but it didn't have that are involved and told us as the other part of the ... go to the clubhouse kinda like these guys they\nGot a little chat on their shoulders to make that ... what do you think the personality of a team is count that would think of my ... my ... of the great coaches ever I mean you think of them and you think okay what was he look up in New England I mean look at look at what you know the\nPersonality of a bill or check team and that's it it takes I and Bob is gossip the same thing yeah you're right I I think you could say the same for Chris climate I I you have any soundbite from those guys with as much successes they've added let's not kid ourselves\nThat as a clear cut number one the eyes away at this needs to be said so it goes on record that my buddy down in ... and ... that\nThat runs the Knickerbocker he first\nFirst coined the phrase being the huge buys and found that he was called stairway to seven so oh yeah and now others are copying that yeah but I left on Friday after having stopped in with the you know to to visit my friend with a stairway to heaven and sure oh yeah I yeah I get you wanted\nSee that happen that way by the way it's going to come through Fargo [laughter] see a split the question of that is a well oiled machine there without a goal but it is really a fun time of year Joel in the valley because\nWhether you land on the greed and gold side or Kelly Greene invite side whatever it is in that level of football maybe a red and white down there in Vermillion maybe you've got that blue and gold and in Brookings whatever side you run out and\nUh it should make for an intriguing postseason if North Dakota can get in\nAnd this week is a monster Joel Wieber state and it's big because the fans want to get delivered by certain South Dakota and you'd like to think that the states probably going to\nKnow fence to us that he probably handle that like they've handled everything else is your ... like Lieber states I'm was going to be the right things to come out today they'll probably be a top six team\nAnd they're coming to deliver a center the north Dakota picks off wherever they go to six and two with having now three ranked teams of the time they played him\nBeat with three games to play he would think than North Dakota can maybe get one more and get in certainly to more and get in and then if they do I know there's a lot of ifs and what's the old saying if they have some bucks for a candy and nuts we'd all up\nThere are a lot of ifs and whatever but they'll regionalized that postseason again we're the month away\nAnd that would mean that you would find in North Dakota taken on a sheet of northern Iowa the winner of that to blame but South Dakota state ensure a path would be All right so this is kind of where we are setting it's up to you when you to hold up then during the bargain that's a good we stayed in their corner there but we were has two quarterbacks Joel\nInjuries again were grown men college a grown woman you of medical people in your family but suffered a one of those injuries and this past week uh there were other quarterbacks where the ankle twist in the bone snap\nSo yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah one of those seismic type and yes and it\nWas just absolutely gruesome and this young man Zhang says his name quarterback at being carried off the field is coaches going down and you're probably in a little bit of a shock I've seen this before\nAnd this this quarterback turns whose coach who just tape it off I Want to play so he's obviously in some shocking suffered a traumatic injury but that so they're down what other quarterbacks coming into Grand Forks on on Saturday That's what that's all I heard a lot of competition aside you never want to see that's the number five six are like six rowing teams that last this past week or so Sunday\nNight this coming week ... saints is Sunday is the start of the week right\nI mean it's kind of the I mean how do you define that Sundays instead of the week it's a day of rest and watch football all rests killing him [laughter] so I'm going I'm going to be in the twin cities for that saints game up I'm going to see if they come marching in I don't like the feel\nGoing into the saints here already it's Monday and you're having a little I don't feel like when you're out sick starters you know ... those are six men how many\nPoints little by kings need to put up Sunday night to be ... brings in the northern\nThirty three thirty choose somewhere in there because you're right if you're

what do we have\nChris Sale and maybe a Clinton Kirsch a game on so yeah if this thing go seven game seven of the world series will be played on Halloween\nI you know and I would love to be wrong but I'm the Boston Red Sox are one of the best baseball teams I have seen in a long time and Houston at a pretty good team and I walked right\nYeah I really thought he was the uh Boston is shown there was a the last time these two were involved in this type of level of the world series Joe I Believe Babe Ruth\nAustin is showing their wares ... the last time they used to were involved in this type of level of the world series joy believe Babe Ruth's\n\nWhat's up with the he he ... he was pitching for the rent is are these were store that that's all all these other shows that the debate was our you
