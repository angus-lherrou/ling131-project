you believe in the great creator would unite the right to see him earlier we know beating all was said to you when you were to win win situation okay I got this now let me or I feel like you're flying saucer that's our model so let me walk you through the\nRight measure three you're being hurt right now in super talk twelve Seventy Seventy high getting good morning everybody man their basketball is on the air okay and you're being heard here and\nI don't know where you're going to say that I don't know where that means we have two choices we have ... we have west acres which one do you want me to go you've got a couple of miles then you've got the whole mall in Bismarck\nI Love it's still open but it's the one that had the ... yeah the the the then we'll have to do\nWith Kirk with which one do you want me to go to to make my point or go to Kirk with ... so I go walking to correct or while I sit in the middle I looked for a demographic so you got to be what I think is Twenty one or you have to be\nSeventy female female mother matter the pollen my view on this group does not matter I Would try to fifty fifty it but okay so now I grab a hundred people okay I've got a hundred people in a room I've\nI've made them ... while the glass of water to bring people ... and\nAnd so then I look at them and I say All right\nHow many people in this room have ever smoked marijuana came and my guess is now this is strictly a gas this my guess is the majority of the people if not three quarters of the people at one point or another in their life have tried or marijuana\nThey were scarred sharks the old game it would probably be about like sixty eight\nYeah or more seven more and more so than other okay so now you ask me why I think recreational marijuana may pass that let's assume it's Seventy thirty just from my point that Seventy people out of that hundred\nWhen they shave brush their teeth combing their hair they do not see a felon\nThey see a person that they like it's them and if they don't like him get over the exercise but they say these are Seventy that maybe tried it in college I could try it or are still use it but I don't know but I Know that that the majority of people in my life\nThat I Know have tried marijuana to my wife has my two daughters now and they're right now going really had to use me for the example I'm the only one of us for in my immediate family that has that has okay and I'm Still going to vote for it but but my point is this\n... they don't see themselves as felons they don't think they should be in prison for it they think it's been over regulated and so if they can get all of that are way\nWhy not vote for it and then add in the other thirty percent or maybe some of that that Seventy percent says I kinda let me down a dark trail I don't want to try that then add into that group\nThe people that are ticked off because medical marijuana is still not available to those individuals with cancer with chronic pain with everything that we voted for now you're\nDancing in the area that I find myself it uh-huh voted for medical medical marijuana and because they're going to vote people that I Know where that this has been it was it legal to do so has helped take away the pain thank goodness this is why but I don't fall into that camp I don't want to legalize\nMarijuana on every Tom Dick and Harry driving down the road walking down the street or taking care of my children in daycare teaching my children in classes that are the law all hopped up on ... and you're my focus group and Martin where like where do I follow up on what you're\nDoing it right you're doing it absolutely right and by voting no ... you know I Would argue that that your reasons it hopped up that kind of\nWhat I was thinking out of the way I don't want to open the gateway to you know I Will die back in the sixties with people wearing dresses and rocking around singing music and ... it's not too bad I'm\nLabor that anybody wants to smoke pot already is now whether or not more high school kids might smoke it I think we'd be very being very naive if we don't acknowledge the fact that more ice skip school kids might try it because it'll be around their homes more in the public but if you're\nIf you legalize it mom and dad are having a day after dinner is Timmy and the Jane having it up in their bedroom while they're doing their classroom at ten years old and I yeah I Know are you are you open that\nDoor looking at look at it in in the form of alcohol right if alcohol is part of your family and your open about it and are you more subject to drink alcohol then or if your parents hide alcohol and make it this thing that you can't say oh you have to stay away from it and it's that\nThe devils juice and all that stuff are you more likely than to drink alcohol\nYeah I was one of those as well as your ladder is probably the answer to the ladder is probably yes but it does that does that mean that we should just open the doors for that and say well they're going to do and let's just do it or stick by the law the parents say no\nShort but took me the only thing that would stop me as if I thought it was a gateway drug and I don't think it's a gateway drug I I think that all studies most studies that I've seen of proven it's not it's you can have compulsive personality is with that as an because of the marijuana\nSo is this all up our number one to say about ... ... yeah so I asked Joel coming in and I said why why am I for medical use but against recreation I knew what they started this\nReasons are legitimate I mean I understand the reasons I and I think there is a lot how worthy has this measure that it's very worthy and it goes a little bit too far in my opinion in in the area it goes too far of\nHey you broke the law but we're going to forgive it now I understand their reasoning because it doesn't allow you to buy homes at it you know if you're a convicted felon you you can't do a B C D and now we've decided it's not a felony why shouldn't they go back in I I get that\nBut I also struggle with it in a sense I got a speeding ticket and I got it now I realize that there isn't a felony doesn't stop me from buying a home but I'm not going to go back when they raise the speed limit and say\nYou know I got picked up at AT and now it's eighty you know the type of thing it's a it's a little bit of a slippery slope\nOf the education of a joy Kelly disclosure when I come into play like Joel why am I like this I don't dance in politics or just got an eight I'm dancing as your other than I Am [laughter] I don't know I\nDid I say I I think the I think you brought it'll open focus to me and I know what I you know those that are firms staunch believes that is getting\nSo you're my focus group of one right now measure one in North Dakota because you you avoid politics you enjoyed and knock anybody\nLike I I think there should should know about what's going on\nSo measure one calls for an ethics commission so you use the state of North Dakota has to put in place and ethics commission that that reviews that policy those type of things how would you vote on that\nHow is the commission being commissioned how was the commission\nThe legislative branch comes forward and they set the whole thing up based upon what the law states they have to do so you have an ethics commission\nOn oversight group to make sure that that that things are being done ethically right\nWhat what it does is it if Joel Heitkamp\nIs a legislator any goes off ...\nWell on on somebody else's dime and he uses the fact that he is a legislator to do that they pay for it so the state and pay for it so I don't have to disclose that then I come back and say we should sell the badlands to Tahiti\nVeils they now have to the ethics commission makes it so people know that\nAre there to ... on this trip when you go over coming back in spending money in my state of North Dakota and ensure their their mind the ... well I thought we sort of the doubt I can see the ethics committee would probably be pretty good but I Would be concerned about who was on that\nGive you another one because I think they buy your very nature your conservative which you're consistent I Love that about you so so I I Would assume that you are not for state wide completely open gambling\nFair okay so if you have a legislator go to where was that Kelly Antigua so legislator goes off to an ...\nOn their dime where there's open full bore gambling and those individuals that owned gambling sites and then take well one you expand in North Dakota then that legislator comes back here and pushes for open gambling but yes\nIt's ... um exclude the exclude now he doesn't he doesn't show ya that is that he's been to in to a meeting with the gambling uh the Broncos and those kind of guys is that ethical disclose yeah but thank you\nKelly rats are just as good federal dams a little a little side door fish yeah you think he was yet I enjoy a good day to McCain or every now and\nGo do that ... the gambling brought his job because never win with online poker game and then we're you know everybody was doing it and", "show_name":
