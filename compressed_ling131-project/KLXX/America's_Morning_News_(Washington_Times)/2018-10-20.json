or something the point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business is the point is not the business\nThe point is what the kid is learning\nThey're learning work they're learning interface with customers and how to treat people or they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality they're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit the capitalism is not evil\n... these are the lessons are what is important\nI understand the accurate or if she make some money that's just a bonus\nRight but what what are you what do you identify as you've identified the way this kid is wired\nAnd a lot of us that are entrepreneurial are are a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how do you measure pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know sense\nI'm sure you know but I ... if you start maybe starting to like a hundred thousand dollars a year or something you may want to do in the odyssey but if you if you're making under a hundred grand whether it profit\nA ... you know unless you just hit some bizarre without doing or something like home depot wants to buy or out or something I don't know but you know what you're trying to do is teach her the lessons of how to set up\nIt is one of the most bizarre things to learn the\nDistance between the less expensive schools and the most expensive schools I mean we're talking eight thousand eighty thousand a year\nSpread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of college is the same cost it's just not and it's the number one mistake people make when they don't have a lot of money and the kid is going off to school it draws people in the student loan debt 'cause they simply go to school we can afford\nAnd as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars in student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education that puts a curriculum\nAnd the high schools and in the colleges across America we are now and forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stuff of staying out of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and\nAll of that kind of thing [noise] then what happens from time to time is the schools can't afford\nThe basic resources and so someone will come along side in the community of business or an entity of some\nKind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the rams the organization is that we've had about four million students go through it one of the coolest things happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that\nEvery high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby that's how that happens\nThe college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good\nNow Tyler Moore is with me on the line and Kyle is from the University of Wyoming usually associate vice provost of enrollment\nKyle White uh go man thank you for doing that\nWell it's a it's a pleasure to be with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming to be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical applicable\nThings for students to be able to apply that college search and uh and and be real fat a consumer of higher education\nYeah 'cause you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lower resident tuition any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anyone\nAll fifty states of all the rooms are like so like you were cheaper than my University of Tennessee you're you're cheaper than the University of dot dot dot that's correct wow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was behind this\nI immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you where am I doing a few minutes but I meant we'll get him to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys we're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enters fear we're talking about a curiosity and independence of boldness\nAt pursued that adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and look for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know it's not a capital isn't\nWhat you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right that is that\nCorrect your football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so as good I play on words but you you guys got you got to the table first will this way to go man I Love it it's a great motto\nOr does it says so much in unjust are so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you gotta sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is it going to have\nAs a coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool Kyle thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are a state that is very practical were state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of lobbying through the Ramsey education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're\nYou know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that I'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college because sometimes people do silly things like wander across\nThe state line I talked to a lot of Provo is around the country I'm\nMy own chancellor and vice chancellor of the ... Tennessee and it's a constant thing and then ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nSir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state but you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for our education in addition to being the lowest cost\nRenting institution we are near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north or south\nWe can be a solution that provide students and incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are\nHelping a student be successful not just students success and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nI meant so how many students on your campus we\nHave we have a little over a twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that are called himself capital\nNow that's a good size school it's not too big and small and so that's that's just right those are ... dress right very cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again brother thank you for coming on whether\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nAnd I love it I Love tomato and I think the world does need more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a little picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but a bottom line is lesser mascot and so\nNow it's uh that's very cool stuff I Love it and want a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high school now if you're a business or a university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the states\nSome states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know\nBut um you know maybe you just want to do it to be to the hospital used to go to um I went over spoke to at them in the building where I used to go to high school the other day and so now I'm middle schools\nSo I'll be forty really bright and shiny little eighth graders looking at me\nThat's the hardest speaking you'll ever have all this time um but no as Anthony O'Neill's got tough job you're all but a pretty cool it's pretty cool to go back over there and ah you know if it wasn't and by the way that the school has our curriculum I furnish it on the streets are on that one [noise] but see that's how you doing just that easy one and\nAh the world needs more cowboys I like it\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nWhy in

joint\nThe construction joint spoiled then it's probably at the crack probably maybe about an inch max someplace to just three quarters of an inch and probably about an inch and a half wide how ...\nAnd that's the way from the joint or just on the edge of the joint\nIt it starts at the joint and then go back in ah probably about thirty forty feet [noise]\nUm you could do that with a type of mortar I'd talked about a political zip it mortar which has a\nI'm In it may not be enough he may have to just go with mortar and just in Egypt do it but the zip it mortar is designed to have the slump where it can be applied to a vertical surface soak it also has a bonding age and then it it's a three ... three pound big un water and you kinda need it like baking\nAnd I think the limitation is death is a half inch ah it's a quick ... called zip it mortar\nWho makes that quick great great huh okay and that that wouldn't work what would I Do what I had a inch or that you'd have to do two layers of it okay [noise] yeah it's only a designed to go half inch thick\nAnd and other than that you just use regular or more\nMortar and then make sure you again you're using a um a a in a nice of a concrete adhesives that can be painted on to the existing concrete can also be mixed into the mortar like act grill ah sixty six where it'll blow on to the existing concrete\nOkay and that's a regular masonry more answer mhm\nOkay then the second or from my God what the slap stick it in various areas where you got cracks and they very any thing from sixteen to one to say a quarter inch how
