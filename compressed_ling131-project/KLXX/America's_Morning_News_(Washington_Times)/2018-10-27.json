I Would not want to pick up the premiums and a half a million dollar policy all that's a whole lot policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a poor right of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo ... life insurance is a horrible financial product\nAnd so what made if you just called me up and you just owned\nDiscussion with his dad and say dad or I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that that are like I don't want anything to paying for something that you know not only that but you have all the time say\nWell it's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yep\n'cause you need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nYeah I'm a question uh regarding up part of my retirement savings said come see us a call at ... from my company [laughter] and that overall is about eight percent of my total as sad\nOr ... or ...\n... well it's I mean a person it's projected to be or at a project that retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be ... percent of my total as heck you know and\nAnd the question is whether the cat has a a lump\nSum yes or ... okay\nYes here's why okay if you'd die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all gonna die [laughter] okay when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it might it might go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there is this Robert benefit the money's gone it's gone\nAnd if you live I or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we've got an account for you over here two hundred Ninety five thousand you can invest it you can make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you could take that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family\nWell that'd be a better deal\nRight\nYeah I just [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint in survivor a ... a\n... it's still you know if you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you out of the same concept of ... so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die makes this a bad deal\nAnd so you always take pension lumps on are almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good roast duck mutual fund so it sounds like your net worth ... million\nAh yeah it's a closer to close that it's been a it's probably about four oh well they're total\nTotal network to assets house is hope for the\n... well ... congratulations [laughter] how old are ya I'm sixty three way to go how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my um my family and my wife's family\nWhere are you a millionaire or that was before that happened\nOr a millionaire before my wife's mother\nWhen my mom my my parents type relatively young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar networks because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern or because of the amount of heritage is is maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nOf its lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool is I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell that twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below you mean they are a modest lifestyle which we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was new people do stupid things I've done a stupid thing which I think if you can limit\nStupid thing that that should do along the way that's good I like that [laughter] big\nMeat patties McKay every every everybody listening right now yeah he has done or will do stupid things but then you can minimize ... along the way\nAnd we live a modest lifestyle with below you mean um yeah Lloyd\nSo do you think it will be done to not twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\n[noise] Ah yes probably probably even higher if they stay minimize the stupid yeah maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and the ... all the math on networks to your benefit a at a Wal alive if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand ahead\nA thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me interview you for a minute\nIt's always good for people here how to be a real millionaire\nOh I Love this millionaire subject to this show

different stories from all over the Midwest that yields might be down just a little of that from where they had like two weeks prior\nBecause of that land and rainy weather in the ... now and the land and all of those types of things to the market I think is waiting to see how the harvest is kind of progress what they really are aren't I said it's going to sit here and wait for a little bit so that makes her fingers support levels on the far decides what to do next that's cameras\nOn her back marketing president Bob butter back things harvest pressure could be impacting the grains a little\nGetting towards the end of Harvard when everything's getting sold up a lot of guys are and how by and they got to do that or not getting dumped into the market I think we are approaching what

just a black cloud hanging over this market\nOh we've been hearing now is how export sales are going to be the savior of of the corn market and uh we've had three weeks in a row in our or there it's just not very good\nAnd Ukraine got corn to sell it cheaper prices so does Argentina until we're in the driver's seat on mic or business I'm guessing that's going to be a problem um obviously we've had problems with exports convened because of the China issue\nUm but then yet at CPAC on top of all that hard harvest progress and and some really beautiful weather and it's hard for the market to go out and then on top of that we've turned out of the technical and the gators lower\nAnd mid west market solutions president Bryan hoops are said the the pressure that was on the green market that

supportive of the feeder cattle market also\nAnd by friday we saw the grains and livestock markets all move higher global commodity analytics in consulting president ... most of the grains we're trying to rebuild after Thursday so off\nWhen you look at the drivers to what pushed us down\nThey were kind of few and far between exports sales were bad because they were on the top of the trading range um but the people in Chicago there they're thinking is that uh the real time demand is just making a making up the needed a bass that it needs to uh to meet the marketing year needs and so I think the technical the funds\nAnd some of the Chicago sentiment all came together at once and it was just a one of those as I say technical bloodbath so now we're trying to rebuild charts I think is
