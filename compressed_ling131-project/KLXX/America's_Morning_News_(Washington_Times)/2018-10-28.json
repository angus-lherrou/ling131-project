I Would not want to pick up the premiums and a half a million dollar policy that's a whole lot policy because it's ... times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a port right of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo ... life insurance is a horrible financial product\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just only about half a million dollars or whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and your husband\nAnd I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and said that uh I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be turning over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you are\nLike I don't mind paying like something that you know and I think you have like I said\nWell it's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yep 'cause you need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nOh yeah I'm a question uh regarding out part of my retirement savings said comedy series I called it ... from my company [laughter] and that overall is a bad guy eight percent of my\nTotal as sad or ... or ...\n... well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be ... percent of my total as pets yeah [noise] and\nAnd the question is whether the cat has a a lump sum\nYes or ... okay\nYes here's why okay if you'd die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all gonna die [laughter] okay when you die a\nThat money's gone 'cause it's a pinch of IEDs and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it might it might go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there is this Robert benefit the money's gone ...\nAnd if you live I or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we've got an account for you over here two hundred Ninety five thousand you can invest it you can make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you can take that two hundred and eighty five thousand you've been rolling into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal right\nYeah I just [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor a ... a\n... it's still you know if you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you do the same concept of ... so the ... the bottom line is it's got a decent but low\nRate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die makes this a bad deal and so you always take pension lumps on are almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good roast duck mutual fund so it sounds like your net worth ... million\nUh yeah it's a closer to close that it's been a it's probably about four oh well they're total\nTotal network to assets house and so forth\nNo ... well ... congratulations [laughter] how old are ya I'm sixty three way to go how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from about my um my family and my wife pay more for you a millionaire or that ... before that happened or\nA millionaire before my wife's mother passed away yes ah when my mom my my parents were eligible young point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nThe point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern or because of the amount of heritage is ... maybe ... maybe ... percent\nSince I was home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool is I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell that twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below you mean they are a modest lifestyle which we haven't done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I listen to you people do stupid things I've done a stupid thing which I think if you if you can limit\nTo saying that that should do in a way that's good I like that\nBecause McCain every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do stupid things but then you can minimize ... along the way\nAnd we live a modest lifestyle with below you mean um yeah Lloyd\nSo do you think there'll be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\n[noise] Ah yes probably probably even higher if they stay minimized do stupid you know maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and the ... all the math on that works to your benefit a at a Wal alive as he put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand ahead\nA thank you for

the kids and many many adults can't wait to get all dressed up and head out for an evening of bright and fun\nBut why what is it about this holiday that fascinate that so much and has through the centuries we talked to a horror specialist and a psychologist about the topic and looked into the story\nOf Halloween to find some answers\nBan Armstrong is co owner of the nether world haunted house in Atlanta and president of America haunts an organization that top haunted attractions in the U.S\nHe says there is some debate over the holidays true origins is it from a Celtic festival a Roman feast Christianity he says no matter who started at Halloween has a lot in common with each culture\nWanted accord celebration at the time of year where it and I think I'm getting older any classical illogical\nPeriod where we enter into against winter so it's a start of death if you will so it's both a celebration of the harvest but it's also a time when the veil as thin and people think about the dark and I think of a ghost Semitic about ancestors so it's always sort of in that\nTradition tradition of apartments tied with you know the celebration of ours tried with darker part of the year at a time when it gets a little colder\nCold days in early nights lend themselves to the feeling of impending doom and death and all things creepy and scary even carving the pumpkin has its origins in a dark and unsavory character\nThe pumpkin imagery is tied to the concept of the Jack o' lantern and there was a character named Jack\nWas so ... even the devil didn't want him so he's got to move to roam the earth with a burning ember and it was actually in a turn up he would have to roam the earth with this burning ember to turn up\nAnd then when the Irish immigrants came over to America they found a much better thing to this kind of hard to carve out of turn him credit found the bunk and that became the Jack o' lantern and it kept the name of Jack was a traditional character the story\nOf course black cat images are everywhere on Halloween and that's because they were thought to be the familiar of witches and very unlucky to come across Armstrong says that the holiday has traveled from Ireland to America and now back to Europe where children and adults both take part\nIn the u._k. where a guy Fox stay in November was the big small celebration Halloween attraction to become very popular\nI was just over in England a few months ago at a very large amusement park there called and power and I discovered that they have a huge Halloween celebration I mean the theme parks have embraced Halloween like no one's business I mean it's actually the second largest money making holiday after Christmas that we have\nAnd the other thing that's happened with Halloween is that it was like to solve it but it's sort of kind of grown into on adults and young adults holiday\nIt's now a lot of the traditions that were formally trick or treating you know twenty Thirty years ago now there's a big focus on Halloween parties there's a focus on going to haunted attraction\nUnlike family holiday times like Thanksgiving and Christmas Armstrong says said Halloween has become more of a party time like New Year's eve and with the Halloween party come to mask the makeup and the costume we asked Dr Janine a scarlet about that aspect of the holiday\nScarlett is a clinical psychologist scientist and self proclaimed fulltime geek she's also a practitioner of superhero therapy and it's coming out with a book by that title next July\nShe says that costumes the lowest to hide our true sells for awhile and become someone who's attributes we might admired\nThere's something really exciting about addressing are about pretending to be someone who are not where usually going throughout our day completely may be inhibited are confined by our environment or social rules but when we put her in a costume maybe we can pretend to be someone get friendly can almost\nTry on and defend the lifestyle for a second and at that moment maybe we don't have to be and then have it may be can be really exciting to do that for that reason many people actually really enjoy dressing up as different characters sometimes even dressing up as completely opposite characters of their true personality\nScarlet says that the character you choose me say something about your personality that your aerobics or like a certain time period in history or not it\nOh there's not one blanket statement for everyone for some people they just like certain costs in certain characters\nFor others they like to address that I think very heroes that inspire them for example some people always go as Batman for example are bad girl\nBecause they really admire these characters and they want to be like them\nOthers like to address the villain and I have some concern parents sometimes contacting me and asking me what does it mean if their child wants to dress up as the joker and Batman and it doesn't mean anything sometimes it's just fun to pretend to be bad and usually the people that dress up as they don't they're not\nCurrently it's thirty seven\n\n\nSuper John's well some of these electronics

year\nRight um\nIt's ... thank God it's happening on the go at it it's not that ... and it's not life threatening are you going to do it while every year\nNow okay so now also they look at what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail about is that I couldn't hear pain commission that the doctors are unsure of what it comes from okay God and\nSo if it was over there but I Do is I'm sure 'cause it's relatively new got I got I yeah\nWell what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in his budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand dollar to duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand\nDollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know a\nA whatever a line in your budget for medical expands ongoing chronic medical and just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside so that so that every\n'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up and leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean like issue is that I'm literally like penny pinching I don't like seeing where I can make that happen from what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars\nOn what I'm I'm hoping overtime on the opposite you know pay out more\nSo why are we finally got an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem we're\nGoing to identify ended that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand I that\nI make I don't think a lot on the license social worker and because of my condition actually switch to a job I had more flexibility\nOn some in a fee for service division as opposed to a salary position mhm and then I make anywhere from Thirteen hundred ... a paycheck on\nI knew how to drive a month on line you back twice a month okay and you said you're living and\nGet some I'm living with a roommate I paying nine Seventy I rent it give us a lot um and I do that from ... from ...\n... and what is the nature of the debt student loan\nPratt is everything credit card I'll also because they can hear it and I was trying to ... stick thing on medical and then it's you know most of it is going to cut it out there that have like a total of six speak out\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things in the food pantry\nNot eating you know\nNot eating outside and you're paying more than half\nYour life from your lights and water and your rent and your transportation\nSo food shelter clothing and transportation and utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson and listen to censor the necessities only the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you work as fell out into the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going in here for these medical expenses or they're going to\nBe new debt right because they are coming\nYou told me that that's why you called yeah yeah yeah I don't it's not me declaring it I'm saying right I've got an ongoing medical how do I prepare for it you save uncover it so\nNow that's our short term long term okay we got to get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and as news your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be\nPrepared to take on the long term which is get your income up\nBut uh we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards is time for plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nFor me and my wife I'm going through a baby step to right now I'm In fact we gets paid out by decade credit card today though we are dollar credit card and move on the line so\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're worried that too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday at a after church we had a big argument about hiding\nI don't know if we want to ... percent and um I realized that we were not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay all that we can give later\nOn it but what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of I thought the eighth of all I Want to get your input on it we have our campers can't find it that we want to live without thinking about it and bought out and given back to the church and then having\nTen percent by it but we want to live without thinking about Clinton got up and giving back to the church and didn't have an extra five percent and kind of giving it to\n'em or their charitable organization that we believe in that are about it one day the ... you know when the crisis mission and so we're trying to looking at trial give what we can to people who need it\nUm but if she don't have an aunt straight ten percent a church and then you are or what we don't what we can't give you know we're not in the media and she wants to give it a chart and\nWe had a big argument about high then yesterday I was\nOut on the the definition of dies the definition of the time was when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term in Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament is tent it literally means chant the word means tent\nIt doesn't mean sphere that doesn't mean twenty if it means to him\nNow you can decide whether you want to tie they're not you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I Am an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says in ... opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker plan is er Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you\nI Love ya and um you can give are not given all still love you but the best way to live your life is to to gifts and all throughout the old\nTestament and Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament is a tie the tens of your income evangelicals are taught and believed for\nFifteen hundred years at that time this is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top before you do anything else and it goes to your local church [noise] so if you want to biblical answer\nYour wife wins the arguing [noise]\nThat's the biblical not your wife and his argument that she was correct biblical [laughter]\nActually both are probably true [laughter]\nIn order to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nThey actually managed to to make something that was already difficult to understand even more confusing it's never been more vital to your business should consult with attacks professional to determine how the new tax law will affect your business employees and quarterly filings\nSo I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you in a range in advance for this bountiful gift that you had promised so that it may be ready as the voluntary gift and not as an extortion\nDisappointed that the one who stole it sparingly will also reached sparingly and the one who's ... will also reap ...\nEach of you must give as you have made up your mind not reluctantly or under compulsion for God loves a cheerful giver the word of the lord\nAre so today is one of three versus one through five please read responsibly bless the lord or my soul and all that is with with the enemy bless his holy name that's\nAnd do I get all Hispanics\nWho forget all your iniquity who heals all your disease who ...\nLove and mercy\nWho satisfy you with good as long as you live so that your youth is renewed like the eagles please cancer the gospel burst\nAnd\nThe gospel for today is from the twelfth chapter of Luke versus thirty three thirty for\nSelling your possessions and get all those neat purses for yourself that do not wear out and I'm feeling treasure inhabit where does he come near a mosque destroyed for where your treasure is there your heart will be also\n\n\nI'm\nNa\n\n\nYears ago when\nI was given the privilege of leaving his church I thought well\nI better brush up on how to do that\nAnd learn some new skills and how to be a good leader so\nRead some books what's in the works workshops on leadership\nAnd they all asked\nOne key question is what is your church is about what is this for about you what is the mission some even talked about\nAnd at first I was a little stumped by\nWhat was I supposed to be pointing to what if I asked you could you tell me right off what is our churches DNA its core values I Would hope many of you to say but maybe not\nI wondered if it was wasn't kind of like being a fishing waters swimming through it and wondering I Wonder where the water is you're just too close\nWith I thought well I'll just start looking around and looking at what we're proud of and how we make some of our decision what we value\nAnd what was a parent was one of the things that trend devalued was the annual performance of the messiah it's been going eighty five plus years\nAnd what we were happy about that it was not just our thing not just our choir putting it on but we invited voices from across the community to come together and joined together and offered that as a gift to the community and the top\nThere's something about who we are\nI remember\nWhen we put together the the community center where we remodeled our old church there when we went through that process there are a lot of people who are saying you know that's an old building you know maybe we should just tear that down and build something nice new enough fish and a and put that up and is that\nWe said no no that's a unique space and we want to preserve it not just for ourselves but for our community as well that's why we very specifically called it the community center and all sorts of groups have been welcomed into that space\nOr remember when we ... down on fourth street there a because it was\nGetting beyond repair of course the city's swooped in and said well you don't have enough ah\nLegally designated I'm parking spaces here so you need to turn that into the spark parking lot\nAnd we thought oh no we don't really need that I mean we ... we had a few spaces there but all around us when we have services all the streets are open in the parking lots are open around us so we went to the city commission and said no we want to make distance of lovely green space at the heart of our our of our city\nA pattern was emerging huh\nUh give me an attitude of an outward focus a desire to benefit others a desire to make a difference a generous spirit\nAnd it was this attitude that energizes treasured trinity than motivates us that guy is our decision do you want to get support for something at trinity Lutheran Church show how it fulfills these values and you'll get very little argument\nAround trinity generosity does change everything\nAnd when we lead generosity guide us we accomplish much and we are at our best is God's people [noise]\n\nThat spirit has caused this all is to look beyond ourselves and look around at our ... years ago um\nPastor Hendrickson had a connection with a Manchester house down south part of town it was a residency program for young people with various problems in their life and we partner with them and we collected some funds to help\nProvide some extra a blessing to them and we actually went down as did some volunteering down there\nAfter a while we met a young woman named Terry Gross who had a passion for kids and we partnered with her and she was actually on our on our site here and started cherries kids and we offered real support
