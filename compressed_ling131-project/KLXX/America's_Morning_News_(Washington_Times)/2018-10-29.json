half as what they're thinking and they just had a turnover and I think that gets into a culture of mind after they just have a turnover that turned into seven points for the other team I wouldn't have been fine with it either way to be quite honest with you and and you use them as many times\nIf a team has the ball to start the second half they're much more conservative going into halftime yes men

maybe not pains to the question in the national football league\nWho would be considered America's Team uh now\nThe criteria being that now granted everybody has their favorite but\nWho has more who travels well and or has more fans that come out on the road in cities where you don't have the tape so who is Green Bay America's Team\nYou see a lot of Packer fans I there's a lot of Packer fans in LA for that game yesterday against the ram at the Vikings Thursday night game you've heard a lot of cheers and I see a purple\nAt the coliseum that's cheered your cowboys voice travel will travel pretty well and they they have but I Do think in in Pittsburgh and it's a Steeler fans are everywhere\nMaybe ... I'm a I'm curious to it'd be deemed America's Team in two thousand Eighteen\nYeah I ... the ... labor labels that your team on time ago\nThat's one way to be America's Team just call yourself America's Team and then have a ... cheerleaders that are on posters and win some Super Bowls that they're too\nPolarized and I think for anyone to say that Air America so I I don't think that's why you lose ... Super Bowl wins and they seem to have a fan base even though everyone all market they just seem to ... ... and part of it is because of the dynasty in the seventies I think it allows people have always been fan since that\n... that I'm Glad you brought that up because there were Packers everywhere I mean it looked like a Packers home game against LA and then the Packers\nDidn't win well\nTake the touch back take that I Want to move quickly as you know there's a lot of play opposition going on on the NFL but let's face it we're with what's going on right now in the U.S yes no UNT they fight hard they lose a tough game developers name did you feel like you're having almost ... of a turnover\nKind of like an Idaho State or the feeling a little bit there\nYeah but I Would also say last night when they had the form of Adam feelings you out of seven points that really swung the game even though you are the score quickly a few of my house it's still I think was a little bit of a momentum swinging the fact that you wouldn't be has a turnover Google Search\nThe interception that uh that uh we birthday was able to pick a pit bull yeah across and boom it said seven potentially off the board for North Dakota are three and it turns almost immediately a couple of places that are to seven from wherever it was just an ideal situation here here's how\nTeams that have this is a wise statement here but teams that have a larger margin for error often times we don't sit back reflecting on that but there aren't many of those teams because everybody has a pretty good you know everybody plays football pretty bad\nBut in times we don't sit back reflecting on that but there aren't many of those teams because everybody has a pretty good you know and everybody plays football but he put pads on and and unless you're a dominating the stores\nYou go back to that and and and it that when it happened I Want you just had it's almost like seeing something before it happens as the pay gap in your ticket or had\nThis might not be good and it turns out now there are a lot of wild wild plow Ninety nine\nOr on the air I called in Ninety five I thought Evan home at a ... step to defy but he ... the one\nNinety nine yard kickoff return for a touchdown hey how about my bird ... my broadcast partner for football who is such a great is why I Love working with him he's such a good coach mind and he speaks how it is he doesn't ...\nAs you know the whole thing on watching what I Do love the high school football game I listen to the whole thing on my phone all the love the listening\nTo him because he goes but uh we were state decides they're just going to try a field goal and take a ... point lead to Fifteen which gets instead of just either having another play rather than some more times late in the game where it's almost kind of decided so like they almost that are voting for the first stone I write my very says quote\nWhy would you do this this is my opinion this is not right at all you don't do this\nYou're going to be touched on game or a guy he says you're going to\nRun the risk of getting it blocked and letting the team back in what happens during the blocks the field goal returns in touch but he's not only Nostradamus he's he's got everything else going for them and and unfortunately they fall short which ah by the way going back to the teams that bigger margin for the team that's in Fargo has a large margin for\nThat is a clear cut one there's there's just not anybody right now close to what North Dakota state puts on the field\nIt's amazing I watch a lot of major college football is you know and and I say this and people get mad at me or antibodies and fans but I just look as a naked I Am not a huge fan of either I just pulled from all to do well and I I just go wild I mean they can hang with most everyone I see I think if I wanted any Alabama's analyses on\nSaturday Night and I just they are amazing and it's um [noise] I think\nYou and defense of the rare thing where they kind of want NDSU to when they went to knock it out of his bubble Missouri appalled team [laughter] I don't have any playoff contention ... do you want the buys into dominate here that's right and you want them to knock out some of these\nTeams because it's safe to say I mean they maybe get\nIll luckily have room for error if they lose another game but you Indian Baba his crew there kind of in the playoffs right now and\nNow that that obviously if they would have got that one Saturday we're we're talking a whole different story too that we're talking almost a seat if they can run the table now\nAre you thinking you've gotta you've gotta get if you can get the seven that's a good shot but not extremely comfortable you get the eight you're comfortable and they have three games slapped in five wins five plus three is eight now you got to win at Idaho when at Portland State at home and with a girl that Arizona which is all get a bowl games\nFor North Dakota dark and then but you got to do but you got to do it and then about the NDSU comic yes you do God now granted the valley is very tough coverage but the problem is\nThat you saw for a couple of setbacks in week after week after week all of a sudden you're sitting with six losses and and and a thick five losses in all of a sudden teams that are seven and four and a rating three that's to your point of India shoe winning so that is a conference that beats each other up an unfortunate comments at beaches other out\nIn that one colonial a little bit like that and um you know we'll see what happens or the next couple of weeks I'll be in Moscow, Idaho\n[laughter] what are you flying to Spokane and drive forty minutes away but that's a that's a good producer gave back

have that with the Viking\nOr late ... he's always said it North Dakota you always have a whole set of Minnesota you always have ... yeah\nWell hopefully they can just get a win this game now I don't
