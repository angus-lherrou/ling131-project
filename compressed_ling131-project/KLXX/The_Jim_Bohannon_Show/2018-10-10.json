O. V. I. C. K. O. V. I. C. where one eight six six five oh Jim bow and the Allen calls in from Dallas this evening and listen to the cliff five Seventy good evening welcome Alan\n... going to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind to live Allen\nAll here he was spending that my experience has been I'm sixty one years old I've ... I've tried ... travel and most of the major freeways in America Ninety five north and south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith ... with on an on the major freeways but then if you run into a situation where like in a south to North Carolina where the Florence hurricane to flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou need to make sure that when you're when you're going now they'll go on the major freeways first and they wait for the detour then that's when you should you shouldn't start on the side roads because it because when there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get get out of the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay undeclared major uh interstate and then and then then if that happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then go to the side Roach that's all I'm saying\nAll right well let's see what I think over because to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me that he\nIs absolutely correct but importantly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to work those roads you\nShould at least be familiar with and so when you're traveling on leisure early um track to some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there now and the other people are going to meet up with you and you should know at least several of the major roads to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those roads so when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline\nIt's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say before let's say you're on a major artery and we are told that are being asked to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey I'm taking this beach are we going to go to through this direction\nTo that location so this way family\nBecause even as the people on the other side cannot get that sick no meaning the tax bill the email message wants that to our turns on and the people on the other side get that connection your text or email all show up once their their cell phone reaches that tower\nNo as a as a ... thank you Alan for your call them ... and your thoughts your or how does the GPS era affect all of this\nI'd makes everything so wonderful that we know where each of those are like you said in activate your GPS for your family members\nSo this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but in times of weather related problems such as Michael\nYou know the storm skipped throwing down you know can take our technology\nAnd if the towers that people that you're sending a signal to wind down\nDance single you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they hit another tower that active they will instantly received those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way and on the other side\nIt's important to understand that they will receive at once a power is connected to that cell phone they will receive that message and now they know what happened to you\nAnd I would just doing a quick little plug for a radio the good old ubiquitous over the radio always their distribution such moments we go to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the bull headed show with our guest disaster preparedness expert at the early ... good evening Patrick\nA good evening Jim ... of this uh this coverage is very fascinating with the hurricanes and so forth [noise] um [noise] and uh otherwise set a than being a good script per a movie [noise] um why not just bomb or a\nHurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific a couldn't be a new killer it would rain radioactive [laughter] a ways to [noise] but uh maybe a hydrogen bomb or\nWell that's a nuclear bomb too because you didn't know because it involves a a a\nTrigger that consists of either uranium plutonium but beyond that if it is let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock hurricane out of kilter a I Am not sure about this but I Would say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal\nInto hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other uh practicalities of such an idea there's just too big and really\n[noise] well you know let's put it this way\nLet's say the United states was to let's say or just you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with the storm and the storm goes towards Alabama what Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida are liable for died during Desert Storm and damaging the states the other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there was a big storm coming towards us and then\nThe other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there is a big storm coming towards us and then we diverted to Mexico and it goes straight through the city and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nOh we'll libel for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the people that it hit they're going to be upset\nYeah and I would note one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody was ever found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action led to what followed but ah this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nOf cloud seeding or part of the eye of hurricane this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left turn and head of the inland\nAnd the the idol think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe the ever again that was tried so ah the the fact is that that we just don't know enough about these things in the ... at the notes quite correctly or\nA one of the just simply change of course in damages somebody else in the ... who is liable and I think\nIt could be a painful lesson in the liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do with the exact precision will take some more calls

insurance claim and uh\nWhen I was telling you what you do you had to rebuild right\nWhy it just didn't the repairs on my own and and here's the thing is when people do rebuild it's like I this is the first time I had extensive damage\nAnd uh I'm I'm gonna do it all out of pocket then I'm fortunate that I can do that because you I was talking to our local\nWell but I mean it's if people do this stuff themselves rather than higher and the first guy that comes along at a pickup truck\nAnd says I'll do that for X amount you know and then they normally have to get that read that but you know I I was at the local Wal Mart earlier picking up so I you know run in and grab some stuff get out and I was talking to one of the workers and I said\nYou know you guys are still open\nSix in the morning till ten at night and I if I got to go in and get away on an oil filter I like to go in at three in the morning when there's nobody there granting get out right and ... and ... well you know we're still so under staffed because so many of the people that work at Wal Mart\nCompletely lost their homes and I um I didn't know it was that bad right here I knew it was ... you know I can see it I mean if you drive through this area right now right you will be on every\nThe sides of every street is still piled with debris ... tour\nWhere the houses are being good at it you know where the trees are bank a cut a pilot on the roads and all that stuff but you know and it is responsible to evacuate when you were told to is a threat is there this is the first time I've ever evacuated first storm\nAnd felt bad doing it couldn't wait to get back almost almost turned around at the Georgia State line and came back but my grand daughter wanted me to go stay with her you know in that area shooter read about ... right I left came back and\nDo the only good thing about it is when I came back I was able to bring things that people asked for because everything was shut down mhm right\nYou know I've been through super typhoons in the Philippines spoken our places like that where you don't to evacuate because the government who is who you're therefore says we're not going anywhere in fact we're going to go out and take care of the people who need our help during the storm mhm so it's it you know it's not an irresponsible act and not always leave now and\nThey're not ... I Believe this way and other countries of course that's a different circumstance and uh\nAnd the like in this country as a general rule they won't ask you to evacuate unless it's a pretty good reason to do so I'm I'm certainly a happy for you David you have the both the personal financial wherewithal and the knowledge to do your own rebuilding\nBut I don't think that's an option available for a

well I'm from northern Michigan especially the northern northern peninsula nor the lower peninsula Oh yes I could I could tell some blizzard snow tales Arctic weather tales I got on a while but maybe just one okay All right okay my father was stationed in Europe that the early Nineteen sixties in the air force\nAnd he was he was being transferred from Europe were to say I saw your air force base in the middle of up upper Michigan we made it across the Atlantic me and sisters I was young school age of ... we made it from the glare air force base in New Jersey or to Detroit by train I Believe yeah that's right we didn't get another plane that's right\nFrom Troy [laughter] we're supposed to be trained\nMackinac Bridge area what are we supposed to be on a bus and go further north you know that that train it was packed full of people of course in Michigan in March still as mountains of snow all over it's covered mountains of snow and it might be like twenty degrees outside\nThat train made it a little ways outside Detroit and what they hadn't figured was it detracts had been the snow had drifted further onto their trucks and I'm sure they had a plow drifted back on and the train went head first into like ten to twenty foot snow drifts\nSee the temperature was out in the twenties it's like\nWhat's the mansion or something yeah and that trend got certainly stuck stuck I don't doubt it no it was the first half of the train and this was head of this because people could've suffocate you know well yeah I was a matter of fact [laughter] so what happened was that the train company of course called out the surrounding towns people to come with\nShovels coal shovel snow shovels um pick access anything wow he'll help shovel the train looks you know [laughter] I took about I think you're five hours and they showed a trained looks they must use 'em flame thrower at one point you know\nIt was like a stock you mentioned trained cast iron getting stuck in what looks like the snow drifts they like what's up man I'm telling a story\nThat much of my life shoveling those things I can show snow I'm pretty good at it and there is still you know\nYeah well I've been around enough snow but I'll tell you I nothing like that Maggie and my my snow\nAnd it's good to talk about about three feet above the worst I've ever been around that's that's amazing you imagine that folks that that they pay a little meteorological macho Maggie okay uh AC in Newport North Carolina up next to lower ac\n[noise] hello how are you know and then I'm well thank you\nUh I moved to a Carolina South Carolina coast in Nineteen Seventy to move causes snow here every winter and in Roanoke, Virginia\nSixteen twenty inches of snow mhm uh Nineteen Seventy three we hit thirty inches of snow in Newport North Carolina a and they never had any snow at all prior to that\nSaying a is I've been through everything I've lost two routes\nAnd those are the insurance how much I ever received seem of
