[noise]\nTalk about was able to show it was eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we talk with Bill O'Reilly\nHis latest in the killing series killing the ss co written with Martin do guard is are already working its way up to the top of the best seller list and they were going to look a bit of just of what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is tackled you look at the titles you'll say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what it usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the other World War two Nazi Germany is collapsing and the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know\nWhat I did not realize until a killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government [noise]\nSure hum after Iraq killing at which became an enormous salary a lot of material left over because he was an occupier in southern Germany or before he was a killer met his death\nAnd the prevailing wisdom from pat in and many other a powerful people in the U.S government was we've got to use these captured Nazis\nSpy and work against the Soviet Union which is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you'll remember him from killing a bad one actually fight them if you wanted to fight Stalin yeah so that's what the new CIA or that took over from the ... says did they enlisted a lot of these uh ss people and get ... people\nTo spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union and they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich ... the head of the ss one of the most viable human beings ever walked the planet called Odessa and Emily knew about a year\nOr before the third Reich collapse that Germany was going to lose and he thought he can negotiate a separate pieces kind of crazy delusional stuff\nFrom him but he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization and so they helped these guys get out of Germany we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened\nAnd also the America and not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland helped them or elements of the Vatican help them and they got them from Germany down to general Italy and on boats to Spain and South America and South Africa\nA it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out and we took a big guys and we took it I meant andme Angola Klaus Barbie the Bush early on and Martin Mormon\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kind of we proved that in the book by dental work and so it was a compelling compelling a story almost on every page\nUm and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you know Jim these ss people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university\nYou wouldn't World War two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the death said go on a cap and we're in we're in a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people\nWho just ordinary people are just amazing I'm ... and when you read it people to all that couldn't happen yeah it did it and it could happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise in your eyebrows right now the thought of that I certainly understand the motivation\nBut I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two and certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind of justification\nFor whatever intelligence these people may have revealed to justify who want to this country and others the Vatican and others did in in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil that is what Harry Truman did ill and killing the ss we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black male to go after Adolf Eichmann\n... they had to say if you don't Mr President we're going to lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who did that and that that forced forced Truman to do it who who who blackmail on it\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear and we named the man I'm that if two men didn't sign on the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened in a concentration camps\nAnd an insult true that Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people he knew it\nBut he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWhite six six five oh jumbo number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill O'Reilly will

an example Jim and this is a pretty vivid example of what I'm Talking about here with the rise of evil in this country after Kavanaugh is confirmed and the day that he was confirmed\nA writer for the cold air program put out a tweet that said okay well maybe he got the Supreme Court job but at least we ruined his life\nYeah okay that bio and bill is on his ... said\nRight I'm going to submit that no one on your staff and certainly no one on my staff and Bill O'Reilly dot com could ever put out its we'd like that and keep their job because it's hateful\nAnd it is an evil act and I'll tell you why because capital as children\nAnd he has a wife and mother and father and this guy writing for cold there who's still working at cold there to no action against it is is applauding the fact that we ruined his life like that's a good thing and I think Americans have picking that up\nThe picking that this progressive left movement and teeth are these people they're dangerous yeah\nAnd and there's nothing in the world more tragically ironic\nThat people calling themselves and anti fascist who's tactics would be recognized by any member of the brown shirts the Nazi movement I mean to call themselves anti fascist is just tragically ironic at and sadly both of them would not even understand the irony\nYeah the good news is the good news is that there's not many of them the the bad news is is that they're identical to the S. A. in Germany in the late twenties and thirties there were Hitler's bully boys who went out and beat up everybody\nThat oppose Nazi isn't it's the same tactics is the same same thing but in America and a lot of these people and they apparently they all live in Portland, Oregon\n[laughter] I have a lot of 'em do yeah yeah\nSo I take a quick break come back with more from a Bill O'Reilly or get his new book killing the S.

their decision on voting\nBased on the fact that it's in the bag I don't think it's anywhere near in the bag probably in the Senate Republicans will gain seats because it is simply a do many Democrats are are having seats to defend I figure three or four seats myself in the house\nIt is entirely possible that we will see the return of Speaker Pelosi and then the the notion that everybody is
