came to me because\nI'm really interested in Russia and the fact that uh they have such an incredible ability to punch above their weight or in\nCreating this trip around the world you know you think about people think about Russia still some of the Soviet terrorists but while Russia has the largest country in the world it only has\nAn economy around the size of Texas says and they don't really have much ability to project power economically because of that reason I mean they do a lot of need natural resources that are having navy they can protect project power particularly\nBut they have an incredible way of I'm just\nLooking around and other people's business it's it's it's in a way it's almost that emission by Russia that they\nCan do better so they're going to see if they can make everybody else do worse and it's a very difficult opponent to deal with because they're not really looking to win anything they're just looking to make you lose\nAnd of course with all of this or is or the relative instability that's built into the system as I say it's almost as if a\nA a mob family ran an entire country and had access to nuclear weapons and that's the the level of of legitimacy that exists in this country keep in mind what would happen in this country let's say a president to President Trump for President Obama had decided that uh\nThat state governors were just messing around entirely too much in the affairs of the country so this point on no more lectures I'm going to a point all of a state governors will of course the impeachment and conviction process would take days or as the president was ushered out of our lives ... exactly what a Butte and did\nHe got tired of all my ... elected governors and so he appoints the momentum and just because he decided to\nYeah exactly and so you've concentrate and just this incredible power with one man and you know the checks and balances that we have the need either states you know it's very difficult for president the uh whatever way they declare war on Canada\nBut you know if if ... were running the place the analogy you would work I mean he could just do it I mean there's nobody\nTo say no or to put the brakes on and you know a few of a little dictatorship and you know a small country in Africa or something like that you know it's terrible for the people and it should be you know we should attempt to to help them\nBut it it's not a worldwide crisis so\nWith this book you know you have the potential and and car that's partially carried out to invade NATO countries on his border which he does have the ability to do and can do it at a staff of the finger I mean nobody's going to push back against him in Russia\nYou know and and something else about the the real Russian President Vladimir ... he has an incredible nostalgia for the evil empire I mean he has said is is a quote for attribution from Vladimir bottom reporting\nThat quote being that the most tragic thing that happened in the twentieth century and I think about that the most tragic thing that happened in the twentieth century which was Laden with super tragic items was the fall of the Soviet Union most civilized\nAt least in the top three of the best things that happened in the twentieth century he has an incredible nostalgia for that era so to the extent that Doug ... is a ... group and your character in the book read war that's a a disquieting thought isn't it\nIt is and I mean if you look at it as a lot of tune in to some extent the Russian people that have allowed him to ... stay in power\nThey are kind of obsessed with the power of Russia it's it's I don't know that there is anything they want to do with it in particular it's just that they want\nTo sort of desperately craved respect and to some extent the fear of other countries around them and\nThey had that uh you know in the Soviet Union they were a major player in the world that people sort of one named moved the world trampled they loved that and now they're sort of it's just a second rate or country I mean so\nThe country it away as always done much better under dictatorships I mean it's easy to see cripple as or in in the real life putting my book group and as\nAs and others are and you had a week of SARS and strong as our stall and being in or essentially is czar was strong and in those cases at those times Russia was strong\n...

Seventy in the mega ball is a seven [noise]\nAnd that's for a one billion dollar jackpot that's one thousand millions okay if you if you were to win that I'm which of the odds against our three hundred two point five million to one\n[noise] um\nWell actually ah since most winters are for cash you would get a billion you get five hundred and sixty five million the billion dollar prize refers to the newly option [noise]\nYou know for example I suppose that you could [laughter]\nYou could opt to receive a dollar a year for a billion years I [laughter] probably not a good option but does most of us would a would grab the the big money I mean what's the difference really you know for the in the lives of most of us between five hundred and sixty five million and a a thousand million or billion\nI mean it would not change I think the impact on my lifestyle measurably you know what do you do with that money well that's what I thought I Would ask you what would you do with the money\nWhat would you do with the money it's so much money\nOr there was a movie a few years back the starting to Richard Pryor and and in order to to uh\nGet an inheritance he had to spend a certain amount of money and the whole thing was about his efforts to extravagantly spend a certain amount of money which as as was pointed out\nIn that movie that was the whole premise for the picture a admirably done of course by by Richard Pryor or that it's not as easy to spend money as you might think it is [noise]\nAnd uh I'm just curious what would you do with that kind of money that this thing about it that a thousand million that is to say you could take a thousand people and give each of them a million dollars\nOr put another way you could take a million people give each of them a thousand dollars assuming that you got the full billion that's uh\nThat's just an astounding amount of money I make sure if your Bill Gates were talking a pocket change your talking chump change we're talking or when I leave a tip Scott thing but for the for the most of us that's a lot of money even Rush Limbaugh would find that to be a lot of money okay [noise]\nIt turned out to a long time listener well thank you\nWhat I Would do it why is I Would use\nThat money to try to get rid of his ... than I Am I have not heard of the\n... and ... for a little bit I enjoyed interests to mind by

had a Joe Hi\nGuys are taking the call oh actually there's a lot of God in the past and I've got a pretty foolproof plan for somebody to give it all the charities\nSo all of a tragedy did I Want to make sure we all heard what the Andrew said you said all of it\nAll that every penny okay ... okay this is the tax load then then I Would use that money you can borrow from your own trust and are just four point five billion in a middle incomes properties\n[noise] than with the money from those get paid back because you've got all the charities they give a billion Saturday in real money plus interest and you've got four point five billion in properties yourself\nWow how'd you get up from from a billion up to four ... four point five billion that that's that's quite a rate of return they're\nTwenty percent down on muscle twenty five billion or the properties\nOh okay well you've given this a lot of uh do you play a mega millions were Powerball\nOr only occasionally\nOnly occasionally well obviously here's a man who's ready for it gee whiz Andrew okay that that guy's got to the guy that planned out already Lewis in Mitchell South Dakota welcome to the ...\nYeah yeah now you're doing fine thank you ah\nI'm not as planned ... but uh uh I can tell you that a from a divorce or five years old uh I was supposed to\nBe removed from ah my\nThat I had a way and I haven't been done\nIt's called that mortgage company and a pay that off first\nAh and then uh always had a dream car I owned it for about seven years and then I had to sell it uh which was the ... general age so it's going to cost me about eight thousand getting ...\n... I'm curious how how big is your mortgage\nUh I Am only guessing gym because sharp and now for five years you're I'm guessing that that's probably about a hundred and ten thousand\nOkay so figure you're you're just a committed there between the mortgage and uh and getting your version of the general leave the old dodge city aren't here you're talking about two hundred grand there so that would leave you about a five hundred sixty four point eight million dollars [laughter] what do you get to the rest of\nIt I I I I uh I got three kids and unfortunately a through the horse\nOr a they don't talk to the anymore but I Would uh uh secretly set something up for each of them about two million apiece and uh\nAlso I'm a big animal lover so uh here in South Dakota I Would probably try to set up a no kill shelter and instead of helping volunteers run it to\nHave it be something to where they're paid employees a man that's about all I can\nTake well very good okay neither the or the first two million each of the three kids at six million you're down to five fifty eight point eight million let's assume that you you get a strap again on this center the you're talking about it was like a diamond even five hundred and fifty million dollars but but you can see what I was talking about earlier it's not easy to spend this kind of money [laughter]\nOh no no no uh I Know the ... you're talking about\nI really enjoyed it and uh it's true you you just don't know how to go about spending that kind of money in if you actually had a plan I think you would probably be a kind of person I wouldn't want to know anyway\nWell you know I as I say I would be very boring but I Would be buying all kinds of a of a a very a a safe and sound or bonds and the like I I Would I Would be setting up my family forever and all I Would allow others to really really blow a ton of bugs\nHonestly there aren't a lot that many things that I really want to do\nI mean you know the travel the world [noise]\nOh I suppose if you could afford it I mean you know sure take some some big vacations and and see a few places but I mean that's not a passion of mine a mansion or\n... not a passion of mine cars I mean you know most of the cars I wouldn't want to buy\nWould get me a a a a speeding ticket that would cost me a driver's license in in rapid order I mean it would be tough for me to think of things to blow this money I'm not a gambler I'm not a big drinker anymore\nAnd uh it would be tough for me to think of what to do with is All right thanks very much the Lewis Carroll in Rochester, Minnesota next on the jumbo had a joke as we have now as a one billion dollar mega millions jackpot tonight and does so far as we speak they've not announced it there are in the winters are good evening Carol\nAnd look at that time with you I listen to since ever since he hadn't even as the years\nI've not been on fifty you know I have had this show for twenty five an hour that I've spent

seems like that's about the time I'm getting ready for bed and it's just nice to hear what you're talking about and you've had some great kids so I just hang in there and keep doing what you're doing\nWell I Will certainly knew that\nIf I had 'em all that money\nThey'd give some to my kids of course\nAnd I like to take a few trips but otherwise\nUm to me money is just a means to help others and we have a wonderful YMCA and my sister and it's getting old and I would build to one at each end of\nTown and I'd make sure that we had employees that we're\nCaring for others and I have free membership for anyone who wanted to come and I'm\nAlso had connected with it a food pantry and I just think that that would be a good way to\nHelp a lot of people because there's family says\nI can see that\nBy bringing those children to the way they get a wonderful start in their life and it can make a difference in the rest of their lives just the way they are handled and treat it and it and\nActivities that are also and I know it feels good to me and then the other thing that operation slang for the children\nKnow yes the cuts palate yes dying give as much\nThat would get them on the road to being happy and accept it so those are two\nBut those are certainly wonderful things that are that you would do Caroline thank you for sharing those with this I Would tend to do things like that I think my old hometown of Lebanon, Missouri which was instrumental in in most of the things about me that are good\nI Would certainly give a large chunk of money to that home town the national radio hall of fame would get a big jump for me one thing that I Would not do\nIs give so much to an organization that it would tend to be corrupt do that is to say give a money all out of proportion and want to certain organizations ever had before\nWhich could frankly ripping organization departed I Would give a big gift to a number of places like if they go but but a huge gift I think could be
