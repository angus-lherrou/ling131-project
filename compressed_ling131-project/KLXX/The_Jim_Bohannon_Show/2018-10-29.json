mean his whistle blower even the right word because you've been sort of given the the green light to start talking about this right so it's not like your your in breach of some [noise] a A N D O or a NDA right\nThat's absolutely correct It's not I mean it's\nOne of those another one of those terms I don't necessarily correct people if they say it but now it's not really accurate when talking about me because my superiors asked me directly and specifically if I wanted to be the public spokesperson for the command staff or United States require a special section so yeah I'm actually sanction to do what I Do\n[noise] and and why did they choose this time um to sanction you coming forward\nAnd telling us about well what I've been highly highly highly classified state secrets why now\nYeah great question and the short answer is it's through a process of many many data points we have determined that it's far more\nDangerous can you secrecy a than secrecy protects and so at the moment we think the dangers of continued secrecy are far greater than the rationales for protecting the information are keeping it out of public sphere\n[noise] how does the [noise] um I Love this term that um that Richard Owen uses a breakaway civilization and these are the the people were ... that have benefited from\n'em back engineered alien technology or technology directly directly given to them by extraterrestrials how does the breakaway civilization feel about you coming forward and and he is I I get the sense that there there is this\nMaybe this battle going on backstage\nAh between various um intelligence groups in military intelligence groups and so forth [noise] ah about disclosure I mean is that accurate to say that that that not everybody is on the same page on this\nThat's absolutely correct there's definitely a conflict of opinion an interest in the different ah areas so\nThe military if you I mean which is really not even you again this sort of one bubble you know when you're talking about the military organization to participate but even if you just love the military organization that participate and then you lump a banking and corporate business\nInterests together and you love a state actors are people who clinically represent different countries and any other interests that may fall under that umbrella yeah everyone's got a slightly different opinion at the moment and we believe\nBy the numbers we have a majority of people who just understand that disclosure is necessary to preserve civilization and life on earth you you can't preserve civilization if you push chaos too far if you push environmental destruction too far because economic destruction too far\nUh there's just all kinds of things that you can't preserve life in civilization if you go too far and\nTo be honest a lot of the big ...\nIs that you can't preserve life in civilization if you go too far and to be\nHonest a lot of the big players on the stage or making large quantities of money and what some people need to understand is those people are finally understanding they don't want to break the machine to fix it because they're making a ton of money off of that machine\nAnd if they even as a breakaway civilization if they broke the civilization down here you know the the surface dwell civilization if you want to call it that uh it would still cost them a tremendous amount of money and so those civilizations aren't separate the breakaway civilization and the\nSurface to our civilization are not entities that can be separated from one another hazard like buying and bill accord that if you broke it or would damage I\nEither one or both of severely so I think we've made a pretty good case to get those people to understand that if the ... that we have to do this to preserve civilization life on earth and even preservation of the breakaway save civilization and the higher ups of the\nTechnological a covert military space program as we understand that needs disclosure to survive everyone needs to survive\nOn that somewhat comforting that they [laughter] and the breakaway civilization they don't need to slaughter the cow just yet when they shouldn't slaughter the cow just yet well we the ... the rest of us please I guess\nYeah the ... we we we that's often the kinder gentler term people call a people down here the surface dweller\nHers are and you know because of the people who are sort of contained onto the surface they can't really go anywhere else um and yeah we we think it's simply not a good idea or for everybody or for anybody\nTo do that to just wipe out you know the surface drawing civilization and uh Lewis some other breakaway civilization they need each other they're intertwined with each other we think the case can be made to bring the surface Charlie civilization up into the\nHigher or parts of the advanced technology civilization and bring it all together before just burns itself to the ground\nSo we should just disregard the Georgia Stones for now I guess [laughter]\n[noise] well it's a it's a guideline that the George ...\nPounds or guidelines predictions so you know their guidelines for different potential uh futures by people who have an idea of what they think is right or wrong but not necessarily what is absolutely the right or wrong especially when talking about the numbers of people that we should have\nA living on planet earth we don't want to overpopulate the planet that is a great way to destroy what we have here but we also want to get everybody on the on the picture because we have ... personnel shortfalls within the space program and we have personnel shortfalls within\nThe civilian parts of that program and so we really think that we need everybody involved in
