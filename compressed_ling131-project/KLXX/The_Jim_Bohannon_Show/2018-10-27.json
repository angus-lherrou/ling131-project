bit like a Saturday and last year in a shootout so we've kind of went overseas and stuff in these rocks all tonight but ah yeah Sam was given a you know I think at the end like a total um I didn't I didn't know what to do with really left him and Guerra says what's bullet we've got another lose and\nHe always gone back into that power play with her with her net empty and to me that's that's a ball game and Sammy obviously berries and [noise]\nUm ... because ... is a really good [laughter]\nYou just air air he's got his head up all the time in Rother says I'm might as well as Sammy a seal the deal get Patrick with a shootout so that was rather spit but um I Can't say enough about Sammy tonight you know Johnny Robert kind of gets lost in the shuffle here\nThe way the average score to ... a couple of clusters of quick goals it would've been easy for him to kind of get rattled and lose confidence but he stuck with it\nMade the safety ... gave his team a chance to come back to nights [noise] yeah and I think the frustrating part was at least for myself as a team says things got good skill and and then they get scores and high schools they they showed that on the back half I thought a with their first two were kinda just bounces and and uh just frustrated that way and I think that was a\nYou know that that that uh that could bother a goal to under some time when a you know it's not a tic tac toe players play that they're run on the power plant just ends up in the back of that but um\nYou know it was a there was another great night for him that's for sure one thing I talked with cared about in the first intermission but\nIt seemed like it was the whole point to the game other than obviously get two points here the whole point tonight was\nPlayed physical be hard
