exactly what Nancy mean sometimes sometimes you just a little goofy a are referring to of course the famous quote about Obamacare we're just going to have to pass it to find out what's in it or to what extent do you believe this could have been a rhetorical rambling on the part of ... feet below sea\nWell no I think I think what she did is give a window to her soul light sake you know you brought up Obamacare the fact that she and her party basically we're willing to pass this massive bill without having read it\nAnd we're basically engaged\nIn a a a propaganda campaign to fool the American people at least a portion of them into supporting those American people were told by the president and by the Democrats that if they like their doctor they could keep their doctor\nThey want to remember that eat Italy yes they were told that their premiums would go down I don't know if they expressly discuss deductibles but I Know the American people were not told that their deductibles would go a phenomenally\nBulls but I Know the American people were not told that their deductibles would go\nA phenomenally um higher to the point where the insurance was almost worthless which was the situation with Obamacare and and of course\n... I don't think the American people honestly told that what they were engaged in was nationalized saying I'm a significant industry\nWhen is it they you know health care system in the United states is

order to achieve again the enjoyed advise the means the whole thing was like that so Nancy Pelosi is engaged in that\nAnd I think this has been the strategy if the Democrat Party if we look at ... you know ... terms looming we have a series of candidates who are posing as something other than what they\nAre yes we've been hearing a number of things about people uh most notably a Christians similar from Arizona Claire McCaskill of Missouri\nAre quoted in recordings they didn't realize were were being made to order at least made public in which they indicate there are a lot more to the left than

Sorry you're kind of skipping in and out what was that last comment David and then I Want our guest to comment\nOkay I I think we need to hold a statement for the uh the Congress up there to put this on their forehead so that each of them can read it and says are a little respect would ah tore each other as you'd want respect you have to give ...\nYeah well they're certainly that's a that's a would be nice to add I think at this particular time your thoughts James ... and about the the tone of the political rhetoric of the day\nYeah and I think that sums up what David is trying to say and that's something I I think all Americans would like to see 'em a little more decorum and dignity among each other but basically you know with that the kind of commentary this collateral damage commentary\nHillary Clinton saying you don't have to be civil um and the\nThe basic um atmosphere I brought up the Kavanaugh hearings to see these mobs of people and they are ... percent that cause

black guy and like a a fat lip um\nSo yeah there's been some scary things for sure but I think that first one was more scary for me because I didn't know what the heck it happened a\nHollywood doing more of this now you had this return to the Halloween the movies with\nA a a\nCurtis a jam with Jamie Lee Curtis is are we going to see a return to those good old days of the of the scary this and the Freddie Krueger that sort of thing\n[noise] you know kind of it looks that way doesn't it I think that guy's face symbol on um have figured out how to make 'em really commercial um horror films\nAnd and you know and it was so interesting I think about the horror genre and Hollywood is it really is that movie that you want to see in a theater because you want to be next to someone even if they're a stranger you know it's a it's a really great reason to go and have a communal experience\nIn terms of of of how we view these things anymore you are the days of the the movie theater limited our wheels\nAs for I was asked that question a on a panel for my day job and um my answer was I Hope not because the way that we respond to storytelling at home is so muted compared to the way that we respond to them in theaters\nSo for instance um if you're watching a comedy at home you might smirk you know I might have a smile cross your face but if you're in a theater and other people are laughing you laugh out loud and when you laugh out loud\nYour body chemistry changes it actually releases endorphins and say you enjoy yourself more so I I Hope it I Hope everything's not just download and we sat and watched things by herself\nThe the whole future of of Hollywood I suppose is is predicated to a certain extent on the on the various revenue streams uh theaters for example uh get an awful lot of their money off of the concessions do they\nNot think so they do\nYeah does Hollywood kind of data but if you're showing a blockbuster movie in the theater bulls in the X number of dollars off of popcorn and a and the candy at twelve dollars a candy bar or does the does the the film producer get a cut of that that's where the money is\nI'm not that I'm aware of where you'd be where I Would yeah I Would be so I'm pretty sure we don't\nYou know All right ah in terms of of the\n... the creativity the that goes into a Hollywood production it seems to be the some of the highest concentrations of creativity these days go not into the TV shows or even necessarily feature movies you seem so to me that some of the highest levels of creativity at least\nPer per second of air time if you will go into music videos and commercials\nHuh you know what that's a really great question I you know I I can tell you and I think it depends upon the film you know when it comes to cost\nThat it it really depends upon the special effects you know the cost per second on an animated film is actually quite extensive\nCosts for second on something like um you know Star Wars movie very expensive Avengers very expensive so it's really more I think about the effects than it is anything else\nDoes do those Hollywood depend too much on affects how we don't have much in the way of star power in the script sucks but boy we've got the great ... computer graphic or a a special effects here as long as you're on the grill light and magic on your side can you sell the public anything\nIt now you can't you you can't sell it felt like anything I got to tell you consumers are so smart\nThey are so smart which is why you know I started digging into that the data side of things is to is to understand the customers more and there was a day when you could just make them moving in but he said I'm a ... this was probably more like twenty\nTwenty ... Twenty years ago [noise] um but now people are smart\nIf they can they can kind of smell a bad movie and it's not that I listen\nI from what I've experienced and I and I had to put it you know the the kind of start with that because I think it's fair either got accents everything in it for every movie in Hollywood but no movie\nNo script ever starts out to be a bad movie you know and all\nGone with the wind or Citizen Kane discouraged\nRight I mean and sometimes you might have a script they might have made to not totally confident in but it turns out to be a phenomenal film [noise]\nUm so you know but I I think people are are really smart and and you know I don't know do we rely too much on special effects and some of our most successful movies and the ones that I've personally the most proud of our movies like hidden figures\nSection some of our most successful movies and the ones that I've personally the most proud of our movies like hidden figures\nUm fault in our stars there wasn't a single ... and special effects in any of those films um Slumdog Millionaire was a an Academy Award winner for the studio and not a single effect\nI you know I I think there are a lot of effect certainly more than we've ever had um but I still think there's room you know for those films that don't at least I Hope so because those are some of our our best stories\nIs an article of faith among the good people in this country that anything that comes out of Hollywood is automatically be left wing of politics preaching to the rest of his career disagree\nGuided it preaching it doesn't feel like preaching to me um you know I I don't think that\nThat is fully\nAccurate I think that maybe some of the stories that come to us might might appear that way um you know it's funny I you know I sit in these rooms every day and you know I'm a girl from Oklahoma I grew up at his ... and a Republican household um\nBut I can still enjoy a story\nWhether you know no matter what my political beliefs are or or not and I think that you know what I Would I just what breaks my heart is ... sized stories had become because movies like hidden figures should never be considered
