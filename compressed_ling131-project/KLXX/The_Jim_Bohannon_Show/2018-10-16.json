others the CIA the defense intelligence agency and the national Intelligence Council his previous book is defeating jihad the winnable war and a one eight six six five oh jumbo is our number\nDr ... you take note of the idea that there are two spectrums of any allergy objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend that while that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subject the truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling I don't know if you're caught this in the cabinet or hearing the Democrat Senate starting with Cory Booker\nA used the phrase a truce\nWhen talking about the testimony from Dr fold\nThat is so telling her truth there's no such thing as her truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is this is what you get this\nPost modern is and this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics can be divided into two groups those who believe there is one truth and those that believe everything is relative the those that believe that everything is relative\nUm they they create the atrocities of the twenty ... twenty first century\nWill wonder if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that ah every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they were out to destroy the United states I mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would ah concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing policies in that direction\nBut what I just said I wouldn't subscribe do but how would a believer in subjective truth telling me that mice objective truth\nWas wrong but there's there's right\nWell you know the best they they'd have to fall into that our own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truth for multiple truth\nThere'd be no way for them categorically to deny your accusations so this is this is the ... the two of the whole situation so yes it's it's a very powerful weapon that you can use against the the liberals that spouting it every day\n[noise] you identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now what about those who identify Islam as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nWell it depends I mean is that the theories as the theology and then there's the practice so the question is what what is the practice or if if it's a Muslim who's living in America\nAre and and are behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's no problem if it's a country as such as Bangladesh show or elsewhere\nWhere it's ... becomes the legal system where shall real law actually becomes the ... of the land of ... such as Afghanistan than we have a problem because then the the truth that we hold to be self evident\nThe quality of the quality of the sexes these things fall\nBy the wayside so you know blanket statements or a dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies that is a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country and who we are actually talking about and\nUh one thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this\nIf it's about the context in which country and who we are actually talking about ...\nBut one thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left are pushing harder and harder or do outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat or you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go I Do think that they've overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\n[noise] [noise] yeah it's a very good question I'm disturbed that in the upcoming midterms\nFor the of the Democratic party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves a socialist\nA in a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of America millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America this is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years\nMore than a hundred million people were killed in the name of socialism communism so yeah I think the Democratic party all the radicals who have taken over the Democrat Party have managed to socialize this word and make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to have this it it it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations\nAdvocated control of the education of our young people to people especially if the collegiate faculty level in many cases of who have an absolute axe to grind and an very anti American ideology who are are less and less likely to try to even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty who are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor and presidents of these universities have not been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America\nAnd demanded to know why such and such and such and such is inspired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I I couldn't agree more are we abdicated the schools the high schools and colleges starting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody as absurd as dangerous as Bernie Saunders\nBecomes popular in America it's because we allow the education system to be taken over by the radicals\nTo David in Cedar Rapids Iowa the bull headed show with Dr Sebastian Gorka hello David\nHell of a chance that hey you guys mentioned earlier that there is a subject that sure it's an objective truth or\nBy the American lung association swim force and they should have at the council ...

solutions\nTo a health care problem that has not gone away Obamacare is still on the ropes of the Republican Congress has passed session could do nothing it seems about health care and yet the problem persists and it's a very real problem for many many people Lawrence calls in from champagne Illinois hello Lawrence\nGentleman I could you time more orientation errors GTC is that sort of like a political candidates except you're selling ideas about healthcare\nWell first of all his GDP and this was as good a time of need to have been some explaining exactly what GDP advisors is\nOrange thanks for the question always like doubting our company\nOr we are a consulting firm we traditionally help advocate on behalf of employers as well as patients and members of the healthcare system\nTo try to navigate what is often times very confusing system to do so so our clients normally are corporations that are trying to help their employees find more cost effective ways to help navigate the system\nOr I was there anything else that you are you wanted to ask you about Lawrence\nGood I think I can make my contribution now um I basically I'm a physician by the way I basically agree health care prices are crazy high\nUh also just ... allies in psychiatry now back in the days when I could charge thirty and thirty five and forty dollars for the gym in an hour I actually made more money that way then over the years as it went higher and higher a I Want to\nExpress my consternation and and and lack of understanding of what on earth happen there are those are days when I was very busy and I didn't pay any attention except doing my therapy keeping up mentally a medically competent and and my ordinary life but everything\nWe have some insights but um I Want to make a point here that uh once upon a time I think the medical world was more\nUh like I was able to do it in the early days of my practice\nOr the people were coming in the hiring me it was their our it was their time they could talk about whatever they wanted it was my job to try to keep the ball rolling in a constructive way that was going to help them resolve the problems that they originally came to me for but still they were\nIn charge in that respect\nI think that's different\nThan what your gentleman that we're talking about\nA yet I'm quite knowledgeable about the BPA ca and I understand the need to help corporations figure out how to uh buy health care for their employees and I'll be quiet now and listen I have another idea or two but\n... okay well let's let's get to that and the second or let's say on the line but to your response or substance and\nWell there's a couple of things and when we're when a wry we've started to see that I go back to the first part of your question or comment orange which was you know back in the day it seems different than it does today and that she gets back in the day it was different um as as we continue to monetize the healthcare system from a business perspective I've now\nYou you know we can actually draw very clear and close\nParallels to what we saw in the banking system right two thousand eight we had the banking system a consolidated into a level of what we consider to be too big to fail we're seeing that same thing of her in the healthcare system now health care systems aren't run by doctors any longer run by Wall Street run by businessmen\nAnd and and the challenges that we have here is that we can say I need to see consolidation\nUsed to use it you would have an insurance company in conflict with a hospital system or a doctor system trying to negotiate contracts and reduce the cost of health care they're no longer doing that\nAre actually working together and working together because of the health ... as a result of the Affordable CARE Act\nInsurance companies are are limited on the margin of profit per the AC a at Fifteen Percent now if I'm a CFO and the c._e._o. or Wall Street based organization and I'm limited to a Fifteen Percent margin\nI Want Fifteen Percent of a million dollars or Fifteen Percent of a billion dollars\nBecause my fiduciary responsibility is to my shareholder not to the patients that by my product and this is part of the challenge we have an healthcare system where the finance companies ... responsibility is to the shareholder not to the consumer\nAnd so we started to see this move when I got into this business over Twenty years ago there were over twenty health insurance companies in Texas where I live today there's four\nSo as the consolidation of the market has occurred and fewer insurance companies are in the market\nAnd they've gobbled up the market share and now they're going to the hospital systems and working in a line that used to you have a doctor and network with one maybe to insurance companies\nNow every doctors in network with almost every insurance company so this idea that insurance companies have the ability to utilize leverage to bring down the cost of health care isn't true at all discounts don't matter anymore prices do\nAll right uh the say the least the covers quite a bit of a thing that you would like to add to that Lawrence\nI can add and\nBring up the the second point a San jose is a thing um there's something strange about a a doctor's turning over the running of hospitals to people called hospital administrators\nIn about a a doctor's turning over the running of hospitals to people called hospital administrators most hospital administrators have a bachelor's degree\nUh they couldn't ever get into medical school yet of doctors who are no more and are smarter actually let these people run the entire\nBall of wax now related to that I think is the need to get these costs down hospitals are even worse than a doctor

...\n[noise] well listen I mean yeah [laughter] definitely has been the practice of the federal government for the last goodness multiple decades um to to look to move the money around and and effectively just rack up the debt let's look at the national debt right now\nA Social Security and and\nAnd even Medicare for that matter is is\nReally insolvent if you actually look at the way it's structured now and the money that's going out while it may have cash in the coffers from a standpoint of\nWe we the government reports that there's money to cover these things it is very true that they move money around in different ways they're borrowing against the defense fund and a number of other things to make sure that there's enough money to pay for one thing that they've committed to and this is again going back to the well we talked about in the first segment why Medicare for all\nA would be effectively just a massive\nAre the only way to do it would be to massively collect taxes and continue to borrow\nA with a baby boomer generation where they are with life expectancy doing what it is doing and that's the thing Medicare and Social Security we're not originally set up to be this ongoing thing Social Security was originally created to ensure that the American citizen didn't outlive their retirement savings\nRight and so but we distorted that in a way that now because of the advancements of modern medicine which are good we're outliving the system or at least the system the way it was set up and unfortunately this is just the way that government has unfortunately

enough\nMoney to isolate to to pay toward specialties but specifically when it comes to nurse practitioners and and I think that the nurse practitioners arguably one of the most deem valued or
