until January so you could have sixty days left with this Congress I'll be at a with a a lame duck Congress\nAnd the doctor Michael ... our guest is a public policy analyst and professor of finance at Stockton University and\nA lot of what we've been saying you're I think goes to the very core of a problem but I have always seen with the sort of thing and I guess I could summarize it this way that the more that a free trade zone involves disparate economies\nThe less likely is to succeed and again that's just right off the top of my head and I never got past econ one oh one but it just strikes me\nThat a disparate economies don't work things out so well so I think what I'd probably both surprised about is that we worked out this deal with by far the weaker less developed of the three North American economies Mexico first\nAnd it's the Canadians who is the economy is much more similar to ours with whom we're having the biggest trouble so if you would uh address my theory a professor you may give me an a through an ethanol take my lumps go ahead [laughter]\nLet me let me say this um you're you're you're correct um unless that less than developed country has some real advantage and making something versus another country for instance\nSuppose the uh and here's the example I use them I classrooms um suppose the the the U.S needs to wait and they need coffee\nSo we're very efficient at producing wait we have the right climate for it we use small amount of resources get a large amount of we were not so good at making coffee we don't have the right climate for it we can use a lot of resources and not get much coffee\nA country like Columbia let's say and South America is just the opposite\nThey don't have the climate or to grow wheat nor the the know how do they have to use a lot of resources and get a little bit of weight on the other hand they have a great climate for growing coffee and they're good at it so they use a little bit of resources to get a lot of coffee what happens they say\nSuppose the U. S. specializes in making just we were going to get huge amounts of weight\nColumbia says okay will specialize in jets making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for you and we\nBoth countries end up with more coffee and more weight without adding any more resources\nSo free trade benefits everybody well why somebody complaining you would say and the answer is if we stop making coffee in my example that make just sweet anybody making coffee is out of a job you say well you can go next week\nBut the skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has a a is very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products and sell them in Canada we'd end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is what happens there\nIn Canada we'd end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is what happens to the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else\nBut they say we don't want to do something else yeah we want to continue to make dairy products for and that's what the rub is with with Canada All right\nTo a call from Sharon in crane Missouri a good evening Sharon\nGood evening can and you've got about ... ...

in from San Francisco to lie to David good evening\n[noise] yes I Do in your guest I I'm Out here in San Francisco we've got two major a financial problems\nDirectly tied to this Chinese steel and uh one is the bay bridge which got opened a just probably shore to five years ago and it was\nThis was the new post earthquake Bay Bridge right\nRight yeah and in fact if you remember just a dollar value uh at at in the Nineteen eighty nine earthquake they said it would be a quarter of a billion dollars to fix the bridge when the new bridge opened a couple of years ago\nSignificant about it or not was the governor\nAnd this crosswords Sunday right okay yeah that was the Republican governor and little brown was the former mayor\nThe two of them put it together and they created they actually created a foundry in China to manufacture the ... the bridge apart there were very few repeating part so it was almost entirely custom\nAnd the they had something like twenty thousand inspectors per part\nAre you know each park had to have an inspector massive heart ... almost to the to the man they refused to accept delivery on the part yet it was over written by a a project manager who had no right to override\nWell that that sounds like a terrible deal I must say although I'm not sure quite how it fits into the uh the context of this discussion regarding a trade matters other than the fact that I I guess the professor bus or you should always look twice when dealing with the Chinese [noise]\nBut uh uh current in Rochester, Minnesota is a next step below courage\nHigh yellow the thing that bothers me about the uh the steel here from China is if you drive a car a lot and you have to have your brakes three done you may have found out over the last Twenty years that you can't turn a rotor\nAnymore because the Chinese steel that all the car owners are made out of is so poor\nThat it is not turn of all\nYou know years ago you used to be able to take a break rotors or your drums in and you could Milam down and get another life out of them\nBut nowadays everybody has to throw away their owners because the ... the Chinese steel maybe cheaper but the quality is also cheaper\nAll right I Want our guest to comment about that we've had two calls regarding the quality of of dealing with the Chinese\nIf it's that bad at least in regard to steal I mean you know when you when you buy a a broom and Wal Mart you really not looking for the the the the nicest brew him out there you want something that will sweep the floor\nOr something like this is well I mean a indicates that the brake drums a that's not such a good thing in the case of bridges that's a terrible thing maybe you will die\nOr is that the other problem in trading with the Chinese the question of quality if you do we had a question some time back about\n... I forget who was food or pharmaceuticals but there was some serious question about Chinese quality\n[noise] yeah that's that's always an issue in a product like steel obviously quality is a essential there especially going into products\nOr like a bridge or something that could cause some severe a\nInjuries but how about some of the smaller consumer product look at the textile industry so if I'm a California used to have a huge textile industry and workers were making let's say twenty dollars an hour and as a result of that they made a real nice shirt that sold for fifty dollars\nWell they decided to outsource to make the ... the uh shirts in China where people are at the time or paid about a dollar a day so now they can make the shirt a and sell it instead of for fifty dollars they can sell the shirt now for twenty dollars\nWell that some people would say that's a very positive thing uh it's negative in that people will lose jobs here but it's positive in that all consumers now can purchase much more uh goods and services because the prices are are lower\nExcept the course of those workers are outta work who can't afford anything at all I mean the notion that we should we should\nIt's strictly around consumers uh but that strikes me as a little short sighted and in fact it may be one of the principal reasons for what happened in the ... presidential election\nBy

that trailer about this new documentary\nUh but nonetheless as they say about the road to hell it is often paved with good intentions we're talking with a couple of veterans of that particular conflict\nRetired brigadier general build David\nAnd a retired lieutenant colonel Michael L. or a beep and also another military veteran retired air force colonel Randy Larson the executive producer and director of this new documentary film\nOr is that there was brought up I think that it's a good Brett's time for you to inject this before we return to the other two guests Randy and that would be\nA of the uh a bureaucracy ... through which you had to bludgeon your way or how how serious was that I mean did you receive a lack of cooperation or did you see of outright opposition to what you're telling\nNo there was no opposition but trying to put a documentary film the gathers a nine month\nIt's a marathon but at the at the paper in the spring when they get the facts white\nAnd he was a lot of different movies and documentaries they had admitted to the mountains but one of the most important things in their stories you know all the military leave the u._s. troops are simpler by George Herbert Walker Bush because we're starting to death in Britain will say in the morning and pat ...\nSo we had to send troops over there they weren't there for humanitarian reasons and then it turned into an incredible fight but\nAll senior military leaders in the show the man said we need some armored vehicles over there are groups get in trouble she ... him one case and Bradley fighting

outlive us troops in there the U.S troops couldn't speak Malaysian\nIt's night there's it's incredible fire going on I Can't even imagine what that must have been light and so as I've been doing this

support that Clarence Thomas and that was none other than\nDemocrat Dennis deacon see any of Arizona who Jeff Flake replaced\nA that's a that's true you do have a good memory or and so we'll forgive

says he he never blacked out I don't I don't have a problem with\nAnybody that had they drank in the eighties everybody\nBut when he says is adequate says that he did not ever blackout I don't disagree I think that was a place online why and that's that's where I have a big problem with him holding the highest court in ...\nWell I used to I used to drink a lot of them are blacked out either I I I I drank too much and there were times when I should have stopped him frankly these days I hardly ever drink at all\nI may be in this calendar year we're in October I maybe had maybe eight or nine drinks this entire year but uh I drank too much and I didn't like the idea that if you drink at all regularly that you automatically blackout is simply not true\nWell I'm not saying if you drink as it is not true but when he says he there's so many people that said yes I just find that hard to believe and I\nMean again there are various levels of of drinking I mean he said that he's he drank more than he should have but of course the real issue here is not whether or not he at one time even if he had blacked out\nOf that in itself is not what's at issue here the idea is that he would have done something horrendous like sexually assaulting somebody I mean for example I uh I I drank too much of an occasion but it's really didn't improve my my capacity for sexually assaulting anybody you know I just simply\n[laughter] I'd lose interest in the world you know\nYeah he's never been interested in either think that it's so I I certainly understand that but when I sat on a college student in the eighties I find that hard to believe\nAs well as those originally where are the majority of college students in the eighties did not suffer blackouts as such a again or\nIf they they drank more than they should uh there are gradations of drinking and they do not in my mind constitute an issue of uh of confidence to hold disposition especially for someone who today apparently a drinks very
