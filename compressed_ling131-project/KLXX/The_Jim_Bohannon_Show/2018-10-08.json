wildfire well they are getting worse they're getting bigger they're getting more destructive but it's not because of climate change entirely\nA large part of this again has to do with this fire suppression culture which means you have more Leighton energy building up in forests around the world more dead wood trees and in would that would normally be burned up\nIn smaller controlled fires but preventing that now this whole Smokey the bear fire suppression culture what is behind it I mean are these individuals that started this where they well intended or was there some nefarious plot I mean why did the Institute this policy\nAll my dad used to say that wrote the hell is paid with the death of bin ...\n[laughter] you have to go back in thousand years really to understand how this culture got started back when you add these people that we're living off the land what they did is they use our ... and\nThe landscape and so ... so we got here these old growth forest or a lot of them oh go for it so we have like ... and the east and the ponderosa pine and it's a quiet on red woods and the west\nEnd you can do these forest and they open them up and they built the cathedral like forced\nBy using frequent like ... hours because ... and walk walk through briar patch and get all scraped up and get a kick from red bugs and everything else and so they opened up a land of the new country for us and that's what it was about opening up the canopy\nAnd let us know sunlight the get down to grow the grasses and load yeah the fact that the ... most wildlife doesn't eat\nThe ... the wildlife 'cause most wildlife doesn't meet trees they eat the grass has given them they don't eat brush and so the trees need the space to a certain distance apart to be optimal for a good life our ecosystem so the navy staples all over the world built up\nWhat was ceded the U.S when they die from the cities in conflict and when the Europeans invaded in the United states and also elsewhere around the world you lost your navy fire managers who were using frequent far as the livelihood they would you know burn occupier patch\nYou burn it and after two years that fruits out unique fibers for several years but then you have to burn it again or otherwise a brush will come up above it shut it out your briar patch or do you have to earn a profit patch a certain way you have to burn\nFor blueberries a certain way you have to burn for different kinds of wildlife beer and Quayle and Turkey's whatever a certain way so they went through the woods burning with different kinds of fires back cars that are really\nLight yet bars where they wanted to really clean out an area or whatever so they were ten thing they were using a very ... of what we call ... culture today as they were economically develop their substance from the land\nAnd they had this deep relationship intimate relationship the land because they were part of nature and they were dependent upon nature and so they represent nature and they had this close intimate bond\nBut what happened than thousand years ago when\nLady people started the population starting to build up from technologies of you know bows and arrows and stuff whenever we had more people\nYou had to do to farming with you know people know farming is that there's a lot more work so you're not going to go to farming unless you've got a hot population that you've got to feed them so they got him in the farming as soon as you Europeans have gotten in the farming and using slash and burn agriculture\nThey started to lay waste to the for us and as I moved into cities and villages they mind the force which seemed limited use them for trees for building houses whatever for firewood for all these other different things and so they devastated most of the force of Europe\nDuring the last few thousand years so there's very few residual amounts of old growth forest in Europe so\nSo the cultural memory of the Europeans colonizer is so far in fact of being part of nature where there's a lot of the native peoples that were conquered\nHave a cultural memory we're living close nature and living in nature is not that far away so what happens is people have got divorced or Europeans got divorced from nature they separated from nature they've decided that they were to conquer nature\nAnd so what happens with this separation from nature ultimate results of what we have the day because\nWhat happens is is I Walk down to force in Europe they came over here and they start logging in Jamestown and they started law at new trees for ships for take back the euro\nBecause they didn't have the trees in Europe anymore and so you started logging in early part of the Eighteen hundreds I just started widespread clear cutting down the whole eastern part of the United states and they're not all moved out west later in the Eighteen hundreds during the ... revolution\nAnd people got even more divorce from the reality of nature\nAnd being part of nature and whatever this process what happened was with this cutting all these these old growth forests of the Navy's people had been tending and laying waste all these for all this debris from that you know the tree trunk is part of it but what really burns is a fine cops and the leaves and all that kind of stuff and so on\nI think some catastrophic fires in these cut over areas as well as there was no native peoples there to really manage to continue to burn it and you'll see like\nIn the southeast where it was a major was burning every four or five years\nYou know in the southeast but they were burning books were frequently and whatever and so the for sure that came over in Europe got caught up in these wildfires and a lot of part of the Eighteen hundreds in the early part of the century\nAnd they had to fight the fires and instead of really blaming themselves and blame people for what had happened they blame nature and they blame far then they started this arch Persian policy in the early part of the Nineteen hundreds that continues is a perfect play out in the western United States where\nIt's been so ingrained is and it's\nQuite different kind of fires in Florida and back in the twenties and thirties and forties that was that it was in California but the culture between my father and his associates in some of the forest service people that actually rebelled and covertly started prescribed burning after some of these massive wildfires in Florida\nThe culture never got stabbed at first blush culture never got established but out west that did and so it's just constant thing now the forest service is paying over half of his budget on the president fires instead of wildfire mitigation and my last full reconstruction projects right whatever they're caught in this try out\nMore and more feel better and better fire fighting with more and more fuel and\nYou know people like myself are trying to show that with the like the ... is the ...\nMillion acre plan for the western United States as a way out how'd you how'd you get out that this catch twenty two how you get out of this kind of cultural trail that you got yourself into right\nWell that was a yeah I have to say that was a brilliant dissertation you really I'm a condensed that down and and um\nI did a great job with that now a couple of things I Want to pick up on and one ... you you mentioned kicks\nAnd a ... this is a bit of a side road but I think it's an important discussion we have now Lyme disease we have people worried about kicks in and they're saying is at an outline diseases near epidemic proportions but you know the medical establishment doesn't really want to talk about it\nOr is that then tied into this this whole fires yeah ocean culture that Lyme disease epidemic\nHere in the southeast United States where I live you know this burning for clients as well as for myself\nI ... ever pick because it makes sense if you burn every year the ticks or
