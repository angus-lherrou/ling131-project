country or even before there was a constitution even in the discussion about drafting the constitution there were people\nWho felt perfectly convinced absolutely sure that there were elites who were crafting that document people in New York people in Philadelphia maybe wealthy planners in Virginia\nWere conspiring against their interests\nBecause really when we talk about populism and the

being worked against often and then the fairest way\nOr the bankers the elites me they whomever a and populism when we have outbursts when we have a rupture and a popular sentiment in the United

they were doing that\nUh there were anti federalist too there were people who said you guys are cooking the books against us and we don't like it um said this is this has ever been with us but

there was populism on the right\nUh uh Douglas MacArthur who had busted up the bonus army these were a pensioner from the first World War four oh the bonus that had been approved by Congress from the first World War and during the depths of depression they showed up on ... in Washington they marched on Washington and then they set up a tent city on the other side of the Anacostia River from where I'm sitting right now\nAnd a MacArthur\nHuh he was a a veteran of the first rebel rainbow division highly decorated keyword tanks into this camp and there was a reactionary hard line on the right there was a reactionary we've got to deal with this and these things but Roosevelt biggest concern when he when he called a Huey Long and Douglas McArthur\nThe two most dangerous man in America he was

land as I recall I may have a a thing that the twist you through I guess a like a three hundred and sixty degree\nA figure is kind of like a model rail and I'm sure that our gifts to be reviewed go knows what it is I don't remember it was very brief I remember that I mean that that it felt like it lasted about one second do you do you know what ride that was\nYes I Do actually I was one of the first rides I actually was on it it also had a little bit of a what we call a corkscrew which is just gave you exactly\nOn that that was um ... I think it was called the ... or something along those lines and was very short it only had that one little law that one not one little area but yes I'm very familiar with it and uh uh in today's standards it probably like a kitty ride but back then it was a it was pretty good and and of course ...\nWas a great place to to to put an amusement park right next to the er the opulent hotel and the and the grand old Opry and I have to admit it was uh\nAh I must be ... it definitely woke me up I I remember that that uh we had been quite busy we're doing my show from a from Opry land and and the couple of our staffers who were there with me and uh I guess you could say that I was a little bit tired at this point and and uh it woke me up Yes sir [laughter]\nThat there'll be no doubt about that [laughter] certainly did [laughter]\nIt was actually called the ... can involve the fire is if I ...\nThat are well anyway I'll put it this way it did lead me say this was often will just be saying well\nIt was okay and since you know as as a guest of the park I got to ride for free I okay that's fine but I paid to do it again no not really victim again of course that's a that's just me what are some of the places out there when you think Halloween and thrill rides\nPete tribute go what places do you think about\nWell there's some great ones out there that started I actually uh uh in I'm In law actually have started a I guess it was around September late September and go all the way until Halloween some of the places that come in line of course the universal studios\nOut their hallowed horror nights at universal studios and that's all based on a you know pretty much a American horror story the walking dead the shining great place to go a pretty scary now if you want to go the reverse in\nA place where you have to be totally scared and and ah you know they they do some good shows but it's a great place to go with the kids of course you got Disney World and Disneyland that have the Mickey not so scary Halloween a I guess a park and\nOff for the kids and of course you've got the booty you a Halloween parade and of course the fireworks to happy hollow wishes or over the other thing\nUh some of the better ones are as we just mentioned to that of course Six Flags and all the Six Flags locations have the right fast\nWhich is your Claire classic scare zones all you know where you go into these mazes and stuff like uh the sewer in the ... that the sewer souls and the witches layer and and places like that um and of course the the point has got hollow ah weekends\nOr with the great pumpkin or fast that that goes on there are ... zombie high school shows the entertainment is absolutely amazing my daughter actually had to audition for one of these shows at Six Flags and are they really are they really get into this big time uh I mean I even the chain stores\nSound extremely real plus they change the the names of the rides sometimes\nUh for example over at ... or which is a heroines in Charlotte North Carolina uh they've got an actual fleet street uh where you can go through the cobblestones of the street and of course demented scare crows\nAnd zombies in and of course uh you know uh the the age old uh you know Dr Jekyll and Mr hyde or be be found there as as well as a you know a bunch of other characters are\nFrom a lot of the novel is a great place to go so there there's a whole bunch of places that I Would say there's about maybe two or three dozen or that actually do this or and or they're just a you know the rise are still open the weather is fairly decent and people have fun\nLet's talk about the term age appropriate over how many of these are places you wouldn't you wouldn't take your kid even if your kid loves the scary rides\nWell the good thing about all these places whether it's universal studios knots berry farm which is in a ... that's ... basically Anaheim all we mentioned or the ... lights over Kenny would on how the screaming Williamsburg Tampa Busch Gardens\nA and of course heroines in Mickey's not so scary Halloween all these places that we've mentioned plus others um during the day you know during the day it really is it like fat or it all happened\nAnd and ... awake and that's pretty much uh most of these places with you you have kids in there and they're pretty frightened you probably don't want to go at night to these amusement parks but if you do there were scare zone their actual zones\nWhere you'll you'll be scared and and there'll be people that will jump out of corners and of course the mazes and and and all the different things that go on the actual entertainment themselves in the places that are non scare zones\nAre are very family friendly\nAnd very age appropriate so uh and and of course they they normally will uh will tell you it it it is easily marks where these places are where you can bring your kids even at night or just to see the shows are we just have a good time on the rise and not have to worry about\nYou know paint totally you know scared or or having a kid have a traumatic experience with that\nPut another way that the lawyers have made sure that none of these places are going to subject your kids do something that might make mommy and daddy call a lawyer\nAnd absolutely I mean at the uh the people that are here you know and again my daughter actually did this for several years she loved it and she had a fun time\nWhile going through college and and now there are rules and regulations that they follow\nYou don't normally if you're an older person you know that they're probably not going to try to scare you as if maybe or a teenage gal or or something along those lines so you know there are different marks and different people that they'll they'll actually go and give the full one hundred percent presentation and others\nThey know when to back down and do they know if if if they scared you\nThat probably the leave you alone if if if it's really really bothering you and again that's all part of the training program one of the reasons why I I liked uh he's in he's in parts of what they do and how they train people in order to make sure that it is a very good experience for for many\nUh and again there are there are there scare zones and there are ... ah you know if you don't need a scare zone then you know something is going to happen\nAnd when we come back and to take a look at that in greater detail in just a moment to them in a new\nMore to the ... and whether it's right on well seven\nHid nc\nOptics move crazy amounts of data at

to examine them I I think that they were certainly diffused and I know the term that has been used by the the government potentially explosive devices which makes me wonder\nIf they might not have contained explosives were not hooked up in such a way as to go off which would certainly explained why none of them did but I don't believe that\nThat ah they were were detonated because you will be destroying evidence\nBy mistake well I I I think so yeah I was just what I was just wondering if there was you know if they had given information as far as how strong they were\nI I've not heard any

me that it's something that contains explosive materials but it's not\nHooked up in such a way that it would go off now that that could be reading more into it then the government intended but that's how it sounds\nArms up by my main who cares that either went off for that I'm Still up well\nIt is edited it still is dangerous and all but it certainly matters in terms of how it was put together if for example\nLet's say I jam a bunch of ah oh diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate or something into a package like the Oklahoma City bombing but I don't include any detonator or method by which it could be set off\nThat that would be a potentially explosive device\nAny detonator or method by which it could be set off then that would be a potentially explosive device but it would not be something that you could expect to go off and that makes a lot of difference in terms of the the the motive of whoever was behind this\nOh yes sir um I I don't know anything about Bob except they hope will let the
