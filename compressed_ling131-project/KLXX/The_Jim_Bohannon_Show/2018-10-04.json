tonight the good evening Marty\nHi Jim another good one man I'm thinking the way with the signal processing speeds that we see\nAnd the um and and the ubiquity of connections around the globe I feel like the nation states are doing their best to keep up but I feel like there's a lot of its NGOs if you will there's a lot of uh an anonymous and uh uh ...\nOrganizations of people you know at a at a at hawk a level that are doing a lot to exploit all of the weaknesses and the Web and do that\nA factor as any nation [noise]\nAll right uh non government organizations for those who were not into the alphabet soup or a nomenclature of a ... ... what about that the Michael ... do you think that ah that such groups themselves pose a a a a threat as such\n[noise] well I Do but you know we have two hundred countries in the world that we have to sort of a coordinate with trying to get that side of the committee to agree on what to do about cybersecurity is it an incredibly tall tale especially when a lot of them are criminal enterprises of themselves so these NGOs that we call them\nGet a lot of them are just a ... they have a mass kind of an NGO and really they are they are at the government that they get ... by the government I mean look at how the Russians train these kids to hack at such a such a young age\nWhich is a great idea for that phone hacking but it's not a great idea for unethical hacking and we we need to train our children a lot more and ethical hacking so they can do great defensive so we have to have\nEthics and this is the problem we we almost to the point where we would have to have a world's cyber courts and you start getting into politics\nAnd and in bad actors that are acting like good actors and he's right on the money I mean I agree with him completely I'm just trying to add that they they might\nLook like outsiders when really\nTheir insiders who talk about Russia all day long I asked her\nWell let me ask you a bit about that than since you since you brought it up or is there any such international body there is of course the world courts into there are various ah\nAh bodies of the United nations most notably the Security Council of uh like I'm not sure that I wouldn't necessarily in many cases be particularly prone to to depend on such international bodies which I find in many cases it but didn't end up at best and the\nAnd the hospital to U.S interests that red worst but I I Am curious if such a pug bodies even exist usually\nLaw and regulation trailed far behind technology especially in this day and age\nNow you're exactly right and it always sounds wonderful and it's really dangerous because it's a really really really powerful weapon and I'm as pious plan to suit the side of how we all get along come by ah I I don't want this weapon given\nA to anyone that's not mature enough in the world is certainly not mature enough for this weapon and they will take it over they will regulate speech they will suppress their people they will\nThey will use it for propaganda and group think I mean it's just way too dangerous which is why\nYou know I always thought the United states should a control most of this still\nAnd and we're seeing this because again it's a fundamental lack of accountability we have nine wittingly\nPut all our shift said one big cloud\nAnd so if you can puncture that you can get a huge windfall you can find the fact that we have that\nAll sort of in one space it's almost like we should go back one eighty and do everything by paper [laughter] 'cause it was harder to screw up altogether and then you take the fact that people aren't really held accountable because the bad actors are in locations that are making a fortune outfits that alone is acceptable\nNormal something that's so it goes against the grain of sand people in this country you just can't be foolish\nAnd that would be really foolish and the United nations will forget it or maybe they have but it's just so far away it so
