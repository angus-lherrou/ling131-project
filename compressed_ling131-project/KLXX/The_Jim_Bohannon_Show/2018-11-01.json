problem [noise] here's it's amazing because Trump and Paul Ryan had been going back and forth on this birthright citizenship here's what Carlson said taking it to another level\nA bigger level about what this is about with the Koch brothers and Paul Ryan and some of the Republican elites and you if you object to things like this birthright citizenship ears Carlson\nObviously and some people say

just want to call names\nI read the fourteenth amendment pretty clearly now I'm a law school dropout I got into talk radio with a year left in law school but I can tell you\nThe fourteenth amendment clearly\nWas not about this and I love what professor east one set of how we may have gotten to this it was about trying after the civil war and all that carnage to stop the southern states from denying some form of citizenship to former slaves that's what it was about\nIt's clear just like Lincoln the film\nWe need to film that's what it is you know what that's the idea that Lincoln tell them I Love whether it's true or not Tommy Lee Jones the whole thing I'm\nDaniel Day Lewis it's tremendous\nAnd you know Lincoln by hook or by crook was determined to get the thirteenth amendment so

shouldn't\nI'm never going to be in favor the death penalty fine I just would like to know why does the obfuscate like this could it be thinks people in Pennsylvania really are in favor the death

welcome in\nOh there was a surgeon Brian I'm retired military and I surprisingly am very much against the death penalty but not for the reason you probably say okay can only do you can only do it to

it works and I would also put cameras they're [noise]\nAll right well thank you very much let me tell you I get this whenever the death penalty comes up and not someone who wants to torture engage in this\nI Want to use the death penalty and use it appropriately and\nIn a swift manner albeit with legal proceedings in the rest\nTo act as a deterrent and it can but we don't do it enough and that's one of the reasons why it currently is not we haven't done it in Pennsylvania all the way back to a guy who was a mass murderer years and years and years ago and wanted wanted to end his life he's the only one that's got in the last Thirty years or so I Want to say\nI don't want to go through all the average schemes of islands and\nTorturing and doing all that stuff\nIt also helps to get life imprisonment easier when you have that as a chip if you're not going to confess and this we're going to go through the big trial and all that you get life imprisonment versus the death penalty it helps to facilitate all that that's a practical argument for it\nI'm just saying though we have a man running for governor that the media other than what they did it Katie KIA which was brilliant [noise] doesn't want to probe this all this powers coverage all these people are ready to take a massacre oh my God\n[noise] and then ... says there's severe as penalties as heinous crime and all and they asked him well are you in favor of the death penalty for it [noise] I'm not going to end it just\nIt's amazing to me that you can get away with that just answer if you say no I think life in
