Botox\nWe will talk and their support to the program about the American role in the world and that its course has been the subject of controversy from the ball but this country was founded\nEnroll in the world and that is of course has been the subject of controversy from the moment this country was founded\nAnd it has increased in importance over the years as the size of the power of the United states has grown our responsibilities have grown and this old world with ours has shrunk because of\nThe jet aircraft in satellites and the Internet and the host of other factors we are a part of this planet and a major part of this planet whether we like it or not and so we're talking this evening\nWith Robert Kagan he is the freedom and senior fellow with the project on international order and strategy in the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution\nA columnist for the Washington Post author of a number of books including his latest the jungle grows back it's published by come up in some time America and our imperiled world Mr Kagan thank you for joining us tonight\nThank around me\nThat's a quite a title the jungle grows back what's the derivation of that\nWell if you think about the fact that you know the world have been living in for all its flaws in pretty good uh but you know there are forces out there in the world a forces coming from China and Russia\nOr Iran and terrorists that you know want to sort of destroy the world it's created and that's what I mean by the jungle growing back and we need to continually push back against the jungle or it'll it'll take us over an adult us\n... and now of course there is a a view that has a at various times been the stronger or weaker but it's never disappeared in that view I guess can be summarized as a\nNone of our business none of our business let's just to stay out of the world to uh keep an arm's length ear will just to sit back out on our own shores and make our country better and we won't we will go meddling is somewhat but at\nThe shore and I mean it's very tempting because of course it's costly to get involved in the world but I think what we learn in a in the Nineteen thirties when we we tried to pursue exactly that policy we tried to stay out of the world is that ultimately the world comes back and bite sauce\nHaving spent some time in our past life in official and unofficial as the um I just disagree with his premise that the Iraq War was justified whether we should be after I started at all given the fact that we've been there now for over Twenty years we've had changed a darn thing you know the country\nYou're thoughts police are\nWell I agree we have not been effective in Afghanistan or you know let's not forget why we went into Afghanistan you know we were attacked some of their uh I think we would have been done better if we had\nTaken out of out from Afghanistan or they had an opportunity to attack us which assembled that we bought a at doing during the Clinton Administration you know as for Iraq I you know I'm not going to go back and say that everything that we did was right in Iraq but I Do think\nI I I still have a hard time believing which better off if we had Saddam Hussein in power\nOr that would be yet another vicious dictator or that we can now at people who are now carrying out assassinations or in other people's consulates like the head of Saudi Arabia or we would have Iran still and so you know we make mistakes as a country uh I certainly make mistakes\nOr in St Louis about what we should do but the real question it seems to me is a are we going to deal with the threats that are out there or our way and ah unfortunately in the middle east there are real threats that we already have seen on September eleventh that come out and attack us and we have to deal with them they're rather than having to fight them here\nAnd to keep in mind also are the areas that were brought up by dog a one as regards Iraq Saddam Hussein\nDid not only have programs of weapons of mass destruction but he used chemical weapons against both the Kurds and the Iranians he had a nuclear weapons program and let's not forget that\nAh as for a Afghanistan that was again the headquarters of al ... which was a so inextricably mixed with the government of the Taliban that it was hard to tell the two apart when the U.S forces finally reached a\nUh cobble a in some cases or a Taliban government functions were funded by Osama bin Laden and al ... money let's not forget that we had every reason to go in the problem I think we have in many cases\nIs are thinking that we can do things like this are on the cheap and the quick a particularly the second ... Iraq War the notion being that that will go in will pull out the or\nThe underpinnings of the ah Saddam regime and the entire country will rushed to the notion of a free pluralistic western style democracy and as we have learned a lot of parts of this world a culturally have a hard time going down that road\n[noise] well that's exactly right and I think you know sometimes you know we we we learn the wrong lesson or whatever mistakes in Iraq then let us to do nothing and\nRight and I think you know sometimes you know we we we learn the wrong lesson or whatever mistakes in Iraq\nThen let us to do nothing in Syria where now we have Russian forces we have a rainy and forces and we have terrorists or says ah you know threatening us our neighbors sending hundreds of millions of refugees are in Europe and I think you know we can't we can't do everything and we should be everywhere\nBut there are places where we are going to have to address some of these threats or they will in fact affect us directly\nWell six six by boat jumbo when eight six six five oh five four six to six as we go to a Marty who calls in from east Texas into Marty\n[noise] yeah Hi Jim uh it it's a I always enjoy your show you know if it's like I'm I'm working on a thesis right now is a historian that the arc of history actually is\nInevitable there was going to be somebody who discovered the new world that was going to be a country that um\nThat are not a country necessarily but there was going to be powers that map to the world and that brought in marketing pillows and and and commercialism around the world that we're going to map to where they were discovered the world that we're going to be part of\nThe progress that brings us to the point that we are today and I feel if that is inevitable and America seems to be the uh the chosen vehicles for the inevitable\nA position that we find ourselves in the world today where we are combating a individualistic notions against a you know I'm collective is notions and that's that's\nSomething that I think is important to consider\nAll right let's let our guest to comment on that are your thoughts about uh the the arc of history if you will\nWell I I don't know about the arc of history because I think a lot of things are contingent and and I really do think they depend on human actions but there's no question\nThat the caller's right to say that you know the United states found itself in a particular position\nOr that do other country was in an idle some of that had to do with geography you know we've talked about being surrounded by two oceans which gave us a certain degree of security but it also gave us the ability to send forces at maintain stability in Europe and Asia and prevent or is there\nA that would eventually engulfed us and it gave us the opportunity to to affect an international economy in a way that benefited our road so I think that's you know there is something special about America and we shouldn't forget about it whether you know whether there is an arc of history I guess remains to be seen by\nA certainly United States has shaped history where that's where this since well yes\nAnd in and of course it is it this guy be if there is an arc of history we certainly are ... yet in a position to be able to\nAh accurately predicted one eight six six by boat Jim bow and of course we are a little ah ah to be heard not only in our affiliates stations but also a jumbo hadn't show dot com which means or anywhere in the world and the skill joins us from the Philippines where it is a broad daylight ... gill\n[noise] here's Jim I'm just wanted to comment on uh on your gifts or abused a drill team like Korea and Japan has\nUm creepy a arrangements are with the United states and and under certain conditions we could read a trip wire\nFor the U.S to enter into a into another major conflict\nIs is if or Korea or a [noise] a Japan were attacked and a lot of people don't realize it or not that many years ago this war's United States territory\nNineteen forty six that's true although in the case of ah\nHow many ah potential major conflicts exist and that is to say I'm not sure just exactly how many countries out there or are covering the Philippines these days\nWhile they are they we we do have an ongoing problem with the Chinese building a well artificial island into\nAreas that are are are claimed as a either territorial waters of other countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam or a areas which should be considered international waters point taken\nAll right let's not argue has commented about that that notion of a of the some of the a bilateral arrangements we have around the world with the countries such as the Philippines or with the Japan with the with South Korea\nAnd the possibility that that these arrangements might drag us into a large conflict to Robert Kagan\nAll I actually think you know are they actually have the opposite effect if we are reliable uh allies we will deter\nA China from attacking them whereas if we are pulled back and and and those kinds of it this\nWay will encourage Chinese attacks and then I think we all get drawn in\nTo conflict anyway I mean the fact that we are reliable allies out their means that we can maintain stability and maintain deeds and not have to get into war is if we think we can stay out of the conflict that involve China and Japan and Korea and all those other countries out there\nI think we're kidding ourselves we've already discovered\nA twice over the last half century we can stay out of those kinds of conflicts\nAnd uh if we try to do so uh uh if we tried other words to go for quote the peace and honor in our time we usually wind up with either one\nThat's right and you know people talk about or offshore balanced SARS but that's what we were in the Nineteen thirties and the consequences of that oil we wound up having to fight on shore so I think it's better to live this ability

in the suburbs disagreeing with people in the city it's really hard to see any kind of geographical line uh and we don't have the kind of fundamental institutional difference that we had\nBetween a slave holding south and a capitalist north so I think we're we're obviously ingrained disagreement and we see polarization uh but I don't see a civil war I think that was a very special circumstances\nI certainly am happy to hear you say that and uh I certainly hope and and I actually think that you are correct Carolyn ... Pennsylvania now good evening Carol ... you say that it and you need to keep that radio turned down Carol this could be a very long call [laughter]\nCarol [noise] I don't want to say much all I Want to say as I Am against the United states doing any first strikes well\nOkay I'm not sure that uh that we have an economy plated or as a matter of a of a your thought process Robert Kagan\nA I guess we would have to define a further first strike I doubt that we're ... to go around and let's say when they first a strike a nuclear option a full scale World War three type of auction of option although my guess would be that there may be places and circumstances in which\n... proactively engaging a problem before it gets worse and something less than the nuclear level might be on occasion beneficial\nAnd typically are engaging a problem before it gets worse as something less than the nuclear level might be on occasion the beneficial [noise]\nYeah I mean we certainly I I we I Can't imagine those using nuclear weapons in the first strike that stuff's not been our policy in it and it it is not going to be but but yes if if we saw a a crisis developing a that might result for instance in another terrorist attack or\nA in a in a war that we could forestall a by taking some action I think we have to be willing to do that as we have in the past and up and you know try to do it as intelligent lives selectively as possible but you can't rule out the possibility of using force although not nuclear force if that's what the caller's talking about\nYeah yeah they they get into

there is or you know the human species regretfully imperfect better more highly competitive but I see a comparison in the original ashtray the tragedy of the commons\nAnd at times when you have people that are vying for specific resources or do they will come to conflict rather than a compassion\nAnd unfortunately a classic example of people that are still deep rooted in hatred among each other is the conflict in the middle east because it's so biblical\nSo I mean people just don't get along at certain points in times when they think something of of deserve a value of for them or their their uh ethnicity is going to be taken away and jeopardize\nLet me offer a thought here about two areas that were bound to be conflicts forever one would be the war in Northern Ireland which of course did not last forever another goes back to some years ago\nWhen I was working with a young woman who said that she wanted to go cover the next war and she was moving to South Africa [noise]\nAt the time I said well first of all I was just back from Vietnam myself I said I'm not so sure you want to cover the next war but knowing you maybe you really do I said if that's what you want\nThen that's probably as good a place to go is really the only place I could have put on a par with that I suppose was was that somewhere in India or Pakistan well of course India and Pakistan have not had an all out conflict in quite a while and there never was a full fledged war in South Africa\nIn which the south Africans ever had to use those nuclear weapons that they in fact later admitted the existence of and dismantled so uh if you want to look at at those conflicts alone\nAnd it was true you know Europe and Europeans have been fighting each other for centuries and people said well how can how can we expect to bring Europe to peace and yet and yet we were able to now I'm not saying that that is you know whatever we did in Europe we can necessarily\nDo in the middle east it it may be more than an effort that we want to make but I agree with you Jim that you know you can't look at any of these conflicts in Northern Ireland is a perfect example\nA and say that there's no way of of putting a lid on it maybe people might still hate each other\nOr not like each other but it doesn't mean that they have to be at war with each other and I think sometimes outside forces can really play a helpful role in that regard\nYeah and then they get I get it boils down to the fact that perfection is not the litmus test here ... you know things are made better I think that's a much more a plausible a

Capitol than in all the decisions he made out of the ... and one thing you see what I mean\nHe is using one thing and and again I'm I'm curious how Jimmy Carter would react if such charges had been thrown at him I've interviewed Carter so I don't even have to to ask that rhetorical question I Know how we would react\nHe would react or very intensely he would probably out Kevin Cavanaugh in that regard not to mention a although we we should in this context that Kavanaugh wrote an apology that appeared in the op ed pages of the wall Street Journal saying that if he went overboard that he apologized for that so [noise]\nYeah I I guess I must say I I put Jimmy Carter the category of ah\nWho cares quite frankly I don't I consider him a has been to some extent never was and he was a better ex president than the president so [noise] yeah I see what you're saying and I I appreciate the your thoughts are Charlie thank you very much for that Pam in Sioux City Iowa good evening them\n\nThe show all the time on my way home from work and make far I'm actually calling from my car that I\nI think what the kind of a west and the cello slashed Gail and I'm an independent I not Democrat or Republican I Am an independent and I think I don't think it's that they want to they're trying to tell people what to do\nI think their point is they have millions of followers\nAnd they just want to let their followers now how they feel I don't think they're trying to tell them how to how to vote I just think that um they just again they just have millions of followers\nOh they do that and I and I'm sure that you're correct I mean the problem I have is really the fact that there are a lot of people who may very well form an opinion based on what some celebrity says that's the part with which I differ or that they both have the right to speak out oh without question without quest are great\nGreat great but I it again and like I said I like I I really respect you I listen to your show a lot and again I think that\nI think they're just trying to reach all their followers and just trying to get the vote out you know\nThat that ... in which case ... together because as I say I firmly believe that each of them probably injured their career to a certain extent so if in fact it was that al ...\nA boy when you take a hit in in your career for something you believe in the well that's that's worthy of applause Richard Durham North Carolina about high\n[noise] hey Jim how're you doing I'm well thank you\nI'm a on my way home also from work in a I'll listen to you on a regular basis and appreciate show I uh I Believe I've always said this to my wife that\nI Believe the um celebrity have a certain responsibility when they get\nTo a certain point of saying that they want to use their\nThing did she get into politics that's one thing that are actually active in politics but when you have so many years the day that\nAbsolutely do not know what's going on and they add allies these people and if they believe that their idols want them to vote a certain way that's the way they should go not knowing\nWhat the consequences are us feel that that's the wrong way to use you're saying\nYeah I I again uh\nI I think what they have to say and how they say both both does a count of very much uh so I see what you're saying and and the that would be actually wagging the circumstance is good for them back it up\nTo them in the middle of new\n... shooting to the ... weather is around ...\nIt's an out of\nYou think you know movies for this installment of film trivia

expect this year with a medical officer from the Centers for Disease Control Dr Lisa gross cough or less gross cough or what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say uh we can never really predict for the coming season or what it's going to be like how severe\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say oh we can never really predict for the coming season\nWhat it's going to be like how severe it is going to be right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states um flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October um but right now we just can't predict what the coming season is going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it is going to be\nExactly are those who say well uh I was ... committed last year or I was vaccinated and twenties or dream or somebody may need to realize and that is a a flu virus was a very sneaky food which keeps changing on his\nYeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change um flu viruses change constantly um and\nThat's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season to the next the vaccine is changed to reflect what is thought to be the thing that we're going to be seen most of in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year\nLook look back to last year than the uh what kind of a reason was that\nYes so last season that she doesn't Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most he's severe seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand deaths\nUm we had one hundred and eighty recorded so far pediatric that's from last season\nAnd one of the the things about it was that it was a season where um the activity was very sustained across the country for many weeks at a time and really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one\nUm all of that said we can't really draw any conclusions or make any predictions about what we're going to see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant about flu and that is that the older and the younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely to develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have debts and\nThose are the very youngest in the very oldest um those under five years of age particularly those under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nI'm older said we we also know that there are individuals outside of that age group for example those with some chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill\nAnd even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who could have you know if you take any individual\nWhat individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm even previously healthy people young adults\nCan get severely ill\nWho have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs there more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available this year um the two basic types if you want to divide them into two broad categories are we have flu shots and then we have um the nasal spray vaccine\nShots are given with a needle generally and they um are made either with no virus at all or with virus that's been an activated and killed so it can cause disease and then the nasal spray vaccine is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't multiply enough to cause any disease\nOf course most of us are not at all confident to make that choice or uh other than the cost that through and I wouldn't be one to scrimp on those which one was more effective at at least based on past years\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer it because I'm ... one of the many things that\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer it because I'm ... one of the many things that very about flu is vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and that can depend on the person they're age their health status\nHow good the matches between the vaccine and what's circulating and also can vary from one vaccine to another\nUm so the most important thing people can do is talk to their health care provider about what that means they have available and they can help select the right vaccine for you\nIn addition to taking the vaccine water other precautions we can play against blue or it'd be bloodier every year we were told you sure to always wash your hands a lot\nWell CDC recommends a sort of a three part strategy for preventing flew um and also severe illness from flu and one of those things is to um get vaccinated every year if you're within the age group that's recommended", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "19"}
