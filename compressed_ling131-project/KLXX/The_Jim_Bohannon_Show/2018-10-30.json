I Would do too I I Would to David's point also said this is that um\nI have spoken to some congregations or heard from congregations that say even if they the option of an armed guard were were viable for them which in many cases it is\nSome of them have very been very clear and expressing to me the fact that they don't want to do that they don't want to worship with\n'em an armed guard it almost gives them the feeling that they've ... related to terrorism or terrorism or the threat is driving in clearly that's an option you know clearly that is an option that's what they've chosen I also want to be clear is I'm not suggesting by any sense of the ... the imagination and into your first point Jim\nHeartening every target is neither possible nor practical there's a men's cost there\nAre I Am saying that within the confines of the or the options that you have it is certain\nThat's cost there are I Am saying that within the confines of the or the options that you have it is certainly preferred to do that than it is to station the armed guards if if if David so concerned about\nThe image of the ... you know philosophy that it gives of of having a a an armed guard there are a hardened target you know\nPut the overlay of a hardened target in an armed guard there I'm suggesting of all of them heartening that target before you put a guard there at least seeks to dissuade or deter or to protect from those that are inside of there so\nUh you know one of the spectrum of things I'm not I'm not suggesting we go to this I think to the degree that David saying the other thing is is is\nWe we we have heart and targets every everywhere it's just the terminology we go to the courthouse ... you know you're the courthouses oftentimes protected that's a form of art and target\nWhen you fly from point a to point B you go through TSA checkpoint there's a lot of scene and unseen things that go along there that target as hard as well too so let's let's not parts too

are there are things that you can do out there and there's not a case of somebody throwing up your hands and to and say do nothing nor is is the notion of trying to instill good will and people a bad idea but it is certainly no panacea\nOf people who engage in such activities are pretty much beyond that level of persuasion although obviously trying to reach people in their formative years was

it's harder to do that to old buildings\nBut today in Europe you can't go to a synagogue um without going through multiple ... metal detectors I went to a synagogue in Madrid a couple of years ago you couldn't go unless you a made an appointment in advance went to the synagogue the day before showed your passport had attract\nThen you had an appointment as to when you could come I wanted nine

each of a Trump or Obama can take their own responsibility for what they said but on a wider scale I think that a lot of the actions that we're seeing are ... and not the extreme behavior to this

and she wouldn't answer about she said she wasn't going to run for president but she er she wasn't running in twenty twenty but she wanted to be president and shortly after that she made the comment it's going to take a lot of work to do all the damage that's being done\nI mean the American people are following a lot of what has set the tone of it's being set by all these politicians and you know during the Obama administration and there was a lot of it's not the way we are it's the right thing\nHowever he felt was the way the entire nation was to feel\nThat there's no doubt about the fact that politicians are not as responsible as they ought to be I'll do many of them are frankly in the business of trying to stay in office they'd be all the way to do that used to not commit to anything

so I just think that there's so much anger and hate I mean I I Can't believe that I have\nA car prison events one mile from where this individual lived uh it's just it's just unbelievable and I just wish people would stop thinking about politics for a while and just keep thinking the fact that these eleven people died and something has to be done\nI I Would agree on one boy that you made Ken and that is that we do in fact spin a bar too much time talking only to like minded people\nOn one point that you made Ken and that is that we do in fact spend a bar too much time talking only to like minded people [noise]\nUh most people today are spend their time with like minded people in person or on line on social media and ah that does tend to create an echo chamber and I agree with you\nThe

written the them published by St Martin's press and ...\nWhy we hate each other and how to heal talking about the impact of pushing us away from but knowing for example who lives two doors down a warning here ah ... alert coming up much\nGood being an older fellow I can recall pre air conditioning and we used to sit outside of a summer evening because there was a cool place to sit on the porch and neighbors would be outside and we would just naturally start to converse\nI remember when we got our first air conditioning unit\nIt was awfully comfortable in that house but I Confess at that point oh I I still do the people I had known before but new people moved into the area I was less inclined to know your thoughts\nAnd before but knew people who moved into the area I was less inclined to know your thoughts\n[laughter] and I don't think that the games are allowed I think that the wisdom advisory um so it would give you another one that that's not for my book but this is one from the book but it's the same exact point\nIn the last Seventy years in America the average size of new home construction in the U. S. has grown by more than three acts more than three times larger average new home size now compared to the midnight in fifty\nBut what are the things we know is that when your house gets larger and you're like get large gets larger the separation from your neighbors gets larger and you end up having fewer of those relationships in your community and so there are places in America where people are thinking a lot about what do you do to restore that sense of walk ability so that neighbors know each other and rely on each other more\nAnd there is there's a move in some communities again it it feels artificial sometimes that ... but\nI but one of the things we were trying to do is move from a big huge back deck like I Confess we have at our house\nOr to a front porch which is closer to the proximity what are your neighbors are walking by there is happiness that's correlated with having gone through that shared experience not just of getting to converse with your neighbor 'cause you're not locked up inside your house\nBut frankly having even something in common as boring as the weather on those days when it's really hot and you were sharing that front porch of because you didn't have the air conditioning it was something you went through to gather\nHumans are relational beings we are social animals were not just nouns our verbs we want to do stuff and we want to do stuff in common with other people and a lotta times shared experiences even if there are imperfect\nOr become the foundation of future character and future bonds even scar tissue or on your on your fourteen year old or when you're a seven year old is something that becomes a foundational experience for future memory\nNow than the drop in our average lifespan now that's a real physical problem though it's not about relationships\nOr at least I don't think it is ... this has been one of the hallmarks of the American existence shura the next generation has better opportunities higher income or education and they live longer what happened\n[laughter] yeah I actually think it is related to relationships at the national institutes of health now there's a new consensus emerging in the last five to seven years um that the number one health crisis in America is actually loneliness ten years ago you couldn't find anybody at the national institutes of health\nIt would have told you anything other than obesity as the number one driver of health problems are and and public health expenditure and the U.S now about Seventy percent\nOf obesity is viewed as EPA phenomenal of loneliness or is it downstream consequence of loneliness it isn't the case that people get fat and then they lose their friends it's that people get lonely and then they get fat\nAnd so at the near term biggest driver of costs at American health care is an obesity is defined as being more than thirty pounds overweight and a a pretty hefty share of American about thirty four percent of folk\nUh are obese most of that is a downstream consequence of loneliness opioids addictions overdoses suicides\nA whole big range of the new drivers of early mortality are things that seem to be related to not having a lot of social architecture and your life not having a lot of friends not having a lot of community not having membership and a lot of organizations this is really new we've had\nPretty good public health data on what people die of four eighty to a hundred years right now and we've only one time in the last six years had even two years of declining like expectancy\nIn Nineteen sixty two Nineteen sixty three that was a flu epidemic that bridge over the calendar year and we had two straight years of declining life expectancy this year pointing Eighteen organized a third consecutive year of declining life expectancy in the U.S\nAnd it is driven overwhelmingly by deaths of despair suicides an addiction and overdose\nFear of declining life expectancy in the U.S\n[noise] and it is driven overwhelmingly by deaths of despair suicides an addiction and overdose and opioids is one of the the big drivers most all of that is related to decline and community that's not to say there are also economic consequences\nBut there is an interplay between declining economics and declining community so bunch of places in America\nThat we think about sort of the industrialized saying you have economic collapse and community collapse working in tandem fewer jobs are less sense of meaningful shared work with other people and the declining sense of participation\nNeighborly association of America and these kind of crisis or or the crises are vicious cycles\n[noise] All right and that covers the problem is most of which I think we were vaguely aware of all not not as well outlined certainly as in the book them but the second part of the subtitle why we hate each other and how to heal what are your solutions\n[noise] I'll give you a three and four big ones are number one we have to figure out how you put your phone down at the dinner table it sounds to some also maybe the broader way to say it\nIs went up to figure out what our technology as for 'cause technology is amazing
