vote\nAnd that is to say the millennials are and the those younger than that particularly the Gen x rays and people of of that nature\nWill find out a bit of why uh this uh this is\nA one eight six six five oh Jim bar number one eight six six five oh five or six to six with our guest is David throw he is the founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and publisher of the independent review David good evening\nGood evening to you a gym and let's start out by taking a look at a couple of projects that you have a a instituted here are the love God love and the catalyst what are these\nWell I'm a few years ago we created a video series on YouTube to target millennials\nCoal love of it's a satire of its on liberty but it's a satire of big government\nAnd what triggered this um is the fact that millennials are voted overwhelmingly both times for Obama or as you said didn't vote and the basic view that they had was the government's going to take care of them\nAnd uh the Democrats' progressive and so forth believe they had this generation and their hip pocket but they wanted a guarantee sort of lock it in that they keep on voting them an office and the way they're going to do that was Obamacare get the kids to enroll\nCan look I'll become dependent on the keep on voting a sin and um [noise] that was the plan but something happened on the way which they didn't expect which was you may remember that when the Obamacare website came online it didn't work\nYou know I just wanted to call or two thousand Thirteen [noise]\nCenters of never said anything critical Venezuela or Cuba or the former Soviet Bloc or North Korea or what he says well we need to look at the Nordic countries the Scandinavian countries like\nDenmark Sweden and Norway and the claim is that these are socialist countries and there were well and people are prospering and there's a higher standard of living and so on and the problem though is that the all three of these countries um basically the\nThe property that exist the assets are owned\nA overwhelmingly it privately about Seventy five percent of the wealth in all three of these countries is owned privately and the economy generally speaking our market based economy\nVery much so in fact is we're we're overdue for a break which we will take you are but we need to emphasize something the only way\nThat the Scandinavian countries could ever afford the extremely expensive cradle to grave kind of coverage that they have is by having road bust\nPrivate sector is that I mean private sectors that are are far more open and free of regulation than ours are I mean is that something that people don't realize that they think that this is just some giant or\nA socialist a would be paradise well some of the programs or socialistic but the economy is very private sector or are they couldn't afford it we're going to come back and talk some more what a fascinating idea finally reaching people who have\nDo a great extent withdrawn from the system I mean they they still have complained but they don't seem to know how to articulate them or to uh to make choices in this in this context looking back with more

car should we covered it talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre\nAnd you're right and I finally ... kind of France pranks on an airplane every state\nThe state of the of the young voters that is the group which has consistently and legs in an election ouch notch voted uh\nThey vote but the the least of any any age group in the country and for reasons that I've never understood I remember casting my first ballot\nAnd I felt a a sense of empowerment or I can do what I got my driver's license which of course is another area which many young people can identify with with me in that regard but a ... it's unfortunate because this is the method by which people have an option of this country and if you don't use that\nThat uh a franchise uh you'd be able to exercise your franchise we have trouble nobody likes of flabby franchise\n[noise] yeah I think I think that's true um I Do think that just reflects the the cynicism and powerless nature of their outlook\nNow but they make themselves powerless I Know you don't you don't get involved you know what are the issues you don't register to vote you don't vote well who told is that you're powerless\nI Know and the better part of it also is the fact that they don't they don't have civic education they don't have access to education American history they don't understand the world they live and\nWhere to go I mean why did I Am at the end of it was\nOf the failure of the of the school system um and that's where I'm at you know that's another whole issue of you know the case for educational choice for so for us\nOf the of the ... the school system um and that's when you know that's another whole issue of you know the case for educational choice and so forth um which I think is is definitely in the ascendant but it it it is reality and so\nThat's why we were focusing on the hook for them being the questions they were asking\nAnd the fact that they were not willing to trust the usual suspects does Ike guy so to speak and the ah so the commanding heights of the culture and that they no longer trusted\nThe political elites which is sort of catching up with the rest of the country but uh in their case especially now\nI'm millennials have left for college and are starting careers\nAnd families and so they have to buckle down and figure out you know how are they going to get through all this so they're look there's you know they're even more interested in in answers and practical way to get through this so uh that that was the motivation for\nUh creating the series and creating catalyst and so on\nSo our our interest is to push this as far as we can uh we were talking before about uh the view that many millennials are supporting socialism\nUm and that people like Bernie Sanders talked about the Nordic countries and you were you were pointing out correctly that these countries are actually quite robust market based economy is and to give you an idea of the percentage of of ownership I'm In these countries is about Seventy five percent private of the wealth\nAnd if you compare that to say a country like China China is just slightly lower than an art in order to countries in and of course is a very robust economy despite the problems with the government so um\nThe uh I think the opportunities are enormous and just to give you a further idea if you rank the um\nThe levels of private wealth I'm a country ah it turns out that Denmark his twelfth Switzerland is for Norway is twenty third sweetness fifteenth I'm\nNorth Korea is at the bottom a hundred and eighty us but the U.S is Eighteenth so the so the U.S is lower than Denmark and Sweden\nWhich is a remarkable when you think about it we're going to come back and talk some more with David throw you found a president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute the website independent dot org you learn more about these series\nThe love Gov and the catalyst one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number and we'll be back with more of the ... in just a moment\nTo emitted new new\nTo the end of her career and whether I thought well seven\nCity\nAre you prepared to navigate today's bond markets for your clients\nWith decades of experience\nAnd not fast has helped advisors uncover fixed income investment opportunities through volatile markets\nUm and uh so we think that all those kinds of factors should be part of the communication strategy for this generation and\nThose questions are not that different from other people around the world um who come from different cultures how do you make the ideas of liberty relevant\nAnd compelling for people so the the fact that millennials um are receptive in the way we're discussing um and we understand how they've been miss educated they're misguided in interpreting certain things for example um millennials have been taught\nThat the great recession and a two thousand eight was caused by greed and the free market\nAnd even though the reality of it is that the federal government created the recession because of the Community Reinvestment act that was started decades earlier\nThat created a gigantic housing bubble and that was not sustainable it burst and of course the usual response was taken which was to have government bail out\nThe different firms that had gone off um and took these high risk um investments which were essentially either mandated by the government more incentive by the government so\nWe don't have a ...\nI'm like ... examples of allegedly the failure of free markets are fallacies and that their cynicism about political authority is even more justified it makes a huge difference in their receptive to the idea of liberty\nWill come back with more with our guests David Thoreau again the website independent dot org ... he is the founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and we're looking at in a way\nThat new ideas and thoughts can actually be transmitted to a generation that has rejected a lot of pressure traditional ways that we do that\nBorder cub money six six five oh jumbo back in the moment\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of

I was loading a a a website that uh well it it has to do with the Christian persecution quite frankly and I was just looking at some of the uh [noise]\nOf Vladimir Putin's and the Russians are NATO remains a very important alliance the Turks for a while or tried to obtain membership and that other Western European gathering the European Union but they at the time they were applying they simply\nWere moving in the direction away from a political freedom\nAnd uh they didn't pass muster\nAnd are these days are turkey which was once a a pretty reasonable ally with the Israelis has gone the other direction\nThey haven't got all the way there's really not Iran or Sudan\nBut this latest the circumstances just the latest example of what can happen\nWhen a country that falls into the throes of a religious fanatics and that's the direction that turkey seems to be heading so we're certainly glad to hear that a river and Andrew Brunson\nHas in fact\nBeen freed and I think we can safely say he will never return to turkey which would feel like a pretty smart move on his part\n[noise] uh\nThe court in Turkey had sentenced him to three years in the months in prison for his conviction\n[noise] ah but since he had already spent two years in detention he will not serve any more time runs that had rejected the espionage and terror related charges in strongly are maintained or to the country that he had engaged in those such activity\nAnd it it seems again that [laughter]\nIt's highly unlikely that he did or that he would uh what it sounds like\nIs another attempt at taking a shot if you will\nAt a at Christians in this world and I'm just curious you are your thoughts about all this is this a case of hyper sensitivity on the part of Christians as the case of a a exaggerating it would seem not by the statistics I gave a just a moment ago\nThey're granted there are an awful lot of Christians in the world\nAre but there does seem to be a fair amount of persecution and what is particularly telling in many cases is the extent to which much of the world will look the other way [noise]\nAh like they're they're only Christians\nAnd that's a a an odd attitude\nUnless of course I suppose you you fall in with the identity politics kind of nonsense that well Christians tend to be a\nA rich wealthy quite western countries or some such nonsense which of course by the way it is not even particularly true but if it were it still would be ah beside the point\nWhere or at least it ought to be ah beside the point\nIs that it is ironic indeed that some people in the west who\n[noise] it is it is ironic indeed that some people in the west who\nMost express themselves with the the various freedoms that we have who make the greatest use of those freedoms are the least willing to defend them it it's ironic certainly if the forces of fundamentalist Islam or where to take over this country the people they would go after first\nWould be what they would consider to be the liberate teen residents of say places like Hollywood for example\nAnd yet those people in their mad quest to appear to be a freebie tolerant uh we'll try to show tolerance for the most intolerant people on the planet just kind of bizarre just kind of bizarre most of the central tenets of western civilization\nOr actually nourished by the Christian Church and I certainly would not be one to say that the Christianity has an on blemish record in this world certainly the or the Spanish Inquisition just to be at one particular example\nBut in terms of a of a civilized and influence uh and in terms of uh the push toward personal freedom\nOr despite any number of of instances you can point out which ah\nChristianity was not always on the side of freedom the overall thrust of it throughout history has been in that direction and the countries which have become the most free had been nations in which Christianity has been the dominant religious force and conversely the countries in which\nAre the greatest persecution has taken place with the exception to view a totalitarian communist nightmares like North Korea or the area of the world that is both consistently on free\nUnstable on wealthy would be the swath of territory from roughly Morocco across North Africa eastward\nThrough Egypt in the middle east and the further east until you get as far as Pakistan that swat a predominantly Islamic countries is uh the armpit of this planet in terms of most ah\nStandards of uh of human conduct a behavior and the living conditions\nAnd since Islam in that swath of territory is so dominant\nOr if in fact it were a pasture or a pastoral paradise\nYou'd have to give him credit and since\nIt's not then so the blame must go in that direction I'm not sure exactly what it is but uh it's just unfortunate\nAnd uh again yes of course there are many fine Muslims in the world but in many cases it would have to be said that they are fine in spite of their faith and not necessarily because of it [noise]\nSo I find it odd that there are so many apologist\nFor some of the excesses of Islam particularly in that portion of the world where it is the predominant faith and so many people are willing to persecute or at the very least look the other way\nAt persecution of Christianity which certainly in recent centuries has become a force and one of the principal forces in support of the notion of free expression of individual rights and the host of other things that could be put under the general\nA title of the western civilization just a sad circumstance\nOne would like to think that the the release of the river and Andrew Brunson\nIs a sign that this is changing in Turkey ah my guess would be it's more of a sign of the pressure placed on the Turks\nIt's a sign that this is changing in Turkey or my guess would be it's more of a sign of the pressure placed on the Turks by a President Trump and not necessarily a sign of any kind of significant change in their policies the Turkish government is moving\nPrescribing Lee in the direction of an Islamic point of view not good for turkey not good for the region not good for NATO not good for Europe of course the tiny chunk of turkey remains of the European continent with the bulk of it of course in the in Asia Minor\nIt's an unfortunate circumstance\nAnd we're happy for Andrew Brunson happy for his release happy that in fact this story has had a happy ending but for so many others that has not been the case and I'm just curious\nHow you folks feel about that one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six\nThere are many things in this world which ah get curious er and curious or as they used to say in the Alice in wonderland\nAnd it is it is odd indeed [noise]\nThat one of the central forces for personal freedom and the world that I think it's safe to say that that is generally crew of Christianity or can be so persecuted at times and the ... and for the civilized world to look the other way as it as persecuted\nWhereas a of a force which with the exception of the ... to ...\nVersions of a of a communism that still exist in places like North Korea there is no more despotic our own free portion of the planet\nThen that portion of the world which is predominantly Islamic that's not a condemnation of every Muslim\nBut it is I think a fair condemnation of the poorest of the world which is predominantly Islamic where are the home grown\nDemocracies of that area where are the home grown supporters of a personal rights and
