I Know the the reason for you because politicians are cowards and they want to keep the job and they time you tackle a serious problem it probably is still a problem because there's some controversy attached to it and politicians hate that well that's what they got elected for was to tackle these issues\nNow I see that that thought has been flushed out in a considerable study by Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who has written judicial fortitude and it's published by um counter books and subtitled but last chance to rein in the administrative state that Peter thank you for joining us tonight\nMy pleasure good to be with you Jim\nAbsolutely are your thoughts if you would on on the witness trend really began and and how it has managed to avoid being challenged in court because to me it is it is a uh imminently challenge a bowl of there'll be such a word\nBut it's it's a very much challenger bill and I hope that this book will encourage the court\nTo start looking at this issue but it really began I think in ... what was called the progressive era between the Eighteen eighties and about Nineteen twenty\nWhen there are many social and economic changes going on in the country and the people who are then progressive is led by Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt\nThought that the constitution was just too rigid to deal with all these problems and so we had to make some major constitutional changes apply to a lot of smart\nOr a ... ... people who had no interest in a particular issue but we're credentialed and and intelligent and we'd make decisions on the basis of what is best for the country\nRegular people only about on certain three year fixed rate loan scholar concentration in conditions equalizing Leonard licensing office he takes an endless number three thirty initial conditions exclusion may play\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a homeless here dancing on a\n... we've covered it talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre are ...\n... ...

I'm going to be done about that ah we have a call from dark who calls in from Wilmington, Delaware to speak with our guests are Peter Wallison than the good evening doc welcome\nThank you for taking my call is August ... just a one or two quick questions raised a metro all set out just set aside less than a course as always Mr loss and\nWhere do you see this court editor President Trump on her opportunity under justice Gorsuch cabs cab at all and if there is no justice appointed us to a second chapter or two does why did\nYou see this court filings turning back to the out of the cameras are not are you hopeful for the future outs are what are your thoughts on that story\nThat you did you have two questions that that was that was\n... where do you see the court going on at least justice and are you all over the future that we could turn back the tide or I Would say almost fifty years\nAll right very good at what drives you do see a go again in other words though yeah I Will go to Jim Cavanaugh tip the balance and to actually show some judicial fortitude\nYeah I actually think that this is very very hopeful\nI at in the book I talk about the position of each of the justices but I say that with the appointment of Kevin ... there are five justices on the court who I think are ready to modify some of the major decisions that have led us to this position\nI'm the one that is most important here is one called ... the Chevron case or Chevron deference where the court many years ago and\nPrior to that the lower courts had to defer to the to the interpretations of various agencies of what powers they had been given by Congress that's very strange because it leaves the courts out entirely\nAnd so that that decision in particular has been a warrant for the agencies to increase their powers tremendously and interpret the authorities that they had gotten from Congress\nOr to grow their powers now with Kavanaugh there he's a constitutional list he's a text you list just just like Gorsuch is and the other three people including especially\nJustice Thomas who I I dedicated the book too because he has always been concerned about this question and now he has four other justices I think on the court who are ready to take the steps that Alexander Hamilton expected them to take when he rose that\n... that the federal is Seventy eight paper that I've that I've named the book after\nA while it it's a remarkable you know I understand Congress being leery of hot potatoes it's cowardly it's chicken but it's understandable they have to face the voters the courts don't want to be so reluctant about\nThat well I think they really are concerned about not having any a direct support from the public\nThey don't need support from the public and I mean if we don't even associate with the public they they have their own circles for cocktail parties in the like\n[laughter] I agree that that there is of that but Alexander Hamilton was right and when he talked about fortitude because he was saying yes okay the courts are independent and the reason he was writing about it is because he had he had been asked why are you giving the courts\nThe judges lifetime appointments in this democracy um why shouldn't they stand for election and the argument he made in this federal is Seventy eight is they need lifetime appointments so they can stand up\nTo the elected branches in a democracy the elected branches the president\nThat Congress are bound to have more power because they're speaking for the people\nThe courts are only speaking for the constitution\nI'm so they had been since that those decisions in Nineteen thirty five and the effort by the president after that to a point seven new members and that's changed the entire nature of the court\nUm they had been reluctant to take on the elected branches so that I think is a reason and we have to get the courts to start doing\nThat well we certainly do a Alan on the road in South Dakota tonight good evening\nPrayer thanks for taking my call sure [noise] [noise]\nYeah I was going to mention I just turned it on here and I didn't have an [noise] but uh ... I think\nYou know he said that uh\nWhere Republican or a democracy and I agree with that may be with you know kind of the time frame little piece of the problem started you know it's also around that time learn from what I've read where\nYou start became you know people start calling us a democracy is not a Republican I since then I've heard your guest said several times referring to our democracy\nI mean look there's one of the ... we have a representative democracy that's why although and maybe that's because until recently it has not been technologically feasible for us all to have one great town hall meeting or we will now of course read the point where those technologically feasible although I think it would be a terrible idea\nWell first of all to have one great town hall meeting or we will now of course read the point where those technologically feasible although I think it would be a terrible idea\nOr we can even talk about that a bit later on but but the point is we have a representative democracy that is the republic we elect people who make these decisions that's how it works or anything you want to add to that a breeder\n[noise] no I think that's exactly right I think ... many conservatives I'm afraid and I'm certainly one of them many that many conservatives are afraid of the term democracy but we have to understand that the that the founding fathers actually thought of the people go running through a legislature\nAnd the legislature being elected by the people would make the major decisions that is still a democratic structure and so conservative should not worry about calling something a democracy\nThat democracy that fit the founders didn't like was a democracy where ... which is called the direct democracy where the people make the decisions themselves immediately in in in some kind of um ... uh a conference or structure but that's not what we\nHave the old town hall meetings in the newly homeless a good idea that's right but we'll we'll get we'll come back to them it's time allows but right now I'm calling from Sharon in ... Missouri hello Sharon the go ahead yeah\nAgain Mr wants and maybe I Am ... face back I'm\nVery movement to have a constitutional convention and one a couple of the things that I Hope comes out of it if we do have one is that we had guessing that term limits\nFor the legislative branch and me reigning power of executive orders as the president now if that is Dan\nAnd the legislature cannot uh doesn't have to worry about running for office and is there like it would that change that balance so that the courts possibly would\nMaybe step up to the plate a little bit more because a lot of these flights or would have to take more responsibility a ...\nWell the way the way I see it in the way I discuss it in the book is that if the courts actually step up and say that certain laws that Congress passes have passed\nMuch legislative power to the executive branch if the court to ... or ... would actually say that\nThen that would force Congress to make these decisions itself the ... for Congress as Jim had said before is that it's too easy for just a pass on to these agencies all of the major decisions\nAre having to be made for the new one coming up in a break the doesn't move here so we will amplify on that but when we come back in the moment\nTo them in a new to him in a new\nMore into the ... and whether Enron was well\nWelcome\nFiber optics move crazy amounts of data and even crazier speed and filed by horizon is the one hundred percent fiber optic network\nWith ... get a good connection you'll get the fastest Internet available download speeds up to nine hundred and forty ...

particular case a illustrates the point that we're making tonight to Peter in in that or if in fact Congress went along with it however a wise or unwise that decision may have been\nUh it wouldn't be the subject that we're talking about tonight I don't believe\nThat no not unless it was an action that was not the rise by Congress this is exactly the kind of thing that could happen if Congress hasn't authorized it um and one of the problems is that this very general legislation that Congress\nA passes sometimes allows administrators even ... conservative administrators to take things into their own hands and do things that Congress had never intended\nExactly it hip and that in fact that's what we're talking about them that would be unfortunate but if there were specific authorization by a majority of both houses of Congress it\nIt it uh a ... in other words if the authorization will specific enough than you would have had in effect a law uh presumably that was passed Gary in Butte, Montana good evening Gary\nGetting ... thanks for having me on the shores pick up things and then get on on\nYour your I agree with almost everything your guest has said I'm a minor point I I Believe we should call it a constitutional Republican and instead of a Democratic Republic but that's my\nMy ... years and I think it really is we're getting into some addicts federally\nYeah yeah yeah it it does mean something to me but I don't have the time to sit to explain it on your show but anyway um and then the\n... the main thing is that I Want to call about is the constitutional convention and that that is something that we definitely do not want to do there's there's conservatives out there that wants to do this and think it think\nIt would be a very good thing to do but I I agree with your guest it could be a runaway cost us ... read the history of our convention they weren't supposed to um go off and ride\nAround here but you're not going to get anything that would be authorized but it's such a convention that could take effect without\nActually having thirty eight states ratify in one form or another let's not forget the articles of confederation\nWere falling apart at the time that that happened and I would I Would just add one more thing if in fact we don't go that route then most of the major changes that need to be made right now being term limits of Congress be at the no budget no pay for Congress\nBe at a a an amendment that would say that Congress may not pass a law that affects the general public that doesn't affect them equally all those things you can forget about\nWe are at an impasse and the mechanism as it is has currently been used it's already it's in the constitution but as it has been used today we're all amendment to start with Congress then we can forget about any of those things ever happening a\nBeauty let me add one thing they're ... and I and I think much of what you said is something I agree with but\nLet's focus instead of having an argument about whether we should have a constitutional convention let's focus on something we can do now because I think we are headed for some serious trouble unless we start raining in these these\nBut how do you ... how do you were swayed short of of of some method of of of force ah ah how ... how do you persuade the uh current judiciary and Congress\nSome method of of

helicopter kid from the helicopter\nSo it's getting worse it's helicopter parents on steroids\nZachary exactly\nWow All right let's let's talk more about that in the company of among others the tonight to Don who calls him from Albany, Oregon at the weather channel and even though and they're good at doing fine how are you\nHearing hurting myself I just got to say the helicopter and warm or parents sound like the kind of parents who were glad they have their children grow up poor you know bubbles that that was possible\nNow you know I don't think you're you're ... exaggerating entirely too much they're done I mean there are some practicalities of course involved in that but I ah Dr Huber I I think the the Don May be closer to the literal truth and he'd like to think he is your thoughts Dr\nI I think he's exactly correct and unfortunately what that ... is a an adult who is dependent upon the world for things and not just the premise that completely entitled they deserve this\nAnd you know I was taught right on day one I don't deserve anything I have to earn stuff to to get anywhere in this world\nYeah uh what one would would certainly hope that that was the case I Would I Would like to think Russia to your your thoughts on because I I think that it probably comes close\nA deal here right now uh you know I I keep I keep hearing about about people like this I'm not sure that that I Know of any of these people granted I I I ... the young people I Know my my that my my definition I'm Talking about a\nA parent's today's parents who are generally a course in their uh their their twenties and thirties and some of their forties or the\nOnes I Know which are not a a wide swath of humanity they're they're very definitely not this category\nOr I mean they they do discipline their children their children are expected to do certain things and yes that includes bumps grapes\nA failures of picking yourself up dusting yourself often end the whole learning experience is there any kind of a of a originality about this or a geographic concentration because I don't know that I have ever actually met\nA helicopter parent much less a lawnmower parent\n[laughter] well I don't think it's necessarily originality I mean I I taught university from Nineteen Ninety six and killed two thousand the Seventeen and one of the reasons why I was glad to to step away from that was probably the last four years\nI we get calls from parents go what do you mean like travel got us thirty on their cats and I go well I Can't even confirmed what your kids in my class and they would blow up and like what do you mean I go well you know there are actually federal laws against that they're they're adults I Can't disclose anything you know\nAnd you used to be when I got a thirty on a on a test I was in trouble today the teachers in trouble\nYes at at the university level not even at the high school level [noise] wow uh I had one flew flew in from New Jersey to Texas to to talk with me about their child's grade [laughter]\nWhat a good heavens above that that does almost eight lay literal helicopter or this case an airline I guess a remarkable hour ride a Greg in Springfield, Missouri joins us on the jumbo headed show with the clinical\nA remarkable hour ride a Greg in Springfield, Missouri joins us on the jumbo hadn't show with the clinical forensic psychologist Dr John Huber a good evening Greg\nGood evening gentlemen said Dr mass question are okay I've got I've got a one year old grandson and ... on kind of worried about situation the daughter in law I mean I don't even know if she'd be considered as long more ... and something else going on I mean\nShe obsess taking pictures I Love your desk is if he stands at you know it's like he's the only big hits ever done it and then when they don't even she won't even let them\nLike ... myself grab them laughing I physically go there and grab them because always on top of them they you know and it can't be around neither grand kids you know they're playing and they get into says there are there some germs you know it's like real fit and I'm almost worried about I mean as\nWell you know maybe you should be more than almost worried I'd humor Dr Huber sounds to me like Greg may have found an example here\nAnd he might have ... I'm I'm assuming this is her first child\nHow 'bout that gray is is is a very ...\nOkay and you know at first child you know they they are at the store and they are in the living room and they spent their pacifier out you got to go stick it in boiling water for ten minutes where he can put it in\nA ... by by the time she has her third kid she's become dusted off it doesn't matter she ended [laughter] you know where they're going to get up out of the gutter and a lot of them out you know [laughter]\nSo there are even more dads that'll change how they will see\nJobs to pass by and she goes by the new ones is Lou and Lou oh\nWell I don't I Hope you get a hold of her now the ... minds it yeah going going way longer\nYeah remind her that you know you you raise the child and spoil the grandchild or you spoil the child you'll be raising the grandchild\nYeah exactly as we go to the next call here as a Dr Huber I guess you do know the reason why ah grandparents and the grand kids get along so well\n[laughter] yeah they have a common enemy [laughter] okay\nA little cynicism there for the program I Love it to Tom in Port Angeles Washington ... ...\nOh gentleman I see a one of the things that generates show adopt her mom just the amount of legislation that's out there that you know the seat that the CDC that child if I look at people\nIn a in in the communities\nCan get word of something in your your child got injured or you know did you leave go to play in the yard and this happened or the charge if the the car seat issue of who you know do you have the right one for you or I had it\nAt that age right that if there there's a whole lot of stuff that that that you would never even dreamed of as kids would be\nA and I'm like you're in my church he is right and and my parents never would have dreamed you know that somebody would have a hand yeah I mean\nAt the state or local level a show that's got to create some paranoia out there for the people that are remembering that they used to ride on the trucks writers for fifty three Chevrolet pickup truck and hang out with a\nMan of the truck yeah we can ride and the bad and the track now yeah exactly you know I Know\nAnd and and and and that does know the things that I could think of you guys go out and get the next ...\nWell thanks for your your thoughts are Tom I to what extent it has a government if not impose this on us at least encouraged this\nWell I'm from the government and I'm here to help and right now and and\nWhat happens is you get you get a vocal minority of people and they go out there and they raise the stink and\nAnd what happens is you get you get a vocal minority of people and they go out\nThere and they raise this think and they stand up in front of a school boards and governor meeting on our legislators and all of a sudden we have these things and post now there are some legitimate things that need to be regulated I\nI don't disagree with that but you know uh I've been involved in so many different types of court cases a forensic psychologist of people following a pediatricians word to the letter a on a first child or something\nAnd the pediatrician assumed that oh you know they're an adult they'll they'll know the kids hungry you don't wait three hours to feed on even though I said you know they'll eat every three hours and all of a sudden you get a child protective services involved\nIn it because you know the kids take being taken up the hospital because hey crying all the time and the other they think oh they're not feeding the kids\nAnd the mother's like no I'm I'm just like the doctor told me every three hours [laughter]\nAnd it's crazy [laughter] it's scary for new parents\nEspecially young ones and uh they they follow those rules and and what happens with kids they hit the public school system and they learn\nHey as your parents do this this child abuse so if your parents do that a child abuse and they start coming home and dictating the rules of the household and it's scary because there's no handbook that says what really you can do parents you know what you can\nWell a suffice it to say we somehow it Dr Huber managed to be here and I managed to get here and other people in the audience managed to get here a courtesy of parents who did not have that handbook either so I guess the the the old methods at least a do not to cause a ...\nA tremendous a fatality rate among young people that might be some lessons there to be to be learned from that\nWe'll talk some more about this tonight this tendency\nIn the

point of raising a kid if you do at the end of the day\nProduced someone who can problem solve I mean\nRight All right that's true why have them\nI mean no seriously why have a kid I you can't just be doing it out of cruelty let's producer\nA human being who will ... failed miserably who will flop in life and and do all we can to to had to get them and nobody says that there is what they're

a sexual assault or a lot of things I don't want our kids to suffer from but the ordinarily bumps and bruises of life\nThe the day to day\nMethod of of learning by doing and by making mistakes that's a necessary part of growing up as in fact that's the goal if you really want your your child to grow up that's how you do it that's how you grew up is how I grew up making mistakes\n\nI a good look back on my mistakes in in various categories there are a few I suppose that I made that I look back and I still cringe about many of them I laugh about what it was I dug\nA at a lot of them I can look back in a positive way and say that wasn't fun [noise] but I'm a better person because of it\nAnd it sounds to me that there is a whole generation not everybody in the generation but but I ate a major subset of this generation the parents engaged in such behavior\nAs if they\nNever thought about it [noise]\nAs I say it is difficult for me to even conceive of of any parent who who thought about this for more than twenty seconds to not be able to figure out that this was a tear\nSteve of any parent who who thought about this for more than twenty seconds to not be able to figure out that this was a terrible thing you're doing you're setting up your children to fail\n[noise] why would a parent what to do that I mean\nI guess if if you're not very bright\nAnd you could convince yourself not me but maybe you could convince yourself that you're being compassionate my child will not ever stop there do they will learn nothing I Will see to it that they go through Eighteen years of the formative life and learn nothing\nBecause every chance they had to learn how to get in the way and make sure that they don't learn except maybe they learn that a mommy and daddy will always be there to make it all better [noise]\nNot the way it's supposed to be and again I Am sure that not every parent does this I Know a few parents in that age group not a lot but the ones I Know\nActually raise their kids with discipline and with standards of performance and with punishment for when they they've followed by the side with correct the behavior all the things that are yes hassles and ah\nAnd sometimes even pay for the parents but that's what you signed up for when you when you reproduce stomach and yeah you're having a kid [noise]\nThis is what you're supposed to do\nIts it interesting that that we have a generation of young parents who apparently can figure that out [noise]\nEverybody I'm Talking to right now talking with a one eight six six five oh Jim boat\nWe were all raised by parents who started out in life making mistakes you grew up who had children and they let us make mistakes\nSome more mistakes than others some lessons more painful than others but the general rule of thumb was I Want my child to grow up to be an adult so that they can cope I Want to always be here\nPeople who are parents get older they die the kids were supposed to carry on that's the whole point I Want to produce kids who can make a go of it after I'm gone\nIt it just strikes me as I said I'm just wondering uh how you feel about that or am I to old fashioned them I stuck in the past ... lacking compassion for young people who should always be protected from every conceivable moment of pain embarrassment are heaven forbid\nChallenge to their self esteem\nWhat eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five four six to six I I'm just I'm just curious about the debate it is just astounding that this can happen that there would be a few people like this year I mean

sounds like a trend now the universal trend to be sure but enough of a trend that you have to wonder are these people thinking\nAt all\nI I don't think we're talking about parents who sit down and and and deliberately calculate this is how I sabotage my child's life they're not they're not saying that to themselves they're not that they may they may be doing it but that's not what they're trying to do\nJust uh just sad and bizarre as I say life comes with challenges\nJust sad and bizarre as I say life comes with challenges as they say\nNo pain no gain\nSome pain of course we don't want our kids

then it seems to be the problem today is that the parents have become the children and then she'll have to come to pass it\nWill certainly the parents have become the children are in many cases I I started like nobody's become ... parents [laughter]\nI've seen children speak today passed in a way that oh my God it not matter if they just got a lotta they just wouldn't it would be unbelievable\nI cannot believe that that no they can't talk no respect today I'm I'm just because of his generation no respect to know that God allows this is just horrible\nIt is horrible and and it it does it what's worse Wanda is that it's entirely foreseeable\nI mean kids must be taught to be rational reasonable people uh kids left to their own devices or are they will they will produce some pretty frightening circumstances\n... society a yeah I mean\nThat the children to go out I mean I'm just looking at ... at some things on it just sometimes I just wouldn't even tolerate some things are just so unbelievable like where are these people put planet that those people come from some well why do\nA ... it's a great question what planet and they do they come from a I tell you wonder are they all are to read the lord of the flies\nA very interesting book or the work of fiction\nBut uh it's an allegory there are the lesson to be learned in the book the lord of the flies it as what can happen
