denied CBS News the White House correspondent to talk of his new book\nMr Trump's wild ride published by all points books subtitled the thrills chills screams and occasional blackouts of an extraordinary presidents I Love the prologue here what I should have learned it in your lead off with this quote\nMajor fantastic I watched it with President Obama two weeks ago he was not thrilled I'm sure I'll be more thrilled unquote the first words Donald Trump spoke to you know that's the exactly right yep please continue with what you you felt you shouldn't have learned\nSo uh what I wanted to do at the beginning of the book Jim boat is approach my audience from a posture of humility because I don't think anyone who writes about American politics right now who comes across as\nA full blown no at all or at aspiring no at all it's going to have that core credibility that an audience can feel and touch and relate to you have to understand and you have to communicate\nThat you're gonna miss things and even as someone who is professional inexperienced and been around the track is I certainly have been you can and do miss things and if you do you owe to you'll read or a sense of personal accountability\nSo that whole prologue is what I should have learned that I didn't learn or took me longer than in retrospect I think I should have taken me to learn\nSo with that sentence that you just read and they don't want to give it all away but I'll give listeners a sense I take that sentence apart a deconstructed almost word by word\nAnd say to the readers here with things that Donald Trump was telling me about himself and if I'd only taking the time\nTo look at that sentence deconstructed and ask myself some basic that's super high level psychological analytical questions but just basic questions what is he trying to say what does he mean how's he coming at you\nI Would have learned about eighty percent of what I came to know about Donald Trump after sixteen months on the campaign trail if I just paid closer attention to that very first sentence\nAnd one example of a major fantastic what is that about\nWell it was a press conference before rally in Bertrand Michigan early August of twenty Fifteen so long long ago feels like a million years ago\nAnd it was the first big rally that Trump had after the first Republican debate and why did he say major fantastic because he noticed me in the pool of\nReporters covering its press conference before\nThe rally and I was the only network news correspondent in that group of reporters and the first one he'd ever seen any of his press conferences so major fantastic wasn't about me it was about you're here you're a network corresponded I'm getting more important that's why it's fantastic that Trump\nI should have learned a paid attention to what he was telling me what what that those two words actually mean and the sense as I say in the book of ... exuberance\nThat is part and parcel of the way Donald Trump thinks about the world talks about the world and views himself with in the world adjunct evil exuberance\nAll the time in every example and then I deconstruct the rest of the sense and I say to myself they're all sorts of these great\nThat Donald Trump was essentially laying before me and if I had taken more time been more curious about this different kinds of political actor and has different ways of dealing with language I'd I've learned a lot more than\nCurious about this different kinds of political actor and there's different ways of dealing with language I'd I've learned a lot more than it would have taken me nearly so long as it did during the campaign just to sort of crack this lock well\nWith all due respect to you and do all the other reporters now you covered\nAh let's see for presidency for three news outlets yeah let's face it this was an entirely new experience for any of you you just were not prepared for I don't know I mean let let's let's just do your look at the at the circumstances of this man\nI I was wondering can you compare him not to any other president ... not even any other governmental leader any other\nKey public figure that you've ever recovered can you compare him to anybody\nNo I Can't I mean he is one of a kind in the sense that\nHe is this very large personality and as I write in the book\nHe was a fully formed celebrity before he got into politics politics as we've learned can make people into celebrities Ronald Reagan though in retrospect people think he was a big celebrity he was a B list movie actor he\nHad some recognition for his General Electric\nUh sponsored radio editorials but he was not a fully formed big time celebrity Donald Trump was he was also a developer of real estate golf courses he had brand identity not just domestically but globally he checked a lot of different boxes\nHe was a completely different actor at different completely different instincts and orientation to the underlying rules of the game and I write early on in the book that there was a kind of school of rock improvisation if you love that movie as much as I Do Jack Black\nOr that Trump brought to politics and I describe myself in the book is one of those fussy parents in that movie those uptight parents who want to\nUm school to be as it always was rigid following the rules everything by the book\nAnd Jack Black ... topples all that in the movie school of rock on behalf of rock and roll and music Donald Trump and his own ways toppled a lot of the rules and I was one of these fussy parents say don't you know the rules why aren't you following the rules and\nWhy can't you a color but in the inside the lines I Know that sort of thing and it's a while to get out of that it took me awhile to get out of it and say you know what\nThe lines are different he's drawing them and look at all these people lining up to see it\nThis is a new experience and take it in\nYou know we're going to have to pause on that note I'm going to come back when they look at how some other Republicans learn these lessons with major Garrett in a moment\nTo them and use them in a new\nBorn getting to the ... and whether I was like oh well\nWell\nWhat do\nYou think you know the hunger games catching fire catching fire was the\nHighest grossing films twenty Thirteen and North America turning over four hundred million dollars

think you believe in what you think you know and what works for you [noise] president elect Trump appreciated that like wow I'm already being taken seriously and giving ... given ... real practical advice by sitting president\nOn the other hand he gets this Michael Flynn thing\nAnd he wanders ... are you sitting up here or what is this about why you're just picking this one guy had you know I like him you know he was a surrogate of mind\nI knew he fired him President Obama when he was head of the defense intelligence agency because Michael Flynn thought you weren't being aggressive enough on counterterrorism I didn't think so either so I agree with Flynn not you jump really had a hard time as president elect processing this bit of information\nAnd yet as the book unfolds and as we all remember there was a very short and very turbulent time with Michael Flynn he was bad news and it didn't work out and in retrospect now President Trump looks back on that in the main as a valuable

of history as I've read about this presidency ah Patrick ... drugs Missouri to like a good evening Patrick into welcome to the program\nA look on a lot of things to take a major Garrett or writing such a good book and you know actually he needs somebody to tell the truth but I really think if anybody takes a look at these bombings it's awful convenient that all the people that are being investigated\nOver this current corruption received the ball\nAnd none of them went off and now the FBI almost completely stopped I Would imagine investigating them and his running around trying to find out who set these bombs I think and this happens right before the election Boston take the heat off the convoy coming up through Mexico\nOh I well I think whether I guess comment about to all of those various factors that it has momentarily are taking the attention away from that took care of and but I can assure you that the care of then once it gets close to the U.S border we'll be right back front and center at and\nTo gauge it'd be a genuine I think the guy was a long way away from the same time I think it can continue and it was doing go ahead sure and\nAnd then I get along with the government was the same time I think you can continue and it was doing go ahead\nSure and and the care of and it's going to remain a story and remember it's if it remains on its current course it's not going to arrive if it ever does at the U.S border for weeks after the election there are a long long way away with a camera is going to be a story ... ... that's not going away and the FBI has lots of different\nParts of it agencies within the agency and it can and does\nI assure you walk chew gum and do a lot of other things far more complicated than those two things on a day to day and our our bases and yes it's a high priority case but the people who work at work those kinds of cases\nThey don't necessarily or even generally work government corruption cases it's not as if everything the FBI was working on suddenly stops and everyone\nLiterally goes and runs in this direction that's not how the agency operates these things work methodically across the agency they will continue to work\nBut what I think the caller is already indicate Jim ... is a sense of what is this really about and I would I Would caution everyone in the audience and I say this all the time and we we have a an approach journalistically at CBS at that tries to live up to this sometimes you have to wait\nYou have to wait for the evidence and you have to wait don't say what ... what do you what we know and then the ten or twelve or Fifteen things we don't know guess what that's what we say we don't know\n[noise] uh during the chapter eight of your book Trump's a Mr Trump's wild ride of Saudi Arabia and the middle east and the particular Jared ... dealing with the the crown prince and now that we of course have some uh later perspective on this chapter your daughter\nSo I'm One of the things that I Hope listeners gained from our conversation demos is that the answer this question do we really need another Trump book\nWhich is not an unfair question and I would say in this sense we do why because we need a book about and that's the reason I wrote it and it was difficult to do while I was doing my day job don't think it was in a book about what's actually happened\nWhat decisions have been made\nWhat if you want to call them this in the White House certainly does what series of accomplishments of occurred in the first Eighteen months and whether you think of them as accomplishments or not things did happen they're likely going to be with this country to five ten Twenty years from now one of the things that is with us is this dramatic shift\nCarried out by president elect Trump through the good offices of Jared Kushner his son in law during the transition\nTo start a relationship with the Saudi regime and\nFundamentally alter America's approach\nTo that kingdom in that geopolitical read region shift away from Iran shift away from the Iran nuclear deal and create a different access if you will in the region which is the United states surprisingly Israel and the Saudis to be a counterweight to Iran\nAnd so much of U.S policy in the middle east was predicated on that and has followed that track set in motion and I detail how during the transition by these early interactions if you want to think of this way or the two young princes Jared Kushner\nAnd the Trump Administration crown prince Mohammed bin some on the de facto leader and Arab parent in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and their interactions and their trust in one another was foundational\nTo this emerging Rio orientation of the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia and\nA long time ago summer of last year when the White House was more inclined to cooperate on books like mind Jared and I had a long conversation about this which is on the record in my book you don't find very many on the record lengthy conversations with Jared Kushner about anytime many topics almost none on this topic\nMy book you don't find very many on the record lengthy conversations with Jared Kushner about any many topics almost none on this topic so if you're curious about how this all got started and what that perspective is I I recommend the book to you because you could actually find out in Jared Kushner's words\nWhat they're trying to accomplish what their initial hopes were as certainly the Jamal 'cause showcase brings many of those hopes\nBefore with clean that he was always my

to set a civil as just stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores [noise]\nSo ... and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores\n[noise] President Trump speaking at a rally tonight in most in the Wisconsin and of course it is there is a certain amount of irony obviously attached to the president calling for a a civil tone or would have been a lot I think are\nBetter for him had he not engaged in some of the tone that he is set in the past because that would have given a clear and moral superiority\nOr in contrast to a party which has stood by and a centrally in some cases are actually whipped up the mob and in other cases that just sat back and ignored the mob but uh again the president is often hard pressed to\nTo curb his tongue so as a result he finds himself a dipped into the mix with the with the others hear your thoughts on that a doctor Uber's bid go back to some calls here\nWell I think I think when we talk about President Trump we're talking about actually a businessman who are political position not a politician he practiced and uh I think that's one of the reasons why he was and he he was not a career politician\nAnd a lot of um middle America just upset and having to deal with\nWith both parties that seem to become kind of a ruling class and they were tired of that so they put somebody in their different and\nI think they expect him to make mistakes and called paws and it doesn't bother to the middle class or the middle group of America\nSo I I think they feel he's justified in ... in the state\nUh up in this way he makes the enemies he doesn't need to make and that would be my rent the added a complaint for a deal that David in San Francisco hello David\nGym in your guest sure you know in ... I've I've always had a fear of a a a fear based budgets or something I Want to stay away from and\n... I'm Sorry if everybody's budgets\nYeah like my line of love and you know something like I don't I don't know where the term budget ... right yeah go into instead cost overruns and and usually know accounting\nSo top secret budgets fear based budgets a suit and sometimes a bad science budgets are can clearly go out to just off the register it if you're trying to check the books for Congress\nAnd you discover that some program is just looking at for all it's worth a you know when you get whistle blowers we the people need to whistle blowers okay and and so this idea of getting every uh getting America to start spending that money on every willy nilly ill\nAs opposed to this whole incident the Saudis are so guilty and these two versions of trying to be afraid of of people seeking freedom\nAmerican you know I guess I'm trying to put your comments in the context of the discussion at hand we're talking about the uh the seven pipe bombs that were delivered to today various locations I mean\nI remember the ... ... are you familiar with\nThat and I doubt that most of the people in the audience or one of the Palmer Raids and how does that relate to what we're talking about\nWell that sounds good Hoover got his start and it was in Woodrow Wilson's day and they had these pipe bombs that went off in Vanderbilt\nActually went off in this case pipe bombs could have gone up I trust your not not assuming the tracking down these people would not be a legitimate public expenditure this was a I mean it may be budgetary expense based on fear but it's a very reasonable fear\nWell after nine eleven they invented the Patriot act and they\nOut I about but it is where they didn't call just invent the Patriot act and point of fact we face an actual attack and if we in fact sometimes spend money because of fear\nAbout what they didn't call just invent the Patriot act and point of fact we faced an actual attack and if we in fact sometimes spend money because of fear if it's a founded fear I personally have no problem with it not can we go overboard I suppose\nDon't feel that these particular instance as we did Dr Huber\n[noise] I think anything that that is reactionary that causes us to give up our rights if for quote unquote safety is a bad mistake ah I think we have to be cautious as citizens and pay a lot of it at all what our government is doing all it there's a new\nAnd we're we're the watchdog so\nI I see where he's coming from we need we need to make these low down some of this knee jerk reaction\nAnd make it more of a thoughtful process nuance and it you know there are times and you know I Know that we just have to react because we all have fine yeah anything else\nAlthough of course I Would note that that in some cases we're not talking about taking away our rights for example we don't have a right to get on an airplane quickly correct but All right to dawn in Albany, Oregon now the gentleman who hit everything\nBut I thought at least for me it's sounding like some whack job took President Trump's rhetoric for marching orders\nMaybe or maybe he decided that he would still be tried to smear conservatives we don't know\nThis is true yeah and then it was the gift\nOr NATO though I don't know how much of a quote unquote white job could could a coordinated\nThe that's the thing that I think that you make a very telling point Dr Huber that that this would require have required very well organized whack jobs plural and they don't tell you to come they don't tend to come in well organized groups\nExactly yeah that that that that I think to the doctor makes a very good point there that for this to have been delivered to the manner that it was\nWould indicate that we are talking about more than just a whack job which is even more disturbing because I Will take it they have given that we will always have people of that nature we got three hundred twenty five million of us but organized a that\nThat of course is a whole nother level of concern yes All right well six six five oh jumbo into a bar with Dr John Huber and your calls as well a bubble had a show in a moment\nOr two minute to minute new\nMore into the

two year agreement\nKnow I appreciate your thought I I again I look at it from the standpoint of if it was designed Dr Huber to take our attention off of something\nWhat would it possibly be because it clearly couldn't be the caravan which will be a story long after this bomb thing has gone away they can't be the midterm elections that's Thirteen Days away and we're going to be all elections all the time leading up to that point so maybe Linda's right maybe there was an attempt to describe it is for something\nBut what could be ah that ah that we're going to forget about it and the next couple of days which is about how long it's going to take us to forget the bombs\nExactly well historically terrorists and terrorism was used to uh oftentimes a ... a a culture or a specific population and what that off and it was you know sway that people's fear of a cultural annihilation and and usually\nRoute while those individuals up and made them move into action so if we take the idea that maybe this was a political uh the\n... and play that they're trying to get maybe more Democrats now to go to the polls that actually vote by saying look they were all targeting Democrats we almost lost a whole generation of our leaders\nOr maybe I mean as I say you were at the age where we we just at this juncture we just don't know the ... gonna come back and talk some more with our
