bit different Fox infringed today [noise] they had on independent voters member it's Fox News channel and they were asking these people\nAbout the caravan and here's what the Democrats are believing and I don't believe them and you can tell us that eight six six fifty jumbo there believing there's a lot of people in America we're going to see this as you know mandatory in crisis\nThey're going to see this is evil wrong Trump\nI'm not proud to be an American if he stops this caravan and all of his threats listening to these independent voters according to Fox News on Fox and friends this morning rejecting pushing back against this caravan saying it's fear mongering and the like here's how it sounded\nMichael let's start with you\nHow big a problem is that the United states has even immigration was\nEven the immigration laws are are a problem for any country and I think our immigration laws need to be modernized an updated\nBut this country is founded on immigration and all of us come from immigrants\nSo what should the United states do is so seven thousand people by the time it gets there can be ten thousand going to be twenty thousand which of the United states do about this\nThis is the ... country on the planet I think we can handle a a a a caravan of people unarmed come into this country so let 'em and say well I I'm saying too cautious improper John real quick on the evidence there is a humanitarian\nCrisis taking place in Central America and yet this issue gets turned into a complete political football there's very little honest discussion about what's actually happening and kept turning the talking points that interests\nYou know treating I'm treating this as an invasion is is a bad idea and it's going to end hardly introduced me to such as that way so I I think people have to be like yeah I mean these are human beings coming here and there needs to be a real solution um do offers um in in\nDealing with who are both a backdrop his the terms and so it all becomes political let's see what happens\n... alright that's from Fox and friends who weren't in my audience was outraged after they heard that in Philadelphia today how about you eight six six fifty Jim let's not all political stop the political stuff this is a real issue\nWe go back and forth with this we have up where it says he said it could be twenty thousand I'm seeing various caravans various things come together just they they're going to punch through Mexico it appears they've already broken through in they're headed toward the border and it may happen next week talent\nJust they they're gonna punch through Mexico it appears they've already broken through and they're headed toward the border and it may happen\nNext week tail end of next week right before the

border I've done shows from there [noise]\nThis is a type of thing that goes on [noise] and I think\nThis place badly for the Democrats and open borders and these independent guys here saying\nWe'll just let him in is that the solution now you know President Trump is even talked about shutting down the entire border that's commercially\nAnd the military and the only hesitation I have there is you would meet announced massive number of military to apprehend and stop this church [noise] and if the military had to use physical force firing on people that would not be good but short of that\nI think Americans say no they analogize it I've had all kinds of people tell me\nThis is like someone just saying they're coming into my house because there's enough of them and they're going to come here and that's it [noise] is that wrong\nWe do have laws we do have asylum laws we do have the ability to process this it is not just political and all of this comprehensive reform enforce the laws

welcome in\nHey how's it going tonight on\nVery very good you know I I went to the border in Arizona Sheriff Joe and the like and we often forget about that and you guys have it as bad if not as worse as Texas and the places we normally think about\nYeah um it's manageable or at least the government was smart enough to inundate the border with agents are where we had controlled it better but now with these hordes coming it's getting back out of control\nWhat would you do have a good yeah\nWell here's what it is and I've been thinking about this um you know or he\nCould the president you could send the military down there which is a smart move however listen to these people are coming and it seems that that's inevitable so my thought was to set up a massive refugee camp\nUh we had the greatest military on we can set it up in no time set up with\nTens and with mess halls them with shower facilities and everything that they could possibly need therefore a we would not be splitting up families and so on and so right\nThere for the Democrats can't go crazy over that kind of thing and then what we do oh by the way we set it up next to a place that has a big airport so you can either do it by the ... air stationery over in Sierra Vista at the Fort withdrew cuts\nAnd here's the thing is and we used to do this a long time ago what what you're doing this\nSo these people really claim some refugee status or some asylum status and\nStuff and and what they do is they they um\nSet them up in front of an immigration judge who eventually make the determination on them okay so what they did what they should do is set up these um I'm\nI'm just right you can and then had to go in there and make sure everything's all co pathetic and everything's good there and send down immigration John ... judges okay and attorneys and everything they could all legal and stuff so that dentist can't complain\nAnd then literally go through each families claim or each person's claim like they're going to do anyway without\nReleasing them into the United states\nAnd if they go through this then we could do what's called the jeep pat flight which is a repatriation flights to their country and\nLook I'm an agreement with that here at a problem though my sense is that so far they're not going to settle for that they're saying they're just coming into the country and that's it because there's well by the numbers whoever's organizing this\nYou know what ... who's in charge they are are we are\nWell look so your ideas humanitarian aid\nControl your and I tell you right slump we're talking to those three countries in saying that we're gonna we'll cut off your ah money that's right well that's good but they're forgetting one big country and this and that would be next to tell the rights to cut them off do if they can't control it and they've got the military that they can control and we can control\nBut well put thank you look that's an humanitarian idea that the fly in the ointment is\nI don't think it's acceptable and who's in charge well so far it legal immigration has been in charge the ball is in President Trump's court let's go to Gary in Williamsport, Pennsylvania hey Gary

it's about well the executive producer do you know the executive producer is that's the top producer out a multitude of producers of the Ellen DeGeneres show tonight showed his hand\nAnd I think this is what they did generous show was about he attacked millennia Trump I mean\nLook you can attack president ... hey attack in Milan and your Trump the executive producer Andy last nerve took to Twitter

they have to get more student loans and more money from the government et cetera then what do they do they raise the cost who's responsible for how costly it is to go to college it's the people

and this guy comes up for a job interview reports it all over again reports it even according to the wall Street Journal reports to Mrs Murphy Eddie Murphy's tower they'll get back to meet with her at least the governor did\nAnd then they never do here's my point the national media is not telling you about this coming off cabin on all that we saw\nWouldn't this be the perfect follow up story if

a job in the Murphy administer a big job a high paying job\nAnd despite all these complaints there still gave it to them without any investigation she alleges and that's what the wall Street Journal seems to say the point being that double standard rears its head her name is\nKatie Brennan in any way that you can spread that around tell people you see the wall Street Journal piece about it\nIt's just one of the best examples I've seen in years of the double standard of what actually goes on so the standard coming out of cabinet people on the left in the media you shouldn't be on the court if a woman makes the allegation without cooperation that's just too bad it's a job interview\nThis is hanging over his head how did this guy then she'll get appointed how is it the Murphy's have not met

Fitzpatrick and this is a key very hotly contested race\nAs far as the house of representatives is a guy who essentially want you to die of have to take away preexisting condition coverage and all
