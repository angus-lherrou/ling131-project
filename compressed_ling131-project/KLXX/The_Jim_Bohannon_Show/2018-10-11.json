tonight we also know the White House says that the president has spoken with the Governor Scott\nWho do the president not to visit the state until next weekend or a or not to interfere therefore with rescue effort is always a problem of course whenever high profile ... individuals ah it ... given area like that and and frequently they can can cause a distraction\nCurrent example there was a lot of ... ... ... ... times as\nWell stay as safe as dry as you can touch and thank you for taking time out\nBoth and I\nThank you very much that's Natasha ... and Panama City Florida where the brunt of this storm struck into we return now to our discussion with Dr Brian tank and assistant professor of the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the university at Albany State University of New York\nAnd I was noticing a doctor ten or comments made by a Natasha regarding the relative a quick pace of Michael in Florence of course as we recall was a guilty of loitering\nOut why is it the storms of vary in terms of the pace at which they move\nWhile you can you can think of hurricane sort of like a leaf in a stream and that is a you know the leaf is is moving in a very slow meandering stream that that's sort of a sudden it or not moving very quickly with like for instance there was sort of linger over the place and that given period of time whereas\nA leaf in a fast moving stream like um like Michael will move very very quickly through an area\nWould it be safe to assume that a a faster moving storm is more likely to bring with the wind damage as opposed to the water damage in comparison with the Lawrence where the wind might be less but the water damage more or or can you even make that generalization\nAll it's certainly if a storm is moving slower it will it will produce um a window over a a area for a longer period of time and it has capability in fact likelihood of producing flooding rainfall\nUm but in terms of the wind you can you can have a storms that are very intense much like Michael that are moving both slow and fast\nI say so in other words the the speed at which this storm moves across the surface of the ground that is to say it's it's a land speed is not necessarily related to the uh the speed of its wins\nYou know no it isn't\nVery good one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six by both by four six to six as we watch\nMichael the remnants they're up continue to move across the Georgia having of course at the Florida Panhandle portions of Alabama as well\nAnd uh is uh still heading across the state of Georgia is our guest Dr Bryan that tang uh this uh\nDepartment in which you teach atmospheric and environmental sciences\nOr that the people today I think uh they look at all these terms like a ... satellite pictures and we hear things like Doppler radar most of which of course most of his ...\nAnd early know what that is but it it sounds like you folks are are totally on touch a with the with what happens in the storm in other words I think we we may at one time we used to make jokes about the weatherman and and how little they knew and compared with today I guess it had no a lot today\nWe act like you guys know everything and if you're even off by a little bit I think we get on your case for that ended it strikes me that there's a happy balance there that\nThat you know more ... than you used to but it's not like you have a complete handle on every single storm but every single moment\nRight and it's it's the nature of the beef that weather prediction will always be uncertain too to some degree but in in the last decade or two we we've really come up very very long way and ability to predict whether interdict extreme storms like Michael\nYou I understand you have a research that you undergo at Albany or that focuses\nFormation intensification and interactions with the the climate system let's start with formation what is it that is the existing out in the open ocean that causes a tropical depression to form\nWell and and the ... uh we oftentimes see these clusters of thunderstorms that form or in the middle of Africa and they will move off the coast of Africa and about um ten percent of them so really tiny fraction of them will form into tropical depressions\nUsually in August September and October\nWhy that time of year I Know there is a season but I'd never be a wide\nYeah and that's when the water temperatures are to warm is in the tropical Atlantic\nUm that also when the uh the atmosphere is is uh uh the the the more most moist\nUm and that is also when kind of the the jet stream which can interrupt the storms that um that that sort of brings storm winter storms that through our neck of the woods over the winter that's when it's the furthest north so um it's just kind of the best environment that time of year for storms to form for hurricanes to for\nI guess it was maybe ten twelve years ago I was talking with somebody who ah worked with a of well at the time was considered I guess the greatest number crunching computer in the world and we were trying to lay people to get some understanding of what this thing could do and I asked him and says or anything\nThat this computer can't do any numbers it can ... said yeah we really can't get a handle on the on all the factors in the environment if you count all of the wind velocity and temperature and high pressure and low pressure areas\nIs that you could put there are so many numbers there that that that computer at least the like I said about a decade ago that it couldn't handle that can handle other stuff that would boggle your mind but that it couldn't handle do we have computers today which can quote\nHandle the the the amount of data that's out there\nUh yes it's it's it's always a challenge because there's just so much data a on any given day or our satellites and in space or take many many measurements are over to the entire globe\nAnd that all needs to be um put into these uh weather prediction models\nIn order to forecast them out on that as a as a pretty a daunting task to do but as our computers get a more powerful and um we we sort of learn about the Amish are more and more um we've definitely made great strides in weather production as a result\nSo we looked at ... at the tropical cycle information or this by the way folks will be three credit hours at the end of the [laughter] [laughter] but now that then the other part of your research intensification okay so the little tropical depression why do these things and I guess not in every case do they but but why do they in some cases become these intense storms\nRight and and Tennessee changes is one of the grand challenges of tropical ... predicts and that's something that we we still struggle with um as we clearly San like all we we did not anticipate you know a few days ago that it would be making landfall as such a strong\nA tropical site found or hurricane um so what sort of we we generally understand kind of what feel with ... that is as you as you said before it kind of the warm ocean waters\nThat a light below the ... are both below the hurricane and that provides a kind of the fuel gasoline for us to power to when he's at the store\nAll right and then that takes us to interactions with the lead the climate system itself or are there are there are portions of the planet which are let us say predisposed to uh to the formation of a depression to do\nThere's a portions of the planet where a a all else being equal but it's a friendly environment for this kind of storm information\nIf they're the the Atlantic actually is is not the most active in terms of the number of hurricanes that formed the um Pacific particularly the western part of the Pacific I'm off the coast of 'em in China and Japan and the Philippines\nUm get many many more hurricanes are out there they're called typhoons by the same system there there's just different names for for them um and they regularly get storms as intense as Michael I'm a you know a a great number of them every year\nAnd that there's another thing that I think confuses the lot of us okay hurricanes on the Atlantic and I guess what what the Eastern Pacific typhoons in the in the western Pacific is that right\nYes tight and in the western Pacific and psych loans yeah just sort of generic sites on the Indian Ocean and in the southern hemisphere\nInteresting yeah those are just terms of convenience we are centrally talking about the same phenomena right\nYes ... which is why in the science community we just referred to everything as a tropical ... instead of hurricane because that's just kind of a generic name\nWherever the all right we will continue our discussion tonight in your calls welcome of course are either as a a question for our guest\nA since everybody talks about the weather ah and ah also in the experiences you may have in particular if you are facing the wrath of Michael we'd

... of the University of Albany State University of New York good evening Donna\nHi Dr ... I'm a native New Jersey and I was like a restaurant here I feel kind of like a hurricane snob and there's not much reference to ever get to hurricane Camille okay having seen the nine right that was five and nothing after\nI had never been worse uh I think a lot of these other storm hit been getting a wrong intensity as comparison to Camille I mean that even had a hundred and twenty five foot wall of water come up from the Gulf or there were\nTankers there were African freighters bar just on highway Ninety and up into the residents that area and they didn't have the type of coverage that we have now I mean we couldn't get on a computer or\nYou know Facebook or cell phone journey thanks how I was wondering if you can comment on the fact that um that's given no reference ... as far as the ... of it and I really don't think any of these others come anywhere near it\nOr you're exactly right Camille is kind of in a class in its own and then a lot a lot of people these days I don't remember a restaurant because I did occur such a long time ago and you're you're right that the pictures of of the the devastation along the coast uh\nWere was absolutely tremendous um what's what's different today perhaps is that uh the one thing that has changed is that there's just so many more people and I'm buildings along the coast so\nUh when we do have any sort of major hurricane I'm heading inland it's just affecting generally a lot more people a lot more buildings a lot bigger portion of our economy\nI'm just I'm because ... is a very desirable thing people love to you know with a look at the ocean every day um and so that's their choice to do that\nYeah and there was a tremendous amount of that conversation I went through the entire thing uh-huh I went through all of that so I mean I'm\nA ... got a crash course and I'm surprised that people are surprised to oh I'm going to lose my electricity and I'm going to get some water in my house that seems a little not to realistic ...\nOr ... you're exactly right I think people who especially are new to\nA tendency to underestimate their risk sometimes because they they just don't have the experience and um you know they they assume they can for instance they could take their windows and\nUm by some buy a bag of chips and just sit through the event and that will be yet but I'm the the there's always we always stress you know before the hurricane season begins you have a plan you repair and emergency kit and then that's it's a mess like this where where um you know it comes to fruition\nYeah I Lived through the the tail end of your meal and uh it almost eight my car or is it the war way up to the side of of uh some land by a stream bed that became a raging torrent and uh uh literally had I if I had not gone to

something that I think needs to be discussed more and that\nUm you know where the terms of um how people managed or the risk and there there is risk everywhere right there is there's risk to to whether you can live in California there's risk of earthquakes have your narrow fault line [noise]\nUm [noise] but in terms of um who's responsible for um absorbing that risk um we all buy insurance\nUm the federal government a has a national flood insurance program which if you're on the coast um and susceptible to storm surge I'm your regular you know if you have homeowner's insurance oftentimes I won't cover any sort of water damage so\nYou need to buy policies through a federal program or\nA another private company that offers sort of flood insurance and I'm a sort of who you know pays for that that catastrophe poll or when when that that risk is realized um is kind of a ... is a subject of rape debate um and controversy\nMhm absolutely uh it should do you think there should be a prohibition or uh do you think there should be uh the changes in how insurance premiums are structured or or what changes would you make in that regard if you could\nYeah it's a it's a very very um complex question um I I certainly think\nThere there are caps on insurance premiums and other sort of policy is that they can put out there I'm ... and and areas can put up zoning

playing the various ah market games or or not or shall we say your hobby\nBut the fact is that we all our economic beings to what extent or another and this is the kind of thing that can seriously affect your life\nLet's talk to or not only our guest Jordan Goodman America's ... was bad\nAnd this is the kind of thing that can seriously affect your life let's talk to or not only I guess Jordan Goodman America's money answers mad but to see the new calls in from medicine lodge Kansas good evening Stephen\nGood evening Jim a former member of the one night a night\nOf very for those who don't know that Steven ... in the same unit I was in in Vietnam but they go ahead\nYeah that you are also for and\nI Know I I was I was actually enlisted also but anyway what do you have for a while you have for our for our guest\nAbout gold but it's so it's been for me I'm a Seventy year old\nAnd uh I uh\nIt's always been colder value for me uh it's it's really a state they're saying or get terrier aided in the last year and I was wanting to know if\nUh if\nIf he feels it's still a place to hold value\nI think of it as an insurance policy okay it's it's against disaster [laughter] but that's been going down because when interest rates go up gold goes down as do many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go up higher and that's been hurting going go gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars announced\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars announce even lower them out\nSo I I don't say it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters in the world and do this not throwing up it's just not what it used to be if anything bitcoins become a new kind of safety valve and even that have been working my way as well so have a little bit of an insurance policy but I don't see go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum or silver\nUm all the same Silver's ... gone down dramatically a platinum is kind of a of a place a play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker lightweight zone none of the pension smells really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add thanks for your service as well now a\nThis is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another ... precious metals will go up a but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these are uncertain times on some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing decently we've got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know it looks like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so ah you know go just isn't doing well it's it really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean defenders arms raised rates a lot and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury has now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so we had a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that was all bad for gold silver platinum unwed him\nBut ... do you see an interest rates going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond there market\nWe've basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bond interest rates peaked at about fourteen percent of the Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute though it was about one and three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point to and I think it's going higher let me just to have a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what\nAnd Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point to and I think it's going higher let me just to have a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve's doing right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOr out of the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds not on a buyer for political reasons another way they can get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bombs sixty billion a month through the so called quantitative easing program that's over that's been over for about a year and a half now and now they're doing qualitative tightening so when bombs come do they're not buying new ones not renewing and letting them mature\nSo two of the big buyers of bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile huge new supply Jim we've talked about this before but the deficit is that we have are being finance with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars in New debt just at quarter alone today there are options of the thirty about on the ten year by they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficit so more supply less demand\nYields and we'll go up and prices go down\nThere you go the old supply and demand thing All right we're going to come back and talk to some more we will certainly returned to the issue of China and a terrorist and the like about that when we come back after this break go take a a very close look at that gift that keeps on giving the student loan indebtedness\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh
