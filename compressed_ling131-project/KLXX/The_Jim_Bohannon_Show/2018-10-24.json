calls in from Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had a job Glenda good evening\nThey had to first I'd like to\nAgree with President Trump's withdrawal from the tree and then also the general comments about John Bolton I think he's a national security stood my comment is is I was in the military all to the seventies and eighties and that was the purging to this so cruel and Germany what makes anybody saying\nThat the European Union is going to allow these intermediate range weapons that we may or may not produce there'll be put on their soil they scream bloody murder up all this ...\nWell I don't know I mean I assume the NATO countries that have a certain obligations Jed but you would know better than I\nWell I mean they certainly do but I you know he's ready to get very very good point I don't think that the NATO countries are going to allow a ... medium range ground launch cruise missiles or any other kind of nuclear capable missiles on their territory\nOh so that's one of the reasons that I'm saying in my article or that we probably don't need necessarily to develop a tit for tat weapon\nOr there are a lot of things that are driving us to do so I mean certainly the defense against the Chinese intermediate range of weapons could include a an intermediate range of our own\nBut I'm not advocating necessarily that we have to develop and field and I ended up violating type cruise missile ourselves are a lot of other ways to do is my preference frankly is for us to bolster our missile defense systems\nWe have some very good missile defense systems but they're not perfect by any means uh they're probably not going to stop more than twenty five or thirty percent of any missile attack\nAnd that certainly is not good enough for we want to do I think is to offset with the Russians are doing here put a lot more money and a lot more time and to perfecting are missile defenses\nThat deserves a follow up of course the whole notion of missile defense or so derided as the star wars by Senator Ted Kennedy and others in point of fact there is nothing\nAbout the notion of a missile defense that is in the least impossible you were talking about the speed of missiles and the speed of computers\nAnd uh the the the course of the speed of computers is increasing every second it seems like and it was only a matter of time before we will be able to as the old expression when shoot down a bullet with another bullet that this is not something that has any inherent impossibility difficulty yes\nWell and you're right but we've already done it I mean the question is how to get a better\nWay we have systems right now our our strategic missile defense system station and California and Alaska are capable of intercepting a ballistic missile in flight\nA we have the bad a

one eight six six by boat jumbo we're talking to a big turnout former Oklahoma City mayor\nWere fourteen years the author of the next American city published by putting them in a man with a lot of the innovative ideas let's talk to a dog who calls the July ... from Pittsburgh Katie ... evening Doug welcome to the program\nHi Jim thanks for taking my call I enjoy your show thank you what I what I wanted to ask the mayor about Pittsburgh gone to a similar transformation from having industry stealing the biomedical and\nBanking cetera um and it's doing well the reason is doing well however the\nCity school the Pittsburgh city schools struggle year after year fewer and fewer families are sending their students\nTo the Pittsburgh public school they'll go anywhere else private school a Catholic school charter schools et cetera ... how is\nThe Oklahoma City public schools are they doing through the transformation of the economy in your city\nWell it's it's a little inconsistent certainly\nWe're we're a little different in that we have twenty four school districts that are inside the city limits of Oklahoma City\nAnd so you have all sorts of different success stories inside those twenty four but the largest district as about forty percent of the population at the Oklahoma City school district and it's it's a you know performing poorly a similar to what you're describing in Pittsburgh\nSo I mean ... the urban public school setting it's still it's a very much a distress full situation across the country\nIn Oklahoma City there are a lot of good public schools are out all around you know that center part of the city and people have gravitated and that's part of the you know the sprawl issue that took place over the last few decades people were searching for a better education for their kids\nAnd so we're trying to get more options you know charter schools and and other options for kids that for for parents that want to come in and provide more density and the core of the city but\nI I don't know the single mayor out there that satisfied with the level of education and their inner city district\nYou mentioned charter schools I wanted to ask you more about how successful they've been\nWell most of our biggest success stories are charter schools are no no you can't tell you that they're all high performing but a lot of them are\nUm and um you know our Mike one of my granddaughters attempts at a charter school downtown and you know it it's run by a board of our business leaders um who you know kind of ensure its success and uh you know there's nothing magical about the about the model it's not that\nThey have a bigger budget they have a smaller budget it's not that they get the hand picked their kids they don't any kid can go there that lives in the district of but they've taken out some of the inefficiencies\nI think that our public school system is played by and created a model that puts more dollars into the classroom so you know in in that one instance that things could be working better I I liked the idea that parents have choices um and in in Oklahoma City there's a lot of choices\nYou know I I Know of course you're acquisition of the NBA thunder franchise and also the opening it part of the maps three project was the the opening of the new stadium where the Oklahoma City rent archer AAA a baseball team are sports franchise is\nA good way to enhance the city because I Know some some urban areas have because\nDemands from most sports franchise owners\nWell it's been a big positive for us I I think one of the differences is if you're if you don't have a a major league sports franchise\nAnd you get one it is on a superficial level up a level of quality that she didn't have before and I'm not saying it should mean this much but it does and and the fact that\nThat suddenly your sports teams are playing teams in New York and Chicago and Los Angeles it and that matters because the image of your city to a certain extent as who your sports teams play\nAnd there's a level of quality that a major league sports team can provide to a city the size of Oklahoma City I think it helps our CEOs attract talent from around the country\nWhen you know you offer some on a job at a company in Oklahoma City that person no matter where they live in the United states they're going to think of themselves if I take this job I have to live in Oklahoma City or if I take this job I get to live in Oklahoma City\nAnd having a major league sports team is an asset that would get more people that would be more likely to take that job\nOn on a millennial basis my my input from young people is that they want to live in a city that's culturally relevant\nAnd that includes the pop culture\nAnd a major league sports team made chew culturally relevant I mean one Russell Westbrook and Paul George to name a couple of our players you know choose to live here and and choose to sign contracts here when they're offered contracts by every other team in the league seemingly\nUm that sends a message that this is a good place to live up in the I think that when sports starts to become\nTired in a city is when they have more than one franchise and people get tired of subsidizing what new facility after ... you know and so I I get it you know if you have three sports teams like Seattle there\nWhen we come up with a

by the way based in in southeastern Missouri a down toward do roughly the Memphis metro area and along the Mississippi River I don't think that the New Madrid influence extends as far west as Oklahoma\nAre your thoughts are Mr Mayor\nWell like I say I think I think he's just listening to us there's a connection between the oil and gas exploration and uh-huh and the earthquake it does seem like there's a\nConnection there so you know central Oklahoma was already on a fault it was probably more susceptible when these water injections took place\nUm and like I said you know they pretty much diminished at this point because I think the scientists to work really hard and they know that\nYou know you you can't survive a politically um if you're the cause of these ... a nerve being a earthquakes but I think most people in Oklahoma had been very patient with oil and gas industry\nIt's been a significant part of our economy for a long long time and most Oklahomans are thrilled that the United states\nIs in more control of its energy future going forward that we've been gr light learn and oil and gas industry is playing a major role in our economy\nUm but you know at some point their their technology has got to catch up and figure out a way to ...\nLet our economy um but you know at some point their their technology has got to catch up and figure out a way to do that you bring up the oil and gas that they'd like to bring out without causes the harm on all the rest of it\nNow in the Oklahoma economy of course a a began a pretty much wants to uh uh the presence of a lot of oil was discovered in and of course the the automobile really coming into its own just about the time that Oklahoma became a state back in in Nineteen oh seven\nOr the Oklahoma economy has been tied with energy for for many years is the the state's economy are still that directly tied to energy or has it been in effect diversified\nYeah uncle in the city has diversify with the student is Bullock\nAnd so Oklahoma as a state is overly reliant on the oil and gas and the student and as a result it's it's a it's calming and its tax revenues cyclical are based on you know how the oil and gas industry is doing but in the oil and gas industry is going through such a transformation right now\nAll of the technology of the advancements that they've been baking and made them for a fish it industry or you know with the current price which is much lower than it was just a few years ago they're able to make a profit um\nI I Would say we've already reached peak oil and gas industry it just simply takes fewer people to extract oil and gas around it's more technology driven and they get more or less gas out of a single well used to ... uh and so the result of that as a more efficient is model\nOr one that if a ... fever people but that has really helped the United states determine its own energy future we need to be less reliance on foreign oil\nAnd uh I think the only gas industries you know as as not a wonderful job in in creating a better resources for our country here the United states\nYou mentioned the progress that you've made from that one cent sales tax I'm Wondering the extent to which Oklahoma City depends on uh the sales tax versus let's say the property tax or is that one of those few urban areas which has an income tax even what what is the basis for Oklahoma City taxes\n[noise] well most of our operations comes from a sales tax and most of our capital aides come from property tax\nThe uh the maps program is a little bit outside of the scenario I just

boy had a job good evening Charlie\n... high and what's on your mind tonight or early\nReal share my grandfather came came to this country in Nineteen eighty nine from Italy mhm they came through Ellis Island yeah then you know we went up there and I got the documentation of his when he came through and ah you had to have money to get in the United states and if he didn't they sent you back on the boat\nAnd if you are sick they set you back now what what do they do these people come up to the other way they they check\nWhat they're going to check their uh\nTheir physical banning it or are they going to be sick or lift\nWell they certainly need to be vetted in a variety of ways\nI mean they don't have any any right to come up here I mean we got this Fisher about him in to sign that says ah you know\nIf if you if you're right thing to do by letting them come in if you don't come in you you can get excommunicated from the Catholic Church whenever that's absolutely ridiculous with the Catholic Church has all these other problems they've got and he got a bishop talking about this\nSo well yeah I'm really not that vision is a boy the view and fifty cents as far as I'm concerned will

evening sir good literature talk to you yesterday and what's on your mind my\nMy my idea what this is okay first of all the people don't disgust me but\nThe others had their attitudes disgust me yet but go ahead\nYes the other gentleman had a good a good point where people came into the country the right way through Ellis Island you know through the the right process\nI don't understand and I am a Marine Corps war veteran and I've been to some of these countries I don't understand why Mexico is not doing anything they're letting them come through that shrine we deal with it and ...\nUh they're they're doing it because it's to their advantage and that's why they have always until now suddenly had a very tough southern border with Guatemala their northern border they've always looked upon as essentially a toilet to flush their uh unemployment and other problems on to the United states Yes sir that you are absolutely\nAnd I I I'm forty nine years old I'm a I'm a war veteran and I voted for the first time for president this last election and I am a Trump supporter and I believe what he is planned on putting our military out on the line to stop them is absolutely correct\nI I I don't see how there's an argument for that\nOh there there's no no rational argument you'll get all kinds of people who get hot and bothered about the fact that we're not being generous enough so it

send troops to their says or order like\nMexico southern border yeah\nWell first of all I Mexico should be doing their job on their border that's number one and number two I don't know that that we need the opposite where they're quite capable of guarding that border as they've proven over the years they suddenly decided\nTo their advantage to let people through but it's not as though they're capable of defending that border they have done so very effectively over the years and they suddenly stopped which for whatever reason there's a new\nA new president in the in Mexico city ah\nIf I thought that that would make a difference and there was no other way to do it I could go along with that idea David but honestly I don't I don't think that it's necessary to do that and I do believe
