Powell about the apparent murder\nOn the Saudi Government property a consulate in Turkey a dissident journalist and we're at one eight six six by boat Jim bode to offer thoughts about this let's start with the Casey in the great falls Montana and the Casey good evening\nYeah I ah highest is thinking that there seemed to in my memory there was a strong linkage to nine eleven with the Saudi regime or at least the portions of the population in\nThat well a lot of the people involved in the plots were from Saudi Arabia to my knowledge there has never been any evidence to get him to the Saudi Government was in any way involved\nLet me uh let me expand upon that point\nI'm not saying that there was any linkage directly but I think that there is a ideology\nThat is exhibited by the Saudis have disdain and disrespect and I don't think the president should go to war or get carried away but he has to walk a tightrope you should send a strong message that they can't just staying here is a\nA presence in his in our nation's help in their ah dilemmas that we're helping them with so that's my opinion\nWell All right very good any ah any thoughts or the ... to the caller\nHad been trying to think about different things that might can be done [noise] also and one might be to significantly limit the number of a diplomatic passes that any of the family has to come into this country at all\nMaybe reduce the number of people at their embassies here or not let them by as much land and property as they would like to buy I mean you know we've got to consider all the potential options that we have to make some sort of statement about this\nUm yes I mean I I see your point there is Jim and our talking at the beginning of the show this is an extremely complicated\nIssue there are good and bad and nobody to knock us how horrible the Saudi regime is but it's better than it used to be in some ways\nYes in some ways and better than almost any conceivable alternative on that peninsula of Luke in Madison, Wisconsin good evening\nEvening I'm I appreciate both of your pragmatic approach to the situation but I don't think you should give us a pass to a group of people that intentionally paralyzed someone and tortured them over seven minutes by all accounts\nFor I'm not giving them a mass either I just ... there's no law we can do about it\nAnd that that is what makes this complicated isn't it the brutality of their act\nThe apparent brutality again when we have so far or ...\nIf this complicated isn't it the brutality of their act\nOr the parrot brutality again what we have so far or stories don't pass it off no no no no just supposed to be clear about this flu we at this juncture did not have a definitive answer on what happened we have what is looking more and more like a probable outcome if that is true then you would be right but we haven't got that when\nYou look at the Saudi response where they first said we weren't involved and now they say it was a interrogation that went wrong no one could be headed during a terrorist here why aggressive\nAs soon as I heard that I thought okay that what that means they tortured him to do that\nVery thoroughly agree on it have you\nHas it as if this was never happened anywhere else on the planet I Am I'm not using it I'm simply saying what do you do about it do you cut off our nose despite our face\nAt some point when you have people who have sponsored the nine eleven attacks\nWill not wait just a minute here we do not know that the Saudi Government had anything to do with the nine eleven attacks\nIEDs won't feel the information that the FBI reports that and you know that too but that's neither here nor there no it certainly is when\nYou have a ... when you have a group of people that are basically scaring the world to act you have to do something and\nAnd even even at even to the exclusion of our own best interests let's say that al ... to ... salary in lower just finish by state but before we get your answer a let's say al ... took control of the Saudi peninsula how does that improve things either for the people there or to this country\nDo you think it's good to have a government that will take someone into a conflict in poetry\nObviously not and I I repeat my question to you in fact I'm going to pose the question now without interruption and then let you respond to it let's assume\nThat the al ... or ISIS forces took control of the Saudi peninsula every bit as brutalization ... regime maybe more so and very identical to edit that I go to the interests of the United states how is that an improvement Luke\nHow is butchering someone ...\nObviously you just don't care to deal with reality okay I understand your outrage but like so many people in this country today your outrage does not have any logical conclusion\nThe answer of course the one I posed was it wouldn't be better and until you come up with some kind of have a better answer other than just were outraged and we're going to do something that will be\nA harmful to the United states and the Saudi people because it'll make us feel better I don't consider that a responsible answer a ... you know he thought from used that needs to go to the next call here\nYeah we do have to be very practical about it and we have to put the interests of American citizens first both whether they be in the region or in this country right now in our strategic military interests around the globe and everything else\nIt'd be a little different if this would be the only time in history that any regime as ever acted in a brutal way well guess what it isn't that I'm so sorry that the human condition is as bad as it is but it is and the notion ship is it never happened before and all of human history I Would say how outrageous\nUnfortunately it has happened in countless times Chris in east Texas ill oh\n[noise] well uh let's just calm down a second and then there's a little logic here because first

many years have failed to comprehend as somebody could enlighten me I Would love to know why in the world\nWe give billions of dollars every year to the Saudis Christiana poor reportage she went in undercover in several places but uh you know really she could have lost her life but she showed where the Saudis\nHave fourteen carriages go five states in their ...

occasion is hardly a useful most that would demand or that they ...\nOf taking a one eight six six five oh jumbo what eight six six five oh five or six to six Rick in Tucson now and the good evening Rick\nHey Jim ... just calling to suggest uh I'm trying to find out of the reason why the Saudis\nOr wouldn't just ... when they've got this guy on the on the consulate wouldn't just revoke his path for a which certainly was within their borders ...\nA claim that he's violated multiple Saudi laws extradite him back to Saudi Arabia he goes into a jail in Saudi Arabia and is a story on page six in the New York times [noise]\nAgain he would be just as out of the way the and uh I I think that the again we have a a very rational thought process from Rick again it unless unless we really think Sydney power that the Saudis deliberately felt that only\nThrough a show a big screen brutality or could they send their message out I mean I Would think that what Rick just described would end up itself be shall we say I'm a pleasant enough aid to send a message to dissidents\n[noise] well it certainly should have been but this is as you mentioned earlier Jim medieval sort of regime and they're barbaric against women and all kinds of\nCitizens of their country so I that's what makes me think this was a deliberate message\nThat they are are barbaric again a is a given a that they were stupid and dealing with the United states this would be a level of stupidity beyond anything that the I've ever seen that's the part I think that amazes me\nThat they have generally been pretty adept at quote dealing with the United states and this uh this kind of arrogance or maybe\nThat's why they're calling it an accidental death during interrogation they were supposed to do everything but killing\nYou know you know the ... that ended up ... this is a regime so brutal that they might very well I think that that was somehow pass oh okay you're only tried to maintain a little bit ah maybe that maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong maybe they are the stupid Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello\nHi Jim I'm not saying that the Saudi Government are nice people or anything like that they aren't\nAh certainly not at that and this this fellow um I Believe um he came from a family of arms dealers have within the Saudi Government at one time I think a very close to some of these\nHe's a Muslim Brotherhood supporter he is the other ... that hardly makes him a savory character that's very true in\nLike a journalist in in Saudi Arabia having the freedom to chat right in favor of Israel he thought that shouldn't have been allowed\nAnd ... says that um and I don't honestly think that the Saudi Government would have been so stiff as kids pull or something like that because they know it would come back on them and I wonder if there was a rogue elements of course we don't even really know what happened\nYou know we do but the thing about this rogue elements in a consulate ... these are not just places like boutiques on the shopping center where you just wander in\nNow but people can decide to do something that's not smart and I think that the fellow called in about John ranting maybe on something and it may have been done and partly make Trump look bad and drop it make a ... ... you know because\nI ... that that is the level of Machiavellian thought you'll have to explain to me I don't understand and I certainly\nThe news has been a negative influence in this country for years and years and years but I fail to see\nHow any of this benefits anybody on the American left especially given the fact that if in fact he is somehow implicated that this would rebound on the everybody on the left in the United states I mean I don't see any gain here for the risk involved\nBut I'm saying that right before the election this isn't you know causing the administration headache\nWell it's going to be administration a minor league headache I mean let's face it they're listening to this is not this is not the Iranian nuclear deal is is not a a jobs than anything else I mean although we're we're making a big deal out of it because people get all upset about it but I cannot believe frankly Linda that ah that\nOne tenth of one percent of the voters in this country are going to change their vote because of this\nWell I think that the minister Haitians handling it very well but I say I do think it's being blown way out of proportion like daily and we've been talking about it for many days early and I was\nLike a okay Sydney or take\nI really don't have anything to add to

yet there must be some reasons why it is happening well we're joined by position and psycho analyst Dr Richard ... who was trained in both ... to an\nEnd to getting analyses to look at this through his book out of control apocalyptic psychology in the age of Trump and uh we uh we thank you for being with is said to my doctor Creighton\nPhil thank you for having me\nDo you have a ... just as an overall explanation before we get 'em to some of the details behind it why we seem to be out of control at this time\nUh I think it's probably many reasons but the point of the book was really to try to frame the whole political issue in terms of the underlying psychology\nAnd I I think the psychological positions are probably best trade with respect to the concept of religious conflict\nBecause I think there are many aspects of what's taking place now that really ... uh what goes on between a sectarian groups are out of religious level\n[noise] ... okay I Am a a a a a religious\nLevel All right uh ... please amplify further on that uh obviously we're not talking about a\nA two different religious sects per se unless you want to uh uh consider a I suppose the more traditional a Judeo Christian ethic on the one hand as a religious sect and there's a\nNew uh identity politics a political correctness when the like ah as being a mother a religious sect or this is a is grounded in which I'm not a perhaps a totally understanding what you're saying\nThings do seem to be as this book is titled out of control Dr Richard ... and our guest is positioned and psycho analyst and uh the subtitle apocalyptic psychology and the age of Trump or to a rod who calls in from a wire Hauser Wisconsin ... good evening rod and welcome\nRon are you There God can you hear me yes you're on the radio go right ahead\nAll my phone it's like out of their own well okay for the\nCall sure up I I don't consider myself a really tell ... what what I heard on Wisconsin Public radio I listen to public radio a lot of it they were talking about George Washington when he became president he did not want a party system and I just think to myself\nWhat a shame that it out because\nYou know if it got people that I don't care who's name if they're whatever letter or named up what they said about\nThat and that way I see it we don't need any ... other white up but on the cabinet or whatever something happened to the port woman and I can't imagine a traumatic experience like that\nBut uh that to me it's not an issue right here in the fact that Obama when he killed somebody for the for the oil we got to wait till after the election\nOut issues on the other for how to get a ... or ...\nWell you've covered a number of the issues of the day but I'm not sure this directly relates to uh the topic at hand I Would just make one note before it deferring to Dr Creighton\nOr it was very naive of George Washington or anybody else to suggest that there would not be factions factions are almost proof that we have a free government if you have a genuinely free society you will have differences of opinion\nAnd like minded people will get together and organize to try and convince others of their point of view it as an essential part of society American faction lives will be carried do far well yes it certainly can and perhaps we're seeing a manifestation of that\nBut the notion that you can have a free society without different factions is an impossibility and I refer to Dr Creighton\nHas to agree with you entirely about that I think there's a psychological motivation ultimately for or you can unify groups to ultimately ... to smaller divisions so I I think there's no way of recording connections or what\nIn this uh the extremes of polarity between two factions so that there is no workable solution to the system\nAnd we'll come back and explore some of that here in a moment but ah right now call from Steve in Chatham county North Carolina good evening Steve\n... are always enjoy your show in a free shake your says thank you ... when it gets to a point when you go to a restaurant or or use it all out and\nUh I I don't know if the person or the establishment is left ... whatever the hell or I don't understand this really want it spills of\n... when it gets to a point where you can't go out and has resulted debate without someone screaming at you spin on the you know and you send things you can't\nI really don't care of your\nDisposition just let's say let's have a reason debate I mean if we can talk without screaming at each other ... which I which I don't do\nAnd yet I'm the I call the Clinton machine the machine has his just use is to give up the fact that two years ago two years ago ...\nYou know you lost the election of ... I guess what if you love this country if you if you're being honest and then you're going to try to build it up not tear down\nWell again I Know the extent although certainly I've had my differences over the years with the both Clintons are especially in regard to uh honesty and and corruption I don't know that we can say that they are personally responsible for the uh the outbreak that we've seen a across the country\nUh I Do a Dr Creighton find one thing that I find tragically ironic\nAnd that is that much of of what we're talking about here is conducted by groups that roughly called themselves and the fact that is to say anti fascist\nAnd the tragic irony is of course that those tactics\nOf a silencing your opponents by intimidation and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect or most of these people [laughter] but that is that that is is the sad a problem\nAnd that cannot be tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective that you are so pure\nAnd you are so virtuous that you don't have to listen to anybody else than the only answer in my book\nAnd you can certainly agree or disagree as you choose the only as in my book is do arrest\nProsecute and if convicted incarcerate such people that is out of bounds you cannot let society be reduced to ... to the level of who can put together more of violence in the street\nYou know I I think you have several important points or whatever the points that I Try to make in the book has to do again with the underlying psychology\nOf what's taking place at least a large portion of society and it's been said for some time now that there's an increasing degree of of nauseous is within the society and then the judge to increasing decree of moral perfectionism and obsession or thinking is in society\nAs a result when when when one encounters those types of psychological structuring individuals are those individuals are very prone to what we call projection and that is that they tend to uh take aspects of the the denied uh\nAnd to place them on people around them\nAre so when you have a group like a ...\nA claiming that the anti fascist and you look at that behavior it's very very obvious that the behaviors that you have your one would expect from a fascist group and so you see this constant accusation coming from the left projecting on the right for everything that they're doing\nA and and denying claiming that it's the rights to doing it so that I think the motivation for some of this behavior in terms of how to deal with it I agree with you entirely I think one of the creators problems that we're encountering in society today\nIs the lack of enforcement of\nThe laws that are ... that are currently on the books a for a place like Portland for for the mayor of Portland to sit by and have people rioting\nOn the streets and refusing to have the police intervened this is a breakdown of the necessary a legal sanctions and boundaries that are a free society must have and if that's gone that it's going to be just a free for all\nYeah ah again it it it is not something that uh that that can that can possibly be tolerated and and I see things like that and there have been other examples some time ago when there was a a police shooting that brought a rioting to Baltimore and the mayor of Baltimore told the authorities to let it burn\nA as if to say if people feel aggrieved enough that they get a free pass or behaving like civilized beings and that is\nAs as you say it I I think I'm not putting words in your mouth that as it is pointing us in the direction of anarchy and that is not an acceptable outcome nobody is so aggrieved that they have a right to break the law with impunity nobody\nKnows who's teaching yeah go ahead\nFor again absolutely but it it's the role of the Gulf than a both at the local level and the federal law ultra who forced the laws of the country and if they fail to do that then you can expect a increasing outbursts or for newsgroups because they're essentially enabled to behave badly\nExactly are we are supposed to be telling them yes you're tactic and intimidation is working and ah people respond positively when are they are told that their tactic is uh is going to be tolerated\nStay with us more to come as a doctor Richard Creighton takes a look at just what is at work here what is the psychology\nInvolved in the the way we are currently conducting a business in this country at the public policy level and it's a\nIt's

sort of might be a very worthwhile Dr Creighton I'm not sure how you would even words that such a law and he thought you might have\nOh I don't know that there's an existing law uh that that deals with which to create a certainly nothing that I'm aware as opposed to ... set up um I I think it's a dangerous thing I think to begin to interfere with people's uh\nKorea does if you will uh but I I think that that does need to the forces in places that tend to moderate the extremes of views at least a as a manifested in the mainstream move of of society\nAnd and in addition the idea of propagating one view only to the exclusion of others I mean uh it seems to me that that today's standard of tenure is that once you got a\nCharles Manson somewhere a teaching under ten year that you you can get rid of him I mean uh they're happy to be some limits on who it is who practice was all of this academic freedom and what it is they say in the classroom [noise]\nWell uh ... once again you

you and whether\nGreat value of the letter but by the way these are selections from their latest CD we're talking with Tony Tyler one of the original letter but his compatriots with the Letterman these days Donald T a Bobby pointed it only been with the group well over Thirty years so they're relatively new covers this new CD we\nShould tell you is the called by request you know some wonderful selections on it and what a number of album is this I Know you've just done so many tonia but how many does this make\nThis is our seventies sit a total total sounds recorded in the last ... years weaker records it eight hundred plus song\nUnbelievable ... and over the years just go ahead hitters will some statistics of of record sales and a top hits and the like because the the numbers for the Letterman are extremely impressive Tony\n[noise] but yeah you know Jim thanks for bringing that up because you know we have quite a kind of quiet career compared to a lot of your group beetles just British Invasion and use it to the beach boys with the sugar in hot rod music will we didn't get all the notoriety because we never get drugs and we never\nWere that oil is you'd never got in trouble we never were political we never got to juggle\nThe water's weirdest three squeaky clean boys from next door that happened to go out there do good show so oh the precedent media there was only ... up put\nStories out about that boys so we were\nKind of under the radar all these years\nAll these years and uh I I kind of like it that way because we never uh we we toured with some of the biggest entertainers we were ... a Jack Benny we took the Jack Benny ... with George Burns\nWe toyed with red Skelton as well as doing a lot of his television specials and ah Jackie Gleason dean Martin the Jerry Lewis and we were in that realm we were\nKids doing rock and roll or being that boy so I I like the fact that we had a clean cut career and we're still very healthy and still are out of his day\nWell it certainly is it didn't just a burn across the sky like a shooting star the Letterman have had to stay in power and I was amazed to discover this but in fact he had his next year but not until next year\nThat the Letterman will finally get what they have so long deserve demand is a star on the Hollywood walk of fame you must be very proud\nOh my gosh there's so many you know you have a survey that's a very big but it's in the in our little lie [laughter] that post I'll bet it's a very prestigious thing to have\nMillions of people visit Hollywood and millions of people take photos city on the star of the favorite entertainer in the Hollywood Boulevard so it's it's yeah we are very very proud of it that the cheating that\nWell you certainly should be now I have to look at at this career this this uh this traveling around the country and the like don't you ever get tired of the tour\nAll the ways that you know I see people on television don't know Carson's show in David Letterman show and there's the other day talking and they put their hands on there for ... oh my gosh it's so hard and they try to get pity for themselves I think they're trying to get pity for all the millions of dollars they're making\n[laughter] say well I always say that if I'm On the road and getting up some occasionally but yet at six AM after one of the foreign catch a flight which you know what I think at the alternative Jim his shirt peach digging ditches\nDoes that do it it really does now\nYou you have you guys was such a beautiful pure sound and yet you interact with an audience so well so I'm curious about this you've got the touring the live shows and you've got the recording studio and of course\nUh with the live show or you have that immediate spontaneous reaction but it's it's one take mistakes that all whereas in the recording studio wild granted\nA nobody's cheering but maybe the a and R guy behind the window but but you could do take twenty eight if you need to to get a perfect and so I'm curious which did the Letterman prefer the studio perfection or the on the road live spontaneity\nWell you know I I'm probably the worst interview or in the world is if you eat in the world is on the very positive guy I don't look to the negative and they take so when it comes to a question like that might I answer is I prefer both because it does\nIf you're in the studio for a month or so and then you're on the road from it gives you that friday of seeing the country she in the world that yet being able to get in there and and do some create Kennedy of euro with your friends in front of a microphone\nDo you guys have anything that approach is also a a bucket list that you've done so much and you had received these honors and accolades and I'm just wondering is there something out there that the letter but I haven't done the oh I don't know like a maybe a a Broadway musical or something I'm just curious\n[noise] yeah you know those are always wonderful things or if it would be great to have like the ...\nYou know the four seasons have a Broadway show here again because they were controversial which they were very uh offstage and did some things but [noise] yeah well I'll tell you what ... not really a gym because let me tell you one thing back in you know the first men on the moon\nAnd you know and the altar and well yeah a Armstrong his it was a big fan of the letter and and his wife was a really big fan so when they won\nOr lost to the moon is interested in to the moon Armstrong he they have this little plot they weren't sure if the\nTour is going to work there and they had in their capsule they would choose the music that they wanted to hear just in case he got stranded up there for a year and the capsule and they all the actor so what happened was\nHe ... he got for Letterman touch with him and when they landed on the moon is spent the time on the moon he left his packet by the U.S flags us flagpole and when that and then came back to earth so back in\nNot what is it Nineteen sixty eight\nSixty nine one one on the moon or he left about settled Letterman cuts on the moon so when we were national act or international act and we're also ... intergalactic\nAc so not much more we can accomplish\n[laughter] I daresay died [noise] and uh a look at the at what you have coming up of course you've got to
