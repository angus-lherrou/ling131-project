and we're taking a look\nAt things that are might possibly come before new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh including mainly gun issues in this particular instance and that's an area of course where there have been many many a resounding battle that has occurred at the Supreme Court Charles calls in Springfield, Missouri this evening hello Charles\nHow are you doing Mr Bannon I'm fine thank you [noise]\nUm I was listening and I you know you hit on a topic that's always been a kind of a hot button for me and that is how the liberals always do get these ideologues that you know completely side with them but the\nYou know people get bored you know anytime that a conservative tries to get someone that really is on their side and it's not some halfway you know a ...\nA you know the Democrats are an absolute fit the we the conservatives do nothing they they have constantly there the\nThe party of appeasement and they need some on this got some site and then in just says no or we're going to fight for this can we just haven't seen it I mean I look at the Democrats and how they treated cabinet and that'd be despicable and either party however why don't we ever fight [laughter] you know where you fight they put up\nWell that's a that's a good point I Would our guest to address that I I certainly agree with the Charles uh absolutely uh Dave in regard to the motion\nThe Democratic president if we put up a liberal justice will start coming up with the stories about how they uh they uh the litter or have overdue parking tickets or what have you I think that that is as drove noted that disgusting practice\nBut I'm Wondering have Republicans fought hard enough regarding some of the more liberal a recent pick say for example a bronco Obama's pick some of which I think sailed a ride through I mean it seems to be Republicans tend to follow the the the victim\nIt's the president's choice in the nominee is qualified I can go with it whereas Democrats followed the victim uh I disagree with that person therefore anything and everything is fair game\nWell I I think if you look at it from the perspective of Republicans credit follow the constitution a little bit more than the Democrats do at least in this issue or and and the the or a collegial bunch of people which\nI'm not too sure that pays off anymore collegiate are being collegial doesn't work too well when you were in a bar fight\nAnd that's what we just witness or frankly you know I I remember\nBack when I was in high school and we talked about all this stuff in American government and and you know I had some good teachers back then people who weren't really afraid to ah to speak out call a spade a spade and say look you know people do this but that's wrong it's not the government is supposed to work\nNowadays a ... it's almost like a a a pitch battle you know a food fight and what they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh the Democrats are with this eleventh hour Hail Mary thing bringing up\nA um [noise] uh the forward accusations and and and frankly I have a lot of sympathy for I think she got thrown under the bus a fifth of the dogs the ... just in order to uh to try to derail Kavanaugh's nomination\nAh they were both used and it would probably be who've the the Republicans now especially if they retain control on Capitol Hill after November\nTo launch some investigations into just how did that become public or what we witnessed with a judge can now justice cab at all or was it just deplorable if not despicable\nAnd ah you know I I wrote about this uh you know I've covered this thing for liberty park press and the gun bag and I'm going to continue to cover it\nBecause I think what happened there was wrong and and the certainly the polls seem to be indicating that to the public is just riled up this really has fired up the Republican base I think\nIt's bringing people out to vote who probably wouldn't have voted at the midterms but Jim and they're angry and and they have some people that they were angry at they can identify the people that they're really mad at me and I kinda think the Democrats are they might have blown this\nOne well we'll see certainly both basis seemed to be quite fired up we'll see who does the turnout trick the best Sharon in grain Missouri yellow\nHearing I can um you know I Hope that justice Kavanaugh\nYes vote the constitution that but I Want to get to do I want to make I don't want them to be ... best on the court I why ... pilot attention\nSpan some anytime that going to be happy with that well it may go against something that I think that parents dictation\nThat will abide by ... and support it I tired of this cork\nA making law than they are not supposed to get that that is currently I Want everybody to do their job Congress' job presidents and their guy and they did ... branch to do their\nCamp for those in the judicial branch who do not do their job or I Would keep in mind one thing uh sharing and I'll just notice to today but as well you look at the constitution that information constitution\nOr the house is spelled out in the constitution the Senate\nThe presidency the chief executive officers the cabin and heads and the like and then you come of course to the article three the or the judicial branch of that is is particularly interesting because it says the judicial power of the United states shall be vested in one Supreme Court\nAnd in such inferior courts as we Congress may from time to time ordain and establish that is to say all of the appellate courts the district courts are creations of Congress Congress can simply repeal any of those courts anytime it so chooses Dave\n[noise] yeah and I think we also know if you if you study the walls really will judges are on the lower federal courts and and there's even been some mention nothing but ... in New York that\nThat is the liberal democratic congressman go\nAhead yeah and it it he's apparently already talking about are trained to I'm a recall or get rid of just his cabinet or you\nCan only do that by impeaching him convicted\nI Know and and and just you know impeachment is just ... that came right out of left field but I think that shows just how extremist some of these people really are on the east side of the aisle and the country is looking at this and they don't like it\nThough I'm I'm sure they do that after this appeals to the base which increasingly has a as Democrats the rather nervous\nOr after what happened to Joe Crowley the New York other New York congressman but again keep in mind as in the case of the presidency\nIf the Democrats get so much as a bare majority in the house yes I'm sure the articles of impeachment against the Donald Trump and possibly Kevin

got changed even even Senator Lindsey Graham who is typically a laid back guy he ... his things were out the other day he was furious\nAt his Democratic colleagues are on the the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd I don't think that's going to go away I think they changed the rules\nAnd you know what they're going to have to live with that for a very long time in in ... when Republicans come back and say there's a Democrat is president uh uh some time the next four to eight years on and we'll see how that works out uh if if\nIf someone is nominated to a a vacancy on the high court ah I think

fabric\nUh you know we talked earlier about a a law enforcement and and how uh the country didn't really have a law enforcement until the early Eighteen hundreds and I checked the Texas Rangers or were formed Eighteen twenty three by\nAustin now All right um\nThe the idea that ah when the constitution was written\nA it was commonplace for people walk around in the village they they'd go to trade they do think they had a fire or with a and it might have been a a Flynn lock or or abrasive pistols or something but they had guns with him\nEverybody behaved at the ... most people behave

ruling into this little Evan that\nBecause semi automatic pistols or protectors so also should be semi automatic rifles and you know that's in some of the Democrats into orbit\nThey'll try it out the term that they could define that their lives depend on what about assault rifles and now I can define an assault rifle for you right now and that is it's a it's black and sinister looking it may have a pistol grip that that's an assault rifle go ahead\nWell I yeah I think you just paint that because quite frankly the term is an invention by the the the gun prohibition lobby and you know they this dates back on and twenty five thirty years\nWe've got to demonize these things and and really make people think that their machine guns and this was the strategy back then and when when Dianne Feinstein opened her questioning\nOf a judge Kavanaugh\nOr the first thing she turned to\nWas guns and and the ... his ah a dissenting opinion which really it was in two thousand eleven and what he said about semi automatic rifles and and then she said something that just is bizarre I called her on this in print she said what about the hundreds of school shootings that we've had or\nThe labels

Know you you met if we look at the size of these guys are just amazing how they are and how fast they are\nAnd say they're overweight trainers and I played early in my career and early unlike coaching for we had we had weight training but we didn't have a coach for that only ... and and we learned after a while it\nThere was a lot to that and uh so the game I see is a size is one of the size has changed dramatically the town level but if you look at it from a from a spectators point of view\nYou're looking at a different game everybody turn that television on everybody comes out pretty much in some kind of an offensive formation where they spread the field they got a kid sitting back there seven plus yards\nHe's a quarterback but he's a tale back in many respects\nAnd if he can run in through the ... he creates more problems defensively they spread the field they throw the ball\nAround and it's nothing for people to score forty fifty points a game that's the big change and I think that's what's happening in the game that they've uh they've made it\nMore exciting but they've got talent level that permit them to\nChange the rules by putting excellent\nPeople on the field everywhere and er and move that bull up and down the field very very it's\nIn addition to the principles that they come forward in the book first forever there are some wonderful anecdotes\nAs a a bobcat CEO those careers inter effect intersected those of book of many others or perhaps one thing that that might be both did was they would be your discussion of the career of Charlie ...\nIf you are a football fan you may recall a kicker was me yes as a matter of fact he certainly was a Hungarian refugee but he uh essentially changed the foot part of football forever to what\nHe sure did the ...\nWere part of the Hungarian revolution they came their father was a doctor and he practiced just outside of Budapest and the Hungarian revolution came along in Nineteen fifty six Charlie was about seven or eight and his brother Peter was I think about twelve his mother was pregnant with a third child\nThought to realize that he couldn't stay where he was didn't know what was going to happen to have it everywhere they found out if they could get to the end of the possibility existed that Australia and open up to the ... and ... to welcome them\nWell put his kids in a basically in a in a [noise] a wagon got somebody to carry them through the forest up there they finally worked after three days and got themselves to the ana only to find out the end it was closed\nSo when he finally check things out he says what our options there any other places we can go they said we can go to America America what's in America anyway they came to America they landed in New Jersey at a place a camp and New Jersey which is a World War two camp and\nAfter being there for a while the father found out that there was a job opportunity up in New York state and the job opportunity was not the practice medicine 'cause he couldn't do that without a license but to be an administrator and he took it went up there an editor\nAnd he sent for the rest of the family they came they came out of business for New York okay that's south of the St Lawrence river and I want to say it's not too far from the north pole I went up there it was cold anyway and make a long story short\nPeter Goes out and you see these guys playing a game you never knew before football\nCan you believe odd things for New York did not have a soccer team they didn't that soccer program which these guys were playing the young age and hungry So Peter started one day he kicked the football he wasn't on the team he was out there and he just happened to kick the football coach ran over to see what are you doing\nHe says I just had already speak English she was trying to tell them where he was doing it goes said you can't do that you don't have any elevation she's gotta get the ball up you know any way he looks over there a week later the coast sees this guy could chemical fifty yards\nThat was the birth of the softer style kicker it a long term is Charlie Charlie\nComes recruit Charlie we get this letter for this\nKid he says you might know my brother Peter who is now at Cornell he said I too am a soccer star kicker and I'm interested in your school he wrote that letter or a lot of a long story short

U. A. Z. is the name of it playing at the university plane as a building block to give extra pillar curricular activity to this didn't base they've started the football program so there are some signs that people are finding a way to keep it alive\nIn the chapter six of your book first forever or a quoting or what you call that the coach of coaches uh granted chief building some of the the positive aspects of the game here I'll just read the for that that he mentioned a positive attitude and approach to life\nA total effort to anything I commit myself to self control of self discipline and caring for others\nUm those are pretty pretty solid point and then a very good points of\nCaring for others I that's a good point I think to explore further at it sometimes seems I think\nThat the people who watch the game who may not have any close association with other than just watching a little screen in their living room but the caring for others would be the last thing they would ascribe to football that it is a\nHard nosed ah ah almost killed or be killed a winning is everything or maybe more along the the Vince Lombardi line of thinking and I'm Wondering your thoughts about this notion of caring in football isn't it very much a\nA hard nose game of of when it not at all costs at at most cost\nFootball isn't it very much a a hard nose game of of when it's not at all costs at at most cost\n[noise] yeah but I think it's come to the point where coaches have come around to becoming more than just\nGuys on the on the field giving you an assignment to block this guy a tackle this guy a cover this band I think they're taking it beyond that to what they do with their lives with Hugh beyond your\nFootball experience 'cause no greater example of caring then when you look at the chapter in here on Jack ...\nWho came in and took over a program at Marshall after they had disastrous crash that killed the entire team coaches in parts of the administration of applying with him went in there and rebuild a program\nRebuild a football program and it's a great story and Jack is a wonderful human being he had a lot he got the job\nThey went through three or four candidates looking how they're going to do this and they took this guy lego whose coach had a small college in Ohio because he was coming from a background where he had to live\nAnd stay and be with his players constantly small college they took a chance with Jack\nAnd he went to marshal and rebuild their program and it's a great story and he's a great story but there are many stories like that you mentioned grand theft rent is the guy that built the Baylor program from nothing he went on the head of the American Football Association for over Twenty years he's giving person and that's why he talks way does\nAnd I think there's a lot of people like that and the game I told people\nWho quickly I tell people that you know there are a thousand coaches out there that were written that book just like mine because there's so many coaches that had the same influence on kids who had the same type of kids that they coached that went on with their lives to bigger and better things\nAre we in need of a\nOld competitive sport for normal size people are I think some years ago there was discussion of maybe a a special form of a basketball for people six feet and shorter\nOr do we need maybe a a a competitive football league for people who weigh two hundred pounds or less\nThat could very well be [noise] you know that's a good question that I really haven't thought about too much but the more you talk\nI could see where it would come down to that if it got to be so different that they only the the biggest in the strongest to play a everywhere or in great places\nI think it would be very interesting to have people who had maybe less size and less talent to find a program that they could fit into because they wanted to play they live they enjoyed it\nA you know we talk about it sure football is a contact sport you're going to hit somebody you need to he had some bruises but a lotta people you talk to and you talk about this book\nEvery one of them will talk about how no matter what happened to him physically as they look back on it the experience was more than worthwhile because they learn how to compete and they learn how to survive that may be an exaggeration but I think in this day and age you look around you need some of that\nYou think you know movies for this installment of film trivia here's some things you may not have known about pulling your guys\nThe books

through the latest edition of Sports Illustrated and are in their inbox section that is to say the letters to the editor if you will or these days emails or whatever I noticed this this very brief little letter\nWas titled perfect storm and I'll quote here shameful and appalling is the only way I can describe this what did the reader find shameful and appalling\nHere's the entire letter Chamberlain appalling is the only way I can describe your coverage of the W NBA championship that's the women's National Basketball association [noise]\nSeattle sweep of Washington was amazing and all you could a lot was one page with a few photos you should be ashamed or such outrage\nOver a game\nOr the writer of that is so proud I mentioned her name is Lisa ... of ... Pennsylvania\nWell Lisa I can answer that question for you I don't know if the sports illustrated people ever got around to reply to you I can tell you a very simply why their coverage was one page in a few photos and that's because nobody watches the WMBA [noise]\nBecause it has very low attendance at any time it's on TV which is sporadically of the ratings are terrible the WNBA exists only because the NBA the cast male league has chosen to subsidize it\nAny women's independent basketball league has gone under\nAnd when I find particularly interesting though is is the language that was used shameful and appalling you should be ashamed [noise]\nNow I'm not that concerned about coverage of women's basketball I Am concerned about people out there who seem incapable of anything that is reasonable perspective about things with which they disagree shameful and appalling\nReally for a minor sport and I'm terribly sorry leaves the but it's a minor sport if you are to judge the the public maybe we should simply arrest all the people in the country who don't have season tickets to a WMBA team that would of course be everybody except for a handful\nJohn or Jane they're outraged again we don't even pay attention after a while John in Seattle calls and believe me John welcome\nHey Jim yes yeah um my take on this or\nIs it I think it's tragic that a young lady that's Eighteen year old\nToday that goes to four years of college for their it's higher institution of public or private there's this constant drumbeat on campus that all men are evil that you always have to be looking over your shoulder but how does that prepare young lady to go out in the world\nAnd have good social skills to make a living to raise a family\nI mean it's it's almost like it's the Victorian area\nYou know it's like there's this real narrowly defined a idea that this is how men and women are and that this is how you have to relate to the opposite sex I mean it's just so narrowly defined it's just like a throwback to Victoria\nWell in many ways it is which is which is ironic because of course to many of these people are rather rather liberty and in in their views about a lot of things that are upset the Victorians but in terms of of being easily offended some of these people come forth like they are one giant raw nerve ending\nIt and I I I think I could walk in with some of these people that I could say a good morning and there was that what you mean by that I think\nI Know it's a it's supposedly a\nLiberal approach but it it's more like a really really a really conservative Victorian I mean it's so narrowly defined about how men and women are supposed to be able to one another so anyway that was my thought on it you have a good night\nShow Thanks John appreciate your thoughts one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six on the bull headed show and in Pittsburgh is that lives up this evening hello Liz\nHi now I Would I Want to say on that was going to be some easier in watery but they can't put that on on man and see that all men that allowed and ... just because they were ... they're not gonna take it out on all men\nMen want to read to\nMe it does happen it it does happen that you're very correct it does happen\nYeah man you know going around ... is often anybody they they are eight than they are killing them read so they're not really in the ... and some ... some of these women\nWell in some cases I I Will I don't know that I can get down to a comparison\nVersus an accusation of rape or an accusation of rape unfounded would be a terrible thing or being raped I have no idea what that would be like and I'm very glad that I I bring Noah\nNoah ... ah empathy if you will to the subject is not something we most of us want to be familiar with but I certainly see your point lives and and I mean again today\nOn all men not mind because some of these moving more rain and I sympathize with them and I I mean it's wrong I might get steam applications for them but they have no right taking it out on on ...\n[noise] well it certainly is not a correct thing to do I would absolutely concur that uh again there's just no legitimate basis for doing that I mean it would be the same thing as if we were to say are based on the Duke lacrosse case all women are liars really based on one case\nWill of course everybody would put down that knows your money you're saying oh women are liars\nAgreed that's ludicrous\nBut how is that different from looking at one incident\nIn which a there are charges against men and assuming all men are pigs I'm Sorry that doesn't hold up either every case is different every case is different and has to be judged on its own circumstances in that I think is the message that that we should be getting across your along with the notion\nOf tried to put your outrage or indignation and some perspective as Steve in ...
