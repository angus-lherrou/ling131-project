have you with us\nAnything uh you know I think on this subject to a rat I think you know the two wars that stuck out to me with\nPeace and tranquility and as you mentioned as we have seen our nation America\nOr that were posted they one nation by did as it hotter in an intensifying with the most recent issues whether it be cabinet off or immigration or Republican or Democrat\nI was wondering what nation\nIf as independent state just like when states will make\nA law of their own\nNow we should look at her over the United states and say OK currently I'm living in Florida because Republicans have a certain philosophy of the way they would like to see things done\nMaybe we should make Florida simply a Republican state\nDemocrats have a certain way with which they like to see things done or whether they care about the environment or support abortion or what have you maybe we should make 'em Texas Democratic state and maybe if we had each individual state\nHave this democratic philosophy for Republican philosophy people that have those philosophies belonging to Democrats or Republicans couldn't live in that state and there wouldn't be all this animosity and great\nWell then as soon as the course of the people read freely mobile also assumes that we could simply dictate what state is now granted election returns mayor so indicate a which direction of the state goes but uh the notion of a viscerally establishing some things\nAre and how would you feel in Florida was determined to be the opposite of you what are you going to just pack up and leave\nSure I Would say that there would be more peace and tranquility in a state that whoever supported\nMe they ... they whether it be bought abortion or not for abortion the people in that state certainly would be much happier and it wouldn't be in my opinion a much more productive state\nOf the most people have much closer ties to localities and bad I mean you brought your quite willing to move wherever whenever but other people\nHave families they have the jobs they have the traditions and and the like and and they would not certainly it would not be all peaceful if suddenly all the Republicans are in\nFlorida in let's say removed to Georgia or something where you where are you going to do to the point of a gun I mean I mean it it just it honestly lean strikes me is just a tad unrealistic really\nAs long as you have a free society now of course if you are if you didn't have a free society ... be very simple but\nPeople\nAs long as you have a free society no of course if you are if you didn't have a free society ... be very simple but\nPeople are much lower than they\nAre not and some are some many or not\nI mean don't you think that's a matter of choice and one is individual life kind of like if they don't like it up north because it's old St Louis downtown\nOh they can but you're talking about or forcibly moving them\nAll I think for moving them it would\nBe hard to move [laughter] well that they're going to be happy where they live well\nBut they're they're going to be more unhappy if they they feel like they've got to leave their view I think would be fine somebody wants to leave Libya others leave\nAgain that would be an optional thing either they can choose me well let's say that would support their values are just the ... or choose to be happy because they don't fight it\nBut of course you know election returns will change what a given state happens to do and then that's kind of an American viewpoint or so you know again uh I'm not sure that I see that as as a solution ... do you draw the lessons from it to your arm\nSo I I I think he'll win raises an important historical point the United states was\nAs you know originally Thirteen independent independent countries briefly and the ... the deal that brought the United states together under the constitution was a was a deal that was supposed to allow exactly the kind of very very significant differences\nIn the state character that help is talking about so all all of us are look back and are appalled at the er at the question of of slavery but we we tend to forget that for example Massachusetts and Connecticut at the time of the founding\nOr had established churches\nAnd we're we're very proud of their of their puritan tradition as being part of the public character and culture of the states\nAnd that didn't mean that anybody was forced to leave those states adjustments that if if you wanted to live and that that kind of a place then then you live in Massachusetts and Connecticut and if you wanted to live someplace else than you'd you'd probably moved to New York and um\nIt it is\nInteresting that over over the last two hundred years the United states you can say has moved more and more towards a enforced\n... trying to force all the states to be the same and as I say I think it's very understandable on the issue of of slavery um but but when you get to a\nWell I wasn't sure if you're going to

languages even have the the word compromise in them I I seriously doubt an Arabic includes the words you pack receipt\nOr because of the of the uh the the way that the many aspects of their culture a proceed so\nUh I I think that there was a much greater recall probably for this kind of thing back when the United nations consisted of a a lot of Western European democracies and we were willing to look the other way for the the Soviet Union and then suddenly all they have the the big\nBreak out of a of a colonial is the ah areas that became nations after the Nineteen sixties and we suddenly saw

British space historian the author of twenty some books\nAs late as being ghost writers published by the capo subtitled when us a German soldiers fought together to save the world's most beautiful horses in the last days of World War two we haven't really gone into this with any great detail but uh\nWe should point out I suppose of the importance of these horses just from the standpoint of if you will breeding stock because I gather that is why the Germans had them in the first place right\nYes I've said that if it's on a breed or very very special breed of a white holes are found in the end of the Spanish riding school\nThey have been carefully bred for hundreds of years hundreds and hundreds of years the Austria Hungarian empire a date performed a very special kind of a display which is known as high schooling of whole says um is very stylized and of course if you go to Vienna today you can see this and they hope the palace and\nThe blood line was absolutely pure and the Germans grab these whole says with the intention of feeding them into a program to create if you would like an area and a ton of soup a whole for the gentleman army\nThat's absolutely believe\nWhich has been defeated elsewhere in that coming up and groups of several hundred or and they say this has some kind of a red flag to a ball or some kind of opportunity and they launch a couple of concerts it attacks\nOn the ah the little town which has defended by only you know a couple of hundred Americans is very light weapons and the small vehicles and uh they have to fight them off and they have a couple of\nA fairly serious battles if\nThe ss had managed to break in of course it would have led to amass loyal to 'em and the other thing is it leads to the creation of something called stew its foreign legion which is the interesting part of the story\nOf bleeds the limits learned more about stewards foreign legion\nWell the officer was asking to come out with a guy called a captain told us to it and uh you know he's any young officers right combat experience but he's left with a really difficult situation is simply doesn't have enough men to defend the town and the sad\nSo he looks around and of course when they came in they all said liberated some allied POWs there was some Americans\nBrits polls sides French except for and they've been working with the whole says for some years and he is able to um some of those were captured gently weapons but it's still not enough men so he intends eventually to the German prisoners that they have taken\nAnd um he re arms field expedient a quite a number of German soldiers have within a man checkpoints alongside\nEx POWs and us soldiers and of course this is known as students foreign legion where you throw the costs accent as well into this twenty on ... and of course when they uh S. S. actually attack it is Americans fighting shoulder to shoulder with German and British POWs and\nContacts and everybody else to defending the stand or the townspeople and of course the ah the women and children of the stuff so it's an absolutely amazing story\nThis foreign legion that this was a collection of people who if you put them all together in a bar or some place they would do very many drinks before some of these people were going at each other's throats in the in in this period of intense pressure or were they able to get them to do work together without killing each other\nI think the ... was that ten they rule in in this together the whole is whether that ticket out if they were left behind they would fall into Soviet captivity the Germans could expect to a nice trip to Siberia and I do like\nA it's not being shot on the spot or for the others of course uh they just want to get out and get back to the American line so the horse has become the saviors of the men and women and children that are also there as well so it's very complex\nOn top of that we have one more play I we haven't mentioned which is the ... a communist pot in his hands who also operating in the forest they would like to snatch the whole says as well because they see them as being checked prophecy because they are on check land so we had another ad is dying mentioned to their says well\nDid they manage to to get in the way of the operation these the check Mart as\nThey try to as the Americans were taking them out they man some roadblocks on the very edge of check territorial of the very end border and a couple of American officers ... a real showdown with the guns were caught and loaded and pointed and it was you know a case of who are being fast\nFortunately for everybody the checks playing fast tend to allow the Americans with that German or allies and everybody else to pass through the whole says into safety in the area\nWe concentrated on the horses are a unique part of the story but of course as you noted the American forces discovered a lot of humans there as well refugees and the like did the everybody a person's horses that they managed to get out safely\nWell kennel read them initially didn't want us\nDid the everybody a person's ah horses that they all managed to get out safely\nWell tunnel read them initially didn't want to take out refugees because he thought it was a military operation but then when he came up in the south a couple of days later when he saw the plight of these people and he decided that he would turn a blind eye to what was going on and if they to join this great loans straggling colored people\nWhich was code name operation cowboy or to move these papal whole says everybody else into the area that would be all that on good because\nYou know a lot of these people are was sedate and Germans and they had a either been born in the area or move there and the Nazi occupation the checks hated them and the checks at a time and to get rid of these people out of Czechoslovakia\nAnd ... after the war was quite a few unpleasant massacres and a lot of victimization so these people want it out as fast as possible into the west\nNow at this point of course the U.S and the Soviet Union were still technically allies the Cold War and it not be gone but I gather that this incident with the ghost writers began what we might call and I suppose the the period of post war irritation between the two", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "03"}
