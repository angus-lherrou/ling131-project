ignore Richard your call low Charlotte let's go to a Calvin in St Louis hello Calvin\nHey how are you were when they are you\nTalking to the governor of the world there I mean I I I I grew up in Arkansas and what he said about girls is absolutely true 'cause I have five girls\nAnd every one of them can take down just about anybody after fighting in something they believe at it and you should just be so proud of your daughter I I agree with that lady earlier but I just wanted to ask you is well I wanted to say something to\nYou know you're one of the most truthful people I have ever heard on the radio or TV or as a governor or as a politician\nOr concerning abortion I think you're about the only person I hear\nA hundred percent of the time talking the truth about what that's about it and I think ... uh I Would ask you I mean do you think that this has more to do about abortion but it does anything else where Kavanaugh facing this opposition\nI think it does a cow in in in large measure because the liberals are scared to death that there might be an honest look and revisit a rosy weight which was a ridiculous decision\nThat was a reaching out into thin air and creating a law that did not have any basis in the constitution but what most people don't understand either to grow the weight or reversed it doesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states and each and every state would make its own\nWould approach it my own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question is to deal with it true the issue of person who heard because if we would accept the biological fact this is the science of of the unborn\nThat every person is a person from the point of conception\nThan the Fifth Amendment would actually be far stronger than any Robie way a ruling ever could be in protecting life liberty and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd would provide due process and would make it impossible for anyone to deprive a person of their life and liberty and I I really hope that that's where we ended up moving with this because there should be about protecting innocent people not just about stopping abortion\nGo up to ten seconds here my then I Want you to stay on the line we'll speak unfair but I was doing a little checking your calendar on inauguration day twenty twenty five you'll be sixty nine same ages Reagan was when he was elected

Jordan Peterson who we highlight in the film you say a psychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a blocked by Google or from accessing his Gmail accounts and his Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has millions of people that have downloaded his conscience so\nIt does happen to people or more often than you think and it just demonstrates the power that this company has to decide if their whim\nOr how they are going to control what you see and what you have access to\nBut they don't play favorites well\nI mean that they claim right I mean I mean I I don't think that the example you just gave our our particularly noteworthy I mean there's sort of thing\nAnd and and what the oil being that that I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claimed that they don't do this\nYou know that well that's exactly right and and one of the research studies that up Stein did that is particularly interesting when we go through this in the in the film\nIs during the twenty sixteen election uh you they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John ah blindly um but they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches um on both\nGoogle and bang as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was over five six month period\nAnd then they captured all the search results that people got now some of these volunteers were in red states where some\nWere blue states some of the Republican somewhere Democrats independents all kinds of genders you know all kinds of social economic status and what they found when they reviewed the result was that you know things seem to be pretty balanced but Google and every single search position of the\nTop ten search results\nThis the results favored Hillary Clinton what they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump\nIn the same search results um and you know by his estimate this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't shelter results at the end of the day\nUm but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is that science essentially political\nBut he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty six teams are and what he is concerned about of course it's not the political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses but his real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that ran undecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election\nThat when they start sort of going to the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for a and looking at the search results do we really want to have a company with the power\nTo influence the outcome potentially of elections and that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer at the one eight six six five oh Jim bode one eight six six five oh five or six to six on the jumbo had a job when we come back in just a moment\nTo him in a

your face\nYou know what we're facing now is not any kind of police state\nBut what we are facing is this all this power that is trying to persuade us that is trying to steer us in a certain direction but we can't really see the fist but it's still there and the power is still there and I think you're exactly right I mean imagine a\n... imagine I'm ... now or a stolen or a Mussolini\nThat had this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we've given them an enormous power and Google basically tells us is trust us yeah trust us\nGeorge Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois Linda\nHow loud cam am I going to make a quick comment a lot of uh the believe that the party has been building a Nazi techno state with going on Facebook and all these people but what I really called us asking I Want to thank our guests for what he's been doing and about search engines and\nThey're used to be I could click which had\nA they they have another wine cup start page the same company but they got rid of ex click and that was if you didn't want to use Google result he wanted other resolved and I don't understand that Google suppress did they make them suppressing quicker what happened to it and I use that that go\nNo that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in the space so look at apple for example apple has this search engine called safari but safari is actually run by Google\nBecause Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year for the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that\nIt's an apple product and Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing their searches but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that\nBecause they want the information and the data that comes through search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing everywhere and you're exactly right start page a\nIs a a search engine you get great results they actually use Google algorithm\nThey have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without data being president I think that is that is going to change eventually biggest star page is becoming more popular it was a deal struck awhile ago Dr go is good\nIt's it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges that best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google but the price that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you\nTo either steer you are manipulate you in a way for commercial gain or for other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there is even you know discussions about the fact that band\nWhich is the Microsoft product which is sort of the great rival\nTo Google a century and twenty six teams truck a commercial agreements or Microsoft and Google struck a commercial agreement we don't know exactly what that agreement is but um they essentially have stopped\nBeing so hostile to Google with a lot of people believe that there is some kind of arrangement where they're doing a search they're cooperating and search so that's part of a challenge there really aren't that many great alternatives\nWe'll be back

uh I mean I can I guess I can understand the flamboyant or\nOr something of is important I think I Would say that my daughter I Hope you understand as the daughter of a senator the importance of this the voters come up this way we can move the wedding to Sunday but if we lose this vote it will affect the entire country I've heard people say just what you just said and and my answer would be no\nNo this is more important I mean it's not like your your daughter is not going to get married later getting married tomorrow or I'm In this case\nIf you're talking about senator able to get married Sunday uh he does say that he will attend the his daughter's wedding in Montana and uh uh\nThis is an interesting thing right here though there's been an unusual late night phone call in which a

for whatever that's worth\nIt's short and that he has made arrangements to be there to get him across the finish line as needed so uh for for whatever that's worth a I I guess he's found a way around this so that that's the short answer on that one that he has a he has promised Kavanaugh if he needed he will be there so\nAgain a law that makes me feel better it left me feel a lot better too I got to tell you it Steve a I had been the bothered about that and I just reached checked the wires here and ah the GOP\nCould hold the session opened by the overnight and allow Danes to vote on Sunday if needed to be\nA a whether or not the cabinet or a a a\nWhether or not they deserve promised to Capitol I mean the with the pure bribe pathetic some of the vote is not clear but the GOP good old the session open overnight\nOr that could happen a so technically are in the Senate parlance that would mean that a Saturday would be a Sunday will be redefined as Saturday or they could do that and and I'll guarantee you if it came down to the point where let's say it is a\nIt is fifty to forty nine against Kavanaugh okay\nAh I'll guarantee you that is what the Republicans will do and then the Danes will fly and quickly make it a fifty fifty tie and the parents would cast a tie breaker so that clarifies that for me I I had been\nThe most curious as to how how bad could happen and apparently
