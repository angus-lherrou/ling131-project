items worth more than ten Fifteen thousand dollar home\nThat are all going down in value okay yeah [laughter] okay and you may have thousand dollars a year\nYeah yeah but I I'm thirty one I I don't cook scared about what you're going to say about my house but\nTwo to five Andy and fresh or in the lobby of Ramsey solution is just stopped five cars that were in the neighborhood from Anchorage\nAlaska really ... thanks for coming by guys are you have an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question we do we have a question\nAbout um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go there we're going to retire from our jobs and laugh and Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family what we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n\nThe camp will be a the the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... own all and we'll be rented or on\nWe currently on that property currently on that property and we'll be living on it\nTime and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be or non profit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of a you know\nYou need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I'd be concerned about or that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the time they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\n'em things that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nOr I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not you know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want there's ... let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land you know you got a mess\nStuck with land in a nonprofit that can get real sticky if you want to lose ... let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands of the land is owned by the nonprofit you see what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a and so treat the you know the landlord had can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that\nAnd any of the things that the uh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you and your your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying as a treat these things separately and your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of insurance people shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it they might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so huge that you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you what how that how the liability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that writes your policy or two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing\nAnd it costs this much and this cover company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it costs this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the farm plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that\nCan you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing you want to ... do do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight anything of this um\nNo I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\n... and\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from ... you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay and um\nA liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless\nYou are liable for that or you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh because we didn't you know properly installed the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a hollow Varmus before he walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called ... those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk but uh I hold harmless is\nIt what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts keeps honest people honest right it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employer you fell on your face 'cause you trip\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not have to write him a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nUh and it'd be proven that\nTo them when their case to not have to write him a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nUh and it'd be proven that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I\nI Would have um signed them and those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are often Brenda about how if you die you're not that they're not liable they're still level [laughter]\nThey'll still loose [laughter] so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you hey thanks for the call and you're ... you're joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll talk AAA eight to five five two to five All right Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a Christian and I'm a new American I Apologize that this is something that you've touched on our website and find new to the baby step and I know that number wine is paying the thousand dollar\nAnd mark and the fun mhm my question is do you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing happen mhm I stay at home I got a kid\nBut I'm just wondering and how do you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would dare okay he's in an unstable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry I'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years and never happened we really lucky we've never been laid off and then they get sent home pretty quick I mean within a\nCouple of weeks she don't couple of weeks to do something and he's going to work on something when he comes home if they did get laid off so\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I Would push paws on hold them want to make a little baby step thing and just pile of cash\nBut just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOf the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners checkout one dental dot com it's not\nDental insurance one didn't as a dental discount program that functions like a membership club think of it like Costco you join for a small yearly fee and you say big every time you use it\nMichael thank you for serving your country really appreciate is good to talk to you\nMartin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave hey what is that\nWhile I was a one of your opinion on regards to um to whether it's just all my rental property to pay off my primary residence or and pay off any other dead also that I have\nA much other data got\nJust two cars um I had credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the last I Would say three or four months\nOkay so your debt free but two cars and two houses right okay how much do you own your cars\nI'm fifty thousand on bald each or total on both total\nOkay wow and what's your household income [noise] ah one thirty okay you have a lot of car and um\nSo what do you own your primary and what do you owe on the rental\nMy primary I go to fix the and it's worth about five fifty\n...\nThan the rental and now my my rental Ohio one takes the and it's worth about I Would say or thirty a fellow at work they be but I if I'm at a little bit less\nOkay so I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right\n[noise] right\nSo on you know if we state taking say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars\nRight and so on you know if we stay taken say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental first probably go ahead and pay off the rental ah my pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know you start doing what forty fifty grand a year and\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh four twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years clean up those two things after the Europe paying off your car um or you can show the rental now and be done\nRight I mean that's what I really had him classroom whether to to do that and and pay off most of the party much taller rent on ... pretty much all my dad on it but I also have in mind for that but I have a son who was about to well I Would say in in two years she's going to go to college\nI don't have a house by managing cash while they're right okay you know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore\nRight now my credit card check that out there and that you want me to get right by a car you pay cash for it I'm All right you never know money again on anything if you do that because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that's that's the planet you can to get on track\nYeah you can't shorter ride this out of debt horse\nIt doesn't work you can't shorter ride him you've got a ride him or not\nAnd so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental\nAnd pay off everything cash flow college now say about ... some other rentals with cash or go along out there in the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have and go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff\nBut you got to stop it you got to break the cycle\nAnd if you've broken the cycle then yeah I'd dump the rental and pay off the cars would pay off the house\nUm and it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a sap build your emergency fund and then start building towards junior college fund and then once you got junior college covered ah by just don't want to start in a savings account the should junior college junior colleges do within their\nBuild it up build it up build it up build it up\nAnd work your way right through it and then um then once that's done then you just start saving up paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way\nBut we're working the baby step share the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the ... I Would I Love rental property but I Love being debt free more\nAnd so I don't borrow money in life is good when I don't have any payments any where life is good it's awesome\nI thanks for the call

you once again to worship today a gate we also welcome those listening in on our radio broadcast reasons given in memory of Julius and also the first of all given by their families and also give thanks to the altar family altar flowers are which are given in memory of Justin and Sandy Blair given by ...\nMiller I saw a number of things happening in the next few weeks in the life of our community for the big one is that next week is our final goodbye at least as him as our pastor or a pastor Steve\nI'm In so I keep in mind remember that there's only one service we're all going to do it together at ten o'clock and so you can join us at ten o'clock I also see there'll be some songs before that if you want to come a little earlier at nine forty five\nBut it'll be a joint service at that time after the service is going to be a party which you're all invited with food it'll be downstairs in the fellowship hall of the meal is being catered so you don't need to worry about that but if you want to bring a desert were kind of doing a desert ... potluck\nUm and then also um we have the White House catering or they said they'll bring the food they'll even serve it but they said if we stand in line kind of like a ... a buffet it's going to take forever to get our food so they recommended if we had a few people to help us kind of just handed out it's not\nBig menu ordering but just kind of bring it played out to a table\nIt would help us so we have a sign up sheet in the lobby or we need about ten volunteers we have about a third of them we need a but if some of you could call in here to just brings a place the tables that will help prevent go much more smoothly and we could say a wonderful goodbye to pastors Steve so join us for that event this next Sunday\nWe also as we are focused on stewardship\nOr every year for the last few years we've been focusing on giving a I always say if you're someone who never gives electronically to anything and you're like writing a check than God Bless you thank you for doing that and that's wonderful\nBut if you're someone who does automatic payments in other forms of giving we would invite you to do that with trinity as well the two reasons we invite you to do that one is that it's easier for the person you don't have to remember your check\nOr you don't have to worry about forgetting you're offering and the other is that quite frankly it's better for the church a lot of times\nMany of us are gone for weeks at a time they were gone for some of the summer you giving allows the church to have a more consistent base of giving a also if you are someone who likes to give maybe in this way but you're kind of embarrassed because when offering plate comes there's nothing to show for it there's actually some little cards buy\nA on that wouldn't table by the window that you could put in that says I'm giving you a by giving so you don't have to not participate in the operating like either so if it's something you would consider a let us know you can either set it up through your bank or you can come to our office and will help you set it up\nWe also have some orientation classes about to happen for those of we're interested in joining trinity or those classes will be this coming Tuesday on October thirtieth and then the following one on November six\nUm and those are from seven to eight or so if you would like to be a new member or if you know someone who would let them know about those classes\nAnd then finally joined would like to share an announcement as well\nSince the projection is being ... this morning is there a slight up there with looser that will play for me\nHow about the him slide\n\nSo like my plan was during\nThe offering we were going to have a reformation\nSing along nothing's up there that looks like he's like a slight\nA Lutheran that built on a rock and true just one foundation\n[noise]\nI don't know what the numbers are 'cause I thought it would be built on Iraq we're going to sing versus one in five a built on a rock\nThree sixty [noise]\n\nAlright look up\nWell is that in the green book alright it's green but [noise]\nAnd as we reached the end of our time with pastor Steve as our senior pastor we pray for him as well we asked that you would bless him in the next phase of his life in retirement that you would help it to be a time of well learned rats of joy of attending to all the wonderful relationships you've given him\nAnd also that you would show up ways to continue to share his gifts\nAttending to all the wonderful relationships you've given him\nAnd also that you would show up ways to continue to share his gifts to get back\nTo find meaning in this world lord in your Marcy\nLoving God we also look at the news and we see\nAwful stories of hate and violence\nWe think about those who of attacks some of our leaders that our country we think about the person who attacked the synagogue and the poor victims of that tragedy we ask that you would bless all those who are hurting right now\nWe have that you would also work in the hearts of those who have heat\nThat you would give them something better in their lives to focus on than who they don't like or who they hate that you would show them you're loves so that their lives can be transformed lord in university\nAnd finally we lift up all those who need your Karen special ways those who are sick in mind body and spirit those who are hungry those were lost and hurting\nWe pray for those in our own community and among our loved ones who need your care including jacked up\nContinues in the hospital and I didn't care centers and we lift up any\nPrayers on our hearts in a moment of silence\nLoving God we offer are all all our prayers in everything we are to you the name of our lord and savior Jesus Christ\n\nWe\nKnow it is truly\n\nA a\nR fell there and heaven\nHallowed for your name your kingdom come your will be done\nOn earth and heaven give us the day our daily bread and forgive us our sins as we forgive those who send against us save us from the time\nOf trial and deliver us from eagle the kingdom\nAnd the power and the glory of yours now

thank you for serving your country buddy we appreciate is going to talk to you\nMartin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave hey what is that while I was a one of your opinion on regards to um to whether it's just all my rental property to pay off my primary residence or and path any other dead also that I have\nA much other debt if he got\nJust two cars um I had credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand and alive that will take three or four months\nGet your your debt free but two cars and the two houses right okay how much do you own your cars\nI'm fifty thousand on balls\nOr total on both total\nOkay wow and what's your household income [noise] ah one thirty okay you gotta lotta car and um\nSo what do you own your primary and what do you owe on the rental\nMy primary to fix the and it's worth about five fifty\nMhm\nAnd the rental and um my rental Ohio one takes the end is worth about I Would say or thirty Philip has four fifty but I if I'm at a little bit less\nOkay\nSo I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right\n[noise] right\nAnd so on you know if we state taking say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off in well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental for probably go ahead and pay off the rental um might pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know you start doing what forty fifty grand a year and that\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh four twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the year of paying off your car um or you can show the rental now and be done\nRight I mean that's what I really had a question whether to to do that and and pay off most of the party much taller rent on path pretty much all my dad on it but I also have in mind that for that but I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in two years he's going to go to college\nI don't have a house payment you can cash flow that right okay you know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore\nImaging cash flow that right okay\nYou know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore\nRight now my credit cards are cut up there and they get right by a car [noise]\nGet paid cash for it I'm All right you never grow money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense right that that's the planet you can to get on track yeah you can't shorter ride this out of debt horse it doesn't work\nYou can't shorter routed me got to ride him or not\nAnd so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental\nAnd pay off everything cash flow college and I'd say about my mission where the rentals with cash or go along out there into the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have and go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff but you got to stop it\nYou got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycling yeah dumped the rental um pay off the cars would pay off the house on them\nAnd it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a slap build your emergency fund and then start building towards junior college fund and then once you got junior college covered um by just don't want to start in a savings account the junior college junior colleges do it in their\nBuild it up build it up build it up build it up\nAnd work your way right through it and then um\nThen\nOnce that's done then you just start saving up paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're working the baby step share the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the soil that rental I Would I Love rental property but I Love being there for a more\nAnd so I don't borrow money in life is good when I don't have any payments any where life is good\nIt's

about the facts of the energy industry\nFeared the crude by media network we generate positive energy with programs like building the Bach and were able to tell the stories about\nThe people the communities and the companies all those that are involved with the energy industry the ones who are living the evolution of the pocket oil field and the oil and gas industry\nOn today's episode of

around fifty three forty six Wednesday from the weather elegy weather center\nWell thank you for joining us this week here on the crude life programming and I love this time of year because uh we get to a visit with a individuals like yourself and I remember\nVisiting with Vicki Steiner every year to er about your guys his annual meeting coming up and I love the annual meetings because it kind of gives us a time to recap and then go ahead and use that information and look ahead at you know two thousand and Nineteen or the next year so\nUh first of all let let's get some of the ah information on where and when and\nJust kind of some of those details on when is your guys annual meeting coming up\nRight our annual meeting in open at ... pm on Wednesday on November seventh and it runs true or early afternoon on November ... when then Thursday November seventh eighth and we're going to be or mayors resort in casino at Wayne out\nOh great that should be fun I mean some people that they've got the gambling there and everything\nWell they do you choose to partake you would have that opportunity certainly\nWell who you know people coming in from out of town and we got an offer some different entertainment I was going to ask you to some of these cities ever been on you guys ... like a Super Bowl because I Know it's been a Dickinson and ... and\nYou know you I Know you guys try to a hit a new town all the time to do the economic developers are it's a bit on your chambers bit and guys like the super bowl\n[noise] well we know we don't exactly minute I mean we were just kind of tried to do our best and move it around a little bit we wash our city and twenty six team that can last year and it was time that with the north again so we were looking for a location in the north and I'm\nA you know the ... facility is certainly large enough to accommodate us with a small trade show we've got to sing examiners lined up and I'm probably a you know expect a hundred or a hundred and twenty five close to register for the meeting large crowd\nYeah but it's it's a crowd of um [noise] you know experts it's a crowd of veterans it's a crowd of people that are you know in the industry and quite honestly ... representing some pretty big players out in the box and I I've been to I think three or four of the annual meetings in ... you know you're talking about\nYou know a good number of well we'll call it a wealth of information so ah ... the one of the things that I really liked about are you guys annual meeting I was in the western Dakota Energy Association yes\nOkay I'm Sorry I sometimes I get it uh my my my acronyms mixed up so is is the presenters I'm\nGenerally you guys are offering some really good information and then if you sometimes even got a panel of uh some of the oil companies that sort of thing well what are you guys got plan this year in terms of maybe some themes or uh some speakers of known\nWell I don't know that we haven't seen necessarily but I tell you what Jason I'm really pleased with the way the the agenda came together we are as you say some pretty high or high powered or influential folks in the industry the or the end of the day and it kind of a day and a half this year I'm waiting for the first time we've done that in a while just to get all the\nTime to all the different topics and\nI'll just get yeah you know the first day here we are going to start out talking about Chuck preventing issues or whatever oversized trucks and there's a lot of\nDuring the block and of course um and they're meant the issues with it you know whether they're you know you stay on the state highway area get pushed off on a county road\nSometimes so we'll have a little bit of a discussion about the issues that have surrounded the truck permitting system or a or we operate the system for the counties in the oil producing region network that one\nThe truck permitting system or a or we operate the system for the counties in the oil producing region and we're now in the process of expanding that just a statewide\nUm and I'm making some significant enhancements to it that we're going to have a a relatable mapping system so basically the trucking industry in western North Dakota and the entire state eventually we'll have a what we call the Google Maps for trucks\nUm trucks can't necessarily go everywhere that car can and but this this uh mapping system is willing to take them around some of those restricted areas of the narrow brand or\nYou know that sort of thing so that'll open the conference and then the second half of the afternoon we'll be devoted to a gas capture and um some of the issues we've had with flaring we're going to have a panel um that includes folks from a ways to swallow getting crushed when\nI'm Talking about some of their investments in the state I'm remain substantial investments in pipeline and gas processing it their structure has been happening or will also have a you know an update from Justin ... dead from the north Dakota bike wind up already looking forward to you know what we're going to need it in terms of pipeline capacity to address some of these machines\nSo that that's kind of the afternoon ... will look like on it with\nA brand alone is a ... a head of North Dakota North Dakota operations for his corporation a kind of getting a rundown on you know the latest research into linked detection technology to avoid a and prevent uh some of the leaks\nLeaks it you know how much of a unfortunately occurred um technology can solve just about anything and they are really looking at some promising new ideas\nYou allude to lead to tension detection is a very interesting because the U.S industry home those who are going to really work together um I don't I'm not sure if that's\nGoing to be discussed that you guys this conference or not but I Know that's you know that's coming down the line that sort of thing I'm just marry news to industries together so\nWe'd detection can be seen from the five thousand foot view or so to speak so\nUh I I wrote down the truck permitting system in the gas capturing wanted to ask you a couple of follow up questions on that are of course the trucks you you know they're they're strongly vital to the block and I'm a kind of me you know whether it's getting a liquid there or the liquids on there\nAnd you know when I was in ... out there in the western North Dakota the the ... were kind of making the news a little bit to slide off that sort of thing um\nTalk to me a little bit about some of those are those roads getting getting I'm\nAgainst ... done some some of those uh roads that could just slide off when when when it rains that sort of the things that are in in in this study at all I mean some of those roads were a little bit out out of ... to ... that makes sense at all\nWell a little bit yeah um you know it's a challenge I mean that you know you look look at some of the school and the counties out there um they're not just um uh maintaining existing roads or improving existing roads and a lot of cases\nKelly are still building roads and the industry in some cases contributing to that some of the cases in the industry has built its own roads are well that you know and it's an ongoing a need for infrastructure converted tiny compared you know when you look at eastern North Dakota those are farm to market roads and you know the\nConstruction of rose rode the current you know early in the early part of the twentieth century you know when a\nWhen you go to the economy was just getting rolling you know from the days of from statehood forward but that never really happened in in western North Dakota because there wasn't really a lot of crop land and you know it was more a rain\nThat never really happened in western North Dakota because there wasn't really a lot of crop land so you know it was a range land for cattle in livestock and that sort of thing so you don't have a lot of those\nFarm to market road that's situation in parts of western North Dakota where the structure is just now happily\nRoads that provide access to the remote parts of\nThis are just so I'm going to ask you to hold on to that thought for just a moment we're going to have to take a brief pause here at building democracy but we'll be right back my name is Jason species and this is built in the box and radio heard

don't just take my word for word listen to what Christie Hubert president of the United way of ... says about hatch coaching\nYeah absolutely yeah um I mean the industry is open to any kind of innovation right now you get it if you get an idea of the industry is going to listen for all the people don't necessarily know you know we get\nOne and a quarter million barrels of oil being produced everyday in North Dakota but\nUm when you process that gas we also have four hundred thousand barrels of natural gas liquids coming out of the block and two and a man that's a that's a good commodity yet so I you know the building block the request sticks industry the petrochemical industry\nA lot of value being generated here which we can you know we're that value added if we get that next step I think people would be thrilled with that\nJust Simon with the western Dakota Energy Association and executive director on the line with is um a couple of questions left here uh we get into the sponsors and some of the people supporting the\nAnnual meeting here in just a second uh and that's what we're talking about using the annual meeting and kind of going out from there talking about you know two thousand Eighteen some of the things that they're looking at and you know with the gas gathering projecting\nOut a little bit but [noise] um but you you know you you do quite a bit when it comes to a policy and a government relations and that sort of thing\nOr what are some of the key topics right now that the listening audience should keep an eye on you know see the the the top three\nAre oil and gas related a policy in ten of from the political side of things which should people you know if they see a headline which they possibly could have done the story to find out more because it's going to impact the industry\nAnd Jason that than I think when they do work on birds because our annual meeting that's you know a lot of the political talk is going to come up on on day to one of the one of the biggest issue is probably the biggest issue with industry right now is workhorse because\nKnow in the industry can grow it can't it can't function without people so I'm On a
