I'm going back and forth you know show what debt that you pay off\nWe paid a ... like that I think of a Home Depot credit card mhm and the law I don't remember\nYou're with us Chuck is on the line and it's our\nJob welcome to the ...\nHave thanks for taking my call sure what's [laughter]\nWell my my wife and I have a ... a about a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt over the past two and a half years good for you\nAnd ... but we've only got about ... ... because we have our mortgage oil three rental property that we have mortgages on and and that's true and a half years we've had a son who graduated high school or college we paying\nAbout half the tuition would have been taken out one should be other half and I and\nI stopped contributing to fall okay and if I've got a beginner baby step say but I just feel like I I'm not sure what to do next I I feel like a ...\nLot doing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income about a hundred thousand ... okay\nShow can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school\nAnd stop the studio is\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on a these rental properties as we've been for the past couple of years\nOkay if you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into bed I Would rather pay get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is there a reason they plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to be going to college tutor Lex cheers\nAnd you know well ... maybe stuff for five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement five is kids college what you want or cash flowing in this case\nAnd ah the Sixers payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth but really um you know in your case you're going to really does you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to pay on your mortgage is\nYeah which is stupid in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think a lot of our Confederate that we should go save up a a a three three maybe four months emergency fund that then yeah\nAnd then and then I stopped taking out student loans yeah\nAnd clear them out and do the same with the other two and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there's money above that then we started throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two so it sounds like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn the house is tiny but then and then and that was more of your house mortgage must be small\nYeah it's about all about fifty sixty Seventy thousand a piece\nOkay a fifty 'cause you said\nThey're all about fifty sixty Seventy thousand a piece okay or the fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen ... yeah yeah and for what is the only one and only twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year well no I was going to feel good and my son is still on the take out a low\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay I knew there was one in there somewhere to make the math work All right Ah yes still I'm just going to plink along on those minimums and take your college without that first\nOnce we got college without that then we find money we throw it at the at the probably go knock out a little twenty five one out and then I'm going to next knocked my house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\nAnd then about first we're getting back in the four oh one K. are a lot\nSo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now now okay yeah well no so did you get your emergency fund\nRight yeah emergency fund is maybe step three and then babysit for his Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack baby steps four five six in order to actually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five or six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then if there's money left we keep going down the list in the next thing on the list is mortgages doctrine\nIs that there's so there's still a prioritization even though some of the news is that logical\nYeah I guess I'll just try that joke that had that for ... for two and three I guess technically\nYears given five or ... yeah yeah\nYeah and you have any skip three to yeah [laughter] yeah so yeah you're\nOn our lawyers which you're back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a

hundreds of heads on line [noise] um what struggling with here that we paid one state for the house\nThe average stays on the market in my area as three hundred and sixty nine good\nLord what is wrong on the area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania\nWe have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half a million [noise] um and then ... and set out to the Haitian because it's on lake\nWe're on water on a on a dream but I'm a military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know you're not in in Harrisburg proper then no no I'm In like northeast ... up near New York border but so your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yes\nDummy three sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in\nI mean and all that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff\nRight and you just have a limited market I don't know what to tell you other than a is there anyone in the resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort is or is there a a real her up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see their son\nThis was in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the have stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives are that are not not purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort area\nThe higher end stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these it's overall it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise] we need

clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through them and they realize where it was I walked away they were not client's\nLocation Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\nThat 'cause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours his sold for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the la [noise] yeah\nBut he found a buyer for us to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one I mean do I pick another will call yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses\nThat when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and it says gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the person that can do that\nThis that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel them down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area\nAnd that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you and that a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't want this area\nThey and they don't have a central buyers and you need to it's a very unique\nSemi rural ... situation\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nIdentity theft has

marine\nFried burger rail facility in Belleville North Dakota course you know that's like the heart of the market out there and what they're going to do is forty nine thousand five hundred barrels per day that's how much the capacity is going to be the Davis refinery to Davis refineries really going to look at refining products from local crude\nOil out of the Bach and to serve the regional market so the reason this is such a big deal is because this is the first Greenfield refinery built in the United states can over fifty years so it's going to be the industry standard globally so what's going to end up happening is\nAfter this Davis refinery has build is now going to be the new standard so a lot of exciting things are happening out there a lot of people wondering what's going on with the neighbors refinery\nWhen there's something on the big magnitude and the prominence when you're talking about setting a new standard in clean technology\nThe last um kind of the director's cut\nUh my my my recollection is we have record highs and both crude oil and natural gas is that right\nIndustry now during the winter months coming in summertime oh well\nThere you know more real\nHappening

that the technology that that's been developed over the last several years continues to Bob ... just about everyone is well they're getting real they are are significantly better than they were say five years or or more ago [noise] and so\nIt takes less well completion to have a quick rate so production girl than in the area to all those things coming together a lean into work expecting to me

going to the oil it's in her newest majority still leave in the region by pipeline when we look at just up here where I could share you know we're about Seventy one percent\nWhere we now I operate

North Dakota's Morgan Elbert eight hundred thousand barrels of oil per day by real car\nNumbers are much smaller today but they are growing that show now estimate to run around two hundred and Seventy five thousand a salon barrels per month leaving by rail car\nUm and that number's expected that continue not to grow out one of the more immediate challenges from the industry right now on
