I'm In North Dakota in a predominantly conservative state\nUm shouldn't she is an elected representative boat how her she had to represent us people if they want cabinet I shouldn't sheep for Kavanaugh for that because she is representing our needs her oh\nWell that's a good question I I don't think so and many times what ends up happening is individuals that might have\nAccess to more information vote one way rather than the others and then you'd you changed your opinion let me give you an example neck you know in in the beginning many people are in North Dakota would never have voted to push an investigation into Richard Nixon\nThey never would have and then when they found out what happened that polling completely changed and so as a senator you got to vote with what you

[noise]\nI can agree with that um my ideal is is you know we're seeing a lot of the testimony and stuff on TV [noise] um she doesn't seem to be\nAsking to North Dakota Public what our opinion is on

whether or not you believed her [noise]\n... and I'm not even talking about myself so much I'm just talking about the broader spectrum we put and it's not even just tatty it Kevin Cramer it's all of our representative that we've come to Washington and\nI'm not cutting you off neck I just the clocks got me\nDone well I Would disagree with that [laughter] why I mean I play a medical marijuana\nThat got done I did um a Sunday opening that passed the house died in the Senate I did that dance breast tissue which I think said women's lives that one got done\nI Want to go back to the the the issue that you had a Sunday opening that died in the house yeah\nNo it died in the Senate okay diamond standard I mean you pass it through the house which he is in control of yes okay she will make sure that he voted against it well that that's OK they did he rise and take on Pam and I mean he voted against your legislation\nAnd you still got past being a member of a big time minority absolutely I just wanted to bring that up yeah go ahead\nYeah and that\nI put it in the bill for corporate income tax credits to help young families with childcare and a representative Dallas or stood up on the floor and die said represent of Anderson that's a good bill but we can't afford it\nSo I'd say I got stuff that we can't afford it we can afford what were your ...\nBut we can't afford it so I'd say I got stuff that\nWe can afford it we can't afford what we're far to the tax break for Harold ham who bought a bunch of his stock back absolutely I had somebody this back home guy I'm going to see on Sunday night say you know it's too bad when when Harold ham\nDivorced his ex wife that she didn't get custody of the kids because North Dakota would be way better off in her hands\n[laughter] I agree [laughter] so yeah it was and he was able to be as bread and what do you see a door to door\nYeah I think people are getting a energized at this point of you know within the last couple of weeks people went from I haven't really pay that much attention to people are making up their minds real quick and so I think um I think people are going to sit down and studied these issues now they've been doing it a little bit\nI think in our race in particular the contrast between us and the people were running against is incredibly clear so I think people in district forty one are going to have a very clear decision to make about what they want is like ... well I think in the case of the budget um something panel loaded to a second ago\nThere was one side that stood up for the tax credits for ah for the oil companies Leo extraction tax the other side said no we don't want to do that we can't afford that we have other things you want to spend money on\nOne side or raise the property taxes the other side was going to set against that\nUm I think that those things even when it comes to listening I'm as Pam and mentioned medical marijuana the blue laws those are things that were in lock step on the other side's against so I think that those are very very clear issues that people are going to get to\nChoose Pam ... you're you've been there as a four year hatch I Know a popular you earned district forty one I I get all of that or to take on\nThe most powerful man and you you know and some would say abuser of that power I mean I travel all over the state I hang out with a ton of Republicans I mean I have a lot of Republican friends they don't like al ...\nI mean to to take on that charge and be the number one vote getter before what was the model what I mean how do you do that\nWell I mean I I looked at it that I didn't think that ours representing me or district forty one\nSo I just said I'm going to knock on his main doors and my taxes maimed people I mean very clear about what I Am different from out and I'm\nJust ask for their vote in their support and\nVery open call me anytime answer any emails and his neck and indoors the other night in this younger woman came out and she goes I remember you ... ... email on you he responded right away\nThat didn't happen with the other representative so I just think I Am just more available and more open more wanting to listen I'm\nI think ... [noise] I think he rules smarter than governed\n[laughter] you know your ads have basically said it does so just go ahead and sad I mean I can\nTell you this you guys that I have\nOur guest host my show I've never hit the fact that I enjoy conversations with al ... and I enjoy debating with al\nBut if our to ever run on a statewide ballot in a state that is so conservative I don't think he could win I mean everywhere I go people are upset with how he's dealt with the budget and dealt with statewide issues and it's their belief Brandon that when he gets in trouble\nHe acts like Santa Claus and obviously you to have him nervous because it's like All right time to all the press conference and say that I can get two hundred million more dollars back in Fargo and you must noticed that as well\nBecause it's like All right time to all the press conference and say that I can get two hundred million more dollars back in Fargo and you must noticed that as well\nYeah I mean that's exactly the playbook we saw I think last cycle last cycle um when he was up for election we heard more promises about flood protection dollars last cycle to interestingly enough a couple of weeks before the vote I'm a Mac Snyder who at that time was the minority leader um had accused outlawed by trying to\nUm wanna lower the oil extraction Texas was in two thousand fourteen before it happened and his quote on that was while we're not nobody's looking at that tax and of course he gets re elected in six months later he sponsored the bill that did it\nSo I mean we see a lot of promises get made right before an election and then we see the exact opposite results right afterwards um I think in this case we're going to see some of that again and that's just that's that's what he does that is what I think you'll do again um our job is to make sure people know about that\nPeople get it right if if I'm sitting there and Williams county and I'm Upset about\nHow al Carlson is governed how he's treated western North Dakota and that he's not invested in gave away those revenues that could have went back home to the place that they are ... ah you know they're generating a lot of that revenue\nOr and so if there that you know find them I'm like okay you know this process here have you been getting some donations from people outside your district ...\nOh yeah I get a lot of donations from outside my desk and that's the way of speaking to ... I mean that it that's the way of speaking to all of this too I mean granted you must you must see that\nOh you know without a doubt and we I I the letters that come with their donations are also fun to read um the\nThere are centrally people who are they're fed up about what's going on on our side of the state because of how it impacts their side of the states and I was out west here about a month and a half ago and you know the day I was out there there was a half inch of rain and when this happens arraigned on those rows apt to stop calling oil\nBecause the roads can't tolerate it unless they have been paid though that a lot of the roads having been they still Memphis structure needs out there and we still have to make sure that we're doing whatever we're doing to to do that so that the budget is going to impact them absolutely\nSo what would you say to a person from district forty one brand in that says I don't care as long as he brings home the bacon right here right in my district I don't care he's supposed to be representing my district first what's your answer them\nYeah my answer would be that the oil revenue that comes in is still as impactful for the entire state including us and if we want help when it comes to flood protection if we want help when it comes to our infrastructure spending we ... we still have to protect that industry make sure that industry is taking care of\nAnd the easiest way to do that is to make sure that they can just do something as simply as transport oil when they need to uh that's gonna be positive for our bottom line even in district forty one so I still think we need to bring up the structure dollars on to Fargo we have needs especially when it comes to flood protection\nBut uh but we also have to make sure they can do the basics that they need to do all that\nTime you're up with these individuals in just a second hang in there but I got to get a weather forecast from\nGive me a forecast rain snow up north or some roads are slippery across North western North Dakota some parts of the northwestern in North central areas\nDue to a mix of some sleet freezing rain and snow otherwise rainfall across a majority of the rest of the year it's not raining everywhere but there are rain showers groceries or North Dakota northern Minnesota Thunder storms will pop up in South eastern Minnesota huge huge\nTemperature range to them as a cold front moves on through gusting north ones will set up and temperatures will take a tumble daytime eyes mid thirties northwest of low eighties so most of us by mid afternoon we'll be in the thirties and forties lows within about a few degrees or thirty tonight freeze was for northern South Dakota\nThere will be clearing sky and decreasing whim starting off with sunshine immoral clouds increase from southwestern northeast chance for rain moving from South Dakota into southern North Dakota and western Minnesota by late afternoon some of that could change the snow in the northern areas\nThe current sixty one Minneapolis park rabbit thrifty to dilute it was a fifty four park Rapids fifty two more ... repeats resource within also fifty three editors at forty one it is forty or thirty four and more listed in Bismarck forty five James Jones at fifty thirty nine of graft and thirty six and learned in Fargo fifty four\nGrand Forks as a forty three and it's fifty four and ... sort of a foxhole Minnesota fifty foreign bureaus Tom's from asking for the news will be was regional ...\nMorris Brandon made well ... right after the\nI guess it's well than you know I I'm going to be there it's gonna be fun the twelfth annual Great Plains and empower North Dakota energy conference Monday October eighth at Bismarck state college now early bird registration\nIs only good through October for so you've got a window here and you have to take advantage of it now for just Seventy five dollars to four pm\nA walk in registration is going to be a hundred bucks so that's twenty five bucks more sign up right now keynote presentation by Dan ...\nA deputy secretary of the U.S department of energy and returning favorite and round table Q A with senators John Hoeven and Heidi Heitkamp and congressman Kevin Cramer so they're all going to be there\nYou get in that room you're going to hear what they say about energy in the future of energy you know I Want to point out there's some platinum sponsors to this includes comical Philips includes next era energy resources it includes has corporation and endeavor\nEnergy Andy dot com that's where you go energy Andy dot com\nMany scenes in this film was shot an IMAX making it the first feature film to use the format\nIMAX film is nine times larger than conventional thirty five millimeter films and runs through the camera horizontally rather than vertically Paul ...

have a success year finally after a long long time or he's back he's in jail he's all of that Greg and of course that's why I asked you to come in here lieutenant\nUm [noise] we talk so much on the break here I'm not sure where we left off I I\nDo know that that that you are struggling to make sure that the people in the Philippines understood what you need to\nWrite a really did and there and I'm not sure we're all the years go home uh uh how fast they went but when we were at the tenure level we just really weren't getting much and we didn't think\nYou know we were going to get them back and that was kind of a consensus of everybody of course here in states turning him down what else can we do\nSo but we just kept we just kept a sending messages to the FBI to Justice Department to Interpol to the Philippines and so forth\nUm and then what happened was um the\nFBI agents changed in the Philippines to really move fast forward and that was about a year ago year and a half ago and so when those changes may we always sent an email or don't have this ... if you can take a look at this that and we're still looking for and we don't know if he's in hiding or were you went\nAnd at the same time ah we produce a ladder\nThe mission we continued to send that and continued to send that over and over over months two three four months and we finally got a response from his a cabinet that we needed to go through the U.S Justice Department which we had been doing the old time\nAnd we explained to him that we had done that Justice Department head for this to his country there and was now a territorial warrant for her father and had been for quite a few years I think in twenty ten or that actually came out and then father says they thought that extradition so moving fast forward again\nWe finally got word we got a new FBI agent over there um I don't know if I'm supposed to say his name or not but he was instrumental car Donny um incredible guy and uh through sending the letters and talking with him and he called us back and and called birch\nAnd said look I'm I don't know if we can find him but we promise you will give you a concerted effort on this\nAnd long story short it did not know that they put a taskforce together not only for a trying to apprehend or find yourself but for some other high crimes that they were investigating over there\nAnd they put the task force together a long story short a after a couple of months are they located him and uh and did finally get him arrested\nAnd you went to jail and the Philippines and it took a while a at that point of the U.S attorney's office here ah Chris Myers who ah\nWas as helpful as anybody to we had heard that a lot about Christmas Yeah John Schneider work on this or not in the early on before unfortunately John and go to John was running with this hundred miles an hour Google federal with it\nAnd then of course we know a John got sick got cancer and and had to leave his post\nUm but we wouldn't be able to get 'em over here we have to have the federal government assistance with that because our warrants are going to do that they had to get a a federal warrant\nTo remove him from the Philippines but in the same sense we had a territorial warrant signed by the Philippine government and the judge there that was a long process in itself\nBut at the time that he was apprehended all those things were done the warrants were there we just need to find the we need to find a warm body of father says there\nSo you know sitting there talking and wondering about whether or not this continually went on\nYou know I ... you mentioned something I don't know if it's in the break or not I got one minute here yet but we're going to hang on to you that he had taken a young boy to the Philippines correct [noise] and he had abused that young boy that's correct [noise]\nIt's just amazing to me I mean it sank God that the people that could do something stepped up and did something way to go to John Schneider way to go ... I mean way to go and and by having your back\n[noise] I I have some some correspondence with our news team here about their skin and it's nice here it's not raining can you stay in the studio with me for a little while longer growing Lauren ladies and gentlemen he's the lieutenant detective with the west Fargo police force [noise] um [noise]\nI you know this is one of those cases [noise]\nThis is one of those cases that is a perfect example of where you need a partnership with many individuals in law enforcement ad that ISIS stick around more coming away [noise]\nKnow if you think about it a seed is really just a promise high I'm Carl Peterson from Peterson farms to eat and the Peterson fire seed we've built our entire business on keeping our promises every corner hybrid every ...\nProcess every quality tests most importantly every one of us is committed to keeping not only are promises but yours\nWas there fear after the first interview that he might fall tiny again\nNo I ... I never I thought he was where he wanted to be a loss of going to leave the Philippines hiding hide it overlooking yeah I you know uh it's like a the FBI agents that he goes you understand this is a huge area and we um Iowans over here and it it's a huge area and you can get washed real easy\nAnd we know that at a point um and we have we found things on Facebook or he was tied with a\nA Brazilian church I'm over in the Philippines and we had people don't check that out and they and when we found his name attached to that church um but they refused to talk about it and said that they didn't know anybody by the name of Fernando say say this is a within the last three or four years\nSo when he came back for and to continue that process of as he put it trying to clear this up and you get a chance to question him by following what was your impression of him\nOr he had real serious issues\nWith a a violating young boys and young boy there was an open admission yeah and whatnot\nIssues with a are violating young boys\nAnd young boy there was an open admissions yeah and what what justification than it used to that um you know he brought up that he was abused himself as a young child or not by the priesthood I don't believe but\nAh possibly by family or just in family members um I think when he was probably around that six or seven age group\nUm which is very possible because we see that a lot um unfortunately abusers are those people abused sometimes become abusers I'm In a corner never gets caught a if it's not if it's not taken care of it at that time\nWell some of the problems the Catholic Church has had a have shown that a number of those individuals or preyed upon and then became the individuals that preyed upon themselves correct and so that that it doesn't surprise me that says sad you know came forests and said that he had been abused that that doesn't surprise me one back\nDown and and um that that's that's all he had and the thing that was the most striking and all the interviews was when I\nDo anything for it\n\nAnd I remember asking him\n\nAnd had he he's\n\nUm that's a hard one to hard one to swallow because of what was going on you know or what some have the time but\nUm we don't know what he was doing in the Philippines that old time that's one thing we we never did find out exactly where he was er sang it out we did try to interview him when he came back here and they refused a that interview when he was brought back a\nSo he he refused that interview did he have any choice\nOh yes yeah you just talk to my attorney exactly I which I assume that's what we're going to get you know that's that's the norm but you don't know if you don't drive so\nSo when you look back on this and you reflect on all of this are the victims of the people that have had the courage to come forth which were the genesis of what you did the huge success that you were able to achieve and by never quitting getting this done that those victims have you spoke to them since then\nYes ah what did they say um they're very thankful that it's done and I you know we talk about closure I don't know if there's a I think they have their day in court and that's what this was all about it's not about us getting accolades about staying with it or whatever because it's ... it's about the victims and as you go through this\nThrough the career of law enforcement it takes a while to understand just the facts are victims of these sorts of crimes and they get they should have their day\nThey they should get their day and the people that are responsible should be apprehended and should be dealt with according to the law and\nAnd uh they're all they're all thankful that he was brought back all of them didn't think and I haven't talked of all of them are going to messages or some of them I'm not the ones I have talked to are happy that it's over and that he was brought back because I didn't think that he would ever\nBe brought back and tried or I'm going through the court system for what he did\nGreg learn about the west Fargo police primary Greg of full disclosure I've known you and your wife\nGone through the court system for what he did\nGreg learn what the west Fargo police department Greg of full disclosure I've known you your wife or your family for years and you know the respect that have for the rule that you individuals have played in community not just in law enforcement and and and how you've lived your lives and\nAnd so I think it's I think it's important that asked this question because by sticking to it by seeing it through\nDo you think that helps other victims come forward do you think that that\nBecause I'm sure knowing you it didn't surprise you win more victims of says set came forward and so I'm sitting there wondering how many others\nAre out there right that it takes something like this to do it yeah I mean do you do you think that that this will bring more people forward on more incidents I mean because here's the truth this is a nationwide issue\nOh absolutely it is yeah and I I think uh [noise] you know thinking back\nAnd that's our job is this was our job to to keep her on with it I mean it's no different than\nA we have missing people from this area and you just never ... you don't you know you might slow up but you never stop until you you've done everything you can possibly do and um I just didn't come up with that I was I had great people that taught me and I teach us\nWhen I asked that question partly let me let me phrase that differently you been in law enforcement how many years I'm forty four forty four years forty four years ago today what is the stigma and everything that went through there's versus now is it easier\nBecause of what and how the public has dealt with this now is it easier for those victims to come forward has anything progressed in that way\nA that's a tough question and I I have to say I don't know that it's ... any easier for him to come forward today than it was forty years ago because of a way of a long ways to go\nTo understand now\nThat said that's really sad feel good though to do is uh what was it like for law enforcement I mean ... to know that you're stuck with it that this guy is worried belongs that these victims get some level of closure on this I mean\nHow do you what do you do after that did it do you buy the first one [laughter] what do you do after that a\nWhile sometimes yeah you do some damage either by the first one but you know it's about\nUh it's about ... beans 'cause we're not always successful we don't always find the guy or about your work at it so I'm being successful and this one after this amount of time uh is cool because everybody that was involved in you know as well as I Do if you don't have to work here is in\nOhio and well and just to bring that up my folks I I've got a letter here from says Sam self that to Paul Jurgen saying and this is David September seventeenth two thousand eighty and it said\nUm\nTalk to you so much taking so much time ah to answer your letters sends a signal to you that my answer to your request of a private uh interview is absolutely no uh it's my family that gets hurt every time there's bad news about me\nUm I just only hope that the media stops feasting on my ideal thank you very much though for your letter respectful respectfully Fernando\nSays family gets hurt and and I can understand that don't get me wrong I don't know what about those other family step\nAnd you write hit it right on and on head on the now uh yeah uh you you hit her right there and that's exactly what it's about because because he goes to jail for twenty\nWipe the slate clean were the victims they do and I know that some of them are still dealing with it constantly um depression or whatever it is\nAn issue prequel or should find a way to pay for that there you go down to act like I Do want to add that\nI'm a your station in ... organs\nUm he was on this like glue from the start and he and of course a work well with them but I'm up all media uh he was on this you need to know that he was on his and he never gave up and he called every so often going give me the
