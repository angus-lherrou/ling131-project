women came forward and said this a didn't happen to me or B. I didn't want my name included\nSo you know that's gonna that's going to play out as it goes and and I know that a center Heitkamp is going to have to talk to many different voices about this and going to have to explain just what happened when she knows more of what happened I Do appreciate your coming on our show\nAnd speaking to this um want to get to some of these text messages a because they're pretty broad and what it looks like um [noise]\nHere's a couple I tried to read through him in the beginning some of them as text messages can be\nYou know they they can be all over the place in terms of what your finger hit in relation to the letter you wanted to send says Joel I finally cancelled my foreign subscription or have been going to do it ever since Rob port came on the scene I'm sure they don't care but I feel better knowing that I'm not supporting them any longer\nI got to be honest I'm going to miss that Sunday paper but I gave it up on principle\nI Can't support a business that supports lies by port another one Joel so sorry Heidi made this mistake on disclosure permission on an ad as always she's real honest and taking care of what is needed respect her so much I'm\nJoel this was stupid sloppy and unnecessary mistake\nThe differences that idea is willing to own up to it and try to fix it that's a rarity in any politician these days jolt I really do you think we're that dumb she pulled crap and got caught when at all cost damn those who hurt look at all the lies in the ad this crosses the line\nI'm Joel how are these names even available to the campaign\nAh Joel Heidi Heitkamp still has my vote at least she's owning a mistake instead of blaming someone else\nI passed like you did to Rob port in his past divorce let's be clear about rapport pass divorce number one when I when I posted in and gave people the information of what he made I asked myself a couple of questions who sent it to me and why they sent it to me they sent it to me anonymously\nAnd they call the ward county courthouse they sent it to me anonymously and so I started thinking of okay who would have said that to me obviously he's got his enemies out there just like I Do that I asked myself okay what would he do if he knew my salary\nWhy nobody do you'd make sure you do\nOkay and and the big reason that I thought it was relevant is because I Know people that have worked at foreign communications for years for years\nAnd those individuals are making nowhere near what he's making my point being that they paid him a lot to do what they wanted him to do which was exactly what he's doing\nEach and every time it's like a ... it's like a an obsession but that's my point is that when it comes to Bill Maher seal senior he's willing to pay for it\nAh Joel didn't Kevin do the same thing with veterans cemetery he wouldn't apologize or pull the ad right away but we only hold women responsible I suppose I'm ... I'm just going to say this\nI don't think that one\nDiminishes the other I think that whether Kevin Cramer did that and I know you did with\nThe veterans that that doesn't excuse what happened here what happened here\nIs serious very serious\nAnd it needs a response and it needs an action I think the most important question I asked her just now is what you're going to do about this what steps are you going to take to make sure this didn't happen\nEver happen again and I think that's what the public deserves to know [noise] it's clear that when it comes to the hands on she probably didn't have anything to do with it that doesn't matter gets hers she owns that she has to do what she said here today and part of that\nMeans cleaning up whoever did have a hand directly into that [noise]\nAsk a dairy land sea customer what it's like to work with us and they'll tell you that it's more just business\nTheir land has been an excellent company to work with more like a family that's one of the\nBiggest things that appeal to me about Mary lands\nTo ask them about our people and they'll refer to them by now\nWell and thank you Russell a highly deserves about you and\nI mean Heidi Heitkamp deserves the bud chewing on this um you know those individuals that didn't give permission to be on that list have every right to be upset about that\nI think you heard Heidi Heitkamp say that I I think that you heard her take responsibility for that I also think that is saying that and taking responsibility for it doesn't diminish what happened\nAnd she knows that I Know Heidi well enough to know she knows that it's her job today to reach out to those individuals who have said and I've come forth saying my name wasn't supposed to be on that list she owes it to them to give full access to her so she can take that but chewing\nShe owes it to them to apologize to them and to point out that she's sorry number one and number two that it won't happen again and here's the step she's taking to make sure it won't happen again that showed\nThat said that that's old now I don't know the numbers and I know there's a lot of women on that list that I'm sure are going to come forward and saying look I Belong on this list I agreed to be on this list you know I'm happy in what she's doing and supporting a victims like myself but that\nDoesn't diminish the fact that clearly there were women's names on that list that haven't yet that hadn't given the approval to be on that list\nAnd the fact that she doesn't ignore that the fact that she doesn't sit there and say okay well something happened here I got to get down to two a staff member I got to find out the you know I didn't know anything about this the the fact that she hasn't taken that approach is good\nIt's good and and it's the right thing to do but the next step the next step needs to be to fix it in as much as you can\nNow how much you can fix we can have a debate over that we can have a debate over that whether or not it can be completely fixed we can have a debate over that as well but what needs to happen is the individual that's responsible for it which is Heidi Heitkamp\nThat as well but what needs to happen\nIs the individual that's responsible for it which is Heidi Heitkamp needs to do exactly what she said she was going to do which is to take every step possible to speak to the women that this affected and talk to them\nAnd make sure that they have a chance to be heard as well\nUh let's get back to the phone lines and let's get to live on live on your on news\n[noise] yes I Would I Try to pass if she would pass on to a natural each to Heidi back uh before I went I voted and I'm over sat in a third that a lot\nI was all over the age it didn't matter whether the person like a Democrat or Republican ape like what I had heard about that now you know what they need their side\nAnd I am going to force lifestyle or never vote for another Republican because the way the tragedy carry on about that next pork\nThanking them on I appreciate the call I think that there are a lot of people in agreement with you on that I'm Dave you're on news ... go ahead Dave [laughter]\nUh yeah say thanks for taking my call to plant yeah just basically just wanted to comment just following up on the previous caller that had specified about [noise] uh\nKramer doesn't get back to people and you know it's a thing that like is that people can say Republican Democrat but I think people need to remember to about\nEighty does an awful lot of good and I think the fact that you don't hear a whole lot of the successes that representative Kramer has done or not in his tenure in the halls\nAll he does is likes to bash negative campaigning and just because he is currently up in the ... never called never called Heidi out it could be just like it was back in twenty twelve\nAnd that remains to be seen but I'm Still a very solid hiding supporter and do this appreciate a balanced perspective on the show\nThank you Dave or let's get to another day David go ahead David\nYeah Joe you know she made a mistake or campaign made a mistake but I Can't believe that people really think that they would really try to pull something like this on people out there are people hurt they need to be\nA console or apologized to or whatever but\nThen everybody thinks that the ... campaign even the person that made the mistake or the people that made the mistake certainly didn't do that on purpose and thinking that they were going to fool\nRest of the people the only saying this does is take a little oxygen out or ... I still think she's going to win I mean I've I've talked to a lot of people are on the phone back and I'm going to tell you she is\nEverybody likes or you don't find anybody that doesn't like her and you find very few that like Kramer or how did you know you can believe that he's gonna win\nAppreciate the call let's get to Kate Kate Iran news the news\nWell I think some things should be said about Kramer is that he says that Heidi's the poor illegal immigrants that um commit crimes they're kicked out of DACA if they commit crime he doesn't mention that\nHe also that um we gave her on a ...\nHe doesn't mention that he also that um we gave out Ron uh I don't know how many billions of dollars or a trillion dollars\nOf our taxpayers' money that our eyes it was around ... we got them to cooperate and let us in fact their nuclear facilities because\nWe gave him back that money why when we want to inspect their nuclear facility Kramer in India I mean I Can't believe people by and then I Can't believe that he's not allowed\nTo outright lie let me let me point this out ... and\n... and I I'll let you listen to this off air um\nHere's here's the thing that that you've got to understand about the voting process I I spoke to someone the other night and did it by phone at first then we text each other because we're having an old fashioned political discussion and I respect the success that he's had in the business community\nOr his politics are different than mine is believe\nA structure on certain issues is completely different than mine but it doesn't change the fact\nThat this man and because of this man's hard work a lot of people out there have jobs\nAre a lot of people have been afforded good jobs because he's created the type of businesses that have succeeded in allowed others to succeed so I Love getting a chance to visit with him he told me that he couldn't vote for my sister\nAnd the reason they couldn't vote for my sister was because she supports sanctuary cities\nI asked him I said okay I'm going to challenge you tell me what a sanctuary city is\nAnd he said it's a city that allows illegal immigrants to rush to then then law enforcement won't cooperate with a ... so that they can stay there and they are refuge from the law\nThat then they'll just be pumped full of illegal immigrants and the feds won't come in because they instruct law enforcement not\nHis premise I [noise]\n\nI said look here's what a sanctuary city is a sanctuary city is a place that the genesis of all of that began with law enforcement law enforcement went to city officials and they said look let's recognize the fact\nThat we have a legal immigrants living in our community and working in our community let's recognize the fact that there are employers who abuse the employees situations and because of that we have a legal immigrants here so therefore\nLet's acknowledge the fact that bad things can happen to those\nThat are most susceptible to this that these individuals can't come forward and report a rape\nReport a domestic assault report being used as slaves they can't do that because if they do we're going to find out there and illegal alien and many times the crimes being committed on them are being committed by fellow illegal aliens [noise] okay\nSo what the sanctuary city does what the policy of it does is it allows that woman in many cases it's a woman to come forward and tell law enforcement this happened to me and that guy over there did it\nAnd then she doesn't have to worry about deportation but the individual gets what he deserves which number one is criminally prosecuted or be\nBut the individual gets what he deserves which number one is criminally prosecuted or be deported because he is an illegal alien and still subject to our laws while here that's what a sanctuary city is that when a sanctuary city is\nPlush get two hundred dollars toward a range of Google and that's smart um devices

Republican Mark ... illegal it should be 'cause there's just not right everybody in the state has the right to vote and everybody knows the reservations do not have stayed at her and leave it to three weeks\nThe election was dirty coal and I hope I hope they can they can vote and they are afraid to let Indian Americans vote because they're all going to vote for Heidi and our second in their shoes\nWhile you can talk to 'em you can thank the Supreme Court for that because that was a cloud that the the Native Americans got the right they needed to be able to go into the polling places it was overturned went to the Supreme Court the Supreme Court upheld or that ruling that overturned it so thank you and I\nI Would encourage anybody going Rachel Maddow is website and um and check it out it it it talks a lot about North Dakota gives a huge history of what the legislature has done\nTo put every wall they can in front of Native American Native Americans to vote it does so I'm In your own news ... go ahead in\nHey Joel and I like to think of myself as an independent I like Katie and I prefer Heidi but\nHeidi's party but Maxine Waters that Cory Booker as it was before the world are unfortunately forcing me to vote for Kevin Cramer because we can't allow those not to be in charge of the Senate and I feel bad for either because I think he does a good job\nBut I Can't allow\nYell at Nightline and I'm just wondering if you think that they're going to be other people that are like me that are kind of on the line they like Heidi but Maxine Waters and all of them they scare or or you know go on for Kramer even though he might not be the best run for the job well he didn't want you to talk about that for a little\nMaxine Waters scares me Maxine Waters was was saying impeachment before we even know anything about it a so believe me in any political party you're going to find people that you wish would just sit there\nAnd be quiet and taking information before saying something now Maxine Waters is one of them\nWhich would just sit there and be quiet and taking information before saying something now Maxine Waters is one of those I'm not a big Elizabeth Warren fan\nI'm not I think that our politics represent her her state I think that our politics are the type of politics that will help or Massachusetts but if I were a member of the Democratic caucus she would not be the one that would sway me\nRight if I were a member of the Democratic caucus I Would be sitting in a room with Jon Tester\nI Would be sitting in a room with Joe Donnelly I'd be sitting in a room with Claire McCaskill I'd be sitting in a room with people like that saying look you guys\nWere from the middle of this country\nWe need to be heard we need to steer our carcass in this direction because it helps it helps us on foreign policy it helps them understand what we are in the mid west the values that we have and how we live our lives and and so that flies a little bit in the face of what\nYou said while I respect what you said I don't think that the Democratic party gets fixed by allowing it just to be an east and west coast party I think we need moderates from the middle of this country who understand agriculture to be in those chambers as Democrats so that they can level that out\nAnd I hundred percent agree I you know the east and west coasters I think their fourth and a lot not just North Dakota the Midwest in general\nHere and I've been on the Democratic party\nFive bedroom contacted by CNN and MSNBC and been doing these interviews on TV and and I always end with you know what don't be afraid to talk to us here in the in the mid west don't be afraid to actually get an opinion from people in the in the central time zone\nInstead of just getting your opinions from the east and the west and you know what in [noise]\nI'm not winning [laughter] no no thanks for your call appreciate it or we're taking your calls on the bottom is well I'm not running I'm not hiding that this is a mistake this is this something that a Heidi Heitkamp come forward on I Want to give you all the time in the world then I'm right here as well go ahead\nOne eight hundred faded over five three fourths than [noise]\nA ... year to year generation to generation nobody's scrutinized his performance like you do and they get bigger year to year generation to generation\nNobody delivers consistent performance like as\nThat there's a whole bunch of them for it yeah but but that's the truth it and\nSo it has but they said it that way they could call you and give me the messages from it up in less than Fifteen seconds why don't the Democrats do that\nDo they make it so confusing or the one that called in about ... certainly and said it for the victims let the criminals\nYeah I think the person that said that's absolutely brilliant [laughter] [laughter] and they\nCome up like that and get the message out there and not know their way that\nThere is a way that called in and she said listen the sanctuary cities are for the victims and it was like okay she said it in five or six words when it took me how long them to explain it I guess she's got to be a guest host on news abuse someday but she\nShe shouldn't be reading things\nAgree maybe she's the one that should be on a ballot thanks but thanks for your call I Want to get to some of these ah Joel I'm begging to the caller Ian to rethink his statement putting Kramer in his what's dangerous to put the on the rubber stamp approval to Trump\nOr you want to talk about people that you don't agree with the Democratic party do you want Trump running unhinged\nDoing whatever crazy saying he thinks about today please end think again\nA jaw this guy is right the former Democratic party of the United states is nuts no longer represents the citizens of the United states\nI'm Joe can you tell me what the differences between Heidi's voting record in John Hoeven at one time it was nearly identical so should Republicans hate hoping to\nAh Joel three weeks until the election and the Native Americans can't figure out IDs I'm Joel when Trump was in Fargo campaigning for Kramer\nHe appealed to the Native American vote and said what do you have to lose they have a lot to lose apparently\nJoel love these tolerant people saying anyone was brains would vote for Heidi if I was in North Dakota I'd vote for Heidi but these people need to tone down the insults a jaw sick of the instability and it started with Trump\nHope we can get back to some kind of normal soon thanks and hang in there a Kelly is Sarah Heinrich on vacation would you like to explain that\nThey tax it back but yeah she's out of maternity leave\nAnd even here they had another boy chicken\nWe wish her well Joel gee whiz mistakes happen all political ads are a a peace media everyone wants to forget damage should be manageable Heidi did what she could for a correction\nA jaw I'll tell I'll tell you I've experienced the smoking product being promoted using my likeness without permission never smoked I was passed I can I Can't imagine how these women feel being outed for political gain\nI'm Joel I was part of the water delegation also I was told it happened numerous times I thought it was hilarious how quickly he closed the elevator doors\nAnd disappeared that's what I heard from my water bodies that they went there to meet Kevin Cramer he wouldn't be with them they met with a staff member out in the hallway then they turned to get into the elevator the elevator door opened up his Kevin Cramer and he quickly shut the door [laughter] so yeah\nThat that I'm Sorry this was a Republican they told me that so I'm\nNot sorry so no apology for me ah Joel I was part okay\nUm the show is
