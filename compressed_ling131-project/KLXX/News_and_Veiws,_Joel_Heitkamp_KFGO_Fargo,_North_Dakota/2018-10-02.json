the layout of the land mass these more progressive than the west in terms of they're much more conservative both take pride in that and but but that's just the truth on how you target race as well

felt it was the best deal they could\nUh that the Iranians were were developing nuclear weaponry a and doing it in a way where we couldn't check it out and so they cut the best deal they could do with the with the international community to go in and be able to\nDo we we were ... we were on al ... says we gave our taxpayer money\nYeah ... it wasn't our taxpayer money but but it was but that yeah I

just don't know too many Terry's out there\nWell I'm usually a very black and white person and that and so that's what I struggle with is to uh and you know what there is the color grey eye and stuff so I Know I'll say something here which might offend view\nBut I I I struggle sometimes if your program and I do not listening to you as much as I used to [noise]\nOkay I mean my feelings people told

a a follow that a a two hour program on the other side\nYeah well Terry thank you for calling in I asked you to call and you did you didn't have to so I appreciate it or there's an individual who has decided yet\nUm I don't know how you target those uncommitted I don't know you know he said barking and white and there is a gray I I'm not sure what that gray used by this phase of the campaign I I'd I don't know what that is but\nI'd I'd love to hear from you or let's go to Kate Kate Iran news news\nI'd like to rebut what Terry just said okay now I mean if you're pro God God for game all saying when his son died on abortion in those women ask for forgiveness\nThere for a given\nRight right exactly when get away with I'm or\nAnti abortion I don't want letting them or not really don't know whether there is so dry by their life if they ban right ...\n... what oh turn into did they have it they make a dumb decision are we going to punish them the other thing is I'm old enough to remember before roe be way\nWomen weren't dying in back alley abortions so if he's a close ally he'd better be pro life for everyone not just an unborn baby but the mother whose life could be destroyed by the bay Andy Kaye that I got I got to say about\nThank you for calling and I I got in so much trouble recently by explaining my pro life position you know I've always struggled with abortion I pointed out what my family is done I mean very much like Cape just said you know I'm against abortion but the truth of the matter is is I think I have an excellent pro life record both of voting\nThan my beliefs you would not see me hold hostage the snap program [noise] you wouldn't see me do that you wouldn't see me\nDivide and conquer when it comes to the farm bill because we still don't have a farm bill today\nThen one of the reasons we don't have a farm bill today and and Terry if you're listening you're about to say there is being biased but it's true Terry\nWe don't have a farm bill today because they put snap conditions into the farm bill and Kevin Cramer came on this very show and he said that having snap separated out of the farm bill is the right way to go\nYou know what I could not disagree more the farm bill is the food policy for this nation\nIt's a way of growing food and consuming food and that marriage between snap is and and farmers is a good marriage that has served us incredibly well and it and we have been there for each other all the way through every one assumes that they have this image of people who use snap\nAnd and you know let's just call it what it is I mean food aid a welfare whatever you want to say\nThere is a huge portion of people that use snap that her elderly\nThat that have done everything they can on behalf of this country and whether it was their skill set their fortune or whatever they weren't able to retire\nAs well as some of the people you know retired and so they're they sit in a position where their Social Security doesn't have enough to get them by and they might be using snap\nOkay then let's go to a different place that nobody wants to talk about there are people who have struggled with issues in their life\nThey were born certain ways where their skill set has allowed them to achieve a level in life where they then can self support and self sustaining themselves in certain phases of their life\nIf I'm helping someone who struggles with mental issues get food on their table so that the people that grow it and the person that I Love being an American west me can consume it that's a good marriage and that is being pro life\nIf we go down the road and we look at and I spoke to the words the thing about being on his honor flight ladies and gentlemen is is pretty simple that you see people at different phases of their life\nYou talk to them about the level they were that when there were a young soldier for this country\nThe world with a gun in your hand what it was like to have the government call and say you need to wear a uniform on behalf of your government what it was like to have an older sibling serve in the military or maybe have lost one and then get called into service on your on that was a phase of their life\nThen they went into a phase where\nThey went about raising families and and making their livings and you see the differences in each one some did well financially sudden didn't do well financially\nBut all dead and what they could do\nThen you enter a phase where many of the men that I spoke to on this honor flight have lost their spouse [noise] they have lost their spouse but when you talk to them about the last phases of what was their wife's life\nThe one gentleman I talked to yesterday said I was just so glad that the nursing home was so close to home I went over and I saw her every day [noise]\nI always went to church services there with her I took her to what I Would call the Dairy Queen the dairy land or whatever they call themselves we always went for ice cream\nOr and and you know what in what he was so distraught about was that he lost her when he wasn't there that he had\nJust saw I saw her on Sunday that service she said you should have seen her ... she she had lipstick on she she looked like that gorgeous woman that I married I went home and she was\nGone but his focus was on the proximity from his place to where she was at you know why the small town nursing homes are open it's called Medicaid that's being pro life it's\nPretty easy to say that people abuse medicate\nIt's pretty easy to say that these individuals are trying to push the government but I'm Sorry I don't believe like our congressman dies I Believe in Medicaid and I wouldn't cut Medicaid as though people were abusing Medicaid\nIf their abusing it I Would go inside and I'd look at it but just to use the blanket to throw over it doesn't mean it tells me you're not as pro life is what you're saying you are\nThere\nSo that's my stance on life just get to the weather came and visited too tall times to ask\nWhat are you going on and they came there began\nLearn well we got a very small amount of cloud cover and an increasing breeze out of the south east

you also have the farm bill itself so let's take the farm bill first OK okay the the the farm bill why don't we have one\nWell I mean it it is a little worrisome about the farm bill that\nAh we couldn't get it done by the end of September because it does appear that the issues that are separating the house and Senate are a lot more difficult to resolve that a lot of us assume they would we we thought\nThat there was a a will there to get those things worked out and for some reason the deadline came and went in there or not and\nSo I I mean is it to me it's a little worrisome that we for the future is if we can't get these worked out a are we are we in danger of going into the new year but no farm bill a ... there there seems to be an understanding that we can always extend the old one but\nUh uh and and I guess that could still happen but uh\nYou know the Senate's version is kind of steady as she goes that's that's what the Senate would like to see the house has got a lot of intrusion into this as food stamps\nAnd the the some of those entitlements and and they want to their imposing what appears to be restrictions or work requirements which we we've had for twenty some

your take on the agreement just made between Canada and Mexico and the U.S\nWell I think there's a sense of relief that this got done I think it's it was anticipated I think there's also some release it it essentially preserves then after that we had I mean it there's nothing revolutionary and here there's nothing that is going to force\nThe Canadians were really wanted that badly and they were willing to go to the map for this to defend their a dairy industry there's nothing really in this the changes that there's a slight increase from three point two five percent a three point five nine percent so\nThat's and and also I think there is a relief that they are the five year a renegotiation that the that are the U.S wanted got the U.S gave on that and now we're we're back to the sixteen year review process and I think that's\nThat that means that they're the lenders that people the investors that might come in to help fund a infrastructure in in Mexico or Canada or even in our country will will feel that they've got some assurance that this was going to last no not not just be gone in five years\nSo I was visiting with somebody who understands German Durham farmers and and he said that while we were looking for a home run we really got a ... single out of the things they were and all that happy that the ...\nYeah I understand and what we're going to learn more about this as time goes on and maybe those Durham uh farmers that really got all that information now\nThat the grading we were hoping to get ratings standards that would make it much easier to move rain across from the U.S into Canada\nAnd it's my understanding that those ratings standards are not really much better now than they were before they were kind of ... they've kind of got a a bit of a wall there are a little way to screen out a lot of our grain so I I I guess that would be a setback\nAnd they kept that in that and there's my understanding\nSo for those who think that this has been can you know completely revamped there there are some things in this certainly and the technology side you know some things in this that we as Americans should be high fiving over but his egg producers that the best thing we have about this ...\nWell I think that's probably the best thing you know the markets yesterday had a very positive reaction we were up Eighteen Nineteen sense and soybeans but by the end of the day you know that it's kind of faded away we've got some little games today three cents or something like that but I think that the market is really kinda sober up by the gorilla in the room which is this China\nThing that is just sitting there and not doing anything and we've gone a long long time now without any orders from the Pacific northwest and\nWe're backing up our our soybeans supplies and the buyers um you know they're kind of caught in the middle they don't really have a place to to go with the soybeans unless they go east or south is St Louis so\nUh that that's a sobering thing and the and while we're really relieved to get something done with NAFTA\nA you know we get settled something with China these markets would really take off I mean we're we're down because of the\nTwo things that the fact that the south America is a is not buying beans from us but they're buying them from South I mean China is buying from South America rather than us but also there's\nA basis widening the idea that we can't move the grain the that we are in the efficient the most efficient way that that has grown over the last ten years to move range from here\nTo the Pacific northwest losing that outlet and having no beds now and I think friday was one hundred days since the last did we got from the Pacific northwest on soybeans that has really made the discount that North Dakota farmers get to Chicago\nHas virtually doubled from eighty five or Ninety cents a bushel to almost two dollars a bushel that's on top of the the dropping of the Chicago mercantile dropped down to eight thirty or\nChange how people market period and and I say that because of this if they are buying us soybeans into buying them through Argentina for example does that change how the people that actually move this product rethink that long term\nThe thing is that that idea of of you know getting rid of our soybeans that way\nIt's a very inefficient way mean that the farmers and actually paying the fried here you know we have to move these beans east and that was twice as much the moving east as it does to go to the shipping northwest that's going to come out of the farmers market that that freight rate is is just a disgruntled basis\nIt's all it's all based on the basis so uh so if we do this going to Argentina and then the way they the shell meal there it's wiping Neal that China were in in a way they're round about way but that is inefficient it's inexpensive way to move the product around that are going directly to China so\nUh you know the farmers are going to end up paying that the most rape costs\nOkay just a couple more questions in relation to China if you would hang with me to get your this gym ducks and ride ladies and gentlemen running for a commissioner in North Dakota\n\nGoing all sports\nWhen it's a small outdoorsman sales going on now as much as ... toward Moscow tells has close out pricing and special finance rates on all

yours mosquito burns forward on highway ten and Ali see mosquito burns word dot com for details hey\nBut they're not doing it and we're not sure if it it it almost feels like something's gotta give here in the next thirty days because this this month October is the month when they normally ramp up their purchases of soybeans because we're in harvest they're normally bind we're gathering the beans are normally go into the Pacific northwest that's normal\nThey normally by about thirty million metric tons this month it's a big month for them and there's no place else in the world that they can get that many beans they are at it in this month\nAnd so why is it that when they can get them cheap\nAnd we have them here and they need them they're just not there so far we that's while I think a lot of us the egg people are looking at this and saying the something's going to have to give and the next thirty days because uh\nI don't know what their strategy is over there if they feel that they've been offended or disrespected and they're just going to show us that they that they can't be pushed around I don't know what and and a lot of people are ... on on certain unclear we didn't expect this we we saw it if they could if we could sell them being cheaper than any place else in the world they'd come and buy in from\n'cause it it should be just transactional that point capital as it was yes supply and demand there's a demand there but so\nI've listened to some of the red trying to follow up on the literature and what's going on at that that's really got a lot of people\nPuzzled and cry unclear as to what China is really trying to do here so\nI I was asked this and I don't know the answer you as a farmer I mean you find all your life other than your time an Airforce fair and your dad had you in a tractor when you probably should have been driving up on a fair and that ... ... well it was we started out you know my dad saw Minneapolis that's why they give you that I Would not give you a job yeah\nSo so you know you've got that history I mean you really do but somebody said to me Joel they said you keep pounding on the fact that there's no market that you're not moving these\nThese soybeans west that that that the basis and everything is up so high and he said what if they were to buy\nAnd the farmers at the current price I mean do they even want to sell\nAnd when he said that I was like you know if if tomorrow everything was the same the basis was where it was they want to buy the price is about the same with anybody even want to sell well if\nThat outlet to the Pacific northwest opened up that basis would change we'd probably be gained close to a dollar just just by the fact that we can go there because that's a fairly\nLow price on that much well there because they've they've done yet on base as well they have on\nBasis but it's just that that's the efficient low cost route to get beans to the market if we have to go down to St Louis we have to go to the Mississippi all that extra freight it's it's an inefficient it's an antiquated system they're not the capacity isn't there\nThese newer systems that are operating between here and the Pacific northwest and the way they can download unit trains I mean\nNormally yeah it's it's in that you know eighty Ninety cents maybe even a little more but it's to dance around two dollars and that's primarily you know that the farmers paying the freight here and if we can get if so we had an outlet that way if we just had the beds\nThere would be a lot of enthusiasm a lot of excitement and the even if the ... price even if the price in Chicago didn't change we would get a a probably close to a dollar improvement and I would expect if China was by use either see on the move up some so I I mean I [noise]\nWe're in we're in a very depressed price more now because we don't have the customers ... we\nWe were in one before that we were when we were in a depressed price before the tariffs for all of this everybody was kind of scratch well saying soybeans and saved us the yields and saved us and yet so I've been prices weren't where you want to them\nOver the over the winter months there were some people\nAnd soybeans that saved us the yields and saved us and yet so I've been prices weren't where you want to them\nAll over the over the winter months there were some people you know that we're doing some selling there was some soybeans got sold and that the soybeans were kind of sort of the bright before we before the farmers went out the plant is Eighteen crop\nThe real bright spot with soybeans because you have a lower cost it doesn't cost as much to raise soy beans you or you were you weren't getting ten dollars but you were close you were in that nine forty nine fifty you could you could sell them for so there was a opportunity with a good deal to actually be on the plus side to go into the black raisins soybeans\nOnce the terrorists came on though that that's really started this this separation between the south America premium that they're getting and what we're getting here now that just that just got wider and wider\nSo there there's really weren't really getting discounted because of the the China's choice to buy from South America rather than us\nSo the end I mean these are light at the end of this tunnel or what are you seeing that would well if I were to look for indicators I mean you you [laughter] and I hate to go back to this but you understand the culture you wore this country's uniform she you know what it's like you have all around the world you know and\nIt ... the mindset of what they have versus we we always think everyone's just like us you know we do I mean ... where where's the end and all this well\nIf if something is like we we ... this one after settlement kind of came out of the blue a Sunday night as they signed it on a Sunday night and you know so we're hoping that something gives here that China is feels motivated to to want to do this\nWe're not sure what that key is why is it they're not right now but if we can get them to move and we could get China back here that would change everything if we can't if if this is the situation we have six months from now all of a sudden this was really getting going from\nBad to worse we we were backing up our supplies of of soybeans right now so ... where does it go from here you know one of the things that's operating here is the Gulf between China's view of what's going on in our view in our in our side of the Pacific were telling ourselves and that's in the news all the time this was a trade war\nAnd this was about trade and trying to get them to the table to you know live up to a more a western style standards and the fair and they're trading practices\nIn China if you look read their official China news publications they're not they're not saying that this was a trade war they're they're saying this is about the U.S\nTrying to limit the influence of China around the world to try to limit China's economic growth and that that the U.S is afraid of the rising power of China and that the U.S is engaged in this\nSteel tariffs on aluminum tariffs to try to injure and hurt\nThe growth and the influence of the Chinese economy a nation so there that Gulf between us as far as understanding what's really at play here\nIf it were were were separated by not just the you know I was saying about the soybeans they should be transactional they can buy a cheap they should be a nearby if this was just a transactional deal they would be but there's something else going on here\nIn the terms of our understanding of what's what the differences are between these two countries and that I I don't know how we get past that and we're hoping that\nThat had the internal pressures in China and there they should start to recognize when they're getting a by when they're getting\nThis well what's the internal pressures because you you know it is not what we have in this country where every couple of years we have an election and we decide with having to turn the wheel you know I mean if if the we're always going right too far now are going back well it's going left too far we're going back right but the point is that doesn't happen as Dr doesn't\nHave there are centrally planned communist country they they can change the feed rations in their large huge a swine heard nationwide they can\nIt is at a central committee in Beijing they can they can control all those levers of consumption around the country that even the diet of their their their their population there\nThey can change a lot of that we can't we we couldn't conceive of how that would cause even possibly be workable in a country like ours where we have ... competing interests you know I'm sort of a merit based economy where you're you're competing in a free market basis where they're all everybody else in the economy that system there and we don't\nIt it just doesn't operate like like we do so where they're going you know that this group of people that ridge running that country has has got some strategy in mind evidently\nAnd maybe it'll change what I've been reading from the bankers and lenders as they feel that we can we can hang on we can go for a few more months but if this if we get six months down from now we backed up all the supplies we are it becomes a huge weight on this market that's going to be harder and harder to shape\nI don't tell you this enough gym but thank you for your service on his country coming off the honor flight
