o'clock time for him or as normal here on the news news radio network\nA number of things that we can I'm In touch on before we had it on out to a Washington feed with a ... as a\n... you've got a week from today or will be the midterm election and people are probably just\nReady for it to be over rights it has been what seems like a for ever\n[laughter] during campaign that started pretty much at the end of two thousand and six tea and and now here we are here singing the final stretch your hearing more of the ads are seeing more of the a campaign worked out at the door and you're probably having literature dropped off in your mailbox\nAnd you're also seeing the media endorsements coming on out and I'm curious\nIf those have any sway for you whatsoever you've got to newspapers every cycle kinda out and say okay here's who you should support or here's\nWhy and I'm just curious if it changes your mind at all I'm I'm of the mindset that paper endorsements don't necessarily go that far yeah it's nice if you're a candidate you can go ahead put up a radio ad you can put it on your television a little scroll across\nYou can go ahead and a male it out and say look we're endorsed by a B or C\nBut other than that as far as you as a voter does it impact you at all\nUm he had a number of endorsements come out in the last couple of weeks and just last week\nAnd actually there were a day I think the final stretch at least ... you have to form communications papers they came out I think they gave us a paragraph\nFor their down ballot races basically said well just keep going and so and so it was in since two thousand and one so let's just keep 'em there and they didn't really dive into a whole lot in my opinion and in fact that I Would categorize as those endorsements as\nA I guess a lazy they didn't really offer much in my opinion\nAnd so as far as the last nail and the coughing there's a whole lotta nails that aren't even in that coughing yeah\nI'm like I said this is this a close race now did they make a mistake you bet they did that I was actually pretty proud of you for taking responsibility for it\nVery very quickly and running out of time here and ... twelve million dollars after senator I Can't put a no on in fact ... how she spending that money that's a lot [noise]\nWell I Know that she's trying to get word out on the reservations to the individuals that are out there just out and vote I mean that's a key so she's pushing hard on that\nJoel Heitkamp really appreciate your coming on thank you very much we're watching as Kelly and events happening this hour what's going on the left former vice president\nJohn right and now they are joining back ten years and years here and progress with Tyler accidents has been filling in for John Tyler what'd you think you know\n[laughter] not at our mandate or the face for radio [laughter] I Know I\nDo enjoy handled the he he brought to the news and views or take really to MSNBC there and uh it was I think there's a direct with uh the national media is he is with the news news radio network here\nYeah and and Joel asked on his Facebook page to this morning you know that basically the same question not miss Jackson asked him come and they sent me the as I mean is this race over I mean do you believe the polls in like Joe said that there and and a lot of the the response is just getting on Facebook from some of our you know people we connect with is that no this race is far from over and I\n... I'm over that mindset as well that is that it's not I mean a visiting with my my friends on the Republican side of of the aisle and yes I Do have friends that are Republican fact I'm a lot of them and they don't think this race as close as well they happen to think you know of course that congressman cameras up\nUh but that it's still reachable on the other side and I think you're seeing that now you played out a bind those in the local market here that have been pounding away on one side and they're now it's kind of raising the\nThe rent flight that hey this is an over there's still a week a lot can happen in politics especially in two thousand and Eighteen in a week so that\nIt will be interesting to see how does it mean right now you're in the course of the campaign words to ground game right you've identified who your supporters are on both sides\nAre the the the point of persuasion I think is pretty much over that's where I get back to the the endorsements of newspapers do they really mean anything at this point because I think that a lot of people have already made up their minds so it's the ground we get\nA jaw just on MSNBC was asked by a ... Jackson about okay well\nSenator I Can't praised twelve million almost Thirteen million after the cabinet decision what do you do with that I was getting on your side to vote\nOr so that that's what you're going to be seeing a lot of if you're out\nAnd county Cass County are up and we'll send you are going to have people come to your door asking you hey have you made your plan to vote if you have early voting have you already done it\nHave you voted by mail if not how are we going to get to the polls on election day what time do you plan on voting so you've got a clear idea of when you are going to get there and in fact we are going to vote for their candidate so you're going to be saying I don't know how much about the money is going to sway that effort as far as\nWhat the the hire people to get on to us or is it just more advertising through airwaves like you have across the day with the news news radio network or or how it all comes together um if I had to pick one ground game\nThat I think as we're going to be more efficient my bet would be on center I guess just because of what they are able to do in twenty twelve and it was the ground game I I think that finally uh you know brought her across the finish line\nWill they be able to replicate that did the Republican Party in North Dakota learn how to establish their own ground game or those six years that that's going to be\nOnly determined after the polls are closed\nA week from today like Appleby making his way back you're all hand his microphone back over to him he can take you back the rest of the way on the news and he was going to tell them as you and me your time on the phone lines to three seven five nine for eight I got some messages in had a three five to seven zero uh\nI was asking about do media endorsements that'll sway you are Tyler negative they should be embarrassed by about how much papers wasted\nUm another one tell her no not at this point in my mind is made up endorsements what have I helped earlier for instance I'm Glad pole and he came out endorsing a a John or with a commercial now but I I Wish the commercialism aired earlier for those minds who were made up\nOne one thing that's been brought up to me 'cause I'm I'm throwing this out before a ... ... people at the top of the ticket you got high can be got Kramer I think people made their minds up on those but there's this down ballot especially in this mid term\nAll the oxygen has been pulled out of the room for the top tier race so if you are a riot Rauscher barrier Kiley overseas in your\nAh ... done during your gym dots and Roger and those those still statewide races but you're down ballot people might not know that necessarily who you are or or what office you're running for\nDoes that make a difference if you have a a media endorsement I don't know uh that's\nThe argument I'm getting in some of the tax code as Well Tyler uh they must think to put all that money into a campaign and lose yeah there is one thing that will go down to this is the most expensive race in North Dakota history and it probably will be for quite some time\nUh unless there is something unforeseen in the next Senate race or congressional as heck the governor's race I think this interests will be the highest in the foreseeable future is going to fall in line to get to Kate Kate thanks for calling in and how are you\nI think that I may not\nRunning on the Democratic crack\nThe elderly and LBJ Medicare elderly are there now and they're out\nAn everyday thing that really only in ...\nEverybody thinks it's fabulous cat my Social Security it's the only income and they thought oh let me ask you are well buddy and where can we make it\nLook like make them pay income tax\nOn this neatly amount of money and then Bush wanted to fund the war [noise]\nSo what did they do they stole from the one like three trillion dollars from a security trust fund and then they just said that it's running out of money and we're gonna have to stand to gain the end\nOf June I'm gonna let you go a ... you made your point um as far as this race and you bring a Heidi I gave them they're running\nOn those issues that I'm not sure if you've got a chance to watch their last debate or hear some of the last minute ads that are playing in fact Social Security and Medicare brought to the forefront because Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said just last week that those are on a radar of how to deal with a debt and deficit\nUh it it it quite frankly it's put the wedge between these two candidates so I I I don't necessarily disagree maybe you know you would have liked to have been an issue earlier on and there I guess I can what you\nHave that as a win let's get to Scott Scott thanks for calling in what's up\nGood morning Tyler how's it going a pretty good\nI had a couple of comments about the high camp raised a first got my vote spent decided a long time ago that would be on the right side but my wife on the other hand it probably get that\nAh\nI see I I agree with what you guys are saying if this race is higher than the polls are maybe so on but something that kind of uh my wife brought to my attention near the other day\n[noise] excuse me and I hadn't heard the ad yet at that point is when uh I don't know if he was hiding your sisters on TV talking about how the high camp we grew up poor we add a children out of wedlock da da da da de ...\nAnd uh that you know it didn't bother her\nThat she's making a campaign issue out of that just goes to her idol she just felt that that was kind of a almost a low ball go on there and I you know help me out here but a mass sweeter her vote you know play on that card\nOf Scott I'm I'm up against the break here I don't know how that would be a ... a little boy it's ... it's what happens you just said that's everyday America so why would it be a low blow to portray your family as hey we're everyday Americans plus you've got the other side that is going I was saying that\nBasically gives the baby killer is what they are running ads on so\nThis is their response was she encouraged me to [noise]\nKeep the trials and have it up for adoption so I don't know how that was a little bowl but you're always welcome here on the news ... network was took a break come back to your time on the phone lines though I came back as well [noise]\n\nLove
