R. C. have been such a standard barrier not just places like this North Dakota but actually nationally we don't do this and I tell people what the ER see is well a\n... year see steps for energy and environmental research center with but around the actually since Nineteen fifty won the facility itself was commissioned under then President Truman as the United states of America as low rank coal research facility um eventually became part of the department of energy\nAnd ah then Nineteen eighty three became part of the University of North Dakota but like you said Joel we\nHave gone well beyond of our ... our local role that people see we've actually done work and all fifty us states and fifty two countries\nWell you've been called upon for that expertise I did it once I mean I did I called on the a C wants to just help me find out\nSome conditions for some federal grants that we're looking for sure we we brought millions into the state of North Dakota because of your research we did it ... it was a pesticide issue from the thirties that related to some arsenic poisoning the water so you were thank you this is what are you working on now that gets your attention to most well\nWe're really blessed to have always had a fabulous relationship with the department of energy both as idea we facility early on in India we use creation way back in Nineteen Seventy seven [noise]\nUh but there was you know one of their big regional players so in any one year generally on the order of half or more of a ... year sees entire research budget would\nCome via the U.S department of energy and and so it's a great to see one of the under secretary here in Bismarck today and we've been very fortunate to be called out by all of the elected officials here today uh uh with the conference so it's been fabulous\nThere there's a real bright future there's not many states in the ...\nThere there's a real bright future there's not many states in the union\nThat have oil they have when they have coal [laughter]\nThey have asked and all that\n... D so I mean is there a piece of the puzzle were messing up here well I don't think\nWe have a real vibrant solar industry uh [laughter]\nDo it all it got me there yeah mostly because of you know the ... it's\nIt's a little rough with the weather wasn't it when the sun just skirts are along the southern horizon on is that\nJust does not reflect that I've had is that how did I think we've got to get out and I drove out exactly but I Know a\nNuclear industry might be something in our future to be kind of exciting\nEither and weapons there there isn't a nuclear presence here I mean for a year we were at that place but uh you know the people look to North Dakota about how to develop some of these resources yeah abs absolutely\nI I mean you mentioned you know I mean basically I don't think he used the words but it's been overused anyway but this all of the above strategy is\nReally what we look at it they hear see and you know it's I'm Bobby ... and everything you see here both on the ground and below the ground in our state and uh [noise]\nYou know some states actually don't have the the blessing of natural resources that we do have but ah I think in the end of the day that makes it all the more important the states that don't have those blessings learn from the way that those of us who do have the blessings of work with them\nWhat would be there they're going\n\nTo say that just isn't true well I think there's been a um a lot of uh a\nCrushing on the the notion that coal is dirty and ... and ... just gotten cleaner and cleaner and cleaner\nAnd there's really won last uh you know big hurdle for us to manage with respect to coal and coal emotions and carbon dioxide and you know again we're we're very fortunate here in the state of North Dakota I have a huge potential to utilize carbon dioxide from coal in fact\nWhen we start looking at how much appetite we would have to utilize seal too and the Internet has recovery mode here in the state\nWe have more than a hundred years of all of the mess yeah from all the coal in the state so I mean realistically we need to start looking outside the state\nUh for sources of sale to support it to work John his which just absolutely good to visit with you my pleasure John how are you from the ER see back with more Julie for check right after that\nWhat does it mean to be\nMeans looking out for each other's best interest of the people they listen to what we're looking we're on the\nAirlines I listen to what I Want to remind them just\nSupporting each other unconditionally we continue to work with the ... because of their willingness to stand behind their product and they're there to back us one hundred percent at all times\nYou know we folks a lot on oil in this country do you think that we're focusing too much on oil than out on the rest I mean we we haven't pushed for a new sorted crushing facility the way I think we could have a ... do you think we're that we're doing enough for our farmers out there [noise]\nWell I think that there are so many different avenues being produced and you know the government can predict can\nIn and provide all the incentives and and the you know push like you're suggesting but ultimately what really drives investment is the market place and I think we're seeing and just an amazing amount\nOf opportunity in the marketplace not even driven by by federal policy up for these various um avenues you've got\nA you know in the renewable and fuels area you're seeing growth in that area you're seeing some of it driven by by policies out in California for you know a change in the ... and so some of that is you know\nIt's a mandate not eight and incentive but it's driving the marketplace and creating market so I don't know I think there was a pretty good mix of incentives out there and I think we're seeing just incredible transformation occurring I I look at it like you know\nWhen I first started in the commission I'd say we were in infancy of the renewable revolution and now I'd say six years later we're maybe toddlers\nAnd we've got just this incredible a transformation that is going to occur we won't in ten Fifteen Years we won't even really recognize I don't think how electricity is produced\nThan compared to how it is today\nWe looked red on red Patterson also sent they absolutely I mean you know we used to people like you and I used to scream Cole Cole Cole would when the rest of the world was out for it so bad not to mention that was powering a lot of states maybe want to admit that but now look at what we're doing right we didn't see wind power is the way we see wind power smell\nSee what what you know one resource that we could be using even you know even more so which is natural gas that we have available to us now so I think\nYou're right and you got storage you know you have any you've got the grades this markets that are interactive and into a communication not one like communication and these are all new technologies that are going to find their way into the marketplace any relatively short amount of time so Julie still up in the job it's a really interesting place to be\nYou know your attorney by

is the president and CEO\nOf the lake night energy council Jason\nGood to have you on ... and ... thank you for having me what I just said was coal fair fair enough yeah you're out there making sure that people understand what the coal industry is doing so let's get into some of the issues that we can maybe educate some people on that they're never going to some of them may never agree with that but let's at least sure tell them our side\nWhat do you think the biggest misnomer is about coal but it's an old antiquated fuel source a cold is not a low tech industry we're no longer the source of fuel to fuel locomotives or not\nBeing shoveled into steam ships whereas high tech industry is you can find in the United states are developing feel sources the future alternative uses for coal and powering the coal power plants in the most technologically advanced ways you can do nothing coming out of that stacks up basically water vapor these days I\nDo you think that\nThey get it you know they're still science going into that or is that something that you gotta over and over again that people don't get that\nUh they don't get it because a lot of times they don't want to get it um a lot of times uh there are people in the media who don't want them to get 'em every time there the New York times publishes a story about call\nDale referenced the word pollution and they will include a picture of steam those two things work together to produce a misconception that coal is dirty\nUm and so there are a lot of people in the media who watch it create a big picture um there is positive towards coal but it's a hard thing to do a moral were growing up stream a lot of different ways\nSo the coal industry and in North Dakota and the role that the place goes way beyond North Dakota tell people about the footprint that you have so we're per providing power for several million people\nIt plays goes way beyond North Dakota tell people about the footprint that you have\nSo we're per providing power for several million people up here in the upper Midwest a lot of our power is shipped over into Minnesota\nUm and that is where our our biggest consumer of our power is outside of North Dakota and so the benefit that we have it's not just providing jobs and electricity for North Dakota and supporting industry and jobs in Minnesota as well because they are\nTaking are low cost power and doing things with it and providing jobs for their own people and manufacturing in particular is driven by North Dakota power\nShe ever think about just shutting it off for a couple of days so we're certain flip the switch for a couple of days to see how much they\nWere constantly tempted to do that are out\nIt is a temptation but at the end of the day ah we're not the only ones with that problem that people don't understand what we do how many jobs are up four thousand direct jobs related to cold maybe send them the oughta maybe fourteen thousand indirect jobs that are supported by the coal industry in one way or another and those jobs are all relatively high paying\nThat they're not relatively I Know some guys who work in the mind and and they're pretty proud of the job they do I've got family members at work and safety and they're pretty proud of what they do and so the professional way that they handle all this\nAlong the curb on highway twenty three crossed over the

Nineteen eighty eight our success has been based on the access of our clients\nIn the design of the finished products retreat every job like our reputation depends on it because it does\nMan science remember us\nYou could try yourself or you could leave your concrete cutting a demolition project for the boroughs dynamic song and Corey unprofessional concrete cutting and drilling company at seven oh one five seven eight fifty eight fifty or dynamic signed dot com\n\n\nA one eight hundred and eight oh five three four six it's interesting because the one thing I think a lot of people agree on is the uh the power\nThe energy everything that we can do here in the state of North Dakota to make sure everything works that runs in your deep freezes still cold in your fridge is still cold and you know and and your air conditioner works and now your furnace to blow off that dust that it's been getting and that's what the great plains empower North Dakota energy conferences\nWhat it is you know we're visiting earlier a with an individual uh from the ER see John ... and John was talking about you know the the things that we don't have\nAnd and he mentioned a nuclear he mentioned solar well I get that um I get some of that the nuclear you could have tomorrow if if you want it to work to develop its solar that's a whole nother issue but we didn't mention I go\nI mean we didn't mention how everything was hardest when it came to the mighty Missouri River and all that was turned in as a power resource and and what happened with that um I think we oftentimes forget what already has been accomplished by the men and the women that came before\nI Do I think at times we just take a step back we need to take a step back and say before anybody says that can't happen just look at it and say well why can't it why can't we do that and then and treat the people it affects the right way\nAnd there are some examples and I hope that's brought up at this conference I Hope people take a deep hard look at this conference of examples of what they could do better\nYou know let let me give me some examples but look what happened to the Native Americans when their lands were flooded and look at how they've been treated over some of that after like the ... and everything that\nIt's always oh poo poo all you know let's not you know let's let's take a look at what was agreed upon versus what was done looks not be afraid to do that let's take a look at the individuals in western North Dakota that are giving so much to the empowerment of the nation\nAnd so much to the economy of our states let's take a look at them\nAnd say what can we do to make sure we have your back\nWhat can we do to make sure that your\nGetting what you deserve out of this instead of everybody else sitting there getting reaping all the benefits\nI mean ... why can't we have that talk let me give you another example is I think of energy in North Dakota we I mean we take a lot of pride and all the energy that we we put together that we get that we put out there on the grid and that is a good thing and I've supported that and will continue to support it but what about all the natural gas flaring\nWhere are we today versus what goals were set of where we were supposed to be today\nI mean ... shouldn't it up an individual be running around western North Dakota to those individuals that hold all those mineral rights and and say look you don't got to put up with his anymore you don't they're flaring a resource they should be paying you royalties on\nAnd so for them to just easily say we'll get to that or no we're we're we're we you know it's just too cheap or wait a second here\nYou're grabbing minerals from underneath my ground I hold the rights to those minerals I'm allowing you access to my ground where you can track\nAnd you can go ahead and do all these things and then because of that natural gas comes as as a byproduct of all this and you're choosing to burn it off\nThat's what you're doing you're choosing to burn it off\nThen because you're choosing to burn it off I'm not getting any revenue out of it\nI'm not getting what I Do what I should be paid and so you you there's there is a little kindness there there's a little okay I Know that takes a while to develop this there but\nIt's not [laughter] ... at some point you take a step back and say wait a second you haven't prioritize this at all and every day I drive by that flame that's revenue lost to me and if we're going to be an all of the above\nThan by God we need to be an all of the above and and if we're sitting here saying there isn't any market for it I'll tell you were in the market is I'll tell you exactly where the market is the market lies in cheap for everybody that\nI mean seriously the market lies and all the things that we could do with natural gas has an industry that would bring not just revenue into the state but that would bring energy and ... each one of our homes right\nYou know that's that's the point isn't it start running or grad ... I mean look at the other resources we've used we grow corn\nWe grow soybeans you know I'm going to say ... this'll here right\nI mean ... we harvest coal we harvest when we do all of these things the thing that we have been very lax in is the percentage of natural gas that we have harvested and we're just flaring off\nNow is it getting better they would say it's getting way better go ahead and ask somebody who drives around the countryside out Williams county and ask if its way better\nThey'd have to have a long memory of where it was before they would because there's a whole\nShould be shouldn't be being burned off\n[laughter] so I don't think I'm preaching to the choir here uh when I say that that it won't be long and ... tell some enterprising young attorney\nComes fourth and says guys\nI'll take it out in the ... you guys go ahead I'll make the case well make money together if I win if we don't that won't but we're going to bring suit and we're going to make an argument that by God they can harvest this they can put it to work and if they can't put it to work\nThen they're still going to pay me the percentage of what they think they're burning off\nPeriod now that makes you a loser as somebody who wants to use that right who wants to use that resource but as somebody who has the mineral rights to that resource\nAt least you're getting something out of it and so and the next big room here and the big auditorium I Hope people are taking a look at that instead of all hugs and kisses instead of all ... we're so lucky to have you here you know instead of all that have the courage to look at\nThe Herald ham and say no\nYou can do this you're good for our economy\nBut no\nNo you're not getting it on the cheap anymore you're not going to sit there and burn off all this natural gas without having a long range plan so I Know exactly what's gonna happen to my natural gas that eye on the on the mineral rights to know\nThis one I'd really love no you're you're not going to sit there and brag and other states about how you got a cheaper in North Dakota than anywhere else but hey\nThat's just a personal bias as I sit here at the great Great Plains empower North Dakota energy conference when we come back\nA bill change there's going to join us a bill is the athletic director of the University of North Dakota I met him once or just for a short period of time and very very impressive so stick around ...\nIn North Dakota and one thing one of our teams will agriculture is a family business to North Dakota grain growers association would like to thank two women that can be made in our state leader in production agriculture\nWith your continued to the point that we can work together you ensure farming remains profitable enhancing non family in North Dakota in ... in the rain we represent\nYou don't think that kid that beat Montana last weekend would mind are putting on the purple leaving college early and plan for my Vikings with you I could\nUse outside of your what how about the NFL needs checkers bill I'll tell you what everyone seems to be wide right\nReally how did I agree that everything's just not lowered right everybody well like right\nI Will not involve you in this I Swear it's just my comment is not heads and he doesn't reflect these at all but it kind of describes our country everything's wide right now [laughter]\nI'll tell you\nStay there that's what makes me cry yesterday yeah can you even make that up I mean normally\nOr what was it six of them yet I was at\nAn extra point I think yeah I mean six miss ... it's like holy cow and and with all due respect as a Packer owner it could happen to a better team Thompson [laughter] well I think I I think I\nThink I read or that was the most ... since Nineteen eighty Roscoe Marcia had a I missed the war and and so but he missed by it's just crazy it really really isn't that kind of goes in cycles spoken up with a cooker\nYeah it is you're the boss of the athletic program I get that I understand that and it's your job to evaluate make sure it's good of an athletic program is can be and make sure that that student experiences it as good as it can be but here's here's the part of the job very few people realize that you have in front of you\nYou have to get to know the alumni you have to put a product out there that they're willing to\nTo invest in how has that been going bill\n[laughter] you know we're very very well thanks for asking will I you know [noise]\nYou're right I Do have to check all the boxes and the first thing is is it right for the student athlete in are you doing the right things that you know based on\nYour rent a new you know they are is a responsibility we take lightly and then all the chairs that we have we have a responsibility to make sure that we do the right things but at the university at all times and obviously the state\nAt all times and so we don't take it a a grand or ... or or you know we're lucky I remind are still now with all the time that you know you put that logo on in representing your representing her and so on and it's just a\nHuge responsibility but it's an awesome responsibility one that\nIs exciting but it is for sure\nYeah and and I think that the connection you're making to that alumni is absolutely fabulous because I'm hearing so many things about use so that's hard that's hard to get started that way but a bill I've got somebody who's got a question for you John you're on with Bill child is going on in the caves I'm Sorry go ahead\nYeah thank you Joel ah say bill how are you good thank you uh I've got some good friends of the Grand Forks area that are all recently\nAnd they've expressed concern about what the football program is going to be like coming into the Missouri Valley a little concerned that it's not going to be ready for the type of rough and tumble to preserve Eli has what is your thought what is your comment and I'll hang up and listen\nTo a British it\nWell and again I I think like many folks are ah ah realize you were we were kind of in this weird to hear independent are transitioning out of the big sky where we have a schedule for the next two years that's a big guys get little or looking ahead to two thousand and twenty getting into the Missouri Valley and\nIt's pretty simple to Missouri Valley has been the cream of the crop and enough C a slip wall there's there's no doubt about that and just go by the number of uh you know bits are each year at that conference has received we know what's coming we're we we know what's what's what's transpiring will\nYou know what to be the best you got to play in the vast and uh I think that's where\nA you know our mindset is right now what do you have no no illusions as to what's what's headed down our our our way obviously was played some schools non conference was only last year but um but we know the grinds going to be each and every week so uh\nWe we robot knows that I Know it and uh you know that's where I think Joe you mentioned\nThat's the connection to a lungs and and and create better facilities and experience for student athletes so that when they come on the University of North Dakota that they're going to want to stay here and compete with the best and you know with this if you can win the Missouri Valley you can win a national or\n... well that's true and you just being honest I I Know that you're like a lame drugs in the dark and the big sky but the move is perfect and it's perfect for North Dakota ... it really is bill it's\nIt's yeah it it it people deserve the rivalries and it will bring and I think that that you had nothing to do with it but I think that mistakes were made in the beginning by U. N. D. and now they've been corrected and so if you can't fix the mistake\nThen how are you going to get around it so I'm you know Bill James wait a second I got one more person got a question for you a boy you're on but it's clearly with Bill go ahead\n[noise] can you hear me okay I'm On the road western North Dakota I've got to ride okay if you want to spread the word you at the Atlantic and especially to the alumni and I don't want to even go there as far as the number that live in the park or a watch cargo area\nTo be kind of a broadcast it any sports on it but it's not on Iraq and I can understand why they can't catch all that\nWorks to the market because there's a lot of the alumni that just can't get the game in the area and I don't know if it's politics or finance or contracts or whatever like something out to be gone to any new in athletics Joe\nGeneral area on a consistent basis that's my comment thank\nThank you Ryan let's get Bill chance obviously talking about TV because if you want to hear the best way you can hear it on radio right here on the home base of the news the news radio network and that is a camp geo but bill your thoughts\nRoy ... no problem Joel yes in Raleigh thanks for the call appreciate the comment\nYou know there's a contractual ... no doubt about it if you had mind if I had my way right a group we would we would be on a in so that everyone could could could make sure in the U.S so something that we are continually working on for sure but we don't control some aspects of a\nOf of the media business per se and so uh but I can tell you this it's not as if we wouldn't want to be seen all over a hundred percent so so it's something we're grinding\nCall it Dr stakes off her shirt and I'm looking for work\nWell thank you and I look forward to more of these conversations and will be given a lot of hollers okay sounds terrible event ... ladies and gentlemen the athletic director from the University of North Dakota let's go find them let's go find the man that\nTo Tom tom ... asking dumb or it's\nA snow in the black hills area and some other areas of western South Dakota spreading up into a parts of south central North Dakota right now and are mainly rain to the east of it or we're going to be dealing with depending on location and it's not enough time to get specific what rain or snow\nAll the way through the first several days this week in word does snow there could be some accumulation of several inches especially is we're going to tomorrow night and also into Wednesday\nThey're actually flash flood watches in effect for South South Dakota through the twin cities area Minneapolis St Paul because of heavy rainfall totals expected their eyes and the forties today thirty five forty two tonight in the forties\nYet again for tomorrow it it looks like it'll be when surely are on Wednesday what are the better chance of rain and snow more had right now at forty one Minneapolis forty nine park rabbits forty one pretty falls forty three it is forty one and ... forty to having or thirty to thirty one it will extend minus thirty six in Bismarck one better at thirty seven devils like thirty six\nAnd cavalier thirty nine is forty one degrees in Grand forks Fargo and walk in and do it all started with a Lincoln North Dakota thirty eight urologist Tom ... news will be regional Watergate\nOh thank you Tom\nYou were sitting there ...
