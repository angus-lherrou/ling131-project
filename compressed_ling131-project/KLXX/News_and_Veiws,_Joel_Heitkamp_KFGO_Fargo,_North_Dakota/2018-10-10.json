and be in the studio at the same time so that we can have a little debate\nThe little discussion about what's going on with the recreational marijuana issue now David ... is the chair when it comes to legalize Andy uh Bob we fault is the chair of North Dakota it's against the legalization of recreational marijuana David good to have you on the show good to have you in Studio thanks Joel it's great to be here Bob thank you\nA pleasure okay let's let's do this first that David Gell people we are tell people why you're doing this and believe me folks I'm timing this and nobody gets the filibuster so go ahead David\nHi everyone my name is Dave owners Joel said I'm the chairman of measure three end of legalized Andy which is the measure for full legalization of marijuana in the state of North Dakota I'm doing this really when it comes down to it for three reasons the first reason is the current criminal justice system and the war on drugs is fundamentally broken\nThe second reason is at the end of the day individual freedom and personal liberty you should have the right to use the substance that's safer than alcohol and that as objectively safer than other substances we have legal in our society is a proven medicine that works\nAnd the third reason I'm doing this is ultimately we legalize ... as well which is great for agriculture is going to be the first pay raise farmers have seen since Nineteen Seventy seven\nBob go ahead tell them who you are and tell them why your position is what it is\nHere my name's Bob we follow them retire district court judge at one time back in the old days I was attorney general the great state of North Dakota\nI'm opposed to this measure because his poorly drafted is flawed measure it's got a lot of problems with it\nAnd no matter what he says what we're voting on is this particular measure with all of its problems and I hope to be able to point out today in our debate and the many problems with it I I ah was recruited by Wayne sent him to get on this because he said read the measure I read the measure and I said signed me up this is really bad bad law\nBut the ... one of the bad things are right at the tail end\nThis measure says section five it is a Supreme law the land in any law in conflict with this measure is not apply to repeal that's absurd\nDave uh that's been a constant criticism of this was partly drafted I Want

three Seventeen thirty six seven oh one six six thirty one seven three six\nWe found is chair of the north\nOf recreational marijuana and Dave on is the chair of legalize Andy I'm going to go to Bob we fall first on this one thought do you believe that marijuana is a gateway drug\nI Oh yes it is a gateway drug or the statistic side that nine percent of every ... every person who uses marijuana will become addicted to it all the medical people I've talked to said it is the gateway drug not everybody uses marijuana is gonna become addicted not everybody's the marijuana is going to go on to other drugs\nBut people that go on to other drugs typically start with marijuana\nI I'm gonna ask you the same thing they do you believe it's a a gateway drug so multiple studies across the publicly available source which is ... which allows you to look at peer reviewed academic documents show that marijuana is one not physically addictive\nToo it's not a gateway drug and three according to the journal of American Medical association and their peer reviewed publication decreases the rates of opioid abuse an overdose by approximately twenty five percent in states that have legalized so as a result no it's not a gateway drug\nNo it doesn't lead to harder drugs no it's not addicting and ultimately it helps a lot of people get off opioids and needless to say it also has medicinal properties so no medicine um and at the end of the day it should not be treated as a gateway drug it should be treated\nUh using the drug's a marijuana to get some pain and it doesn't give them pain relief as well so they're going to opiates and there was a study in the airport in the Fargo forum yesterday\nThat said pots worse than alcohol for teen brains no question about that all the stations I've talked to said that a marijuana is a gateway drug marijuana can become addictive I don't know I I Would we disagree on that I understand that we disagree on that but the evidence to suggest\nThat it is a gateway drug it is addictive\nSo it's interesting that you brought up so go ahead I'll give you thirty seconds here so Bob wants to cite opinion pieces of not peer reviewed journals and peer reviewed journals are done by the actual experts the journal of American Medical association is clear down the attorney general in Colorado citing a study\nHe is is that in the Rocky Mountain task force he's a ... that had access to all the publications that are there the this is serious business I Know that there's a dispute and a half a day but acts like he's an expert in this stuff idle purport to be an expert but I can tell you that all the medical people I've visited with talk about it being a gateway drug\nI I Want to get to the Rocky Mountain part because I think it brings up the economics and to this as well a bubbly fall when you look at what's happened in other states one of the one of the calls that continually comes in here\n... and ... and I recently had a gas from PBS that uh that was ... Rick Steves that you know he does have a show on PBS where he travels around the world and tells people about trials and and those type of things but he cited the state of Washington\nAs an example of all the things that were said that it was going to do that it didn't\nThat brought in revenues at it that it uh you know it didn't it make crime go through the rough it didn't do any of these things and so what I Want to ask you is this a site in Colorado have you looked at what other states have had happened and based your opposition on that\nWell the there's a company called smart approaches to marijuana Sam [noise] that has done some work in the states one sister's for instance in Bend Oregon where they've legalized in two thousand Fifteen emergency room visits excuse me when from two hundred and fifty to two thousand and one year\nTraffic fatalities are up\nOr people with drugs in there with marijuana and the system fatalities or up\nThe are they talking about peer review or by the way the American Journal of psychiatry is the one who came up with the study but pot bad for teen brains so there's plenty of evidence out there are and all of it seems to be bad the or\nThere's more traffic accidents\nBut the problem is is we know whatever's happening other states were voting on this particular measure all those other states Washington everything else they all have limits they all have limits in their bill they all have controls and if they all have revenue streams\nThis law this law that goes into effect will be completely unlimited unregulated uncontrolled new revenue stream it is going to be wide open I agree with David and that if that's what they want if they intend to have freedom they got it when this bill\nPayments I I Want to do about Colorado\nAnd what's happened in church and state of Washington you know what I'm building to hear whether or not uh the the results of those states have shown that the concerns of people against this really aren't valid\nBut what it certainly shown is that in every instance when you look at the macro data how you when you don't cherry pick up small county or you don't try to pick one particular location but you look at a macro sample size and entire state what you see are the following you see traffic fatalities slightly down on one particular outliers Nevada wherever the past eleven months vendetta\nIt was down about two to three percent index per capita you see a decrease in violent crime typically a percentage point and you see a decrease in\nI Know that you like to bring up homelessness that goes down as well and you see an increase in employment so unemployment also falls slightly that was a correlation and causation it's hard to say\nRight it it's hard to say does legalizing caused these things to go down but we don't know what we do know is legalization does not cause crime to go up it does not cause\nI'm traffic fatalities to rise per capita it does not cause any of these things when you look at the macro data now you can cherry pick certain things and report to the piece on this he even said um look depending on where you want to pull your data from you can show anything you want\nBut I Believe that the general trends since two thousand twelve has been downwards and these things are great\nOkay I I Want to go I I only just say I disagree with it I think that I think that they said to have gone up words there's more traffic deaths because more people marijuana and here's what I don't understand gosh this isn't something where opinion matters it ... this is something\nWhere where it's either a fact or not I mean this is not gee you're against it in and you're saying that\nThat states to pitch to show this has caused all this trouble and David you're saying statistics show that you know what it has been caused so much trouble so it does it for the list are out there who I'm trying to connect with on this I'm struggling\nWith how the stats are either one or the other [noise] okay so we we only have a minute left in this segment and I'm Sorry I got preachy there but it's so frustrating for those of us really haven't made up our mind on what we might do on this measure when we come back\nWe're to talk economics so there's your morning as you get to get ready to make your case we're going to talk about revenue brought into these states we're going to talk about or you know whether or not that revenue or really can utilize or whether it shouldn't be utilized because it might cost money\nIn that state in terms of\nOf how you have to deal with it treatment and other things and so I just want to ask you about that\nI Want to thank both of these individuals Dave on the chairman of the legalize Andy and Bob ... a share of North Dakota it's against the legalization of recreational marijuana\nThem both for being in the studio at the same time\nHope you're enjoying it will find more information for you right after that\nCombination of separately registered product to put more performing than any other looking like the three\nWell I I enjoy it every day of being Seventy six I'm thrilled to be really nice to trust me I'm not throwing the eight at heart around but it you know is this a of a generational thing is it that you don't understand it because of the age that you are\nWell or what we what I Do understand is what I read in the bill the bill is poorly draft we're voting on this but we're not voting on something else we're not voting on whether farmers can make money were not voting on sales tax on that money on a regular stream we're voting on this particular measure hit is flawed as poorly draft that I think even some of the people\nWho have supported the idea of say well you know there is forty drafted they should have gone to the legislature they should have gone to some ... attorney that had competent and writing these things it was it's poorly drafted now you want to know my personal opinion I don't like marijuana my son was killed in an accident five years one month in ten days ago\nWhere marijuana doesn't fall no you can't expect me to go out and preach to the choir and say Oh yes we need that marijuana I don't think I don't want to do it I Know people want to use marijuana that's fine but they have to do it and the rules and regulations are no rules no regulations in this and the notion that the legislature has got to bail him out on this\nI don't know it's going to take two thirds to do it David\nI Want to ask you the same question is is a generational thing\nNo it's it's not a generational thing in so far as what the facts are what what it is is we have people that were unfortunately lied to by our government for a long time in reefer madness and then these movies they said that marijuana was worse than heroin that's false justice\nAnd when you have years and years and years of being lied to eventually you start to believe it and it's hard to learn what you've learned especially when there's an emotional aspect to it and I wasn't going to bring up the emotional aspect the Bob house but since he's brought it up\nThere is an emotional aspect to it that does block your ability to learn when you associate a tragedy with a substance you're not going to look at the research you're not going to look at what everyone's saying you're going to look at your own personal experiences and I'm I'm very sorry what happened to you happen to you Bob I really wish it out\nBut I don't think it's a generational thing I think it's people who were lied to for a very long time by people that they were ... but they trusted and they're having to unlearn it\nOr whoever goes first I always give them a chance to rebut Bob do you want to read about that at all\nNumber one I'm not a line number two I read the bill that split\nProblems not with what ... research out there it's with this bill we have to vote no it's a bad deal okay\nLet let me go here because Bob mentioned this just a little bit ago David ... he said you should have gone to the legislature you're ... you know would you or should have gone to the legislature\nLegislative counsel is not offered to ballot initiatives so there is no way to go to the legislature unless they're willing to sponsor you wouldn't want to hear you\nNow there was a study to even research recreational marijuana in that failed so we didn't have that option I Do object the statement that we didn't use attorneys we used three very good attorneys we used a leash a darn who's one more awards than any attorney I've ever met for her age and his license to practice federal law and all fifty states\nWe had Nicholas Sarwar come on the record of this a former deputy public defender in Colorado before legalization and after legalization and saw everything that happened in the changes that need to be made we had Jordan Parker and attorney to focus more on the civil side from California\nLook at again before and after legalization we took the best attorneys that we could get who had been there and done that and use that to create this North Dakota bill it's not poorly written it's just not liked by\nOur opposition Bob your answer that\nRate the bell and you can make it make up your own mind that it's a fourteen pages long the first twelve pages are rehash of the uh controlled substances law that get to the last two provisions section for on the expansion section\nFive on the Supreme law the land you'll see it poorly written it's going to create all kinds of problems and that ticket for me it does that David a chance\nTo read but I I actually agree I I think you read the measuring let me tell you what you see you see families no longer being separated because of the drug war you see kids no longer being potentially eligible for a felony because they live within a thousand feet of U. N. D. and therefore possession over a gram as an automatic felony\nYou don't see these huge problems in states that have legalized you see a process to seal records to put people's lives back together so they can become productive members of society I agree with Bob read the bill so fantastic bill\n... chair of the north Dakota is against the legalization of recreational marijuana is our guest as his David oil now David as chair of legalize Andy\nUh Bob do you think we'd be in this room if if the legislature that you cited a little bit earlier had dealt differently with medical marijuana or do you think that that\nHas played a role in us being an extra\n... I I I I'm not sure because I wasn't involved in that I Will tell you this of uh the legislatures looked at it of all the states that have done medical marijuana except Minnesota the passes has taken from eight Eighteen months to twenty four two thirty month so I don't think it's taken a long time in North Dakota\nOkay I'll let you answer that same question is is the motivation behind this the frustration of the fact we still aren't able to use medical marijuana\nThere are certainly a lot of people who feel an are correct and feeling that one measure three is legalized on December ... you will be able to get medical grade marijuana\nIn North Dakota without having to deal with the prescription problem without having to have tons of symptoms that medical marijuana helps that aren't covered but that's not my personal motivation\nMy personal motivation is again the families being torn apart the lack of individual liberty and the agricultural revenue but that being said measure three sets as your last best chance to get medical marijuana before year round\nOkay thank you guys are we're going to continue this we got a little more time left and I want you both to be able to have closing statements but I've got to get to\nConcerned about the weather out there to talk ... ... a well or the racial line has been pretty much situated very close to more\nThe snow in east of it

think Jim Casper has and so here's here's my bias I I'd Jim Casper is free to call into the show anytime he wants and he'll get on the show but I'm not calling them\nI'm not calling them because it wouldn't be fair for me to talk to a gym Casper about this because I don't believe me as ethics I saw Jim Casper did not tell me where he went to to start casinos in North Dakota when he got a flight to all free and wind and died and everything when it comes to it and then basically you know when I challenged him on that\nOr he told me that it's none of my business and and what's the point of

vaccinations on the couch\nAll mad nice working whether like this but\nIt's beautiful young guys fill out west so doing All right\nYou're better than we are we got a lot of years\nSo I had a couple of comments or on for a cab and well the reason\nOkay but what responsibility as a publication\nDo you have when you allow your strategy to go so far that it includes lies\n[noise]\nI mean I I don't know I you know you sit there and you get in the debate about whether or not charges could be brought when the local state's attorney didn't bring charges\nAt at the end the at school and ... and so that you can sit there and published because you're the mouthpiece you're the tool you're the one that gets the twenty tax day by a campaign that says hey say this say this you know what\nThe Native Americans I mean there there they'll fall for that say this that Heidi Heitkamp wasn't there for abuses that happened the Native Americans you know what go talk to Native Americans\nGo talk to him\nSee whether or not they believe that Heidi Heitkamp has been ... there for them there is so\nLittle political gain everybody talks about politics the money of politics or you know how politics brings us money well you know what can you imagine for one second\nJust one second if Heidi Heitkamp was paying her husband a salary because of her role in politics can you imagine what what the Republican Party would be saying can you imagine for one second if Heidi Heitkamp we're paying her children\nIssues pay alley and they said\nTo be on her staff of her campaign can you imagine if she had paid them for the last six years of her life and paid them to the point where it adds up to hundreds of thousands of dollars can you imagine what that response would be from the Kramer campaign they would be going nuts about nepotism\nAnd yet you know it it's all of a sudden some sort of oh my God it's a lie well you know what\nWhen you've got people like Tim Burton a former U.S attorney that comes forward and says you know that this is what could happen\nOr if she had no option here it's not her fault and we need to get Tim burden on the show Kelly we need to let him speak to this because what's being said in the Fargo forum and I'm going to say it has the Fargo forum because it's their product\nThey pay for that product this isn't a gas editorial assistants somebody writing at a gas started toil this is somebody who represents them that is lying\nOkay it's that plane that simple that it might fit the narrative it might fit the game plan it might fit the strategy of the ...\nBut it's not right it's not right\nAnd and so you can compare it to myself and Rick Berg first stop Rick Berg had a chance to counter me anytime he could have called in the show in two seconds later he would have been on\nOkay\nTo stop Rick Berg had a chance to counter me anytime he could have called in the show in two seconds later he would have been on\nOkay\nSo this is about writing something and days later somebody having to respond to it that this is a whole different critter [noise]\nAnd and I'm Sorry but it's wrong\nAnd shame on the Fargo forum I mean shame on the Fargo forum to those good people that work there you bear some of that responsibility too because you need to go and they need your skills\nThey need your talent to do what they had done in the past so you take out that popularity that you've gained that that that skill that you've given them through years of hard work and take it out for a walk\nLook at him and say you know what guys I\nWant to be proud of where I work I Want to be proud of what we do [noise]\nAnd and I want you to make sure that our employees right the truth\nAnd that's a big part of it now how much political game do you think Heidi Heitkamp God when she's sitting there and she's working on back pages when she's making sure that young Native American women couldn't be traded on the open market as though there's some commodity there's no political gain for that\nThere there's nothing there that that sits there and says oh Heidi you're going to make money it's about doing the right thing\nDo you know what percentage in the state of North Dakota Native Americans are\nI mean so for the Kramer people that go ahead and say this it's just a lie is a lie to sit there and say you know what oil oil on a domestic side here you know when it when it comes to oil\nOr you know I was the one that made sure that domestic oil could be sent to foreign markets that we could export oil that's not true Kevin Cramer it's not in fact the oil industry knows that it was in fact Heidi Heitkamp\nThat's one of the reasons that one of the individuals that I criticize here often actually did a fundraiser for Heidi Heitkamp in Harold ... do the research you'll find out\nSo I can take almost anything but a lie let me give me an example of what I think is ally okay\nSocial media what you do on social media\nThere was a there was a a panel that was set up\nWith leaders across the state of North Dakota there was the head of the late night energy there was a congressman Kevin Cramer there is Senator John Hoeven and there is senator Heidi Heitkamp\nWhen pitchers went out of this from a Kramer campaign they crop tidy Heitkamp out of it as though she wasn't there when Heidi Heitkamp sent it out Kevin Cramer was in the picture\nOne of those to his ally which one is it [noise]\nIt it's it's there and and I was talking to a good good friend this morning on my way to work and and what he said to me was was right\nIn that he said I'm so proud of your sister and this individual is voted for as many if not more ours and he's voted for these he said I'm so proud of your sister because she's run such a positive including campaign and I looked at him\nOr a or I said to him over the phone I said you know\nIt doesn't always work negative campaigns work and so if somebody's going to get this whole orchestrated media everybody behind them and have them have the ability to lie\nAnd they get this whole orchestrated media everybody behind them and have them to have the ability\nTo lie to flat out lie\nThat's a tough thing to overcome without getting negative that's a tough thing to overcome without looking into a camera and saying I'm not for tariffs on soybeans I think there's a different way to negotiate with China\nI don't think that farmers should bear the brunt of that now those are the type ads and he's been running I get that\nThey're positive she explains who she is she explained to her family as she explains the relationship she had with her mother she talks about issues\nThat that affect you that nobody wants to talk about issues that affect individuals that don't speak to it when it comes to sexual abuse that's uncomfortable those are tough tough ads\nThat isn't the criticism of anybody as much as what it is a recognition of a problem [noise] okay that's there\nSo let me give you another example\n[noise] Donald Trump last night talked about he Fifteen okay Donald Trump talked about a Fifteen being able to to be twelve months side of the year that\nThat we shouldn't just worried about the flex fuel standard of what happens here and there is no this is somebody that gave their support to Donald Trump or a hundred percent of the time the Trump Administration gave waivers to the oil industry because they didn't have to blend and makeup and all\nThat's what they did\nSo last night there in Iowa and it's time to sound\nAs though oh my God we love oil or we love after all he Fifteen eight Fifteen you know what your poached eggs at all\nYou did\nYou screw them over and why did you do it because oil wanted you to do it I'm sitting here looking at an editorial\nWritten by Kevin Cramer about how the renewal of fuel standard mandate should end in twenty twenty two he was really\nProud of this really proud of this it got all kinds of national play when representative a congressman writes that the renewal\nBoth feel standard should go away\nBut now we're in a campaign right now we're in a\nCampaign now the president that you promise to support a hundred percent of the time and you yourself are all for ethanol because it's a positive thing when the facts show that you weren't there for ethanol\nThis editorial proves that your lying and if I don't\nCall them a liar I can guarantee you this the Fargo forum won't because they won't even call their own employ a liar when he lies\nI'm going to bring up one more thing Carrie you ready for this yesterday\nI got hit with the whole the left is nothing but a bunch of radicals but the left is nothing but individuals that that are basically terrorists the left or the individuals that that you have to fear\nYou know\nThe way that some of the people handle the cabin our vote and the way they talk to some of the senators\nWas wrong are expressed that yesterday but see if this sounds", "year": "2018",
