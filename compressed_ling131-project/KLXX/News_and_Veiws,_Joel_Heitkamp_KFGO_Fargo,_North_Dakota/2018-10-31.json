district\nCongressman as you know the experience that you brought it oftentimes I'm a Democrat you're a Democrat full exposure to like people didn't know that um people say people like you and I are against guns nothing drives me\nMore nuts and that I mean you wore the uniform of this country you know what it's like the whole the gun you you've been out in the field you gotta you gotta rooster a commentator said didn't so let's just do that at a congressman Peterson how frustrating it is it to you to be at a public forum and somebody says your after their guns\nIt's frustrating I didn't help me in the Democratic primary but I'm One of the top gun in Congress for years in a row you know we do this we go out and shoot ... drought rounds of that and I can\nRide back on the bus and ask my Republican friends how it feels to be out shot by a liberal gun grabber every year in a shoot them and so we do these forums or they admit that you're not bad\nAnd they know that they know that it's a talking point and I said in this country as I said we grew up doing this but I Know responsible gun owners their hearts break when we have these shootings they don't like somebody should get their hands on a guy who doesn't have one these are responsible books which they sure do a background check make sure you have red flags to\nTo take them away let's have this conversation let's do let's do some research into why this is happening and which I find so interesting is is how they assume it by what your you know what party or from a 'cause we just had this conversation they did a big story in the Minneapolis papers like who owns more guns in this you know gubernatorial race will of course with me 'cause my opponent doesn't\nUh has never owned guns has never been around them doesn't have anything to do with that and you know what I got a safe as we had a gun safe is and I I I think the frustration and we have is\nIs that for the responsible gun owners who are out there that they're there can be a middle ground on this they're there can be a place where we respect your Second Amendment rights and and we all know that that as society changes\nAnd different things happen we need to keep working to try and find that place where we we used to strike that balance so it's frustrating or it has been a electoral strategy\nThat we're going to let people so people will vote for someone who knows nothing about guns just because they say I'm not going to do anything about it well\nThere's a whole lot of folks who own firearms and say we should do something about some of these people we we can't allow this to happen\nSo I Would really struggle looking if somebody who wore the uniform of this country achieved the highest rank you can and tell you that you're against us you know I Would have a real hard time looking\nI shot our officers do I tell him that I or you didn't even have to be that good a shot and you could hit on target with a cannon so why are we done these things\nThat I ... if you're elected governor of of Minnesota obviously you're gonna have a base in the twin cities\nYou know what one thing that they're in their mind right now those guys getting after soybeans and corn right now and then they're strict they are going to say is I I Will film of all the you know forget about us you know everybody has to Minneapolis and they don't get about us what's your answer that\nWhile I think they have reason to worry about that and I think that's why this whole model of last year of of having an ounce steak candidate for governor is so unusual I mean it's been Thirty years since we had somebody is not in the twin cities in the Republican or Democrat\nWho's outside of that I I think they're right I think we talk one Minnesota about building this and this is not about demonizing the twin cities it's about making a clear understanding that investing in greater minute\n\nWe're not talking it everybody comes greater\n\nI I'm I'm at the point right now I'm telling these people if a politician coming to you in touch broadband they\nIn this fight between trends\n\nIn Minnesota that kind of built the Minnesota Miracle was local government aid that help lower property taxes by spreading out some of the general fund dollars back to them and equity in education funding that said if you go to a small rural high school you're going to get the same opportunities as suburban high school class and that's changed and now you have these\nRural high schools are these real communities willing bond referendum to raise their property taxes to fix a leaky\nRoof and that was my next question that you are under the model of temple after you cut taxes cut spending the next you know states broke subscribe then then you look at a mark date and he finds a sweet spot in the tax on where you can still have economic development in the state\nAnd yet people are going around screaming that you've raised my taxes too much which ones right\nIt's the middle and that that people are right that we should uh we have for taxation but as I always say you get what you pay for it there's a reason that we rank at the top and many indicators of quality of life of uh\nWe have taxation but as I always say you get what you pay for it there's a reason that we rank at the top and many indicators of quality of life of a everything from life expectancy to uh\nTo personal incomes or it's striking that balance and and again you tell people were going to cut their taxes you don't get to just say that without telling them how their quality of life and what services you're going to be back in your rights when temple and he was there\nWe did shift gimmicks he didn't use the word taxi said these all of us got feed the death if you will rather than taxed to death we saw property taxes sky rocket because we pulled away that that equalization ... and then we started to see was any Rosen of\nQuality workforce in all parts of the state that had a long term economic drag so yes this is philosophical uh in terms of\nEconomic you know economic philosophy but but one of them left us a six billion dollar debt\nHurt our credit rating borrowed millions from our schools that were still trying to recover from drove a property taxes and cause local governments to have all kinds of banks and the other one on your Mark Dayton balance the budget created grow put us back up on the top of things so it's the oldest thing in the world that just go tell people you're going to cut their taxes men don't deliver\nK just want to know you get a chance to promote ready I've got thirty seconds for you to answer this you being listened to all the way to in Sydney Montana deep into South Dakota [noise] you know all over the state of North Dakota obviously if you could tell them one thing about Minnesota and why they should come there it's what\nEdison statements invest in our people who's your best qualified workforce you'll have the healthiest folks and you'll have a world class transportation system in research that will grow your business we're here and we're open for business\nCongressman Walz good luck near election special Tim Walz ladies and gentlemen when we come back\nOf the hour she's going to be here that's right Heidi Heitkamp is I don't know if it's in Studio ...\nSater Heidi Heitkamp they got a bus tour kickoff she's got Joe Biden

cash flow their farms because of this trade war we've got to stand up for the values that are made us a\nAdopt that party to begin with and that's what I think Joe Biden does I\nTalk to you a little bit about some trouble than I got an yesterday I'm surprised you know your little brother got in trouble again but I you know I was asked to be on a ... with national media we carried it here on the news news radio network and I told them I don't believe the polls that then I think that that I don't know\nA center whether you're gonna win or lose you know nobody knows you don't know but I Do know that it's much closer than what national media is making you know to be and so I Want to give you a chance to get in as much trouble as I did [laughter] you know what what would you say to those national pundits and say this race is over\nWell I mean I've been saying all along North Dakota is a state that all politics or personal I'm going to probably from the time that I got back here to last for weeks I'll have taught ... by the time were done to Fifteen thousand North Dakota and\nThink about that show if you take that times ten that means that I win the election and so\nYou know polls are polls last time they had me downtown there's a poll out again today that has me down nine I mean you know I just want everybody to just stop listening to national media outlets the pundits I'd at eight percent chance according to the best\nUm a predictor of elections last time to win an election in North Dakota but you know I one and so don't listen to that I think what what we're hoping to do is get out and vote persuaded a few more votes and get this across the finish line\nSo when you take a look at what it takes to do that there's an issue that's been raised today on the on the reservations with Native Americans every tool has been used by the Republican majority in the north Dakota legislature to stop them from voting\nPeriod and I don't want the hog you addressed that\nWell you know obviously we're ... we're very very concerned\nAbout twenty percent of the tribal population puts on a uniform I think if you put on a uniform the last thing we ought to be doing is taken away your right to vote and so when you look at the complaint I actually read the complaint this morning that that's been filed on behalf of ...\nWay you're right to vote and so when you look at the complaint I actually read the complaint this morning that that's been filed on behalf of a number of native citizens talking about\nHaving their ballot rejected I I I Would just challenge anyone who says that this isn't the problem to actually read the complaint and read about these experiences and so the question becomes\nHow many more time says that happened where somebody hasn't basically called out and said I Need representation and so clearly even with new tribal ideas were having problems because of um my communication for the secretary of state's office\nTo these auditors and and so hopefully we'll get it resolved\nI'm but I'm the good news is that because of early vote a lot of these problems are being recognized right now as a post on election day\nIt isn't it isn't some hits in the guinea up here between the secretary's day these individuals were told that they had to get a street\nAddress the call Mullins Alan on the street address then they go to vote and they said that's not good enough as it\nDoesn't match with what they think the street address says\nAnd even though they're trying to light either yeah\nI mean I'll change or doesn't know what my street address yeah I mean if I walked up to him right now and so now what's my street addresses she doesn't know how well the other day when I Lived the nine one one coordinator knows where I live\nYeah the other thing Joel remember we never when we were growing up and down there we didn't have a street address we had appealed box our parents didn't vote under these rules\nNo bill box ten that's where you and I loved yup field out [laughter]\nAnd that was what was on our driver's license bureau box ten I I when we got our mail has their best what\nWe went down to vote and they knew where you live did they didn't have a problem that wasn't voter fraud\n... there was there was a friend of mine that went to vote on a school board election they said you don't live in a school district you said well can I vote any way\nThey knew where I live in what they say no way here's\nThe other part that that really upsets me about all this is that it's by design that\nWhat they want they want to make sure that a certain body of voters has to jump through every possible and here's my challenge tiny here's my challenge what evidence there do they have that there was a problem\nWell none I mean they say they they did but what we know about this is that this is a national solution that's being promoted by hail a national uh groups\nAnd they're all pushing one size fits all in North Dakota bet and what's interesting is for a group of legislators who I always said let us decide one size doesn't that all they sure bet on a one size fits all election solution that doesn't work for North Dakota\nWhere's the bus with the big Heidi rap going\nWhat's going it's going to be in Fargo we're going to be at the air museum a bite and Joe is going to kick it off and so I'm counting and Earl

buy when it's his round that's all I'm\nNot is not true totally everybody what you call him alligator arms Danny that's what I Do I don't know what you call not going there ... told me\nSo here's the thing about this race and I and I did say this on national TV yesterday that anyone who looks at this race there's a there's a famous\nPicture of you holding up the Fargo forum where a week before the election it had us forty in Bergen fifty and so why do you think that polls have been so wrong when it comes to your elections\nI think it's getting harder and harder because the cell phones a lot of these are skewed for land line that a lot of them are skewed western\nI'm which is you know it's not an area that I Do particularly well in compared to the um that every vote matters and and but I Would I Would tell you Joel is I just quit looking at it what we're doing is we're knocking doors were counting votes were getting all their votes were persuading our votes and we feel really good about where we are right now\nSenator high camp as always good to talk to you or be safe out during the ... or ... one last one I\nRemember the last time last time we we had a bus tour you ended up

anymore and I just wanted to say I I think I can get a wonderful yeah they're going to pay anybody watch that it's pretty clear you should vote for\nThat debate wasn't close I mean that debate wasn't even close it was so close to I\nHad done an individual come up to me and say I hadn't made up my mind which I was shocked that 'cause I looked at him and say\nYou are you ... been with me because I knew that he lean pretty far right and he said no Joel I had made up my mind because I like your family he said but after that debate I did she said she wanted and I thought whoa whoa seeking if we can get that vote friday that's that's a chance that she may win who knows so\nShe did amazing and that was never a time when I worked out in the corner what she was on sixty minutes yeah I Wish I was

testing for over\nHow do they determine how to terminate if if my address is invalid [noise]\nWell that's one of the things is a lot of this lawsuit was intended to to find out I mean what we're seeing is is ah [noise] ah you know folks that have a a North Dakota driver's license we have an incident but folks a person as a North Dakota driver's licenses said their addresses XYZ and bell court [noise]\nUm but when you go to the central voter file it says it their addresses X Y Z in St John up on the turtle mountain reservation so what's gonna happen when that person shows up at the poll with a D O T address a bell court\nBut a voter file address of St John I mean they should be allowed to vote they have a voter id that has an address on it it it's it's their address it doesn't match\nThe voter ID A potentially um the question is what's gonna happen at that moment in time and we're\nThis lawsuit is intended to make sure that it's clear that those folks can vote\nSo again we don't have voter registration finite when you show up with an address the poll workers and say okay this is your address yes okay I'm going to write down your address you're telling me this is your address it shouldn't I mean when you show up in voter registration state if your ID doesn't match your voter registration of\nInformation they can deny you the right to vote we don't have voter registration and that's why this is so troubling\nThat's the point of my question is that okay who determines that news training in these these poll workers if that's how it's going to be dealt with because that has to be coming from the states\n[noise] well I mean we were going to that is one of the things that this lawsuit is intended to find out is is is where is this coming from and then and you know we were we're hoping that that ah we can protect the vote in these specific counties\nThis lawsuit is also narrower than the last one and only involves the counties or where there's registry where there's reservation ah within the county ... exterior boundaries of the reservation or within the county and you know we're trying to narrowly target this that's one of the problems the circuit had with the last case singing applied statewide we're we're trying to narrow that and again focus on\nUh the tribes that have been affected I mean our complain also allege is\nI mean you can't imagine the cost to these tribes to to get these new ideas new IDs issued as well you know as you know Joel tribes don't have unlimited budget and when you start having to print 'em a new IDs and you're waving your charges for them because you want your people to vote\n'em you know that those dollars come from other things they come from opioid prevention they come from child welfare services I mean\nTribes have limited budgets in in in the spirit lake try him a were alleging has has\nYou know they've they've printed something like ... ten twelve twenty times the number of IDs a that they normally print on any given given week over the last a month to try and get up to speed\nAnd you know they still in in in our in our complaint we allege that there are still a perhaps over a hundred people that that that don't have an idea what they're what they're mailing address on it\nFormer U.S attorney tempered ... going to get Daniel on with you he has a question Daniel question or comment for tempered\nYou roll it out and you know he has the liver through our ballot or else\nYeah I mean are there so I mean I got ya you hear it winds right\nAbsolutely and in our lawsuit alleges ... ... the lawsuit itself the complaint has some maps or you know in the middle of the complaints [noise] and they show that there are um on the on the on the ah computer program the N. D. G. I. F. sub which a secretary of state has said is\nIs a definitive tool or an authoritative tool for getting your address um there are streets where people live that are labeled unknown right and in our complain also alleges that [noise]\nThat ah if you look at this G. I. S. hubs sometimes where somebody when they say somebody lives\nIs a mile or half mile from their actual address and so there are clearly problems with this are lawsuit alleges that there are problems with this\nAnd and the goal here is to not have these arguments taking place at polling places next Tuesday on an ad hoc basis but to try and get judge Hubble and the federal court hearing in North Dakota to take a look at this\nTake a look at what we've uncovered and our investigation of where we've been over the last month\nThe circuit says we think said we think the secretary of state should be able to to execute this and make this so this doesn't [noise] negatively impact undo people's right to vote doesn't impose an undue burden on them our investigation to show that that hasn't really worked out over the last month\nAnd so as applied a this is an unconstitutional burden on on folks on the reservation in terms of voting\nIt's Wednesday or next week Tuesdays election day people are already voting today how how fast can judge humbling turn this around if he's going to turn in a\nWhile we filed a complaint yesterday were planning on filing a motion for a temporary restraining order ... injunction today um and we're you know we were all full will get in front of the judge and he'll take a a a close look at this\nOkay Tim ... a former U.S attorney thank you sir thanks coming on thank you [laughter] okay um it it's a mess it's an absolute mess and and don't kid yourself this is this was done with no evidence a view we can we\nCan have all the letters to the editor that we can have from from state senators saying look this this was no big deal tell you what a Nicole Pullman go out to the reservation\nLive on the reservation well right now they're all laughing right live
