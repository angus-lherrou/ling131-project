and bad news\nWell yeah I'd like to have you back on me back I mean I I'm interested to hear the the news about a ... hour we are harvesting says us down to earth cutters that are killing them so we've got a they've got and politically correct all the way the Canadian border\nWell ... that's the word I use harvesting that way I take it and everybody out to a who says you went out and shot a bunch of peasants you bet I did but we harvest them we're helping them touch now a jury I Want to I Want to talk to you a little bit about\nWhere we're at with the farm bill in relation to marketing and there's been a lot of talk I heard a report the other day that uh you know exports up the was making a difference what are you telling your growers when they look to you for advice\nWhile we're trying to ah continue that team you know that we talked about earlier in the ear where we were a doubting that China would import\nAs many beans as what was the first thought you know back or nine months ago by the trade and know what they were doing is taking the five percent ... percent per year increase in China that man and just a trap pointing that out to infinity almost\nAnd uh and that would have been something that neighborhood over a hundred and eight million metric tons for\nThis coming year and actually it's a it's actually going to be down around eighty five we thought it would even exceed Ninety five\nSo what they've done is they've done without us I guess and they're and they're just bent on doing that ever since really if you go back to the summer I think it was a Seventeen when they had some um probably artificial as we would call him a restrictions on a foreign material and that they\nThat they imposed upon us but not on not on Brazil and that created some slow down so they were buying things from Brazil oil way back in anticipation of problems occurring or\nA after they knew that Trump got elected 'cause it's pretty low on what he was going to do what trade and ah and how he felt about China so we're trying to keep a focus on what that means that it's kind of too late now you know that ship has sailed right down to a couple of blocks from the eyes and\nWere blended man on the elevator all taken Mendez they care about a few uh tripled up fees but\nAh I think we're going to do a lot in a week or ten days as if it warms up that gets rid of that snow that we have a second chance at it\nI don't think it's going to be as bad as as as some of those I think\nUm but here again that's a different situation or North Dakota and what I went through I don't know and the ... weapons and they didn't crack open debate fall on the ground back then but when you start getting below zero weather that's certainly a possibility that readers on December\nI

Jerry I Want to talk to you about interest rates and the the sheer mechanic some of loans and and what it takes\n... how big of effect or can can what we're looking at I I Know there's been talk about the fed and everything else how is this going to affect production agriculture\nWell if you look at it you know when we've suffered from the not suffered I guess in the end and then we'll probably say we all suffer from low interest rates but the part of the low interest rates that we that we've seen a logging is what I Would call the unintended consequences\nBecause why wouldn't you buy increase your capital expenditures because interest rates are so low\nUm however when those interest rates start to come back up and your pencil then about three percent interest rate perhaps or whatever it was it a few years ago relatively low and it goes up one percent that's a thirty three percent increase in your expenses for interest\nAnd it's coming at a time when you don't have the cash flow you grow up a couple of percent and if you talk about the fed normalizing rate\nOr those of us bin Laden longer than ten or Fifteen Years remember that we used to think five percent interest rates was was cheap\nWell now you go back up to there and you've increased some of these interest rates\nAre thirty to forty percent a of a low number and a and that bottom line item number it can get them back to haunt you\nThe only decent thing about it as ... as the ... from your income tax\nBut if you're not paying income tax and you don't have the cash flow to start with so that's a problem but I think you know for a long time and we were warned of the fact that uh that that's not going to last forever so I think there's a lot of farmers who have\nAt least ... their long term interest rates for land and hopefully some of their uh working capitals wall although a lot of the banks don't want you to go out ten years on working\nUh Jerry you've been criticized by a lot of people for being too negative in your projections it turns out you're right uh we have one up here that does what you do for a living named greener who couldn't have been more wrong ah you know how tough is it a for somebody like you when you see what's coming on the horizon and\nSee how tough to to go out and speak to farmers about this and I've I've got only about thirty seconds left your\nWell it's difficult and um I got into the ... years ago uh being invited to write for top producer and I because I was successful harming to start with\nAnd I said I can try to help people and and the lady back then I said to me she said yeah but you have an obligation to tell other farmers are what you know how you do at best and that's what we tried to do\nAnd been successful at it so if you do it as right first I think all the rest of the stuff comes but it's not easy because um you know it it isn't something that farmers are want to hear and they generally want to go someplace in\nAnd and and listen to someone to speak to them that is going to be positive or we had a client the other day that signed up in ... because we were too negative two years ago the rain on price\nHe wanted us to tell them that were China's gonna make it nice and we're going right back to ten dollars again okay doesn't do that in fact there is the opposite so generally have but that's part of the tank or Jerry ... with the ... group [noise]\nBoy\n... year to year generation to generation nobody's scrutinized his performance like you do and they get a ... year to year generation to generation nobody\nDelivers consistent performance Lincoln's\nHighest dealing soybean seed in the U.S [noise] offering one hundred percent exclusive genetics and innovation to keep you forming out and ask you do or how much further you can\nOkay and and then you play into those same individuals that have never been active politically and you tell them that Mexicans are bad that their rapist that everything else goes with that\nWhen in fact many of those individuals you're speaking to hire Mexicans\nMany of those individuals that want whatever product they're consuming comes from the labor of Mexicans many of those individuals who you know who don't want to work for a certain wage don't like the fact that a Mexican supports family\n[noise] so you know you have those individuals now who who make up the the thirty five to forty percent of America that that are active politically and they've gotten active politically because the president\nNow what you have to understand about Donald Trump is the brilliance of Donald Trump\nHe is incredibly smart when it comes to the media I mean you you've got\nAll of this national media that everyday spends all their time beating up on them and all he has to do is say they're fake\nAnd people buy into it because they're they're doing or you know the media is doing exactly what his supporters don't like\nThe U.S it mice that must be fake at the times that they need it the most know it can get you ratings you know if you're MSNBC and you want to spend your whole day bashing Donald Trump it can get you ratings\nIf you're MSNBC and you don't want to be in the middle of this country and understand exactly what I just said about Donald Trump it can get you ratings I understand but it won't get you the\nPulse it won't get you the pulse of that forty percent and so there is such a disconnect between the regions of our country and Donald Trump knows that he he knows what Johnny Carson said if you\nThis country you don't win the country and so we get this credited and and we get we get taken for granted because all you have to do all you have to do\nIs just be a Republican in the middle of this country it's all you have to do\nYou you can support these tariffs and do well in the polls here in North Dakota Kevin Cramer if the polls are accurate Kevin Cramer is doing quite well and he supports the terrorists so ... why is that what why would anybody who who votes with their own checkbook\nDo that it's because of Donald Trump it's totally because of Donald Trump\nI mean why would you get on stage and and go for the hog and end up getting the handshake why would you get on stage and and claim your undying support a hundred percent of your time so you give away your vote\nIf it wasn't for the fact that you know the majority of the people in your state\nLumber dilemma\nThey they wouldn't do anything for him\nAnd it matters that matters a lot now now do you want to sell your soul because of that I don't I don't think so I mean I don't think so I mean some people wouldn't sell their soul for that I remember when Donald Trump was asking Heidi Heitkamp to be a member of his can't as cabinet I remember that\nJust like it was yesterday I was in New York City I was there for the University of North Dakota game against Boston College it was at Madison Square garden and Donald Trump and asked Heidi Heitkamp to come to Trump Tower because he was building his team and he offered her a position in his\nCabinet she doesn't go around saying that a lot and I don't know why she does go around saying that a lot of Donald Trump wants to come on and and and say I'm not telling the truth come on bring it on I'll be more than happy to have that conversation\nDonald Trump later on offered her another position in his cabinet when he hadn't filled the secretary of agriculture yet no that that's multifaceted you know the breakdown of the Senate\nGetting you're out of the Senate knowing that you got a Republican governor in North Dakota and the Republican governors are just going to appoint a Republican or you know you've got\nThat that's just political strategy I get that but there's connection there is a real connection you know he he can\nCampaign for Kevin Cramer that was a pledge that he and Harold ... made that was the insurance policy they had if Kevin Cramer Lewis is Kevin you got this job is going to be way more than you're getting paid as a congressman you got a job so go ahead and make this race will be there will back you because we need more Republicans in the Republican cut our Congress and\nAnd ones that will support tariffs ones that will support me in whatever efforts I Do\nAnd and so you as voters because of your\nI mean you're upset your mad DC isn't working you're sick of these traditional politicians you want read of them so you're not you don't care\nYou don't care about what it's costing you financially\nYou don't care about whether or not it's embarrassing for the children you're trying to raise their your grandchildren\nTo look at the that the face of how we handle this ad Shaffer sat right next to me\nAnd I asked him whether or not Donald Trump brought dignity the office he said no he doesn't so you don't care about that because you like this bowling a China closet philosophy that we have right now because you think that it's going to drain the swamp I Would argue that the swamp is

you know there are gone and he lived a great life so just start sympathies go to the family\nUm ...\nYou know I've been I've been meaning to say this\nAll show and so I'm just going to\nUm you know there was a march last night or a walk is probably a better way of putting it uh but um what they did was along Broadway in downtown Fargo there there was a walking in relation to justice for all missing in\n... murdered indigenous people and and so you know people can say that card was played or this card was played the one thing that is incredibly accurate is the there's a way higher rate of

it isn't a\nYou know boy you know look at me I made sure that that road got paved you know look look at me I lowered your taxes kind of a thing I\n... it isn't that isn't sexy\nBut if you ignore it if you're not willing to talk about it nothing's going to get done about it\nSo you can sit there and make an argument that you know back pages where where they trade for sex where they sell women were all these things happen you you could make an argument that that's freedom of the press people don't have to go there they can ignore it you know it can be called out by other forces or a sources of

that is recognized as a as a need to protect the program and and uh and not to raise the age for retirement we don't need to do that there are other ways program can be\nA improve for the long run
