yesterday let's get her on senator high caps welcomed the news in his cage all alright why um\nBecause I think that he in his testimony and in his presentation um I think we have to have no doubt about impartiality have to have no doubt about judicial temperament\nAnd I had serious doubts after that presentation\nAnd after on especially after the exchange with senator called the shark and those doubts continue to grow plus I Believe that um uh this event um which uh cause the extra caring gap and I think that um you know you you have to sometimes\nMake up your mind on who you're going to believe and I believe her but I don't think that means that he doesn't remember it I think I think those two things\nHe doesn't remember it I think I think those two things can co exist and so if you look at those and you say is a disqualifying I'd say you have to\nSuggest that it is but you add to that that doubt that as a ... a presentation that I think was biased was angry and it was on becoming of someone who is going to sit on the highest court in the land with a lifetime appointment\nWhat separated him from judge Kavanaugh who you did support and the judge Gorsuch horses I mean uh you know who you did support what what's the first one\nI think it's judicial temperament you know one of the one of the discussions that people had about\nUm a about Judge Gorsuch and they found him wouldn't and and they were looking for empathy you know we had an absolute amazing discussion in my office and I saw a very empathetic man I'm and you know so I had no doubt that he could be impartial he certainly is conservative\nBut I Believe that he um he has his uh the way he acquitted himself during that process\nUm made him a an excellent choice for the Supreme Court and I tell people I not only I not only supported them I advocated to other people for him\nThe other thing I have to tell you honestly if I like the fact that came from the west um he understood Indian law he understood water law he understood coming out of the Colorado circuit court\nThat um there's other issues beyond the east coast issues and so I'm now more than willing to support Judge Gorsuch did not see someone of that caliber and judge Kavanaugh and this is a lifetime appointment\nWhy why do I have to go to Georgetown Prep I mean why why is it that I have to be cut from a certain you know more to to be able to do this I mean there are a lot of good men and women out there that can be looked at to the Supreme Court justices well it has to be somebody like that\nIt it it was interesting 'cause Lindsey Graham said he was afraid that he was quoted saying he's afraid that the president was going to appoint judge Judy and I thought well what's wrong with judge Judy and she she deals with people's problems every day\nI you know and I'm not saying that that does this the Supreme Court but it doesn't have to have that pedigree and I think that when when the court\nThen becomes populated with people with the same life experiences I think that you don't get a ... do you don't get a diversity of opinion I Am perspective and and I mean I I I find that\nUm yeah I mean it wouldn't be disqualifying me that he went to Georgetown Prep\nUm but it certainly isn't the reason why he should be on the bench\nWell in the way Lindsey Graham's been acting judge cabinet must have seemed ... to him but that's the whole side and what what I'm getting at is what I Want to ask you about is you're going to pay a political price for this I mean anyone who looks or your reelection process is not going to say this was the brightest move you made what's your answer to that\n[noise] you know my answer is I promise North Dakota and said I was going to approach this job and do my job and put politics aside and do what I think was the right thing and how can I you know look at myself in the mirror and say that's honest if I take a vote that is\nIt politically expedient but for me in my judgment the wrong vote especially on a lifetime appointment this is not something that can be done\nAnd so you know we may pass legislation or failed to pass legislation we can always revisit that legislation like we did with Dodd Frank you cannot revisit a Supreme Court appointment it's too important of a decision to make it a political decision\n[noise] talk to people about the process because I think people really don't understand always the process of this and how how long have you spoken to shake oh\nThe process was horrible it was horrible because of both sides I mean can you imagine this show we went to the you know to the secret Rome at the skiffs\nAnd review these documents they only made one copy and there was Seventeen senators and so we're all passing them around like school age kids now this is a secure room they're not going to walk out of that room what in the world I mean you know I just wanted to say this is what's wrong if America saw what we're doing here they would be mortified\nThat were passed when when we have copiers just out the door\nAnd it's just the it is so frustrating how this whole thing was handled by the committee and that's the majority and minority [noise] um I Hope that they take a long hard look and and start having a discussion about how they can improve it\nWhat's going to happen today is there's going to be a vote on emotion to to to invoke cloture which which is a procedural motion\nTo get it on the calendar there'll be thirty hours of debate after that passes it presumably it will and then there'll be a final vote on confirmation what what people should what what people will be talking about is even if they get\nIt if they're successful on a cloture motion on this motion to get it on the\nFloor they they may not have the votes for 'em they may not have the votes for final confirmation so I don't think you can but those those two votes aren't are not necessarily identical\nSo let me ask you this way he doesn't have the votes for the the the final vote he does he doesn't want another McCain moment that does is just get the later what happened\nWell I don't think I think most people think he has the votes today okay most people think he has the votes do and and it's so it's the it's just one of those you know this procedural vote will be an indication of how many votes he has\nAll right well center high camp I Would add this and I think you know what I'm Talking about of steel mills good job thank you thank you thank you\nThank you center Heidi Heitkamp ladies and gentlemen never been more proud to be her brother will take your calls on it you can go ahead and beat me up all you watch uh but you know what\nShe's right and for that reason alone it just makes me ... let's talk credit for the\nGirls need so he's program this year's been done\nBy free of one by one by one of another\nOne needs to\nBe rewarded with guns and you give us the rightful\nOn the walls of suburban home or ...\nOf the big up as a symbol of democracy\nAnd that's the reason he wouldn't get my call her he wouldn't get my vote he just wasn't a let's get to John go ahead John\nWell I'm sure are going to be up to ... ... ... when I got to tell you that right now I ain't heard the news last night and you know I\nThought OK idle much further to the left wing either you or your sister do okay but I Am so happy your sister did the right thing here\nI Am so happy this [noise] you know like like I said you know they they peddling conspiracy\nUm the you know a capital rent that he showed in his here and I mean I've never seen a Supreme Court nominee you know act like that in a hearing\nGetting that getting that Charlotte [noise] ...\nAnd I would add John that an an apology or I didn't mean to do that that that doesn't do it for me I I mean he is about to be on the highest court in the land\nThat coming out and saying well I I just I add raw emotions and and my family and all of this ... did I like the hearing process absolutely not to I think that her testimony should've came forward earlier I would've loved it if that happened but\nYou tell me this you listeners out there you tell me this he's about to be on the Supreme Court today he will be on the Supreme Court the you know he's going to get sworn in a little bit later I get that but today he's going to be voted on to the Supreme Court that's going to happen\nHow many people do you think are going to feel comfortable coming forward with information like Dr Ford then\nAnd this is comparable I realize she's a Fifteen year old I mean I've got a congressman that said nothing really happened anyway\nNo he he didn't get underneath are swimsuit right so that takes care of it his buddy pushed them offer that takes care of it I mean there was nothing more disgusting than what I heard Kevin Cramer say\nNothing more disgusting and and it it it\nHave straight up there with what we went through a couple of months ago when when a talk show\nGirls is fault because they had their grapes open when we had a peeping Tom running for secretary of state it was the girls is fault I mean this is right up there with that nothing happened anyway did it\nSo what would have had to happen Kevin\nWalk me through what physically would've had to happen to be something that would have caused a reaction out of view that said you know what this guy should have the job\nIt the ...\nThe hearing was a job interview for one of the most important one of the most important jobs in the judicial branch of government\nIt was a job interview and if you think job interviews they're supposed to be hugs and kisses and not tough questions and not get you know pushed to see how they react then you're not a good a job interviews\nOf job interviews or oh men do I like what you wear yeah okay that's your party OK boom you got the job if that's your idea of job interviews then you you're a whole lot different person than I Am Steven you're on news ... go ahead Steven\nAnd you know I read the news yesterday and the paper and you know I've been listening to the polls on what percentage of North Dakota wanted a cabin or to be\nAppointed and you know I Would have thought I Would at a certain stage not bad 'cause she's really representative of people ... and people were in favor of having a ... so that's the only\nQuestion I have is why they do when they're elected to represent the people why don't they represent\nSo let me let me throw this one that just even because that's an argument that keeps coming my way and I keep pointing out that in the end you gotta live with yourself when you look in the mirror brushing your teeth you got to respect the person you saw so if that's the case\nThen then what percentage of people in North Dakota do you believe\nLake and wanted these tariffs [noise]\n\nYou know I really don't know I've never done any research into it\nI think you'd find that the vast majority of farmers don't want these tariffs and I've seen some\nResent the water they two percent of the population in North Dakota in our three I don't know\nWell they matter to me I'm just going to say that but my point is this the tariffs affect them\nAnd so if congressman Kramer wants to support the tariffs which he has that means he's supporting them around the public opinion\nThat farmers have and so that's my point Steven he makes a choice and he makes the choice that doesn't fly in the face of the public he serves it gets ignored Heidi Heitkamp had to go with or God and that really doesn't\nSound to me like it's getting ignored I hear about it every night whenever I turned on the ... and you know they're they're complaining and certain guys are complaining about terrorists\nNo but the argument the argument about oh my God you have to vote with farmers think you just struggled with that Steven so thanks for your call let's get to\nJohn you're on the news is John [noise] um [noise] I um [noise]\nGet on it and I agree with the last caller that I feel the ... the ... on it [noise]\nAnd [noise] you know I Walk home site that's at listening to your health care for our show walk by them and everything and I guess [noise]\nI Know where you get when you go on Capitol Hill and that these people um that were going out with a man you know you're talking about having empathy there's got to be allowed to get fired up when they're hammering him [noise] and [noise] you know they're they're they can't even\nTrue [noise]\nJohn John can I ask you this should he should he have a different temperament should have a higher tolerance should he says the Supreme Court justice be different than you and I\nFondly but how can we can take you know or you don't you know I feel like when you let it doesn't matter yours or or or whoever whenever that disagreement Don it people get fired up\nBut we're not you're not in all due respect John nobody's going to ask you to be on the Supreme Court and me either okay and and so that the people on that Supreme Court\nBetter be able to hear something without getting up and they were grill and get non\nThank you John had a lot of feedback there and I hung with the

I'm In the from a blue state red state that I went away it was ever a blue state but you had two Democratic senators yeah um and I think there'd be a lot of your DSL numbers out there that would support democratic\nThan racket that Crestor here's my take on it here here's what changed it good times\nGood times that the Nineteen eighties when there was just to focus on the need for government to to realize what they were doing with the farm loans and the interest rates and everything else there was a need for people that weren't afraid\nTo get in there and get dirty and and make\nGovernment work the way it should work they did the work\nAnd then others came in and ... to ... reap the benefits of all that and so you know it's been good times financially now are starting to see some differences and that and and there are individuals that are starting to look at at other parties so so when they have good times they go home to mama\nOr when they don't have good times they started saying All right who who knows how to do this work who can fix it\nAnd so you know and I told my fellow Democrats and all the time that we're not a dead party were were a party that's on the shelf waiting for them to grab us when they need us again and we just have to stay stay fresh stay\nStay there and and stay stay opinionated and be there when they\nDo ... so yeah 'cause if I recall back in two thousand twelve of the farmers were doing you know the state was doing great and still do it right but you know the oil but now even the farmers the value of property the crops for up to now with the terrorists and valuation of farming you know what people want some change I think a thank\nYou Chris appreciate your call or let's get to Jim Jim you're on the news and values\nYeah I'd say they're going to take a little bit of a sub similar German was talking about the marijuana yeah and my thing is that why do we have to tax the heck out of it you know it's like\nOkay you're you want to use all how you want to use marijuana or whatever why do we got to tax the heck out of my like there's the sin taxes like you're doing something wrong but we don't we don't care if he's going to get your money out of the deal what kind of this tax the normal rate like everything else\nI you know I ... for this call\nI have been waiting for this call because I think that the the the comments of let's just tax it tax it's you know the the whole you'll make revenue off and I think it's a legitimate that yes you'll make revenue and right now it's a black market and you're not making revenue but this whole pushed to to tax the heck out of it\nYou know I'm not going to the gym I've been waiting for that call and I think that you've got a ... a great point to make you really do\nLove the people that are wanting this don't want to be taxed to death on it I mean the people if they both work in are saying we want to get government the automatic step in and say okay now we're going to take advantage of their decision\nSo let me as long as it's not just because I can tell you're going to vote yes I'm going to vote yes your circle of friends who are they going to vote\nAre pretty much a lot of people I Know are going to vote yes I think so too I think it's it's like it's like\nAnd I don't use the stop personally I never liked it but there's so many people using it now I mean they're they're all out there using it functioning completely normal they're not causing any problems that I work in health care I mean the problem we have an healthcare is with the ... and the drunks they're the biggest issue marijuana users\nAnd all the ... the most I ever see the bad that comes out to them as they come in with some times with uncontrollable vomiting and that's so rare it's ... it's just not an issue\nJared ... there's two reasons I'm going to vote yes I\nActually three I Am going to vote yes because I think it's the right thing to do and I think it's it's where we're going to go with society the second reason I'm Out of all yes just because I think our prisons are way too full of people that don't need to be there and the third reason I'm going to vote yes which is not a good reason is because I'm ticked off at 'em over what they did with medical marijuana\nAnd I think that it sends a real signal Adam so thank you Jim ... we're going to have a justice\nOn the north Dakota Supreme Court not the U.S Supreme Court the north Dakota Supreme Court joined us yet on today's show also Jeb Williams\nThat's right and wildlife division chief with the north Dakota game and fish Kelly you can call pheasants and you're already tackled\nBy the way you know already knew you could you just you know you can't call they may not think God Bless America and yet I I Would\nLove to be with you the first time pheasants flushes right underneath your feet\nSo have you ever met and there was that before not under my feet I block says in ...\nIn his early in

a top down pretty good during the majority portion of the day and so folks\nFolks with ... they're they're not even interested in you know I think that very you know kind of early morning up sundown\nType stretch for the most part they they like to be in areas when those birds are going to be tucked in the good the good at it that the good cover to be able to get those get good work out of their dog so um but yeah that's that's generally speaking what are you know what what is what a pheasant is going to be doing throughout the day\nThe only reason that they're going to be waiting there right it's set up tomorrow is because they want the spot [laughter] say well yeah that's right yeah that probably ... prong heartache you finish your coming on today\nThat was going to take care of your\nJeb Williams ladies and gentlemen always kind enough to come here on the news news radio network cows going to be out I'm going to be out will be texting each other pictures I'm sure right\nOf all that sentence there and she shoots um I Hope so because we've been talking up all week and I'm just getting the anxiety is getting higher as the weeks longer because there's pressure on me to get fat\nYou're going to do fine you're gonna do absolutely find a I'm a little nervous because I'm sitting here right next to a Supreme Court justice with all the conversations going on you know that this is a nurse Dakota Supreme Court justice that's right at least make Evers is with us right\nNow she wants the job again Lisa good to have you back on news and be as\nWell thank you Joe it's good to be or how's your race going well I I'm hoping that it's going in a positive fashion I Know that I'm working hard trying to get the word out about my candidacy and I hope that people are listening\nTo not take this the wrong way okay you know how I Know you must be doing a good job I haven't heard a thing about you [laughter] your term so far which I think that's probably a good sign\nWell well thank you a judge justice is on the north Dakota Supreme Court don't generally go looking for a notoriety or for publicity so and that's why people don't know us only have to run for election or reelection we have to get out there and worked because people don't know who we are\nIsn't that interesting though that you know on a national level things are playing out the way they are in on a local level here you know when you get on the ballot portion of that I mean the vote totals are nowhere near what they are on the executive branch does\nThey they usually are lower and that's because people don't know who we are but that is probably one of the benefits of having a an elected position versus a lifetime of appointment is that it is a nonpartisan position in so uh we don't have all that\nPolitical problems either yes and that you have with the with the United States Supreme court what do you like most about the job [noise]\nWhat I like most about the job or is really working and learning from my colleagues and uh just digging in and trying to solve the puzzle I'm I'm a person\nWho is always trying to look for the right answer and we don't get necessarily all the easy questions we get some pretty tough ones when so pushing up my sleeves and doing research\nAnd then debating that research with my colleagues as one of the most fun things that I get to do\nSo it's your job to judge you don't judge individuals' by their siblings do you\nKnow I Hope not\nHe's ... years here five or seven oh I'm One of seven okay I'm One of seven too and they're still six of us alive so I have I'm from a big family to here's what I'm building up to you know don't judge Heidi by me which I Hope most people do and I won't judge or a judge justice creditors by his brother Dave\nHow that's the deal I think it's fair to justice rather so uh\nYou know this race really comes down to talking to people getting out I saw you up at the University of North Dakota tailgate walking around meeting people shaking hands I'm sure you've done that in Fargo and other places as well what are you hearing from people\nWhat I'm hearing from people is that they don't know either who I Am or who my opponent is that they're thankful that I Am going door to door and meeting with them because I've had so many people say I never had a judge knocked on my door before and they're thankful for the information that I provide them said that they can make an educated decision\nSo the term is how long to tenure term so you win this race you're in for a long time it's it is a long time now has just expanded while doing\nUh he's great you know it's it's been such a privilege for me to get to work with the chief justice for almost five years now and I work you know as a colleague that I I worked with him somewhat before when I was a district judge as well but no it's a pleasure to work with the chief justice\nHe is he is an individual is not I mean he is one of those people that he's going to go down in the history of North Dakota I mean how long has he been on the bench\nHe's been on the court or for over forty years now if you think about that I'm no spring chicken I think I'm the one year younger than\nYou and I think you will more than one you know only one I think I live by looks up\nBut anyway he's been on the Supreme Court since I was going into my junior year in high school what's that tell you that\nI mean that I lost a step no he's not okay if people want to know more about your race or do they go\nWell they can um we have a Facebook page McEvers for justice if they want more information about what I've been doing that that's a place for them to look there's also lots of information on the Supreme Court website itself if anybody wants to look at the opinions that I've written\nOr or my separates all of that is on the Supreme Court as well as my biography about what committees and serving on her house or have done so if people want to look for information about me either look on my Facebook page or on the Supreme Court website\nJustice McEvers good to see you a thank you for coming in I Am glad you're willing to do this job so thank you
