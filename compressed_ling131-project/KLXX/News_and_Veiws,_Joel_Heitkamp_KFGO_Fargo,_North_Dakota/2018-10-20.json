what have you tried to get it off ...\nWell that's [noise] Bye bye go to the pressure was right but I don't know that you're probably taken away border I used the fresh\nAir not if you don't you know might go to on that might be a pressure washer to Dan but yeah you just got to be you know how to use a little common sense on the amount of pressure you and use from the pressure wash or what they mean by that is I probably wouldn't use\nLike if you use a twenty four hundred PSI pressure washer\nThan you used a twenty five degree nozzle and you were Eighteen or twenty four inches away from it you'll be fine unless I really had really saw brick or really solve mortar a guy I mean I'd probably go that direction but you were going to say my problem is so good [laughter]\nWell I mean by a pressure wash your up like a twenty seven hundred PS as I think that the problem still\nOkay so if you have that let's backing off to a forty degree now so\n[noise] forty degree yeah okay\nSo you're going forty degree nozzle and then you still say Eighteen to twenty inches away\nFrom it and I it it'll probably be enough pressure to go ahead and take it up you might have to play around but you'll be fine if you go to a wider\nThan a of that uh nozzle ... in terms of a cleaner oxygen needed bleach would be the cleaner you would use a United believe yeah and you hear me talk about one in there's different degrees of it\nI talk about the masonry defender dot com which is ... they have a masonry cleaner on that website which is a hog grade oxygen native bleach so if you want eggs are there\nAnd um splashing on mopping on led said about ten minutes Robin rinse\n[noise] okay All right hey thank you so much great reach a\nVery good about things they care Bye bye good point by him two really good point\nWhen you use the pressure was showing that I Love using pressure washer and people that have pressure wash or they love using pressures to ... game little toys little fun but you can do a lot damage if you don't use it properly\nSo have you have like a twenty seven hundred and they all up to like four thousand PSI\nProbably more than in [noise]\nAnd you don't want it I mean if you get thirty five hundred PSI pressure wash or twenty five degree nose will start hitting a concrete driveway your twelve to Eighteen Inches away from the concrete you actually etch that concrete [noise]\nBut if you're a twenty four hundred twenty five degree knows where he tennis or not [noise]\nNew clean it [noise]\nBut you might wanna sealed after that so you got to be just a little careful with it but you can use it you change it to a wider fan nozzle back off a little bit how close you are\nBut even if even use the water or a pressure wash your own brick inspect the brick and he said missing mortar and that is a problem you got to make sure that you don't have missing motor ever\nOn your house I got a couple of good stories about that too but a pass we'll get to Dan Dan welcome to\nThe area thanks so much for taking my call you have a great deal\nThanks user hey I Need your help here but\nI Do a lot of myself and I'm working at a you know on file crank [noise] in my\nBasement on the floor and I got about eleven hundred square feet down there\nAnd it appears to be about the crap and leveling the floor always is\nUm [noise] I don't have a problem with grinding coffee grinder on the scene and getting that but it helped me out with the level and um [noise] ... how\nAbout you how far away [laughter] it can be a big deal it can be a big deal\nYeah they're not we're not bad I\nUh the stuck on the vinyl plank is three sixteen over ten feet and I'm right on that edge I Know I have a little bit more than that or but overall I'm In pretty good shape but I Do want to get a good\nWell there is floor level lawyers that are on the market either ... or the ones you have to mix and ... and ... it's self leveling for the most part um or if you wanted to you what I usually use a two by four you get yourself an eight foot two by four used as a slow\nBefore the floor level are on there and you just run the two by four over which will spread that evenly and level it out\nOkay I Will I been guys on line that using ... and I didn't I mean that's more like car then\nYeah well you know if you've got a two by four I think that's the perfect way I mean that's the big long slow to get somebody on the other end of that and just run out over\nPerfect perfect\n'cause you know it's the floor you're put on there's you know it just needs to be level just means dirty and level and that will certainly\nAccomplished that task okay in ... and ... sometimes be way of an inch inch and a half that's a problem\nYeah yeah [noise] um how 'bout the how about the craft it's the talk cut fill that with the level or\nUm while you're going to have to it it'll probably just crack right through I mean but it'll be level right right yeah ... yeah you're going to do an older then\nI didn't know if there was a different uh [noise] uh\nOr that that salt cut their is designed to be the weakest joined us late in case you have some movement it'll crack in that crack mhm and if you put Flora level or overt it's got to correct so but that's OK you're floors can be over but you wouldn't even know will correct\nOkay so I was concerned with using that much or level in that middle crack a car car why in deep how wide early ah well the top of um they got to be a good half a course in why really got yeah\nAnd where you add alike at all that was something oh\nOkay uh any ideas you suggest\nI think what I Would do is if they are that way I just haven't seen them that way I Would get a backer rod in a backer rod is like folding rope okay that comes in different sizes half inch five age three quarters engine just push it down in there\nGet it down below the surface and then run your level or over that they'll just keep it from\nYou know going into nowhere land\nRight you won't waste the floor level or social just simply a backer rod it's called back or rod caulk saver things like that\nOkay I'm kind of almost looks like it's a tall or close to an actual ...\nOkay All right we'll still putting it won't matter just put that back or ride in there if it's real deep they'll just say from wasting the four levels [noise]\nSounds great thank you Gary
