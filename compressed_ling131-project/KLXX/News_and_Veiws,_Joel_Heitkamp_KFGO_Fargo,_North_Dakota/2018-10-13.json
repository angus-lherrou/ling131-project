S. O. in within the next two weeks every Home Depot store us and Canada will have the flight in stock is well\nOkay and um somebody says is there a phone number for the first of all I mean you you got to have the Internet in your home correct absolutely yeah this\nIs a wife I based product so you use your um use your phone's Bluetooth a feature to to set the device up but then once the device is set up then basically to devise where the cameras are connected to the cloud so you gotta have wife I for that\nRight and um yeah yeah so this is why it's a smart how have you got a whole life I for a smart TV too right you got to have a wife or yeah All right so what happens I've got my coach light I got my maximus coach light up I got a camera what happens if I have two lights by the way\nThat will ... we have another um another product called the companion light and basically all of our porch lights come with companion lights and it's the same uh actual fixture\nOr seem designed same finish\nThat are in in essence it just doesn't have a camera on it but it pairs with your life with the camera show if you've got a a left and right a light on your front door you got\nLights on your house as you walk up the sidewalk towards your your front door but you all want to map that you wouldn't have these products old man should be the same most light fixture you can do that and it's called a companion liked\nAnd I guess if you had one coach light and you actually at the camera face and towards the driveway and the other one right on the porch you could do that again\nAnd again you know limitation you can have as many with cameras as you want is that if you you know you don't always need cameras on every light but you want to have more lights that sort of match and um for the design of your home and and so forth and have the other lights where you need lighting up so we offer the companion lights um customers like that\nNow here's a question if my daughter has not in my home town and she said enough to the beach she's not gonna ever phone with her can I can I be paired with her like and camera shin I'll watch our house shores\nI mean here's a couple different ways to do that and I mean certainly um\nAny any customer can share their their log in and password with someone else that's the easy way we again then you can't take it back so right well we ... what we've offered or what we've been included in our app is called share camera where you can actually share one camera to ...\nTime and then they can see their your camera long with theirs and then you come back from vacation or whatever then you can ensure that camera\nSo it's a way to show like you're sharing contacts on your iPhone yeah men in the beauty of that is as you're not actually pass along your log in to pass where it's temporary and I'm In it and you can delete that sharing a anytime you'd like\nTo cook so what happens when a stranger or friend or foe walks up to the door and I have ... ... what happened\nSo the first thing that happens is you get a notification someone's at your door and there's another feature cold medication or I'm a greeting someone someone comes to your door you can actually have a automatically set up in the in the app you can have agreed in place for that person\nIt can be a barking dog it can be a time you can be sorry we're not interested today we've added or over the weekend we had an older Halloween greeting so you can have something seasonal and they automatically here that greedy when they walk up if you want that you know the winter and you can turn it off or on okay\nNow okay I mean I think of that and most importantly recording start okay so no matter what happens the recording starts because the motion sensor was triggered says recording starts am I watching that on my cousin and if you want okay yeah so you get that you get to like if you want to watch it live you can and if anyone is still goes to the club\nOkay and so is there\nHow long do I have access to the ... cloud to watch that\nVideo yes so depending on your level of service if you're if you don't have any kind of a paid subscription which just not required device works a hundred percent without any type of paid subscription\nThe um the video will remain in the cloud for a minimum of two hours okay if you have any kind of a paid service and they can last in the cloud for up to up to a month if you if you have some kind of an independent services very inexpensive\nAnd one of the thing I might mention to um I don't want to forget this this is very important feature\nIs that when they're recording starts um you can watch the person lived but when the clippers actually loaded of the cloud we actually put ten seconds onto the front of that video okay one of the things we've noticed is that the the beginning of the videos\nOf critical kind of the for the video so um we put ten additional seconds on the front end she's actually miss anything\nGood marketing is my guest he is with maximus lighting Randy Diane she'll please hang on I'll get your calls right on the other side of the break\nHere at home with Gary solvent [noise]\nAnd you have questions get area call I've won eight hundred eighty two three o'clock in the past have at home to carry [noise]\n\n\n\nThe holidays are just around the corner and it's time to take a look around your house but inside and out and see what you can freshman up\nUgly counter tops old pilot known him for did you know you can do it yourself and it'll be easy which spreads stone by ... coding stuff's amazing\nIt's a role on cutting that'll give you the beautiful look a stone\nI mean I don't think of the chair okay well let let the Martin Mars is actually in today marks\nReady to go with your ... question he he may I think he's got an answer\nYes so one one feature we do have um that's important is that we ... we do send the alert to your smartphone when your cameras on line or off line\nSo if the power goes out on your home no matter where you are there'll be a mess he just sent to your phone and says that the the cameras off line so at least you know that is off line for some reason which is usually it's a user either the wife dies out okay or the power's out\nBut we don't offer um any type of supplemental power at this time we get that question it's something that we're learning that\nUm interests so we don't we just pointed does need power to to operate\nInteresting he had all kinds of issues there [laughter] that's wonderful oh All right um I just had a thought and just that just ran out of my brain so we'll go to Tom\nTom welcome thank you very much a question about them if it offers any kind of a local storage you don't have the video store the cloud\nYeah so we were strictly a wife byproduct um there are other products I'm On the market lower tech products that are for local storage and um there's just so many limitations with local storage ... you know mainly the biggest says you can't really you can't really view the\nThe independent which one you have you really can't do it when you're somewhere else where you've got to fool with actual card if some sort but there is no local storage it's all it's all cloud base so this allows you to to view the activity from any place at any time in the world basically\nOkay well I just I just thought with storage tanks\nSo this allows you to to view the activity from any place at any time in the world basically\nOkay well I just I just thought with storage being fairly cheap maybe there was a way to plug it like it must be hard drive or something like that on a different note on my wife I network and that might you might be able to\nYou know that's a good that's a good to see gesture so you're saying offer an additional storage um keep it wife I base but offer some external storage that's and that's a good um it's a good suggestion I mean you can you can download the videos and for them and save them um anytime but it is a good suggestion appreciate that I write that down\nThanks some ... to go um\nNow we're going to go real anti technical okay because it's a Gary question I got all the cameras going on I got motion detectors can I just turned a porch light on first\n[laughter] that's a great question yeah so beyond the the camera functionality to video functionality it's a smart light so I'm within\nThe ... um you can um there's\nTwo things you can set a schedule for the light you can turn it off and on on demand ticket and you can also set alight schedule like dusted on or a specific time you'd like to like to go on or off\nAnd then the other the other features what you'd like to like to do in this motion you went the way to go on when there's motion all the time just at nighttime or whatever but yeah so yeah so it's a smart light in addition to having the camera capabilities\nYou can have a lot of fun with that if I Know I mean there's all kinds of features that's awesome that's awesome [laughter] All right mark kind of cut his my guess he is with smart security lights by maximus lighting we'll come back with your calls at eight hundred eight two three eight to

... or pipes from down spouse that exit out away from the foundation it's imperative that that water can get out of those pipes and a lot of times is the\nIn ground shifts and moves those pipes become blocked are clogged with either leaves\nOr any any type of debris or just soil and occasionally you got to dig goes out and make sure that water's flowing very very well away from the house so again just dig in and out putting out a little pets of maybe some rocker some the breaks up the water flow from there\nIs is a real good idea you can't let those get clogged you certainly don't want to have a washout a part of the lawn area so you can put that on your list another thing that happened to me a number of years ago\nAnd haven't really done this walk around the house but a good idea to do just that today is wherever the exhaust pipes\nAre around your home maybe from your water heater your furnace anything along those lines [noise] um the white PVC pipe does extending out just make sure that there is no I'm missing mortar around those pipes make sure it's cocked\nTightly to the brick or to the siding with every hip also briar vents those are both really really easy entry

but yeah because the the real ceiling takes place\nUm it's kind of like getting stitches versus just putting a band aid over okay yeah I got to get into that crevice area between the sighting and the window and there's that gap and then if you put in a good acrylic silken ice cooking you're getting\nIt he's you know both sides and you're not really filling it but you're getting into the two pieces that are moving if you just put it on top and then you just got a band that you haven't really filled where the cut is\nI get that currently I Can't get to get like white white\nYeah there's two types that you can use the least expensive and it'll give you probably you know eight to ten years' worth of services called acrylic silicon nice talking how\nIf you want to go with the product called ... on the quad that is the euro thing that's a polyurethane cooking which will probably last Twenty years is probably four times more expensive it's good for different mixed substrates because there was

my office round thick ... stuff uh covers everything now\nIt's kind of the seeds\nAnd I think I think you're alone yeah whatever who cares I knew what you mean [laughter]\nYou can grab it on one corner and just peel it up to and I'm I'm just wondering how the movie theater brush\nWith those three spines yeah\nWhat's the problem and going to be am I going to have to take all that stuff out

there's a whole bunch of but I you know are a whole bunch of pine needles that is a problem especially if you have like a\nReal steep roof in the saddle which I have and I've got this one section I Do almost have taken out all the time\nUm so I so I don't really know I I you know I mean it is a potential if it's fine and it's sticking in laying on the roof it may lay on that brush and if it lays on that brushing gets tangled ... she was leaves and stuff to win cleans it out\nYou know I don't I don't know if it'll do with that\nI doubt it but um [noise] I don't know it was a time when you're worried about that but I mean ... years old now and you are going to be difficult to get up to the staff not up to any more so I just wondered um before I commit to it if maybe I should uh\nWell how big of a gun or do you have their Roger\nOh I've got five inch in ... and it goes showing all four sides of the house okay um\nIs there a certain area of lengths where there would be more than anything else because they have us they have a sample pack and I think it's just like six feet long um but maybe you just want to try and one gutter and just see\nIf I could do that I mean I Do know the more to one hundred percent\nOkay look at it and it's for any reason it's not going to work they'll definitely get your money back okay well that's that's really what I Need you know yeah the case\nIt's relatively inexpensive for what you're trying to do versus helmets and it's a hundred percent guaranteed and I mean I give it a try I mean you can you really can't lose maybe a little bit of time\nOkay I'll give it a shot All right good to know Roger thing\nLike air but by yeah ... yeah that real find stuff can be tough I mean even they say maybe every couple of years you might have to shake it out and this one section I Do\nTom welcome [noise]\nHey Tom Bulgaria yeah yes how are you good\n[noise] ah just bought a house got granted tops got to same and the top one is [noise] field

[laughter]\nI'm a\nWidow wires yeah can you get your fingernail and it oh yeah definitely it's bigger than that can you get a pencil within it a ... yeah well I say\nYes it was it was one of those things when I Walk through we were looking at the top or the house was looking at a lot of other things so I really\nI'm not saying down it it's almost like a camp for at the top ... man when it goes down it gets tighter so I Would say we're probably less than a pencil lead down that or the other side seems like it had some sort of a filler and\nYeah well what do they do is I'm guessing and I will talk uh we got Lenny from granted go coming in so uh listen for all your granted questions but I Will ask him I think it's a mixture of ground granted dust\nAnd some stuff that is very very smelly [laughter] ah\nThat's mixed in an almost almost like a proud in product not something that you're going to just you know liquid that you're going to put in there but I'd have to live in\nA hot or the

had ... points Lenny we need boys now ceiling it really is not a big process this is easy\nYeah feeling is a\nYou know we have a water bases are that's easy for the consumers to do them so they don't have to wear any special gloves masks or anything it's a neutral ph\nAnd um it's always good working sections when you seal stone because if you spray it on the tire countertop me come back and try to\nWipe it down it's going to dry on the surface before you work at an event that happens especially with darker stone you get this like Hayes on top of the surface which will come out with you know react the sealer using half its own but kind of a pain to do with that way so I always suggest do like a three foot section\nBut to see their on their way to Terry cloth working in the stone flip the cloth over buff till dry moved to the next section and kind of go down to counter tops that way\nAnd folks that really are like me and all about it you know granted gold is making a a three step process even easier yeah you guys get a lot of white so\n[noise] yeah you know when we talked about the the cleaning shy of trying to make things more convenient easier um\nWe didn't launch this was kind of a first for the industry is a we have three different wipes we have cleaner and the first and only see the white stone countertops in the civil rights are great cars pull out of out of the er at a pouch\nWiped the carrot top down buffet dry with a paper towel her claws them you're done and it's actually the most cost effective way to seal your countertop so a pack a sealer will raise anywhere from nine Ninety nine to fourteen Ninety nine\nSo to counter tops for ten to Fifteen dollars is heard of it in the industry and that\nLeans seals in polish is\nSo we have three separate white so we have one for cleaning one per ... yeah I mean we even have a polish wipe\nYeah there you go [laughter]\nYeah it is I mean maybe it doesn't get any easier and so we're to folks get together and a gold um products\nSo um if you go to our website and got her start located or you could find that you're looking for a specific products are but we do have like our core items leaders who are polish is a naturally and Home Depot and Lowe's um ace hardware\nI'm Joe how are we carry all of our products were in a lot of grocery\nUm we're actually just a really live probably this week next week a with a clear polish in public\nUh grocery stores here I was a that was very cool and um yeah\nIn the ah the wipes me we are in a in a hardware and in a very hard work a lobster and we're also in a Wal Mart with are clear in our Korea trying\nVery good now tell me about courts does it it doesn't need ceiling correct or does it\nCorrect I'm so court is still around Ninety three percent natural course material and then seven percent of rather than a proxies\nAnd it it is man made but it's with natural materials that you don't need to feel it because the absorption rate is so low but you still need to clean it you'll get polish it um you also you don't want to use a any\nHarsh chemicals cause it's still like ... percent natural materials so we actually just launched court spray courts bright is a two and one clear college where your core it's kind of cops and at the civil made for courts\nBecause it's so dense that or does it absorb so we have to work with a formula to make it or didn't streak on court said it was easy to use [noise]\nExcellent so here's another question I have an ... if you don't mind maybe they can hold you over for five minutes or so um when people make an investment in a granite or courts countertop I mean I used the word investment because it is\nA even if it's a small countered up I mean this is not cheap right I mean and it's one of the most in demand things for a home people want granite countertops there were ... cords counter tops either for the island or for the back cooking area or for the bathroom vanity\nAnd with that big investment and something happens to it a\nThat's a big problem in a you know are you folks got a protection plan and I want to get into that so can\nYou hold on for a second sure All right we'll take a little
