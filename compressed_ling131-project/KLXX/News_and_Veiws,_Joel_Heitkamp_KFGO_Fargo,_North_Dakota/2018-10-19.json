Peterson when we come back [noise]\n\nSeats digging deeper with the most of your company the show where two economy experts take your questions about crop intrusion your your hosts we'll focus on raw spender senior a growing up I was growing up what was your company [noise]\nHi this is Kirk and this is Ross and today we're answering the questions you've sent us on social media just when it comes in from Twitter what's the best product on the market for boosting sulfur levels boosting sulfur levels in the soil is actually fairly difficult\nFinal bill if you have thirty five forty I'm Democrats in the Senate and voting for the final bill it'll never pass the house and if you have a meal like they did in the house that has all of you know just a handful of Democrats it'll never pass the Senate\nAnd so what you need is needed to get to a place where thirty five Democrats in the Senate are going to vote against the bill\nAnd Seventy conflicts in the house are going to vote against the bill and then we'll make up the difference that's where we need to get ... you have to go with ... always going to have to go tell people\nThat he's going to have to back off and stuff that he told him he was going to do and stuff and I was going to have to go to some of the senators and say we got to be able to do what we said we were going to do these are senators that have really no I'm up farms and you know no agriculture but it's not going to be a Christmas tree right you know and\nAnd the sap stuff uh you know there's a lot of integrity put into the system and the Senate\nAh there's more that could be done or the problem with this is not work\nWe've had work requirements since Nineteen Ninety six\nThe problem is in that the legislation we said to the administration you could ride rules to determine um whether there should be waivers are not for the for places that have high unemployment and difficulty employing people\nSo we gave them Broadway their authority and so what they did is they ah one through rulemaking [noise]\nAnd they had a came up with the system you know to give our waivers and so the reason that the only reason that people are working is because they're in a waiver areas you know and so that's it so I said it ... months ago I said\nLet's work on the waivers you know there are abuses going on in the waivers you know and there's things that are ... you know the whole state of Illinois is a waiver the whole state of California the whole state of New York Louisiana New Jersey but why do you see are waivers you know a half of Minnesota is a waiver\nAnd the Trump Administration extended these waivers since they've been in office at the same time they're campaigning against them [laughter]\nYou know so I mean so that we need to do with the Senate did and we need to work on these waivers that's the that's what needs to happen you know but this is not age I'm honest debate because this is politics\nAnd you if you talk to people and say well you know if they're on welfare they should work sounds reasonable\nThis is politics and you if you talk to people and say well you know if they're on welfare they should work\nSounds reasonable right mhm yeah and I'm for people work and that's the best thing you can do you know for somebody you know give them dig that they have a job\nBut that's you know the issue is not that we don't have work requirements the issue as we've had these waivers you know and are there in areas where jobs are tough to get them frankly a lot of people in snap are they can get a job somebody will hire\nHim so al and a lot of people in snap aren't individuals that have the ability to do a job you know that's what I mean and so they are and and the other part of individuals in snap what you've said sitting in that chair to me many times which is I don't think people understand that the percentage of elderly yeah veterans now\nWe're not doing anything well I mean we are doing with the elderly because once they want to do they want to the end of the work requirement so we've had since Ninety six then I Want to expand that to people that are fifty to sixty\nSo we all have a system that's not working on the way it should so they want to double down on this and they have these people that are fifty to sixty well if you get laid off at fifty five sixty and you're not in good shape financially you know and you need to go apply for food stamps\nIt's not going to be very easy to get a job I Know that that is\nYou know but here's my point in and saying elderly is that this image people have\nIs that they want to draw in their mind they don't want to know but my point is they they they want they want the public to perceive snap this way I deal with that with my Congress now he wants you to think of snap this way right when in fact it's much more in depth and it involves much more than one of the meetings\nThat I had with the chairman and his staff or I was trying to you know get them to be reasonable and and I said you're not going to get to build on the way you're going about this you know we have to understand what the Senate's going to win and you know and they said when I brought up these issues and they said well you're right\nBut the perception is that's not what it is I mean the perception is people are working and I said okay so now we're going to legislate perceptions [laughter] so I mean it's just\nSo you know so that was not perfect but at the other thing is that we won't get a farm bill without it because if you don't have always been the case if you don't have the urban people getting something out of this bill\nThere is no way we're going to get a farm program that's going to do the job\nBut you're also playing games with snap knowing that that's the coalition you need for a farm bill at the same time that is because if you're looking at long range planning as an egg producer\nYou're looking at federal crop insurance which you're lenders telling you gotta have federal crop insurance you already got that hurt All right Bye bye that's permanently authorized so that does not need a farm bill to give up my point is that\nYou've got people out there saying why do we do is just like a no different than why are we to subsidizing soybean farmers in either going to be\nFor terrorists than by God we shouldn't have to subsidize them per Bush will in fact we should have drug tests on them and work requirements on them I get those phone calls ... to head on and it's like okay so this is the mentality the mindset that we're at right now\nThen you fast forward the trade issue\nAnd the perception I get from farmers when I was down at at Walmart South Dakota yesterday\nThey were sitting there talking about the ... market where they're going to put them who's buying them who storing them and that the plain and simple answer I got from five different farmers was there not moving in you know and if\nHaven't shoulder beans you know you're not probably going to be able to sell them you're going to have to you know finding in this market especially of her in the north and South Dakota and even west or Minnesota because those beings we're going west the nod markets shutting down and then all of it\nEspecially if we're in North and South Dakota and even western Minnesota 'cause those beings we're going west than that market shut down\nAnd then all of it has no matter what it all you know\nIt's a big problem it's a big problem and you know how long this is going to go on you know I don't know but\nThe interesting thing for me talking to the farmers yesterday was that they seem to realize that if that the terrorists in with China tomorrow if all of this you know kind of fighting and we're paying the price for other industries if if that ends tomorrow it isn't gonna bring these markets back this year\nNot no no well you know some of them might come back but uh they're not going to be moving them that was what they continually sent me and told me that they now the elevators\nI've got an immoral I'm going to be down in a you know in Travis County to talking to the elevator down there to you know find out from you know they're kind of close to the border whether it's affecting them the same way some of these elevators or on the other side of the district had been shifting over to the Mississippi\nBut now that's clogged up that whole system [laughter] you know so it it's um I mean I understand why the president's doing this and China is not a good player but the when we should have dealt with this was when we brought trying to end of the WTO because we knew what China was doing\nAnd I voted against it and the reason I voted against it was because of what's going on because if you want to do business in China\nYou gotta set up a company you got to give the Chinese government fifty one percent of it that's the deal then that was a deal we signed the thing back when we brought him into the WTO we let them do that and that's why I voted against it you know so now they're making a big issue out of this and rightly so it's not fair but we agreed to it\nYou know and so they're trying to use these tariffs to get China to change\nI don't think it's going to happen I Hope I'm wrong but I just don't see it\nAs well and and everybody who talks to me about it is like well they've got to get it I said China isn't cap you know they're not capitalist if they look to a gym next year you're not going to eat pork I mean ... you know I can do if you're eating pork you are not going to eat pork as they get into public isn't gonna rise up and say we want our pork now that isn't how China where\nYou know it's a bad All right we're going to take your phone calls at one eight hundred hated oh five

Ninety One you did something back then that I thought was just\nI don't know if you remember but our in our transportation autumn and was forced into bankruptcy thinks the metropolitan federal um fiasco yup and it was taken over there to see right and they never missed their parents did everything right all the people it represented them\nIf they would come down to federal court orders falls

it matters to folks let's get to a let's get to Bob you're on about go ahead [noise] [noise] yeah yeah\nThe morning all\n... all the congressman who's been fantastic one ... one of the few people that I visit without lose two that are truly was part of that seven and you've seen that as we pass found out\nI Would have come to the certainly an issue\nUh those beans are already a missed opportunity the trains have been sold off\nA when I've been missing a couple of weeks ago a senator I kept them for two weeks since you're trained at length to the west coast with us soybeans or the Chinese have already bought the elsewhere or it's going to be probably a year before we look to this even if the Tara was she was taking care of your own place I\nThink about you know and that's that's the unfortunate thing it's um this is a self inflicted\nWound that was not necessary you know um and I I just\nYou know they some people say that the president's got some kind of strategy here that's going to be good but I just don't see it\nI Hope I'm wrong you know I Hope\nThat there is some strategy there that's going to make it you know make this a win but I just don't see here's what I keep challenging farmers with defined that when if you're in a production because there were no tariffs on Sunday night there were none\nWhen would be we got the tariffs off what China was putting on our side I Will not just a calling it either yeah they weren't doing it so so my my point is is if you are a farmer what do you hope to get out of these tariffs\nOh you're not going to use ... and the only thing you're going to get is going to be negative you know so the NAFTA renegotiation we were concerned about that\nBecause at one time there was some stuff on the table or whatever theory the Mexico marketing dairy ah I didn't believe the Canadians we're ever going to give up anything on their supply management you know and at the end of the day\nThat it it was exactly what I said it was going to be we got a little bit of market access on the tea argues\nAnd we've got a little bit of of um I don't know what you want to call it the ability to challenge the last seven stuff so that they don't dumped the excess powder end of the world market at a loss\nA show on you know it was I'd say just out of school that you know and so the president claims as these huge when you know maybe it is for cars I don't know but\nFor agriculture we just held her own then we're just glad that we do go backwards you know\nThe eye on some of her up I just don't see I mean I Know what they're trying to do they're trying to get back the jobs\nThat went to China and the folks in Ohio and in those states worst upset because they lost their jobs you know Twenty years ago now they're upset and this was the first person that came along for running for president took up their position do and he won the election over that [noise]\nSo he's following through the problem is two hundred people and try to move to the city\nTo fill those jobs for a million people\nYou know and what happened we got that market an agriculture\nThat's what we we gained all those years allowing you're showing me a a it's a\nCongressman are always good to talk yeah thank God every time you get your plane he got a hundred more people to visit [laughter] the district as long as you know that's why I have sort of playing out right and he flies it just isn't any staff let me tell you that [laughter] I've seen it so\nWhen we come back what are we going to do are going to take your calls and that's what we're going to do are going to find out what you thought of what the congressman said we're gonna play some clips from last night's debate about trade and we'll let you comment on that as well so more coming your way here on ... [noise]\nYou know we're finding out that a lot of new members of our bell bank family are farmers and if you're one of those you have made a great choice folks are built bankers who specialize in egg\nAh you know I Want to play this clip because trade matters you just heard congressman Peterson talking about that and the debate that happened last night between senator Heitkamp and congressman Kramer involved a trade and so ah Kelly are you ready for me let's let's take a listen to this\nFight fight fight for our farmers this is a huge difference between time congressman Kramer and myself\nFrom the very beginning I could see that these terrorists were going to have a very dramatic a negative effect on North Dakota farmers that's why I immediately went and said we cannot do this I talked to light a Robert Lighthizer I talk to the secretary of\nOf agriculture I have been you know I I used to say I'm the teeth that you're about these tariffs because they are so wrong for North\nDakota we spent Thirty years building a market we're going to lose it in a year we have to not only grow other markets because we found were too dependent on China but we have to recognize that if we're not trading internationally in North Dakota\nAre egg products we will not be successful on a farm this terrorists these terrorists are going to decimate a very critical and important market for one of our most important cash crop soybeans\nSecond All right so way back in March when there was first talk of this I wrote to the secretary of agriculture asked them to come up with the mitigation plan should a long term trade or come back on farmers so that we could have a mitigation plan to get through the short term he did that and those payments have gone out the first half\nI also attended and testified the only member of Congress from North Dakota to testify not once but twice that us trade a U.S PR hearings and\nI'll tell you one thing I haven't done I haven't spent with China against our farmers I understood with Canada against our farmers I haven't stood with Mexico against our farmers when our president picks the tools he's going to use\nI think we're obligated to stand with the United states of America the best way down to trade more quickly is to be unified on our side none of the other side that's why I'm so grateful that eighty eight percent North Dakota's export markets\nCanada and Mexico have a new deal that South Korea we have a new deal that this week alone us you are is identified has notified Congress of a new negotiation with Japan European Union United Kingdom and I'm Glad there\nOn their way right now to China thank you congressman Kramer is um is a little late on the news I can tell you that\nThe you right now is pulling out of the deal and the deal with Japan won't include agricultural products so let's not overstate what is actually happening here in fact Congress and Kramer almost blew the one provision that was critical in the new NAFTA which was the green grading provision by speaking very rudely about our Canadian neighbors\nWe have to bring diplomacy we after being the right kind of trade authority and let me tell you this trade policy\nI don't care what anyone says is going to decimate our foreign markets for the long term if we aren't careful and if we're not fighting back and if we can't ...\nI'm Sorry that's where they cut you off ... and obviously Heidi brought a lot of passionate argument congressman Kramer stated his position which which I respect his position is quite clear\nThat when it comes to these tariffs and it comes to trade he stands with President Trump a hundred percent of the time Heidi is made that argument that she wasn't in the state where Donald Trump is incredibly popular and all these polls are coming out that show her that she's behind maybe that's why I don't know what I Do know is one of those two is right\nOkay one of the two is right which one do you think is right because to me\nFor me personally and I ... I'm not putting that this credit out there that disclaimer out anymore here here's the thing\nHeidi's right Heidi is right it is not easy it is it you are not against your country it is\nEverybody's talking about you got to be patriotic well you're going to be patriotic who's going to be patriotic for the farmers there so it isn't like I've got to support my president I've got to support them even when he does something wrong\nThe biggest problem with congressman Kramer is he doesn't have admitted did something wrong he did there was no diplomacy used when it comes to the China deal this was about Ohio Pennsylvania\nAnd Merrill or ah Michigan okay congressman Peterson just pointed that out those three states elected Donald Trump they did so they're like Donald Trump what happens\nWell they get what Donald Trump promised them to his credit President Trump does\nWhat he says he's going to do he keeps pushing for a wall that's as ridiculous as you could possibly get but he keeps pushing for it and it keeps pushing for it because he said he was going to do it I actually respect that part of um what I don't respect as what he says he's going to do so\nFast forward that to this trade issue\nRight you want to make them happy and you want those steel jobs back those steel jobs the steel jobs right what what cost the vehicles went up a new motor home I just bought went up that's a business expense that went up I get all of that\nYou know that's all in the name of boy we're going to have tariffs on steel we're going to do this that as the ... implement dealers ask them the manufacturers whether or not it went up it went up\nOne of the ones paying the price for this we're the ones paying the price all betting on the come that some jobs are going to come back to an area where it was promised in it's unpatriotic\nCongressman Kramer says if you point that out if you point out that these tariffs are not good for egg and that you would have used diplomacy and that some of these deals that you're bragging about in fact aren't really happening and some of these deals that you talk about really didn't do anything different than what you had in the first place\nWell then you're you're unpatriotic because you have to stand with the president a hundred percent of the time because if you stand with China will who the hell said you're standing with China\nBecause you have to stand with the president a hundred percent of the time because if you stand with China will who the hell said you're standing with China\nWho said that\nI don't confuse standing with China versus standing with us soybean farmer you can stand with us soybean farmer and still find a way to do business with China those are two completely different things completely\nDifferent things and if you're worried about the cost of your new DVR machine or whatever the heck is called DVD whatever but if you're worried about the cost of that\nDeal with it negotiations talk about it deal with the individuals whose technology is being lost and find out what they're doing to make sure that technology has lost if you're dealing with the average Joe out there who's wearing a hat right now flip your head over and see if it says made in China\n[noise] you're already dead right it says made in China\nAnd still talk to the business that bought the hat put their name on it and asked them why they didn't buy American right we can talk about all these things what we can't ignore is the fact that some people are out there trying to say it's unpatriotic to not support these tariffs\nAnd when I pointed out last night Heidi one she want on this one\nThat's one that pushed me over the top that's what you're going while you're going to vote friday anyway well wait a second I'm going to vote for Heidi I Know that but when I'm watching this debate because this is what I Do for a living I'm going man this is what I'd say here that's what I and as soon as like what just shut up\nThis isn't about you I'm watching a debate here and she was right I get that but\nOnce you got to the tariffs and she talked about the terrorists I was like thank God
