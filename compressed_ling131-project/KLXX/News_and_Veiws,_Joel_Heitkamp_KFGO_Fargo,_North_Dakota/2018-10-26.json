Steve you're on the news and means hey Joel how are you a sport I'm doing very well it's friday\nGood it's amazing something I agree and you're going to work at it like the first comment but you're probably not collect my question to the candidate going to do it but anyway um I I totally agree is that this bombing things a nightmare you know and and obviously nobody wants to get you know a PVC pipe full and lord knows what you know male to you\nThe the reality is though it in in in your comment is whoever is doing this doesn't seem to be very bright you know we get and or very good at making them which is the good news because inherently they're probably not as dangerous as they could be doesn't mean it's you know I I'm not trying to downplay the fact that some moron is selling is sending bombs it's just\nI think they're going to get caught and we'll find out who it is and what their motivations are and the people that are running down all these ...\nConspiracy what questions do you get your question my\nQuestion would be if someone on your campaign staff\nIs caught on videotape contradicting\nA significant portion of what your campaign ads are telling the people of North Dakota would they be immediately fired\nThat's a fair question it's a really fair question thank you Steve I appreciate that I Know that there was an incident on the high camp campaign where some young staff workers or were caught or they were caught basically out there drinking beer trying to I'm trying to get to know some gals and they were set up\nAnd they were set up by these gals in these supposed journalists out there saying something that they had no knowledge whatsoever up\nI mean that they're trying to look like big shots and I think if they're out there I'm having been on a date I think we can all understand the motivation they might have been using a ... you know what the goal was okay can we say that\nUnfortunately a lot of guys say things to impress at a time like that are in this one had some high in the name of journalism which it really wasn't some double the good thing I can tell you what I'd answer\nThey wouldn't be fired I mean they wouldn't be fired they'd be told to go away go home you're not working on a campaign uh you you can maybe work on policy or something like that but you know grow up a little bit because you don't speak for me is that so I'd answer it I'm let's get to Larry Larry you're on the news the news\nYeah the first question out at the Kramer is he's been in the I think he's been in the house for six years\nThat I I think that those questions are valid as well um if you are individuals that that right now I mean right now if the top priority is overturning roe v way do you have the for for how many years now you had that the house\nYou had a the Senate you've had the presidency and you've had the Supreme Court that the majority of individuals on the Supreme Court have been Republican for a long time now and that goes back to the Bush administration so that is a fair question if you preach it all the time to get boats then why aren't you doing it\nWhy aren't you introducing that legislation the other thing I think that Heidi Heitkamp and others are bad at\nAnd I do think there are bad at this is they don't explain what they mean in regards of what Planned Parenthood and how you deal with birth control issues\nI think that they need to to speak to that issue defend that issue and explain why they are where they are when it comes to that because it it is an issue that polarized as people oh let's go to Andrew you're on news news Andrew\nA one question I'd look them both at say is a sense we really didn't get much action out of the u._s. NCA are they both willing to re implement country of origin labeling and stand up for an America First policy\nThis goes back to ... when you say that I always think of you know our calf versus the documents association this is a fight that the people that raise cattle never really sell a settled themselves doing\nWell it's kind of like the trade war with China there's there's groups that support the president's policy and there's groups against it\nI mean in any kind of policy like that you're going to find lots of groups for and against what we call the trade is to have American beef label product of usa go I and I told that had nothing to do it the border\nBut I what I'm mad about this whole deal is that why to Canada have the right to come into America and change an internal policy and then have the right take that to the WTO\nThat was such a farce and if this administration is a ... first policy I I Can't see why we wouldn't get on that\nAnd I play in both parties sport because in the Obama administration was repealed with the twenty fifth the end of this bill and both Kevin Cramer and Heidi Heitkamp voted for but ever since then we've seen the decimation of our cattle industry I mean so we were selling cattle for two dollars and thirty pounds before that\nTwo years after we repeal that we're getting a dollar twenty and there was no twelve dollar or twelve billion dollar bailout for us cattle producers we don't hold the suck it up quick making so much beat\nSo Andrew ... you know I don't argue with any of the points you just made my argument that the two to thoroughly understand what you're going through what role has the Packers made and all this\n[noise] [laughter] they're the ones that are supporting keeping the country of origin all because they are cattle cheaper at the other country\nThat's my point I wanted you to say that because the meat ... there are the biggest obstacle to getting down to what you see on the shelf knowing where it came from on the shelf knowing that Andrew grew it\nRaised it is probably a better way of putting it in and then I can take it home to my table and know that I bought the rib eye steak for man Andrew ... the meat Packers and the biggest obstacle to that\nI understand the politicians can fix that but you know what I'm getting at here Andrew\nYeah it it it's the best and and the same thing with pork or our our industry is that with fresh pork imports from Poland\nSwine flu going wrap it in all and all it puts our livestock industry at risk by\nBringing these important in the same with football is he that Brazil it's these are policy changes we get that Sonny Perdue could make by closing the border and saying wait a second year in effect the country working all it here I got there are too afraid to even do that at the border\nI got you Andrew great points thanks for calling in let's get to Tom tom you're on ...\nYeah I Do um as far as I'm and I like that both candidates are basically the same question but the court for lectures and confirmation and that that would be more important to them and how they feel about a balanced court\nI mean the uh the court system very much out of balance straight do and to be fair to the country and people in the country but we're supposed to be sort of ... president third party\nI like to see what they think is most important and why\nAnd then I guess one other question would be at first when you talk about the farmers and stuff like this how long are they going to continue say they're going to still supporting the farmers when there's a great deal for less money or there's going to keep losing money a year after year next year they're not going to have enough money to plant a\nYou know I don't think they've been figured out that way too I mean they have the money appropriate but do they have a way to supplement these people these farmers and ranchers\nI got ... I get your point I I get the the first one we can speak to and we well or the second one to me is really starting to build which is the general public that it that through their tax dollars pays into the farm program\nThese individuals that don't farm keep saying the same thing to me when I'm Out and about if they support a policy why in the world do I have to support them\nSome you know\nLove where I live I've got fresh air and it's great being from my back porch people think it's hard to get back to the Internet out here but the truth is it's easy to use that\nWherever you live you can get high speed Internet right at home using that satellite Internet which means you can get anywhere\nIt's made for people like me it's super fast and comes with built in life I can I can sit back and enjoy the sunset while I shop pay bills on line or chat with my family and friends he's also comes with unlimited data and no hard data limit and here's the best part\nIt happened six years ago when foreign communications did it it it happened then and it didn't work then\nHeidi Heitkamp one then and the forum had this ridiculous moment where they looked like the Chicago Tribune where they're sitting there and and Heidi Heitkamp holding up a paper that says Rick burgers they had like ten percent and and the reason for that\nFrom old man Marcial was pretty simple he wanted you to not vote\nHe wanted you to think the election was over well that's where it Garland is doing\nI mean that's exactly what gardens doing and and I I feel bad for the pure journalists there because there are some there are some good good people working there and they're being put in a position where they have to at times carry this water\nThese buckets of water or for for a little like and it's not fair it's really not let's get to Carl Carl you're on news it'd be a scratch off\nA lot of employers user IV cry or your name and a perfect courteous number outcome that or I'd like to know what the candidate for think making\nA all new hires an existing workers would have to go through a quiet thrill simpler non biased and uh that would probably help on or eliminating illegal workers or even illegal logging\nWetter obsession wouldn't be on getting either a quiet prayer we're all workers\nIs that your answer to illegal immigration Carl yeah okay let me give you mine it minds even more simple ready anytime you have a legal immigrants if you have even something like an e verify any time you know an individual knows they have a legal immigrants throw him in jail for ten years\nTen years yeah it's an automatic mandatory minimum sentencing or jail for ten years because if you want a shutdown illegal immigration in this country shut down a chance for employment in this country the vast majority of people coming into this country living under a sub culture\nAre coming here to help their families and they're coming here to work and if you want to stop them\nThen two things need to happen number one\nNumber one you need to put in jail the people that are hiring them because many of them know they're hiring illegal aliens\nThere's a lot or they they know Carl they absolutely\nAre are also railroads crying or is it raised the fried and it's a small to slap\nAnd the wrong when you buy and then if they can't they can't work 'cause I like the court or so back to their own concrete\nWants to find all they're gonna do it that Carl is they're going to look at a ... they're going to look at it and say you know what I can say this much on wage I can say this much I'm not paying fighter I can say this much on and if they find me this my check that I'm Still gonna come out hole and they're not going to ... you know forget that\nWhen you look at those individuals who hire illegal aliens\nAnd you say listen you're going to go to jail if we catch illegal aliens working for you you're going to go to jail you do that and all the e verify in the world will be tools used to make sure\nThat these people aren't illegal\nThe employers will require that\nIt it it doesn't need it they'll do anything they can\nTo and and don't take this excuse of well I didn't know or or or you know what what I did was I I talked to somebody else and they sent me contract employees you know what who are you contracting with\nYes I'll go after the individual that sense you contract employees that's priority number one then but priority number two is for me to look inside your operation and really find out whether or not what was going on and you do that ladies and gentleman you get after them that way a lot of this will change\nBought what America doesn't want to admit with that whole sub culture of illegal aliens working is that we need them\nThat if you've rounded them all up tomorrow two things are going to happen wages are going to go up\nAnd unemployment is going to go way down which means that you're going to pay more [laughter] and the truth of the matter is you're not going to try you're not going to find the employees you need you're not going to find the people that do the type of jobs that you need done\nAnd at some point we as Americans need to look at ourselves in the mirror and be honest about what these people are doing [noise]\n... there are so many people screaming if their radio not right now and saying they're dealing drugs they're murderers their rapists they're all that you know what some of them probably are and some of the white people you're talking about probably are I'll be really curious about this bomber this terrorist that's doing this I'll be very very curious about this\nOkay a ... and I have no idea of this bomber or bombers ethnicity I don't but I'll be really curious about it so yeah you can sit there and say all these things and accused them of this but we're talking about the the ... both sides agree it could be as high as ... eleven\nMillion people [noise] eleven million people\nWhere do you think they are they're not on the welfare rolls they can't be\nThey get caught and deported that's just a cold hard truth you know what they're doing they're working many times for cash many times under an ID that
