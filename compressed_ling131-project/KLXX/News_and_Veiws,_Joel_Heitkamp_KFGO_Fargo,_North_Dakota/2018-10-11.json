have you back on the news the news\nOr what are you seeing out there\nAnd all of the worst of what we have is out now Barnes county area on the interstate system and then as you get either sell for North of there as we're the biggest heaviest bands of stolen through yesterday I think they're talkative bird came to Seventeen inches of snow in some areas and it still is very ... or ... or what an heavy yesterday\nAnd it created like cop acted ice on the roadway so are due to the best they can do to try and break that stuff up so you're not the most difficult driving conditions today and that Barnes county into the eastern stuff's been county area a south if people will slow down give yourself extra time when you travel through there\nOr were still pulling a semi they'll they'll have gone in yesterday so they're going to be some areas where we're troopers working alongside the road so give them space you know if you see lights up ahead of you they'll\nSlow down when he got on top of that was flown out prior to getting close to them or she can react to whatever's going on when you when they get their did anybody get hurt in this\nSo it's still a lot of records were being called yesterday for just cars and semis that we're going off the roadway\nYou know I think probably close to a hundred vehicles that were uh the guy off in the ditch between starts men Barnes of the ... county yesterday and today it probably about twenty to twenty five of those were crashes so I sound considerable amount of work going on yesterday\nI don't doubt it and that's why we we appreciate these these updates these weather updates from birds a truck equipment home of birds snowplows because that matters as well but I kept a\nYou know when I was talking to some individuals they said like the valley city hill on I Ninety four the semis couldn't get up at uh did you hear anything like that\nYeah we had a case yesterday for about an hour and a half on on a forest close in that valley city or the valley area there because we are trucks that were jak math on the hills just because of that goes ice conditions and it continued into last night there's there's hills east to west valley city as well there are some of the trucks were having trouble on\nUm it's it's you know it's one of those things were way I Know a travel advisory and when we push push those things out there is a reason for that because we don't want people out there because of conditions that aren't safe for people to be driving and then when people are driving it creates issues like semi jak laughing now we have road closures\nAnd uh that's what was going on yesterday and through last night and it's just it becomes very difficult for the deal for us to respond where to do our best while we're out there\nUh but people need to understand is that we can't get to everybody right away and we're not going to get everybody pulled out right away as well so if you don't have to be out there in those conditions when we put that out there we we we ... we we don't just put those out there because it's not only put that up there because it's conditions that are not safe for you to be out there\nYeah and I think people need to hear he'd that because of the reports I'm getting your just enormous so captain un thank you thank you for for answering when we call and thanks for giving people the update\nAppreciate the time yeah captain brand new and ladies and gentlemen love to get some snow reports from individuals\nI you know it's it's that phase right I mean\nWe've been hit it we've all been getting rain prior to this and and the rain didn't shut off a prior to this and then have a big snow incident in\nIn a big part of our listening area and power outages and everything it takes for these people to get power back on in fact\nYou know I mentioned the fact that they've got to go they've got to inspect these lines a sense have found out that one of the individuals that that you know this happened to\nOne of the overturned vehicles was alignment out inspecting lines so I when I say it it takes a team to get everything working I mean it\nThe whether that's the ambulance providers whether that's people out there who fight fire you know the bad times compound and when bad things happen it takes a while to to get things right and you have to get where you're going\nAnd that the men and women who move this snow as captain the un said they they do everything they possibly can\nAnd and I've always had a bias yes I get that I I Know these people I that I count many of them as my friends and and I've always stuck up for him I always point out what they get done for us\nBut to close the shops is wrong\nIt's wrong we need them we absolutely need them and we need them out there as quick as we can and and let me share with you one of the more ridiculous comments\nThat I could get it and it just shows the hyper partisan nature when I when I say call the governor of three to eight twenty two hundred it's not because he's a Republican although I Would say ... it could do something more because he's in the majority is\nIt used to be closed in his backyard but but what I'm saying is that ... works for you give them a call do what you can to fix this\nSo I did I get a text message like this typical liberal blaming the voting of a conservative governor I don't see where any liberals ever done their job very well I'm reading it as you wrote it done their job very well all they do is get the mob mentality and complain\nA ... and maybe the real reason why some road crews in the states are doing their job instead of pointing fingers\nSo he says\nMentality and complain maybe find out the reason why some road crews in the states aren't doing their job instead of pointing fingers\n[noise] so they're not doing their job that's your position your position is that\nThese men and women in the north Dakota highway department that that's easy to do when you're sitting there writing an anonymous\nText message right go up to one of them\nTalk to them about it [noise] so you know what I don't think you're doing your job I think you're lazy I think we need the

I mean people are going to have to come back how many heated the warning and did evacuate Rob\nI think a lot of beach all a lot of people had to have left otherwise the death toll would be higher so people actually paid attention and I think\nThe TV coverage of other storm there is more Fifteen now the patriots so many more news sources even you know what the president calls the fake media everybody's taking pictures of different damage\nThat is finally gotten into the psyche of people who is that you know what I don't want to die I'm leaving\nAnd I think that's what happened in this case\nThere is profound damage writes the roofs field on a pedestal science you know the kind you get in front of a bank that like the bank and the doctor and a lawyer those things are just talked

big help and all of this in sending the signals of what can happen radio was a huge help down there are many people aren't in front of a\nYou know at a TV to be able to get some of that information

before but I think this needs to be said they're forty snowplow jobs open right now from the north Dakota DOT hard to fill with the uncertainty of the position that's right news came out today about all the things that they're buying out at somebody\nJust sent me a text saying that they did in fact called the governor's office to say governor ... you got to keep these places open and the governor responded his office responded with call your local legislators\nUm so I found that incredibly interesting\nThat it would be about calling your local legislators are because he's the governor or he's head of the north Dakota a highway department because he has the flexibility to get something done as well and so if the legislators had their head where it shouldn't be the governor has a way to address that\nI'm Joel Republicans control every aspect of government in this state you don't get to blame Democrats for mistakes in government while Republicans are in charge you can't have your cake and eat it to another one\nCould we talk about the legacy find how much money is in that and why none of it as being used instead of cutting state budgets thanks ah Joel I'm not advocating any state closing any state shops but isn't the structure\nOf the roads each covered this same approximately as it was in the Nineteen fifties so couldn't that discussion about what can be done in today's equipment versus years ago be considered just food for thought today's farmers can do more with less also\nI'm Joel we had one of the best damn snowplow operators in the state and ... and he got transferred the valley city where a when they closed his shop I'm sure he's still one of the best but now we're sitting here with part of a state highway forty six\nThat wasn't plowed at all yesterday

can have that you but it doesn't make you write and it doesn't make you honorable\nAnd that's the sad part that is really the sad part I'm going to talk\nTo you a little bit later in the week about something that has been very very personal to me\nYou know you can you can hold in and buy and do advertisements with you're pregnant daughters valley being shown and you can call somebody else a baby killer and you can have people from my home town saying look if you put a highly sign up we're going to burn it out\nI mean you can have that\nOkay all in the name of pro life pro life but I I think my family has some really good examples of how we've lived their lives and how we support life some really good examples\nNow many of you are going to say well you're just going to talk about what you do after the baby is born it's not true there's going to be some examples a little bit later in the week\nAbout what has happened with my family before the baby is born and what I can tell you is this this is just a small example this isn't one of the bigger examples I'm going to share with you\nKnow sharing the story man sue sue and I were dating are very you know we're dating obviously very close and we got pregnant okay we weren't married yet we were part of an era\nYou made choices and we chose to get married and today we have a beautiful daughter that has given us three beautiful grandchildren and you know what it was the best decision wherever could make it any other decision was not even something we thought about\nBut having a mother who was sexually abused we respect the fact\nThat a discussion needs to be made by individuals who might make a different choice because whether you believe it or not whether you sit there and not a woman can get pregnant being sexually abused they can\nWe had a United States senator one time talk about how a woman's body will not allow itself to get pregnant through rape\nThat's how stupid some people are that's how incredibly stupid some people are that happened\nThat that that\nWas presented by somebody who define themselves as pro life now here's where I Am proud okay somebody asked me one time in a in a Republican state ... with with the skills you have to communicate and the passion you have for public policy\nWhy don't you just become a Republican like John Hoeven did he was a Democrat he knew that the best way to get elected was to be a Republican\nWhy didn't you do why did you do that and they say that Brian cock is another example of an individual that was very progressive I don't know that Brian was ever a Democrat I don't know that\nA buddy obviously was somebody that believed in getting things done um you know and and so the John Hoeven narrative is absolutely got on his true he was a Democrat became a Republican many of these people realize they became a Republican because there was a path to victory and I told them\nDemocrat became a Republican many of these people realized they became a Republican because there was a path to victory\nAnd I told them why I didn't choose that\nPath and the answers really simple to me I Believe in Social Security I Believe in it I Believe in Medicare\nI Believe in it\nAnd those are democratic policies those are the foundation that the Democratic party was built on I Believe and medicate\nFor those of you who called welfare I Would only ask you this did anybody in your family ever used what you describe as welfare as a tool to keep\nGrandmother or grandfather\nIn a nursing home [noise] did you use that as a tool to make sure that a life's work wasn't gone\nWhen it comes to your farm land\nWhen it comes to the other things that you've built up some of you your homes ... did you ever use medicate for that and many of you did you don't want to set\nYou don't want to talk about it and the reason you don't want to talk about it is because many of you have been calling it welfare for years\nDo you know someone on snap I grew up in a town where one gentleman who was on the beaches of Normandy lived in a garage with an old kerosene heater\nI grew up in a town where an individual lived in the old office of an abandoned lumber yard I grew up in a town\nWhere an individual lived in an old chicken coop I grew up in a town where an individual lived on a first floor of an old house and on the second floor he raised chickens to get by\nThat was the generation before Social Security both for Medicare\nAnd before Medicaid\nThese guys didn't qualify they have it and and and and so and and for many people it was considered an embarrassment to utilize these tools so for those of you who ever debate with me why I come from the party I come from\nI Hope you heard what I just said it's going to the weather came and get an update from you
