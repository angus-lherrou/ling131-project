have you on the news in the U.S yeah thanks for having me\nAsked you Gina come on and and and I want to talk to you a little bit about what you're seeing out there and the farm academy up buying selling the type of things that you have to do is supplying and and fertilizer cost what what's the mood of the farmers that you've been talking to\nSo I think in general you know we're seeing some great deals certainly in corn and you know good ... coming off so that's a positive is going to maybe make some cash flows go around where we thought that might have been you know short but they're still gonna be tied\n'em but decisions are going to be a little slower people are gonna want the best Fridays on the farm or so we have the best deals because in\nThese depressed prices when you deal so we're certainly seeing that uh yeah decisions are much lower this year than they have in the past um fall fertilizer we looked for that'd be quite sluggish just because of indecision on what crop we might put in the into the ground next year\nHave fertilizer prices arisen are you looking at big increases fracture\nYes they have reason uh I looked in from maybe ... level law where they're at here right now um but we are up we're probably you know thirty to forty dollars higher than we were this spring so they have called up this summer\nSo what about being able to buy and and move product what are you hearing there because uh some of the elevator managers that I talked to really only watch to to take in what they contracted for and after that they don't want to hold and if they do older they're charging more than what they used to charge to put them in there have been\nWell that's very true when we have um export markets that are very sluggish certainly off the Pacific northwest I'm with the China situation we've taken that market down so I'm most burger ain't gonna have to go into the domestic markets soybeans into crushed likely from the north and\nCorn you know through the ethanol plants and obviously the we'd market seems to be fairly steady domestically but yeah we've taken that export market away from us and it puts a lot of nervousness within any grain elevator if you want to pilot underground you certainly want to know when it's going to come up and right now we wouldn't know when we can bring it back up off the ground\nGene when you look at it and this is going to be hindsight but did we put too much stock in the Pacific realm I mean just sheer logistics I really don't know what else we could have done I mean the the ... ... explain to people what basis says again we've done this before our news and views but I think it's best coming from someone like you\nWell yeah you bases his ... it's a good chunk of it is you're freight cars cost to get it from\nI'm from North Dakota to the Pacific northwest and it was probably a a buck and a quarter plus a bushel to run on a train out their that'd be a shuttle train and then so that's a good chunk of it and then obviously the the cost of handling in it and storing it until we can get to\nThe whole basis just next to Jean do you see people raising as many soybeans which has been there kind of their cash crop or are they going to go away from them do you think\nWell right now I Believe that you know corn and wheat or probably king on the farm on a cash flow basis as we speak but the price relationships oftentimes shift if you know would get\nReally acreage reports on acreage estimates and what the market thinks we're going to put in the ground next year and if you shift you know is this shift Ninety Bush Ninety million acres of corn you know you take five million acres away and put it into soybeans or\nVice versa or are we to such as those acreage shifts I'm oftentimes will see the markets spreads between corn beans wheat changing and that'll drive you know marketing and planning decisions as we go into spring\nGene for the average man or woman that drives by on the interstate and they look out at a a quarter lab and they sell that one's corn and soybeans I think they they believe at times that the cost of input on all of them is the same\nAnd I think it it would be good for you to explain the difference in cost of import and corn versus soybeans\nYeah definitely you know your your input costs are much higher in corn you\nKnow and again it depends on the soil types and hybrids and the amount of input is going to take them each hybrid today sort of calls for a different\nOf of fertilizing and I'm certainly driven around nitrogen\nBut yet corn would be you know came as far as you can put costs are which is if money's tight\nYou know people might want to pull back a little there but at the same time I believe we'll all look at the cash flow at the end of the day and we've got to put in the crop that it's got the best cash flow and actually we had an excellent cash flow this you're probably better casual then soybeans did so [noise] um but oftentimes hindsight's twenty twenty\nYeah but it gene can you give me just a little more time can I talk to you just a little bit more through the break sure\nGene ... ladies and gentlemen he's the CEO of allied energy graying economy ... or ... actually I Want to talk to them or a little bit about this college says well yeah because a lot of lot of men and women are going to be looking at small grade next year and I think genes right it's it's been good financially this year but\nYou know in in the past this concept of big part of that so I'm more coming your way here I just [noise]\nLove where I live I've got fresh air and a great deal from my back porch people think it's hard to get back to the Internet out here but the truth is it's easy for you smack\nWherever you live you can get high speed Internet right at home [noise] huge net satellite Internet which means you can get it anywhere it's made for people like me it's super fast incomes were built in life I can I can sit back and enjoy the sunset while I shop pay bills on line or cat with my family and friends\nThrow this such as well because when you talk to some of those egg producers out there [noise] you know they they think people that drive by on the interstate are kinda foolish they see a a corn pilot an elevator and they they they don't know whether it's corn or soybeans\nGene there's some crops that are OK to store outside and some crops that art and walk walk people through that I feel it\nWell definitely you know corn is probably the safest heads out there because in marketing corner you're allowed five percent damaging and corn keeps quite well I'm On the ground certainly if you can put some areas under it\nUm soybeans a you know if you get moisture in the bottom layers you're going to have sour beans and nobody wants our beans in the marketplace they they ... they don't want to crush them because they're curious who end of the meal and it's just going to create some discounts for you and then\nWe just you know that's a very high risk crop but usually that it gets to be an because that's the first crop harvest and so it tends to be corn and beans and a him no doubt wants to corn on the ground in the beans that have been\nOver in our eyes itchy and thank you for that I Want to get a call or two in here if we can one eight hundred and eight oh five three for sex David you're on a gene go ahead David\nO R Joe ... yeah I Wonder if anything I wanted to ask you about commodity prices and if I understand right a North Dakota's got a it's a very unique bank right ... thank North Dakota invest in North Dakota it's based on North Dakota collateral\nWell I'm Wondering if that collateral is put at risk\nBy a\n... if you remember how the two thousand seven to a snake crash happened uh there was like a hyper inflation and the banks got over in savings and loan Scott over extended\nAnd uh and then when the crash came bam they all of these smaller banks folded up by the most corrupt right so North Dakota's bank is unique in that way the people owned the bank and it's there to work for the state\nAnd uh if you end up with these out of state ah corporations that are getting over extended loan\nStay with the crash so we don't want to invest in you know in colony economics and uh so yeah that was the purpose of the bank to begin with\nAnd I'm just wondering if uh you know what I find that the state is spending more money on cops to protect that\nPipeline rather than they're not looking for well inspections they're not spending will speak well amount of money and wealth inspections that's where she and forty million a gallon spills into high dollar\nI Gotcha Dave I Gotcha I Want to stay on topic here at gene a gene in terms of equity and I think that some of what the what a what David Was building up to their gene ever do all your producers have different times of the year that they're operating loans come due\nYes definitely and right and the ... it's a lot of that relates to when they bought land and and how they leverage their land and just their rotations you know a livestock farmer might have a different\nYou know cash flow need it than a agreeing farmer um cash rents as well I think many landlords of\nYou know tried to spread you know their cash flows out so yeah all of the above so but at the end of the day you know obviously when land values go down you know that leverage position you know goes up unless there's a way to to to pay you know that that your extended that down so all the ... but you know with regulations and you know\nUm I Believe that the banks are fairly heavily regulated today but more importantly is it's about a girl responded farmers you know just working with them and their cash flows um but there will be some guys that get squeezed that's just um the the nature of the beast\nYeah it it's more than anything I just in a segment like this gene I just love the fact that\nPeople who don't who don't live around the farmer who you know they understand what the economy as involving their community if you go to actually if you go to calm if you go to any of those areas out there you go to a more what role do you think ag plays in those communities\nOh it's it's very very key is you know everybody is affected by ... you know certainly by egging these rural communities and we feel the impact but our businesses every business feel the impact of it it puts pressure on the margins you know because people will shop harder because their cash flows are tighter so absolutely it makes everybody you know\nSuck it up a bit as we go through these kinds of time's\nLeft for a little tougher to sell a pickup or a bobcat fair to say\nThere to say they'll put a new tire on them and they're going to keep running them\nYeah Jean near a good man thank you for doing this I promised you wouldn't get into politics but just facts of what's going on and the farm so I really appreciate you coming on thanks for having me\nHey you know that's the that's the issue folks just the sheer economy of it what what's going to happen you know when it comes to the finances of all of us because what gene just set is right and it doesn't matter if a judge layer\nCalmer Berliner Fullerton or pick a town around his area I I don't care that it's the same in your area in that same would include Fargo it would include more had it would include well is that it would include victims and it would include my not as if anyone thinks\nThat in those towns they're isolated from low farm prices\nThey're naive they're

county love getting a chance to come to sense when county pilots get sick and Kevin Kevin you're on the news the news\nI just want to go first on like that I don't agree on but I respect your on your show and the knowledge that first well thank you appreciate\nJak second of all I'm not I'm On a North Dakota I'm On my work over here and I listen to your regular basis and you know you're talking about buying Chad and charm I agree with some of that stuff or what you're saying how can you can just stand with things that they say and then turn around and be the way they were last night\nI question or you can you answer this question\nWith all the things that are going on a party where Trump and the female and\nI mean they answered it\nHaving Kevin if if you can't if you can't make a case\nThat you're a better party when when that what we just played earlier happened\nYou could not be more spot on Kevin ... thank you for your call or you know the answer to his question is yes here's what's wrong with the Democratic party they don't understand the middle of this country\nAnd they don't care at times they don't you you have ... you have good good Democrats\nI mean you you have Democrats that are out there working on behalf of you got Joe Donnelly in Indiana you've got Claire McCaskill in Missouri uh you've got John tester you've got Heidi Heitkamp these these people are east coast or west coast liberals\nThey're not that popular and er Cox don't get yourself they're not there [laughter]\nThese are people that on any given day you know that that whole kind of blue dog cockroach saying\nThey're not all that welcoming the carcass Rome a you know I Know for a fact that Chuck Schumer has not been all that happy with Heidi but then that's the nature she doesn't work for Chuck Schumer she works for you sodas Donnelly sodas test or soda these people that I have had\nThe privilege of getting to know\nThat you know so for what Kevin sad about\nYou know a few of the Democratic party you know how do you lose to these guys well the answer is you get defined by somebody other than who you are\nYou know you you allow somebody to define you rather than tell them who you are and then backup who you are with how you vote in what you do\nI mean there's a reason Heidi one and a very very red state because she tells people who she is and she goes about making sure that she follows that up now I think the thing that I I respect the most about her is the fact that she\nWill not vote a hundred percent with anybody\nI mean she on the cabinet vote if you're going to take a poll before every vote versus voting what your conscious says I mean if you're going to sit there and pledge your vote to somebody a hundred percent of the time what do you need to go there for\nI mean what what in the world do you need to go there for it to think about just a couple of years ago how incredibly unpopular it was to say that you supported portions of the Affordable CARE Act\nObamacare remember that the label that Obamacare now they're using terms like the Affordable CARE Act because they like some of those provisions does it need work you bet but imagine imagine just a couple of years ago if you said you know what\nI like this there's things about it I think work I like keeping my kid on insurance throughout their college years I like the fact that I'm sitting there with my knee just go out and that's going to be a pre existing condition the rest of my life and now I'm covered\nAnother Democrat or the Republicans are running around saying that and so I think the Democrats do a horse [noise]\nI think they do a bad job of letting people know what they have accomplished and what they do and what they stand for\nThe middle of the country Democrats get run over at times by the image of the east coast and west coasts Democrats that's why you hear people saying always trying to tie unpopular politicians with the middle of this country you know how many times have you heard hiring Heidi called Hillary well Hillary isn't president has\nOr politicians with the middle of this country you know how many times have you heard hiring Heidi called Hillary well Hillary isn't president\nAnd she's done politically right\nSo I don't get it I think it's a valid question and if the Democrats can't get better at it and and understand the middle of this country that by God they better be used to be in the minority and that's just the cold hard fact that's that's how real that phone call just was a let's get to Todd Todd you're on the basis\nFor taking my call he'll he'll walk how come you never hear Haiti or Catholic I read and then talk about health care anymore [noise] well\n[noise] I see from Heidi talking about pre existing conditions don't you know I feel like that caught up in jail [laughter]\nYeah well I like that that came up during the debates I did you watch that no no I missed it but I didn't see it right eight but now I'm going to go to the one on friday I Want to see how that goes but I I get a cat and I are Todd I'm Sorry I think it\nI think it is important that they talk about the costs are I think that what you hear consistently as somebody say that he he voted to repeal it sixty times those votes were symbolic there there needs to be a ... a plan to replace it\nAnd Heidi's case as she supported aspects of it and set it needs to get fixed what's her job to fix it so both of them have a responsibility here to use the borders and they should answer more questions about it totally totally agree\nAh when we come back you folks are on hold um comedy is right after they went on [noise]\nWhen it comes to begin to sort of being the treatment you need something consistent\nSomething the performance on your for your [noise]\nUh you know this off I Am but then\nIn their statement about what\nThe president couldn't do anything you want to tell as long as he's an office that stupid nobody's against don't nobody is above the law\nI mean I agree David uh you know the the don't kid yourself that there's a reason why it was him there are so many good conservative judges out there\nSo many good conservative judges um I made that same point here in the state of North Dakota you know ... we've got a really good us attorney that's conservative\nIn in in a man named Myers right he's sitting there right now in the U.S attorneys chair and he's winning award after award from the Trump Administration\nUh you've got the attorney general coming here and Jeff Sessions to thank him for what he's done in this war on drugs I mean you you've got the example I for example\nSo then you inject politics into it right drew regularly wants the job back he got in some trouble right I mean drew got in some trouble and so he he got basically put on the back\nBurner as far as this rapid fire I Want to be this Sunday political career of his then so the quickest way to get back has to be us attorney and so you're going to lose every tool you or use every tool you can\nIn all of this is what a few Susan Bala\nI mean what if you're there Danny of you remember Susan ... she was thrown in prison\nThat's what happened to Susan ... you know what she lost everything she had in this world and that process financially and she ends up getting out of prison because they find out that what drew regularly and Winston Jim did was wrong\nAnd so upon appeal they take her out they take the conviction away you know what that says doesn't give her back to the lives that she had lost that doesn't do anything on that\nI mean look look at what's happening with Wayne standard do we have any active investigation or any responsibility when it comes to the Saturday case have we found a payload her that was lost down in ... county [laughter] come on\nThere's gotta be accountability for this other than I've got the right letter behind my name\nI mean there has to be there has to be someone that stands up and says you know what this is wrong I'm going to stick up for you folks I'm done taking trips on the company's dime I Am really curious how many of you are going to vote yes on measure won the north Dakota state auditor\nThis is the auditor that that should be for full exposure that should be for you know what\nAuditor this is the auditor that that should be for for the exposure that should be for you know what every dime we should know where it went in water water when for that sort of the auditors officers about he came out against measure one\nThat you know and and honest bumper sticker in the in the parking lot and says vote no on measure one paid for by Americans for prosperity\n[laughter] kept\nTelling you want to tell them what Americans for prosperity are what their group does\nNot that they're going to the Koch brothers yeah about that and that's exactly\nWho they are and you know at the Koch brothers want they want to be able to pay people money to do what they want and that's what's going on there is some of the biggest packed donors in the world this district that I'm at right now right now if you check out ... checkout ... uh uh\nUh you know headlines numbers you're going to find out that that these people these people got tons of money they're carcasses got tons of money from the oil industry tons of money so what happens they vote for tax break\nThat's what that's what lack of ethics dots I'm Sorry but that's lack of ethics you're sitting there with\nWith people like Craig and Terry voting to give these people tax breaks and and voting to to basically get read of our anti corporate farming laws and they're they're taking money and mine stakes are getting stakes for it at the same time\nThat's why we need measure one facet we need measure one for ... to make sure checked power and and Terry ones that can crank headline to make sure that these individuals get the light shined on them right I mean\nIt ... goes out to DC\nGoes out to DC has a meeting with the head of the department of commerce the under secretary of egg\nYou know they come out and then congressman Kramer I'm Sorry but that's all it was they stand out in front of the White House and say we were there we got word out on what we think about these tariffs were really believe that the administration hurt us and I think we're on the road to getting this thing ...\nThat's what they do outside the White House you know what happened twenty minutes later\nWhat twenty minutes later the president came out with more tariffs\nIt you know it's so you've got somebody fighting measure one so people will know whereas money came from [laughter] he caught somebody so ineffective that somebody I have no doubt somebody paid for his trip to D.C [laughter]\nYou've got a very ... standing out in front of the the the White House saying wait till you see what we did quite a bit later they take a thirty six inch Mickey Mantle to see it that ridiculous\nYou know and I realize they're strict party night is a very Republican district but these candidates that are here right now these three individuals to Catherine Ross of the world that's running against Terry ... I mean I'm Serious that\nHe walked out in front of the White House look them in the I ... I mean ... you're sitting here looking at a Laurie Carl's Senate Mary slasher okay so these people are on an uphill climb they know that\n... they're going after Republicans in a Republican district but how in the world can the voters be informed when you don't know the facts of where the money's\nBut how in the world can the voters be informed when you don't know the facts of where the money's coming from and how it's being spent\nYou've got guys that you've got state highway department offices it you know I shouldn't say opposites where they keep the snowplows right\nYou've got them closing down in a very rural district because of people like Terry watching because of people like Craig ... because of people like chat part and and now they're trying to go around and say oh we voted for infrastructure we voted for infrastructure how'd you like to be sixty miles away from ...\nAnd have something happen in your family when they ambulance needs to get there when the power poles broke\nWhen all that snow yet you know what you saw on the debt stepped over\nYou saw a rural electric boom truck that was just trying to get the power back on to people you know why you saw that because the boys that move this snow have been cut back so much they can't do their job the way they shut\nAnd it showed it showed so the question is how are you going to vote because of that consider that a commercial if you want it wasn't it was the facts let's get to the weather cave and visit with to Tom tom\nOut what's going on in the weather down\nAlready well we got some clouds in northern Minnesota and a few in southwestern South Dakota but plenty of someone else where there's no real precipitation occurring any word the present time and are not as expected here and so we get into tomorrow but the temperature wise we're looking at a big range as usual\nUpper thirties north to maybe around sixty or so and so most of us from forty to fifty clouds increase west unsolved tonight mainly clear elsewhere\nLos from twenty five to thirty and forty to fifty five tomorrow with Iran chances pushing into the middle in western part of South Dakota few central North Dakota and then toward the valley in Minnesota tomorrow night in Thursday rental Minneapolis is a forty one more here twenty eight ... thirty seven cooks at twenty eight and dues there's a thirty nine\nOr a thirty thirty four Aberdeen twenty five and systems are twenty nine degrees thirty six I'm heading ... thirty nine Willis and thirty seven degrees\nIt is twenty six in mind under twenty eight in Bismarck grafted at thirty cavalier twenty eight Grand Forks twenty eight and Fargo's at thirty two tools to another day Webster South Dakota thirty three of the road there's times from asking from the news and be with regional whether cave [noise]\nThink it's on the cruise or well that's pretty easy that's sponsored by North Dakota Siberian farmers it's sponsored by the north Dakota farmers union edit sponsored by by first\nBox in reality and land management and it's sponsored by Stutzman Harley Davidson and North Dakota is rural telecoms back with you let's finish it our phone calls the rest of the way and a mountain and text messages right after that\nDigging deeper with the mostly a company the show where to draw dummy experts take your questions about crop nutrition your host couldn't move folk and raw spender senior aground them from the mosaic company [noise]\nThis is Kirk and this is Ross and today we're answering the questions you've sent us on social media this one comes in from\nTwitter what's the best product on the market for boosting sulfur levels boosting sulfur levels in the soil is sexually fairly difficult task so we need to find the source that can keep it available for longer micro central with fusion technology contains two forms of silver sulfate so for", "show_name": "News and Veiws, Joel Heitkamp KFGO Fargo, North Dakota", "year": "2018", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "23"}
