when earlier that sets and North Dakota rural telecoms I'm sitting here with the power brokers here in this area I got a cat that Jason ferrets with me as I Do Steve McLaren steam you served\nWith Human Services I Know that uh I I see you have a beautiful nursing home here um South Dakota though he didn't do it to a quarter which is a pretty conservative state did when it came to funding we didn't we didn't we uh I got to get the governor credit threats\nPer person in the nursing home that you keep 'em all that so you keep them open we've lost either seven or eight nursing homes already just this year ...\nMainly because of that and you can get your percentages private pay Medicaid pay but I mean there is so everybody in the rural areas have moved to the ... yeah then I whether that was their focus or not\nI don't know but it's unbelievably difficult you know we're losing money\nOn the one in Roslyn losing money on how you keep them going you know what do you do a lot of\nConservative states in this conservative states did that all in the name of ... it was Obama yeah so they definitely wanted I was kinda proud of North Dakota because we did that and now it's a big fight because the attorney general up there is suing basically the state because we\nYou know he he's trying to get rid of the the pre existing conditions you know so I don't I don't I Can't figure that out and they are finally speaking out\nAnd it's an issue and I think you're going to see that hopefully come out in this in the next election turnabout or you know three of us I've known him for years\nSo it's always been preschool daycare and now long term care every ... those are the issues that are going to come up in this election in South Dakota those are the important\nHow any chance of changing that any chance to having them take another look at it [noise]\nThis next governor election right now I mean it's pivotal a Billy ... is running as are a democratic nominee and Kristi Noem is running for\nGovernor as well and she's in Congress and so there's a real crossroads we're at right now in a million I served in tandem rolls whether I was a leader he was assistant leader in the Senate side and then we\nWere threat strolls and I went to be aware but we've always been a real good friends and I'm so proud of the campaign is wrong because he said let's look at our values where we come together and we agree that education taking care of our folks whether they're young and old we need to be there for him but then at the same time it's come together must not be divided and so\nI Hope that on a national level that there are people that are watching this race\nAs they need to learn to speak you know somebody in the middle I Wish they would get a chance for standpoint it's coming from a town in an area like this if you don't have a nursing home you're going to a long ways to see somebody you love who needs the help they\nWell certainly and of course the the other thing is to you know that when it costs or when it comes to the cost you know I mean a lot of the people if they don't have access to good health care of them are they wait until the last minute and then they end up going to emergency rooms and so then the costs really go up and so the public ends up\nPaying for it anyway\nAnd the only thing is you don't have very good outcomes and because you don't get to the treatment you know for the people at the time they need it you know and so it's a sad situation that we um you know aren't able to open my eyes up for what needs to be done\nWell and hopefully somebody on Human Services will keep pushing joy out of the house you promised me\nThat in Congress in energy him on that one to everything Jason said earlier I mean\nThe whole at this time\nI Do watch it when I had already\nI mean you you need a situation where somebody realizes what keeps a small town going by I I get the luxury you guys getting up and driving to\nA great city I drive to Fargo and next week I'm going to be an Willis than just a bit I mean two completely different cities but I get to work in towns like towns with street lights on all night long and still come

in two thousand Eighteen than it was twenty twelve two thousand six Nineteen Ninety six things in different I I don't know what the average voter is weighing into their thought process when it comes to this race what's unique about North Dakota is\nWe have the large congressman you know both of these candidates on a more personal level than many other voters and other states have\nYou know Kevin uno Heidi and I'm not sure how that will play into\nHow the outcome is determined and just a couple of short weeks I'd Tyler not sure how anyone can support Kramer Armstrong her boss support and the insurance coverage\nFor pre existing conditions another one Tyler I'd like to see Kevin Cramer told the truth but it would be awful dangerous for Heidi because that bolt of lightning that streets or Kevin could carry over to her her\nUh another one Tyler I've always been so proud of our voting laws in North Dakota and and now embarrassed or to be the subject of national attention for voter suppression ashamed for us time to replace those in our legislature that voted for this and other backward butts in the last session\nWe just can't keep voting for these people ... about\nThe voter id law that was now a ... in the the Supreme Court or at least that that said North Dakota had the authority to make the change that they did in two thousand and search team\nMake no mistake than that change was directly because of the two thousand twelve election results\nThe bill was first introduced by Randy banning a Republican and district twenty seven that's a and so far and go\nThe original bill was simply just to a firm up on what the resident requirements we're supposed to be as far as if you're going to be voting by mail\nHow long do you have to live in that that residents before you are the eligible one and that's all it was made sense alright clarify that what happened was he had these national groups that were pushing voter id alec\nOr the American Legislative Exchange committee or or whatever it is I forget what the academic officially says oh look it up on the brake\nCame in with their voter id and the heart and how was\nThe bill what that means is they took the original bill ripped to shreds and then made something entirely different why that's important is there wasn't a hearing in the house on the bill and that's a voter id got passed it wasn't really anything to do with that we had issues in North Dakota they admitted that during the debate\nBoth on the official record more importantly behind the brass rail we're all just the bumping of elbows happens out and the capital's Bismarck their intent was to change\nThe rules of the game and now here we are six years later and they're getting what they want one frustrating about it is you have secretary said el Jagger coming out and not only is he putting out ballots that have errors on it\nWhen people are trying to figure out in the next two and a half weeks what they're going to need when they get to the ballot he's going with their shoulder shrug of yeah you know I'll probably accept that we're less than three weeks away can you be a little bit more decisive so people know exactly what they are expected to have\nWhen they show up to the polls I think we are all old that in the mid ... and how any election doesn't have to be a mid term it could be your local school board it'd be or county commission it doesn't matter what type of what should you should know what is required of you know that the uh\nThe mid term it could be your local school board to be your county commission it doesn't matter what type of what should you should know what is required of you know that the top official at your state has your back [noise]\nWith your right to vote one eight hundred eight zero five three four six text messages have three five to seven or somebody asking about the ballot measures we can go down that path also harvest debates coming on in limited use radio network tower actors doing it for ... [noise]\nCursing mhm\n... ... ... ... ... yes correct your traders back what change\nDo you miss a lot I I I don't know where it says that in the north Dakota constitution 'cause I don't believe that it does me I don't again\nWell ... what's locked look at measure one's a opponent\nOr you have all these lobbying groups getting together throwing in twenty five thirty thousand dollars\nTo oppose this measure money of that money comes in from out of state members of theirs and then they've got the audacity to run ads saying that this was some other states special interest groups trying to change North Dakota keep it the way it is they want to keep North Dakota the way it is because they have a lot of influence on the Bismarck\nOr only now man okay for a different light [noise] they're already talking about it constantly about oh ... ...\nHot oil part can bring all the ... billion mhm well if you take a call ... ... ... ... ... can be handled and ...\nAnd ... quitting thick harm ... I'm ... and I kept a low income for\nMe when we all can become more [laughter] [laughter]\nSo our car effect pressure in\nNevada I appreciate the phone call and he was he had perfect analogy here's the thing with the oil tax you've had a number of years of just spin on this thing and that's what it is\nThe decision by the legislature\nTo eliminate the tax which was universally agreed upon to lower that for a limited to trigger not to tax the trigger was a separate policy decision then the oil tax rates you determine the right when you voted in in the eighties the legislature decided to put a trigger on it\nThey could have and were asked to just eliminate the trigger and keep the tax rate that what you wanted at six point five they didn't they lumped it together and they're saying that's how it had to be bowl it did not have to be someone there lord that rates in two thousand Fifteen ten days left in the session\nOne that did over that time frame from one that became active until now what the legislature left on the table was five hundred and Seventy million dollars of tax revenue yeah they collected that five percent\nThey could have collected the six point five and collected another five hundred and Seventy million and that is the truth\nSo when you have all these little ads running saying oh they're not being not as bad as spin ladies and gentlemen let's get to Bob Bob thanks for calling in how you doing today\n[laughter] good good I'm just wondering how many people are aware of the fact that after they give out this big tax break to the wealthy that they're going to start playing around the Medicare and Social Security and then it doesn't say on the big ones attention at\nAll by Bob I uh I I mentioned that yesterday on my afternoon show and I I go back to the December debate on this tax reform\nPeople said that this was going to be a a revenue neutral in fact maybe it was going to increase revenue to the federal government because the economy's going to take off and uh we we now know that that wasn't the case their own Federal Reserve said that now\nAnd the second thing that was talked about at that time as if the revenues do not come in they're going to look at Social Security Medicare and Medicaid to try to offset and bring down the debt and deficit and that is exactly where we are now in October ... those are the two things that were talked about them\nSo I I don't know why\nIt's not getting the attention that it deserves right now about\nThe survey there because that's all right and it's been a lot to do this for two years and now finally that's going to do is is the last bit a bit in Korea goes out the door to him and then my ... my whole life has been there have been the one that did that for years and that Social Security they'll well they've got that are happens outlets describe that part and they\nIn Baba and that's where ... ... people always want to say you know you always bring this up in an election year just fear mongering right to that when you talk about Social Security measures we're hearing it right from Mitch McConnell the Senate over the weekend exactly yeah Bob All right thanks very things raising the points I appreciate the phone call let's get to\nAnother Bob Bob thanks for calling in how you doing\nGood and what's on your mind a debate tonight yeah I was trying to text\nAnd got to interrupt or whatever or calls like going to do it this way\nSure what a day today or I expect\nKramer to spend a lot of time talking about I mean I Can't ... on you know the last ... mhm yeah I don't think that we had a whole lot else say ...\n... well I I Am dismayed that that's going to be a very contentious moment of this debate it and it will get brought up in it shouldn't get brought up I mean both of these candidates should get give their way and when you look at how Heidi handled the campaign making a mistake or I've heard both\nOr NGOs of this uh the people that I could not disagree with more things she meant to do this that's not true uh and then those saying well at least she was on his own debt and I don't know which side wins out overall that's why I think when Kevin I I'm sure it's going to come out aggressive on this\nWhat the response will be and what voters will take away from\nThat right\nRight right but ... it'll be it'll probably take over a lot of the debate and it'll\nBe on on Heidi to get her point across it and if I were her I guess if I were in that position I'd say look I\nUh I Apologize to these individuals I fired the person that I Believe is responsible I Will continue to try to burn their\nForgiveness as far as those people that are on the list I don't need to earn Kevin Kramer's forgiveness and in fact when will he apologized for a B and C when he talks about throwing people up against walls up at spirit leg we talked about well nothing really happened\nBecause there was no penetration when does he apologized for that\nThat's what I'll be curious if it goes back horse or if it's just consuming the entire debate let's\nHead on over and get that final up day from Missouri\nTo complain about the weather across the tri state radar
