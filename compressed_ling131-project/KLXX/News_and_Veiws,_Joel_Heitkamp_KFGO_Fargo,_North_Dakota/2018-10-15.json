and she said that if this bill\nThat she wouldn't be able to go to that Farm Bureau meeting on one of their own pork sandwiches and coleslaw because of this bill and I\nI look and read up on them from what I could understand I don't see that that's true but I guess I'd like to hear from a bell and you know I keep up\nThere's a lot of that type of information out there which one wants to go first you know it's\nSo ridiculous I hate to even address at because this is a large being honest their own to hear that oh yeah I asked the question yeah and I know that it's out there but it is ridiculous because this is a constitutional measure it's about principle there is there are no weeds theory they're getting down into the weeds and the reality is\nLegislators are going to make those decisions because they're eight laws probably that will have to come out of this to define\nWhat is and is not\nCovered under the transparency or the ethics commission will be doing their own rules and regulations which will go through the review process that all rules and ranks go through\nSo let me ask you this way ... if if I find out after after a legislator pushes for open gaming that that they push for just unlimited gaming and I say All right where where's this if there's a driving force here where's that coming from and that individual wasn't that that\nIndividual was flown to Antigua let's just say that because it happened ... am I able to find out that that the folks in Antigua paid for him to go\nNo you're not no I Will I be after measure one yes yeah I mean well effort to get back to their friends is it not it is\nIt's it's Jim Casper yeah it's it's state representative Jim Casper he was sitting right there in one of those chairs and I looked at him and I said who's paying for this did you go to and take what he said that has nothing to do with this you know and I kept pressuring about Antigua it had everything to do with that\nEverything Dina and that's just one example\nI I I couldn't agree more he was a he was a special person have on that panel when we selfish Sochi and\nNow if you would have got to get married just him and not the moderator\nAnd I thought that you know the courage to sheer courage that made me vote for her [laughter] made me [laughter] you know there there's something to that Dina mom\nShe's wonderful she was on that panel with made them but when we face the big boys [laughter] and she was just great because they'd bring up these these these wild or things that this would do and she'd say that's ridiculous\nI I Want to talk to you a little bit about um you know why is the Catholic Church opposing this which one of you wants to address that\nWell I think they've bought into the also a ridiculous idea that this is going to have people who put money into the collection plate have to have their names listed someplace and that's just ridiculous they know better than that\nThis is not a ... it again goes back to the legislature\nAnd the ethics commission when it hit his appointed will set their rules and regulations but nowhere is that evident in this constitutional measure and it's just so health so out there that it's not gonna happen\nEllen why to be a ... American civil liberties union the ACLU come out against is\nIt's the same kind of thing and we believe that you are right to uh spend money to influence\nAgainst us well it's the same kind of thing um we believe that you are right to uh\nSpend money to influence elections and governments and and remain anonymous ... is is not you're right that we have a right to know who's spending money to influence our elections and um if\nThe the opponents say that's against the first amendment\nAnd so it's unconstitutional well it's it's just plain ... anyone who thinks that a North Dakota initiated measure and constitutional amendment ultimately is going to violate the first amendment of the U.S and North Dakota a constitutions simply as you just can't do that [laughter]\nYou know here's one for you it's touchy but but somebody texted him so they want to know Ken current legislators keep the money they raised from campaigning for personal use for example can Craig had lend pay he's DUI fees and finds from campaign money\nI'm I feel badly for for for Craig and those are never good things to happen uh but they did pass a law last time last session that said that legislators could not keep their campaign funds and use it for personal use\nI don't know if that means after the campaign is over or when it's still ongoing I'm not aware\nOf the fact that you don't know [laughter] that tells you that there's still an issue of\nYou know you have a lot of people coming out against this that are part of organizations that have really big lobbyists you knew that was going to happen they're out there saying that you wrote a bad measures that the reason to vote against it\nIs because of the language in it they did that when it came to medical marijuana they've done that so many other issues they beat it up you know because of the fact that they think you wrote it poorly speak to that\nWe had three lawyers all the way through we passed it by the legislative counsel and its Palin's great comments they didn't change anything but a few punctuation march\nWe have national partners the campaign Legal Center who have who have been supportive um [noise]\nIt has undergone rigorous review and they're wrong and it is such a typical grass tops campaign where you attack\nAttack attack with nothing to substantiate your position other than undermining and throwing out these outrageous scenarios as the hypotheticals that will never happen if the legislature does its job [noise]\nAll right let's get back to the phone lines where to get to Mark Mark you're on go ahead\nOh hi I'm I have a comment Lancaster to request very near somewhere or about what measure one way to solve this inner lane is a well known powerful state senator was chairing\nA committee to look at it through telecommunications regulations before I'm good stories about this that it was also being paid by\nA greater rate to ... and ... they were allowed to get rid of that he made one trip to Wyoming Legislature up the house is quiet\n[laughter] I'm sure measure let later one but at least turned more weight on this when I suggested to a friend of mine and broadcasting this way for your stories are well I think that's more of a newspaper story it's complicated but it's pretty clear that\nThis was on our physical any comments on that\nHer story it's complicated but it's pretty clear that this was on a trickle of comments\nAre there okay let's get their take ladies\n[laughter] yeah I think people I I think they would be brought before a panel or a but a charge could be made and I am hoping that the an ethics um commission would be able to cast some light on that or let them with me is er boat and that would be a no\nAs a as a former legislator if I'm sitting there and somebody is carrying a bill\nTo deal with telecommunications issue or when they are in fact a lobbyist whether it be in South Dakota whether it be in Montana for a TNT or or quest or whoever uh if if they're doing that on the side\nAnd I don't realize why they introduced a bill or a carrying a bill\nThat isn't right I deserve to know that\nThat's called conflict of interest and it's a major part of the amendment is to deal with a a number of ways in which conflict of interest now can arise legally in North Dakota\nOne of the most powerful legislators out there now one of the most powerful legislators out there has contrived legislation that puts individuals in this case higher education in a situation where they have to lease buildings that he owns\nThis was happening in Bismarck I mean this is happening we've pointed out that that is a conflict of interest aside from the fact that it's unethical if this shy and some light on that Dina you've got my vote\nYeah and and Joe I said to a group of them when they were gathered and again that infamous meeting I said hey this is going forward those of you that have committed any of these kinds of acts previously it is not retroactive\nSo [laughter] you know a good laugh it got a good laugh because it's it's not retroactive it's going forward but I I Would think\nThe exposure of these kinds of conflicts of cast a shadow on all of the good legislators that put their foot there themselves out there\nTo serve their constituents serve the state of North Dakota and do good for the citizens the bad apples yeah I think it would ... it would it would bring to light what they're doing and that's appropriate\nI can count on my hand that the times that somebody stood up on the Senate floor and said look I have a conflict of interest when it comes to this bill a you know this bill affects me personally or one of those individuals as a statewide Republican office holder and Randy Christmas now I always respected him but a huge respect for him after that\nAnd the body itself then had a choice to say no ready you're okay well you know we know now that you you said this go ahead and vote on it and there's something to that there's something that must make you go to bed at night and feel better for just being honest I Would think so\nI got some events coming up Elon I Want to make sure they get out there\nThank you uh plenty of opportunities to meet with us in person and and discuss any issues you have this evening five thirty than rose as a social me for the seven o'clock showing 'em at the front of the theater of an incredible PBS a and private

just expose them to expose the issues\nIt would determine which a body or entity would be responsible for bringing charges that would not necessarily have the power to 'em so\nI right now when it might write rules where that would allow it to do some limited things but all of the existing penalty sources would be referred to it if they\nIf I Want to I Want you to hear this comment before you

all\n\nThe way we've chosen to live our lives but you get really sick\nYou get really sick of having your sister or your family called baby killers it just it gets it gets old\nIt gets really old and if you listen to this show regularly you know the position that I have taken when it comes to that you also know the position I've taken when it comes to a baby that's been born\nAnd a baby that needs help and a baby that as they grow into adulthood might need help but take a listen to this letter or when I was Nineteen years old I became pregnant\nI was not married and our family was very poor\nI had finished my first year of college and I had a choice to seek an abortion or have the baby my choice was to have my baby I spent the summer trying to decide what was best I told my mother who is unwavering in it her insistence that I go to college regardless of my pregnancy\nIt was Heidi who took care of me at college she had me move into her apartment lift my spirits and make certain I saw a doctor to stay healthy\nI saw a counselor for help with my decision attended my college classes and gave birth with Heidi by my side I made the extremely difficult decision that my baby deserves so much more than what I had\nOf terror and cried when we let her go today my daughter and I have found each other our story has a happy ending in this campaign my sister has been called a baby killer by some who don't know her\nWe were raised Catholic went to church every Sunday and most holy days are Christian faith told us to help the poor\nThe homeless the vulnerable than those with no voice\nThat's how we lived our lives and it's what Heidi does every day for North Dakota and the Senate I'm proud of my sister while this campaign could go either way I Will no longer allow others who don't know Heidi defined her morals especially Kevin Cramer\nThat comes to Melanie Hi camp sister of Heidi Heitkamp\nThat's my big sister talking about her big sister and you know I Hope you just sit back and take a listen to that just a little bit about what it must have taken for Melanie to write this letter imagine that\nYou're you're letting your life go out there when ... has never ever in all of her political campaigns in all of her life used what she did for Melanie and what our family has done\nFor any personal gain who would have been easy right this was a choice that Melanie made this was the choice that my sister Melanie made because she's mad she fed up she's had it\nOkay it it gets a little bit old no gets a lot of old when people are defending your morals that way and you've lived your life just the opposite and so it's frustrating it's frustrating it's disingenuous it's really easy to sit\nThere and expose expose you're pregnant belly and I hope that there is a beautiful baby that comes of that and I hope that baby is growing into and born into a wonderful family\nBut it really gets old when that same family is running around the steak calling you baby killer it gets really old and so I commend my sister Melanie for having the the the courage to do this I\nCommend my sister Melanie for for being brave enough to do this and so I Want to get to this call quick a swanky you're on news ... go ahead\nCorning jaw thrives gears just one thing I just want to thank your sister for taking that all the way she did it all the stuff comes out of the woodwork you know it's like her and that and joke by the way\nWhen you have to see your sister they're just tell her that she's always welcome that my ear capital there are there no care of that country\nAll right thank you appreciate that call wait a goal Mel where to have the courage to share part of your life and do that [noise] you know this is Melanie Hi camp who runs youth works she's

I met you are the one thing that you said bill was the main reason there there is to get a great education and become the people that they want to be long term for their life\nUm you know that following through on on the history of you being an athletic director\nGrade yourself how are you doing how how's the team's doing or are they going to class and they are the people because their stories out during the media today from the University of Minnesota I'm not very happy about it and so how's the University of North Dakota doing\nWho well you know and and obviously I'm going to give a major kudos to my predecessor and everyone that spent here prior to to beeping here but uh over the last ten years Joel since the division one area there's not a semester that has gone by where we haven't had a cute GPA of three point out\nUh so that's all three hundred and fifty student athletes are cumulative believe so\nAfter that has gone by where we haven't had a cute GPA of three point out\nUh so that's all three hundred and ... in student athletes\nCan do that the way so you know we're doing that they're doing the job and I know what you hear a lot of times that of course why wheelchair\nYou hear about that one percenters right in life and and the one percenters probably are going to are going to garner a lot of the conversations but I'll tell you what the the three hundred and fifty student athletes I'm blessed to be around each and every day\nYou know I I'm I how how about this this will make hopefully some of the listeners a optimistic I'm optimistic for our future and I and you know I I watch them on a daily basis I see the load they have to take\nThey've got to juggle you know the demands of division one athlete and then also being a student and then doing the things that we asked them to do a socially and in that community as well and they handle it all wealth\nBuild the you're not the rocky anymore I mean you've got the keys um how how's it going I mean I never just ask you generally how I mean you know one of the bathroom is now I mean how is the job going\nI mean I I think we're pretty darn well I what I've said this some folks Joel ... good bad or indifferent if you have more than one child um it ... identity before so it's kind of like bringing your second child home from the hospital\nI mean you're here you're dangerous they're just ... you know you get maybe know how to change a diaper right\nSo there's going to fool you either right or wrong\nI mean there's there's always a lot of fires come into my office down the question I have to analyze is\nIs there anybody really even course to the fire [laughter] you know I mean is that you know five thousand miles from the fire ours are downtown in so uh you know those are the things that ... and again it's it's a court or everyone it's important to what they do but\nI got to analyze what's in the best interest of the University of North Dakota and for the state and and make sure I Do the right things and I'm working on the right thing right I mean the last one is someone sitting in this chair working on the wrong things and so uh\nSo again you're just in just I
