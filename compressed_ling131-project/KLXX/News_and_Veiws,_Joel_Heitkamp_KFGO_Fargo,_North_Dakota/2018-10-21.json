five to two\nOf ... is with us in Hartford, Connecticut high up in our you\nAnd good thank you so much for taking my call sure what's up [noise] I'm calling because my husband and I just started I'm really getting serious about the debt snowball we have a practice\n[noise] um I'm calling because my husband and I just started I'm getting serious about the debt snowball we have approximately Seventy thousand dollars in debt mainly from my student loans\nAnd um we have fifty six hundred dollars in savings and my question is um we have\nA baby coming and da da da da da da da da da da da da da da Silva wasted that I was a ... going to use [laughter]\nYou know get the thousand dollar emergency fund in use forty six hundred to pay off those yeah but now with the baby I didn't see a guy that that I was wondering what how we should kind of attack that\nWhat I Would suggest you do is push pause on the total money make over okay in pile up cash\nAs big a pile as you can pile between now and the time by becomes okay and um and then whatever you are piled up and and then when mommy and baby come home from the hospital in everybody's fine in April\nThat event is than behind us in any worries are threats or anything we would have had about that is behind us right um well I mean there's the whole thing of raising the baby but I you know eight eight years yeah there is now but I but basically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery and everything goes and we don't have any hiccups and when we got money okay\nSo let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now it's about a Seventy seven thousand okay\nSo let's say you save up twenty five thousand dollars between now and then got into it and twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your total money make over and take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it at the at the uh student loan you will have lost no ground\nOkay unless you go maybe spending crazy during the next few months\nWe had a lot of stuff like this is our ... that actually her second child ... you had a lot of stuff the only thing that would be a little bit different and the ah the skated a boy because I have a lot of girls close yeah\nWell there's no but I mean other than that you know what I'm Talking about by by because you've had some friends do that or they just like oh drop twenty grand to get ready for\nOwns a AAA eight to five five two to five Brittany\nIs with us in Johnson City Tennessee Hi Brittany how are you\nI'm good how are you have better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] okay so my husband and I got a piece for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance part before we purchase our life insurance and we got part permanent and part terms and of course we watch the insurance part last night and we just got\nA block insurance about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and we immediately wanted to get rid of the term are All right the permanent and just have term and he said Dave Ramsey is talking about whole off her imminent insurance not portfolio base permanent insurance which is what you have to\nDo is it still bad shall we still didn't get the\nTerms of like he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey [laughter]\nOkay Dave Ramsey does not ever invest I was real clearing the lesson you heard me yeah when you never tell you under any circumstances to use life insurance as an investment vehicle one hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do is\nLike which so you knew or knew financial advisor okay that's what I Would show you you don't have a natural advisor you have a life insurance salesman\nOkay they're selling you in church\nSo what we were thinking we should do a switch to four hundred thousand just the term each and then the money we were 'cause it was like three hundred dollars a month which I'll do a lot yeah um and just go ahead and open up our rah rah are IRA and start getting money into that\nIn bed with mutual funds okay that's exactly what you learn in class was uh yeah so you already knew what they rarely she said yeah he just like which tells me one of the things you know this guy's a liar or he's are ignorant\nBut [laughter] he's a family friend who's in the um actually one of our friends who did apparently gave them our number because they use and for it as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which is I mean I I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nWrite and middle class\nRight and they're laughing it on our current policy um on your class he said you know twenty or Thirty years whatever went on and our term policy one then can we were eighty wet hand [laughter]\nOkay\nWhy don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much this guy's overcharged you for everything he sold you\nKnow guard and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\nHey that sounds like well Oregon that down on it and and that they played\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically um\nThe people who sell investment based or\nWhole life or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me and so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nCrap in a bag\nThat's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after they take all of\nTheir fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred percent [noise]\n\nSometimes up to forty years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that\nYou're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die with cash value\nPermanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only\nThe face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that\nFor the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you about ready to return it when you die they keep it all\nSo bad savings account it's bad investment broker the pay the the [noise] life insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more\nThan you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nThat's what they Ramsey has always said for twenty five years here on the air upset it for twenty five years is ally of owned myself\nI have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind ever and I did get a horrible northwestern mutual\nWhole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was uh\nYeah Hi my wife knew from college\nCame around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from it I had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was\nAnd got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy\nAnything other than\nFifteen to twenty year term life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you\nThe best way to buy life insurance is through a broker that shop several companies the best way to buy insurance if any connoisseur a broker the shops several companies and get you the best possible deal\nOr that your car insurance for homeowners insurance your long term care insurance sure life insurance your insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of Neal and that's why we've indoors for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff center has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from Zander and I don't own Zander insurance on ... any of it that show that while this always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement\nBut the reason they done well is he said he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds and they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either\nSo that's why I've endorsed it's real simple and takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance have been cost that much so just jump in there and do it\nSo Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that\nYet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance out by the way a broker you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with ... with the help he usually a north local providers for your ... what we call PNC property in casual you got your car in your home owner's insurance you can shop most people saved three to eight hundred dollars a year\nOn their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business a captive agent can sell for one company like a state for major\nForeign nation wide in Asia\nPeyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent [noise] was it nationwide that's nationwide and now\nBut um and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that\nBut you're paying for those guys\nWhen you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nFocus is one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for the new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this one was the last time you checked on your financial plan\nHeard me or do you even have one I listened with a financial plan in place you're more likely to reach your investment goals\nAnd the best place to start is by sitting down and talking with investing professional our smart vest her program helps you quickly fine the only professionals in your area but our team personally works with and look on oh meeting where the ...\nShall we just we quit borrowing money so you do whatever you want to do will be your friend either way but the way I live my life is how I answered questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability and up terms and in down times\nAnd joy to not have a ... named country wide on my back bank of America on my back can't even imagine it's been so long since I've had him that just\nJust ... I think I Would probably like an anxiety attack it would be bad Carl is with us in Pennsylvania hate Carl welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up\nHey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping we'll give you some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free or we just went at our house off the way to go yeah we're happy about that a decided to sell off some investments just to do that people kind of\nSaid well why would you do that other people's money ... low interest that's right and I tell you what the peace of mind is great you know hey the problem I have is we were able to\nDo who thought option and I've got about five or six hundred thousand dollar that I'm trying to figure out what to do with a few that about the same amount in four one K. which I have to be in the market um I'm a little nervous about\nAmount of money in the market and I'm five foot homes we for about ten home in the past and I'm thinking about using that money to buy a rental property you know outright ... and a and B that and maybe diversify a little more than I wanted to hear what your thoughts on that\nOkay um I think it's excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor yup it is you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you you know\nBut you you put put a renter and how much they go out on ya [laughter] and so there's a ... you know you got the hassle of buying it you got to pay the taxes you got to pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a national factor I've got a bunch of it um mosque by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market I've got a lot in both\nBut a real estate will give you a better rate of return but it requires\nManagement by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else to what you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so\nMy real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit the the you know that appreciation schedule in other words the actual cash on cash return the ... minus expenses as a return on investment and the growth in value you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual return which is called the intern right of return the IRR\nOkay which you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples higher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent right of return\nI are are not casual cash is about ten\nOkay or a little less and some of it okay but uh I our our total with increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that than I Am on the road to ... on the other maybe double what on that are making a mutual fund but I've got a lot more hassle with it\nI mean it is um you know even though I don't management of my son in law runs our our real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally\nDeal with a renter or something like that or anything or vacancy or a broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this morning with him and to see how the properties are doing we check on him and he's telling me the stories of the drama he gets to deal with and such is real estate but I Love real estate do that\nAnd I ask a question I'm sure they might play point with a hundred thousand dollar house so at five hundred thousand [laughter] I have I can get five home mhm I'm all in a hundred thousand each [laughter] now so I don't I own them out like all the rents minus expenses are free and clear or somebody else to go on the tree\nAnd language for fifty percent\nYeah but I don't ... you know I I I think I Know your answer there on a leveraging I\nI'm not going to leveraging the I don't I ... I don't want the extra pain in the butt of dealing with a banker on top of this and on top of that I got risk and it just takes all the joy out of this whole discussion um what's the average price point in your area nationwide it's a little over two hundred thousand\nYeah how about that I mean I can get a three bedroom one bath three bedroom two bath for about a hundred maybe a hundred and twenty some kind of single family home yeah\nI I'm probably gonna bump on up in the hundred and fifty range in you and do three three one fifty one Seventy five right in there or rather than five ones and the only reason I'm telling you that is get a good by on whatever you by whatever it is not above ... but the higher the class renter\nThe more they pay in rent or they users are deal with generally speaking\nAs a general category it's not always true\nI mean there's some wonderful people that rented every\nYou know people pay two thousand dollars a month [noise]\nOf folk that could be with somebody\nBoth myself so I'm not somebody shut up\nOf folk that you're dealing with the ...\nBoth myself so I'm not talking about somebody shut me\nUp and when\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nLegally and forever is with time share ... team they have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contracts to find a solution they've accepted thousands\nOf timeshare owners this year alone they're the best in the business because they simply a more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process but there with you every step\nOf the way and timeshare exit team is so confident in their exit service that if they don't get you out you get a full refund called eight for for\nNine nine nine exit and schedule a free consultation eight for for nine nine nine ... or timeshare exit team dot com you get to the ...\nYou get to the Bismarck all home expo going on now at the Bismarck event center brought to you by mattress from see the latest in designed decor remodeling at home automation\nYou won't want to miss it mission is free and so it was parking enjoy life demonstrations in Bhutan will go along with muscle and national vendors featuring products and services for your home and family living it's happening now\nThe Bismarck fall home expo Saturday tend to six and Sunday eleven to for learn more Bismarck ... dot com\nLook for the times and that's a fairly common phrase that frankly doesn't make much sense [noise] Hi I'm\nBrad with indigo signed works you shouldn't have to look for business science science should be looking for you grabbing your attention\nAnd indigo sign works we develop your side design and build it right here in North Dakota enhance your brand with a sign that not only grabs attention it demands attention gifts fast free quote today we're on the strip demand\nIn indigo signed works dot com or\nUnder one man owner of man science Bismarck since Nineteen eighty eight our success has been based on the success of our clients\nFrom the designer the finished products retreat every job like our reputation depends on it because it does [noise]\nMan science remember us\nNeed help turn to a local experts\nDover is national ...

William premise of Meridian Energy Groupon to give U.S Canada the low down the down and dirty and you know you know you're building the Bach and we'd go right to the source\nAll right then we're going to go to watch for city McKinsey county and talk with Daniel\nDenver he's the economic development coordinator out there the executive director for the uh economic development corporation out in at McKinsey county like I said that's where a watt for city is kind of the heart of the box and\nIt's been known for the national media and the local media regional media all the media Waterford City they've grown exponentially uh they've got a lot of good things happening out there in ... city so where the economic developer kind of a year and year in review or let's look at next year gives us a rundown of some of the things happened in Waterford City\nAll right and then Jeff Simon he's with the western Dakota Energy Association they have their annual meeting coming up one of my favorite annual meetings or this year it's going to be in Newtown\nAnd so he gives us kind of a little bit of a run down some of the speakers what they're\nTalking about and a question I like to ask a lot of gifts these days is two thousand an Eighteen what would it be known as what she found it a nice scene is the year of X Y Z so we do sprinkle those questions in as well with some of our guests on today's program All right\nLet's take a look here where we have gone up looks like we've got our Meridian Energy Bruce\nDavis refinery updates coming up in just a moment but first we got a few things that we need to a less you know about first and my name is Jason fees and this is built into Boston radio heard of a crude like\nWhy\nAnd exactly I Know I went to them and it's so broad and so it it got so much for us about brain jobs here it's it's more trying to find the workers to come here and to enhance our quality of life makes your quality of life you know it was being tainted I we have a like a community for people to live in\nWell and that's a good point too because a lot of people the your economic development in the first thing to think of as you know like what you said jobs in some of these uh you know bringing companies the town et cetera et cetera\nAnd some of the things that you've been doing there though are a little bit different a little bit outside the box I Know we had a Buddhist pattern Britain Ollie on a few weeks ago and he was he was really you know given you a lot of uh kudos for your work\nAnd being instrumental in kind of bridging the gap in being a liaison for new Vera environmental solutions and you know the county when it comes to their high school and that sort of thing or are you do it a lot of these little special projects I mean I I really haven't heard too many economic developers doing that type of thing\nWell yeah I think sometimes people are looking to have meetings with other people but they don't necessarily have the venue or the person to organize them eating and um and just because our workforce is is probably our biggest challenge that we have\nYou know what in our office new is what we've been asking and I'm\nHaving conversations with a high school and having conversations just spending I says they're like you know there are ways that we can create more opportunities for for kids in high school to see what the opportunities are here right in our own backyard and for them to understand that and so we've just been\nWhere you don't have a college here in town um that as a bricks and mortar but we have the University of Mary offering class this year Will Stone state train Andy ... we've been having conversations I on you know what are ways that we can\nCan meet our workforce needs without having um kept people leave our community for training and so that Saddam\nWe've been meeting with various oil company and serious a petroleum companies as well to just kind of talk about you know what are your needs what can you guys talk to\nSchool with that they can see\nWhat I'm what opportunities there are for people who want to enter the workforce right after high school those that want to maybe go for one or two years of school and then those that want to go on for more of a traditional four year degree and then enter the workforce\nAnd with that it's just lead to good conversations amongst industry and and the school\nThat have um training opportunities to just try to figure out a little bit better the the pipelines that are available and the pathways that are available for for kids to get into the workforce\nWell I'll tell you what I thought that was a fantastic idea about cultivating\nAnd just exposing the opportunities of the energy industry through you know trucking I guess is probably the right way that maybe it's not energy industry as much as it is the trucking and distribution industry like new girl was coming up with I just thought it was a it was a neat idea because\nAh the one thing that we've been pretty vocal about on this program\nIs that maybe the four year degree is not for everybody in fact\nWe've even argued that the two year treating degree is a better way to go if you're a kid just wants to have a good job and make some money now if they want to be an accountant or a doctor or lawyer that's a little bit different but if you're not quite sure you know your specialized career\nBoy I tell you the the the way the world has worked out in the last you know five six years is it's really opened up a renaissance for these trades or whether it be artificial intelligence or welding or electricians we're in this case getting your CDL license man you get a CDL license that's\nThat's a heck of a thing to have if you're under Twenty years old\nWhat what um [noise] I guess what was kind of the book\nThat that you saw with this to really make this thing work because you start introducing uh some of the stuff to high school kids\nYou could actually have a few people that don't want that are there are a little bit upset or they might turn it into a political argument did you guys get any flack or any any pushback are given the fact that it's an oil and gas town where people pretty receptive to this an open to the idea\n[noise] and yeah I I think it's just very energy quite generally quite well um I mean the idea of being we just want to present the options I think I think what we're trying to help prevent against it just kid that when they graduate or even one and two years in college there being like\nYeah I don't know what I Want to do and I don't I don't know what any of these jobs and kale\nUm if we can just present the options I mean the school also brings in the veterinary a veterinary folks and talk about those professions the medical profession and all of these different things I think it's just getting kids exposed to\nTo all different industries were also having a meeting with health care providers next month or next week actually to have them talk about what kind of opportunities to kids to have that we should be um [noise]\nBe working on and I and I think William just kind of\nIt's no longer than day where\nPeople kind of keep a job for forty years anymore it's more like I've [noise] I've changed my job a little four or five times in the past ten years and um and I like it and and and there's not a lot of people that kind of us are\nPlanning the sticker with their job for thirty forty years and at the same thing and so if there is a way for us to be nimble and\nAnd like he started and then you start out with a two year degree and then you do a bad job for a few years and then you realize oh you she like graphic design or something\nWhat role can we provide you a class or two or three or four for you to get a graphic design training matching the answer that she could\nTo pivot into a different condition and so I think the idea of okay you're going to go to four years of college and then you're going to do that bad job that she went to school for for the rest of your life that that happens with some people but not as much and I think we'll just see it less and less and so if you start out with a couple of you\nSomething just continually lifelong learner and or you want to be alive\nMr Daniels Denver I'm going to ask you to hold that thought for just a moment we're going to
