I Believe it was the intention\nOf what what al Jagger and and what the Republican legislature want it they they did by design with no proof no evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing put as many roadblocks as they could in the way of individuals voting the exact same way they did in the primary\nThen so if there was a problem they easily could have and this was locked is the reason they got the vote that way in primaries because there was overturned that that the court said that's not what all the way up to the Supreme Court in ... and then the Supreme Court ruled that the way of the Republican legislature so\nYou know it to me it\nIt's as simple as saying show me the proof\nWhere do you think that there's been illegal voting I'll be happy to sit down and talk to you but they weren't able to do that I Steven you're on news and be go ahead Steven\nJoe uh you know I was going to the prior year I'm going to be with him but\nQuestion is you know he he he alerted to the fact that most of the members or for the Democrats are liberal or whatever you call\nAnd I thought well if they weren't out there for only three or four weeks\nEach every four years to get them to vote or every two years why don't they don't get to my address and everything's okay well that's what that's what I Would do if I Want to a voting bloc\nAnd Steven the other part to this is I'm getting a lot of messages in asking where a tribal management themselves are why they're not taking buses wind or they're not that but you know you can take a bus to the polling place\nIf that individual doesn't or it isn't structured with street address now you're in trouble they used to walk in Stephen with a post office you know if if you got your I'll use either tale as an example if you got your author tail bill and it said\nYou know post office box ten Joel you know well then that suffice it's like okay you're Joel that's ten let's go let's vote they can't do that anymore I'm a big problem Steve is where it was the problem\nWhat word is where what was going wrong [noise]\nWell I don't know if there is anything going wrong but I I'm a firm believer in you know everybody's got a type of ID and so uh I think 'cause they get their tribal ... going without an id\nYou know now a lot of it and I get\nThem through ... found him but I think should call they're getting their their whatever whatever they get\nComes through the mail to the post office box so I think that ... ... exactly it makes the point if they get to travel checking it's through the mail and it's the post office box that's pretty good evidence that they know they lived there and that's what they used before\nAnother individual text in and said what Joel another case of guilty until proven innocent\nFair point or we're

[noise] so what are you what are you picking up on when you knock on those doors what are you hearing\nThought a fair amount of frustration especially in the farm community are a lot of them will be okay this year because they forward contracted a their soybeans in particular\nUm next year they're a little bit concerned um that that's the biggest one in the farm community but I I'm picking up that people are really tired of the of the negativity and and I don't think people\nReally care if they get Democrats solutions are Republican solutions they just want to know that their legislators and the people that are serving them\nGenuinely care about them we may not always agree\nBut they just I think they just want to know that people understand what they're going through and and are willing to to listen and to try to help in some way Joel I'm In ... and that being said\nWe're a very red state um people are becoming some people are becoming more partisan\nUm I've heard people are still complaining about the Clintons in Obama and\nSome point you move past that didn't use it tried to you you you rather than keep looking backwards we have to look forward and say OK what can we do to make things better and that's what I Try to do ...\nKnow I'm not sure that that what you're saying is I I Know it's incredibly honorable\nAnd it's how it's ... it's who you are I get that I'm just not thinking it works and let me explain what I'm getting at I I I'm very close to an election this this time I realized that in in elections you you you do some things you make some mistakes here and there I get that that all play itself out yesterday and\nApologies were submitted to ... and we'll see where all that goal is but I Do know this\nThat you can run the most positive race you can based on your record and you can say listen you know this is what I did that this is what I told you I was going to do\nThey kept the promises you know grade me on that but if your opponent runs ads in lies\nYou either punch back or I take it and if you take it oftentimes the next thing you know is all of his court and that's all of his his uh connections that he makes a they end up blasting un whatever media form they can\nYou know when you're up against the juggernaut or when you've got it and I walk or news director at valley in his life when you got a Bill Maher seal senior when you have\nA you know you're up against juggernaut ... in the media world and then I get beat up because she comes on the radio every now and then so how do you counter that Perry\nIn a in a district race or you know we're not\nWe don't get covered by any significant media I mean our our local paper uh down in a hanging soon as the paper the monitor and walk in and has a daily those they do a great job of covering us um they're pretty unbiased um I've not seen a lot of\nBias come out of them that I had to be honest years ago they were when the publisher was alive they they lean pretty hard to the right\nOf that being said even he was was there and again will grant the seeds snooping around he passed away damn time ago yeah I knew it was a tough nut to crack he was but he would always have time for you know I knew this new will just like to scrap a little ... and the more you scrap the more he respected it was an old media guy\nHe was knew it was a pretty neat guy they uh they showed me some holes in the walls in\nThe office of uh where he would throw things and uh and I had a bit of a temper but he was very colorful guy I like ... and you don't notice candidates helper [laughter]\nYou know I'm very well but um [noise] uh I I Am running an ad right now calling out my opponent and and he would call it negative advertising but with Senate bill twenty three twenty three in the last session\nWhere introduced by Joan ... and I believe and I think senator O'Bannon had a um it had a Republican sponsored as well and the uh it was to cut out out of state travel for the legislatures\nAnd at the time when we're in an eight hundred million dollar deficit and they voted against it ... the Republican all voted against it\nIn the Senate I Know I I think it did at one or two Republican uh yes votes but not a huge amount of money close to a million dollars but it makes you wonder when they can't sacrifice out of state travel\nWhat are their priorities at a time when when tuition assistance for veterans is being cut\nAnd I received a I saw an email where\nVeteran who's going to have to drop out of school because he couldn't afford it anymore because the tuition assistance was cut the boy isn't it nice at the legislators were able to go to California and the Los Angeles and go to with a pagan to Kansas City what the hell are our priorities shall\nSee and I don't think that that's dirty campaigning well some people would probably say it is no I don't know if Larry Larry wants to travel all over the countryside and the state's dime and then you don't have enough money to meet your obligation for the tuition for that National Guard\nStudent it's that's a legitimate issue that isn't negative campaigning you didn't say boy I drove by his house and he doesn't always yard right I mean he didn't do\nAnd unlike in in federal legislation you know how it is where one bill will have you know fourteen different issues attached to it and\nSome are good and some are bad this was just a stand alone bill they don't as near as I can tell don't do that in North Dakota that this was a stand alone bill it wasn't attached to some other appropriation bill it wasn't attached to milk for school kids or anything like that this was just to stand alone bill were\nTo cut your travel out of state and they said no we need to keep that [laughter] and they used it [laughter]\nAnd let's get to Tim Tim you're on with Perry Miller\n[noise] yeah I just have a comment and general for it I Know a lot in my district but he said something they're quite interesting or us guys on the right we're supposed to forget\nAbout uh you know Clinton and all of this and we're supposed to forget or sands but uh we got to go back and dig up a stuff thirty five forty years ago on our side you know at that same funny to me\n[laughter] give me an example Tim [noise] it out but what I\nI don't know what you're getting at your we were talking about how testy politics are today and how polarizing I get that\nBut you know ... people what he said what I heard him say was that people when he talks to the individuals from the right they still want to bring up the Clintons they want to bring up the Obamas [noise] um yeah you know for me personally to him\nIn my lifetime one of the most decent men that ever sat in the chair in the oval office just a decent human being was Ronald Reagan\nI'd I thought the world of Ronald brown as a as a man I I I think that when we personalize all this and degrade them you know to to that point and you know if you're going to have a program on bullying and you're going to be millennia Trump I I think she needs to clean up her own house first Tim\n[noise] [laughter] well we should we can say that about the other side to outweigh\nWell give me an example that's why I asked for an example\nWhile I ... the last Supreme Court a circus we had there is a good example of it they're a man convicted before it was uh on on just a here say in a court of law that wouldn't want a healthy\nWell I Will tell you this in a court of law the way that he acted in his testimony went to went five feet so while I agree that the the hearing process wasn't good I totally agree with you on that Tim\nHave you ever been accused of what he was accused though\nI've been accused of a lot of things I wasn't guilty of well have you angry to have you ... exactly\nI have been accused of a similar things totally also in a a that's a hard thing to have to live down\nThere but let me ask you this they tried to destroy that now but\nLet me ask you this Tim what job have you ever applied for or gotten that gave you a lifetime position on the most highest court in the land or anything as powerful as\nThe side the point now not Tim ... is not the oil and not ... ...\n... Tim he had to answer those questions and now he sits on the court so thanks for your call it is not beside the point\nHe he's getting a lifetime position\nThat's way higher thing with all due respect

already forgot\nThe name Merrick Garland I mean they already forgot\nThe good and decent man that was sitting there for a year waiting for a hearing or even a meeting so they don't hold much weight

party issue this this this is everyone's impact\nOr so and then you add on your silver Don ... election mail is it forward it to the new ballots that are male or a ballot a patient buttermilk or not forward it to their Arizona California Florida or are they are of the world\nMan that's an issue [laughter] some real issues are Josh is resonating there are people getting it I'm every time I turn around I see you in a different town that I'm In I mean you must be out there meeting with people\nYes absolutely you know a good challenge with this race is\nYou know people who engage in the office everyday business leaders nonprofit leaders they get it they want change regardless what industry they're in or it was a political stripe is they want someone to there and again that was evident back in March or April when the Republicans that it was time for something to do in the office\nUm but it you know how do we get to those other voters how do they understand that this impacts them too and unfortunately it took a mistake like this out of his office\nAh for us to understand that it's not just when it comes to voting or who can do it this isn't just a Native American idea shoot this is any of us will North Dakota those are the Cass County one mistake or could impact everyone\nKnow Josh keep finding a good fight I think it's resonating with people we're just gonna\nWe're gonna see we're going to see how it does I mean when you when you get the wrong ballot your mail in county I mean come on ... this is it it's not hard to see why papers would get lost on his desk it's hard to figure out why anybody in this day and age would know how to turn on a computer and absolutely that's what I'm\nSeeing a motorcycle his personal life so people don't want to go for me there's another candidate they could vote to or to both of us have business experience both of us know how to work the modern technology um you know people have a choice they don't have to send back the guy that they're trying to get a good retirement plan for twenty six years so\nAll right thank you Josh priests\nBut there are you about Josh pushing ladies and gentlemen out running his race for secretary of state [noise] um I Want to get to a couple of these messages one says Joel I've been to I'm thinking they're thinking three powers of the Native Americans claim they are a sovereign nation and I say that they have no business floating in our elections\nThen okay did you think before you hit send on that one [noise] why are they on the reservations why are they\n... you know there were there were two big mistakes made it\nYou know when it comes to reservations number one the of course the the belief by Native Americans that they were going to get to live their lives the way they wanted to live their lives without any interference that didn't happen the other beliefs and and I wonder if times that isn't true was that the individuals that\nLike my ancestors I Would guess although I think that they came after uh the the the Indian Wars if you look\nAt it they want him to go away\nSo they wanted him on that piece of ground and usually it was the worst ground you could find because they didn't want to give up the good land for telling right so so they put them on ground that you couldn't farm anyway so go ahead and have a big part of the black hills I don't care\nTurns out Black Hills was a bad land to give up right or the badlands of\nFriction there are certain land that was and all that wise to give up land adjacent to the Missouri River where it's\nLowland it's wetland you I mean you see what I'm getting at right\nAnd so all their life they've done what they could to make sure that life was better for their themselves their people to Native Americans are you can you can use all the stereotypes you want but the truth of the matter is yes yes\nThey have a higher rate of alcoholism yes they have a a shorter lifespan\nJust put them in a in a box and ignore them though to sit there and sent me an email saying they shouldn't get to vote in our elections that because they claimed to be a sovereign nation there in a sovereign nation because we made that deal we wanted that deal\nWe wanted them that's how we sold it to them was to be sovereign and then we wanted the other part right\nWe want them to be able to go ahead fight in these wars in terms of soldiers defending this country per race no one has a higher percentage the Native Americans no one period\nMore Native Americans have died for this country as per Native American than me as a white man fighting on behalf of this country you it doesn't take long to get to that statistics that doesn't\nThat's just the truth so don't do not do not send me anything saying that they're not part of this country don't do that um ...\nWe should wait and see on the Saudi Arabian issue we don't know what we know yet thanks agreed I think that we I I think there is a good understanding already of what happened but I also think that is\nThat if the media itself hadn't pushed on this issue it would have got swept under the rug and it would have got swept under the rug by this administration who for what ever reason is willing to look past the atrocity of this incidence incident when it comes to Saudi Arabia\nAnd so you know I posted today on Facebook just to a fair point to ask what the Saudi Arabia have\nUs I mean what what what is it that they have that doesn't make them make us take a look at them and say wait a second here these guys that flew into the twin towers they were ...\nAnd these guys that flew into the Pentagon they were from Saudi Arabia and this guy that was headed towards the capital he was from Saudi Arabia\nI mean what what's going on there that we can't recognize that it's not all hugs and kisses with this regime right we like to use words like regime that's what's going on in Saudi Arabia\nSo now you've got an American reporter going into a Saudi embassy in Turkey and he comes he doesn't come out or if it comes out he comes out and pieces\nThat cannot be ignored all because you'll like hanging out with the prints\nIt can't be and luckily people on both sides of the aisle and Congress have pushed back on that they've pushed back and it wasn't just the Democrats have called the president on that sits both Democrats and Republicans are the pushback\nAnd they need to they need to\nSaudi Arabia we there needs to get resolved in where this tax messengers right is this tax messenger is an individual that says we should wait and get that
