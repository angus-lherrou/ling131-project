in North Dakota former that did build a green been but that's not a long term solution and I'm Amazed that Kramer has so little common sense\nUh Derek after watching the debate if any farmer out their votes for Kramer than they deserve low being prices and they better not complain about it so it really I mean I think\nOne thing about it or the passion I think comes out about this 'cause this is a pocketbook issue I'm going to get to something a little bit later I find interesting there's someone I really call myself a Republican more of a conservative Republican up until about two thousand three and I can get into details airway really became more of an independence\nBut as someone who grew up kind of becoming a Republican as a teenager because Ronald Reagan it's amazing to me how much

what so you're you're using that to occupy a what what I always curious when I hear that out is what legislation is a dead\nBanner in Paul Ryan who the speaker of the house during six of the eight years that President Obama what is it that she was able to vote on when it went from the house to the Senate that she actually voted on what are the details on that\nCampaign ... ... details that that most immaterial how can yes it is it is very material because it's talking about the actual facts\nI mean it's hilarious to me this ad that she she bought so it's ... she bought her a personal bomb eight percent of the time not much legislation got done during the whole time because of who the speaker of the host was throughout six of those years\nI I think it's just ... it looks like she's bought it for me well it'll give me some details of something that she voted on that the legislature legislature passed\nThat she was able to actually voter and that's what I don't get that in by the way the whole six years that she was a senator was pretty much throughout the four years of Obama right\nWell Asperger's and it was the speaker of the house at that time was Republican I mean it's a bunch of garbage Kevin you got to come to the game a little bit more and more the details not talking points from a Republican ad I mean there's nothing there\nSo we can agree to disagree I Know there's not a dollar green you just don't have the facts you're you're an echo chamber for what you hear on the radio you got to be a little bit better to that if you want to bring that to the news of use radio network\nCome on man actually look at this was some details there are some things that I'd never agree with President Obama on I did not think Obamacare was very good at all but I have the

than anything else when it comes to races like this\nIt's it's really a situation where you have people who like the person it's a popularity contest many times and that's no doubt where Hillary lost in two thousand sixteen 'cause in the upper Midwest she just wasn't popular in in Wisconsin and Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania she really wasn't popular and that's why President Trump is the president\nAnd you can also say that about Kevin Cramer now too well and the willpower following this where it would be in a farming problems for things like that he's not popular right now\nWe we still see I mean he's leaving the most of the polls I Would argue some of the numbers of some of these bulls the thanks so much for your call Greg and and that's going to be real the real question is

in solving as long as I've been living going back to when Jimmy Carter was president okay when I was a young person so I've heard this over and over again now there are things that they can do to fix it\nThe biggest thing is the question is going to be for Americans out there is whether or not it's going to take care of the very popular benefit that it has right now is no matter what you say and that's a winning solution for you\nAnd I'll play this back a little bit later with President Trump on the election you know when he was running in the primaries and caucuses in two thousand Fifteen

that they're going to cause security and Medicare\nThat all in fairness he said we have to make reforms right\nNow so that leaves and with a mistake he made I think especially when you have some of these hotly contested house and Senate races that does open up the door for Democrats to do what say hey that they want to have cuts to Social Security Medicare because this has been a fight that's been going on ever since FDR get Social Security\nGoing and ever since LBJ got Medicare going correct\nRight but they they're they're going to make it there they are like Bush ... yards W. H. tried it\nWell he certainly campaigned on giving you the option of not paying into Social Security to have you know you have your own private plan right\nAnd looking at that now and and I I still kind of call myself a Republican back in two thousand\nOne and this is when President Bush came to Fargo is it the ... and sports arena and he was trying to get North Dakota's constituents to do and called Byron and Earl and can say hey you got to vote for the way North Dakota is one of the vote on Social Security on this\nNo never came to fruition but this has been a topic for a long time now I think for a lot of people are going well you look at two thousand eight thank God people didn't get themselves those are the Social Security\nAnd had everything tank and the stock market\nBut this is a battle and it'll be interesting to see who else control and in two thousand Nineteen what the Congress looks like and what they will propose\nTo do that\nThe stock market and the stock market crash darker that\nWell to be fair he didn't want everyone to just get out of Social Security he wanted people to have the option\nThat you wouldn't have to do it but it would have been happier if everybody on\nThe right I mean it's obviously his buddies are donating to them they want people to get out and have that money go to the stock market right I mean there's no question about that I think for me more than anything else\nList and whether you want to call socialism whether you want to I mean you think about President Reagan defending Social Security talking about it all the time and also raising the taxes on it could you imagine a Republican president now\nActually talking about raising the percentage that you pay into Social Security [noise]\nMe Democrats how I think if they want to win this battle they got to hit hard on the raising the cap on Social Security 'cause it's it's pretty low if you look at the rate of inflation since they put that cap in for that really is the thing that they need to hit on if they want to win this debate\nWill talk about the big weekend that are you in the hat in Las Vegas and much much more Derek Hansen in for Joel Heitkamp on news it'd be\nIn the north Dakota crop improvement emptied association is along named to remember about their impact on farming has been unforgettable ... whether you're planning oats Durham hard red spring wheat barley Fox or soybeans you'll find the latest proven NDSU varieties on their new website\nHindi crop improvement dot com threats to go to ... to unseat association financing agriculture through their production promotion and distribution appear seed contact your local seed dealer or go to Andy crop improvement dot com right now this is\nWell I mean I I think you know I think it's fair to say this dark or\nYou know that historically you get eight wins a division one way and she go eight three and a traditional wedding game schedule obviously every\nEvery four or five years you get to play twelve games but uh but you know in Lebanon game season going with three is kind of a number obviously has got a larger forever at this point having you know drop the game against a very good ... ... obviously Weaver has done a nice job there and uh it J hills done a great job so uh\nUh you know fell short brought out one possession short but I gotta work cut out for us we just got to go on the road and take care of business against Idaho\nYeah it's it's going to be an interesting stretch your 'cause yeah you have Idaho and then of course a northern Arizona and so it's going to be a pretty good in Portland they mix in there to writes a winnable games going yeah yeah you gotta you gotta wait a minute [laughter]\nYou got a whim I mean that's it I mean I ... you know we've got no room for error I mean I you know separate for eye is always a crap shoot depending on how the year goes\nAround the country and I think I Would say to be safe I mean like ...

about having basketball be a one semester sports so it starts after Christmas break and then all of a sudden you have instead of March Madness may madness because basketball seems to be more of a spring and summer sport than it ever has before\nYou know I I Am not in those Cornell is you know on and say how so so community and I wasn't in the basketball oversight committee but\nI Wonder if they've had that calendar conversation recently I Know there definitely was conversation a couple of years ago and and not many sports you know cut across both go semesters if you will but\nYou know I I don't know I think in that camp I'll be honest with you I think\nOn the calendar and standpoint it can get a little bit last early in the year right wing obviously football is is is heading toward their bowl season and uh in the ass yes the playoffs so all that to be said I I work before I'll do it for at least just discussions again because you're right\nThat would be an awesome time here and there\nIt's just a better fit the abuse talked about you know they've taken over Christmas so it's almost like they want to start their season then and go well into July but ... but buddy up against so many different uh different types of sports including the world series and all that when I start their season so they could\nBe a no doubt or you're trying to navigate just so many sports at that point in time but we don't who knows maybe that countering will all come back I it it's hard to say but you are right around that spring time so it was like a logical process\nVery good pleasure to
