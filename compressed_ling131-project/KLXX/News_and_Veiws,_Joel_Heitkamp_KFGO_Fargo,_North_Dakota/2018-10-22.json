twelve or one my disability case\nI'm [noise] I'm In constant pain and due to the pain I have depression we cannot get help from doctors and we need something to give us a little relief\nOr this isn't living list is suffering thank you okay so that's I read\nThat and let me read this again and then you tell me the point that it jumps out at you OK says I'm another dawn I was diagnosed with a spine diseases that age of Fifteen at thirty nine I had to quit working in in two thousand twelve I Won my disability case I'm In constant\nPain and constant pain and due to the pain I have depression okay that's the point isn't it\nYou you you heard her say disability case so for many of you because I thought this one I was in the legislature the stereotypes that people had about individuals that had to go on disability they're like either just faking\nWow these people you know look at me I get up every day and I go to work okay so you you you're that strike number one for a lot of you\nThen she mentioned or he mentioned I don't know what what this individual is man or woman doesn't matter or they mentioned that they deal with depression their strike number two a strike too\nYou know [noise] this is the truth for many people\nThis is what they deal with this is the truth\nAnd and they [laughter]\nThey have a way that might help I'm not even saying it will help I'm not saying that at all as much as what I Know this it might it might help and so why in the world when when\nWhat was the vote tally Kelly was sixty three sixty sixty three percent of the it might have even been higher sixty three percent of the people in North Dakota\nI mean when you get sixty three percent of the vote ... if you're on al ... inside of the aisle I mean you're high fiving because it's a landslide we wipe them out yeah okay I get that\nBut what was the Tokyo from green point ... percent right so I'll get to use sixty four that get thrown up rather around down because it's about okay\nSo sixty four percent of the people said yes and we still don't have it [noise] so for this person that just text in with by the way I settled on one area code number they're not welcome to use it [laughter]\nI get it ah\nJoel what does legalizing recreational or we'd have to do with access I thought it's all available to anyone who wants that at least that's what you say when you know illegal\nAt least that's what you say when you know illegal wrecked we'd uh well affect children's so which is that I've said that\nI've said that the vast majority of people that are already smoking weed for the last ... vast majority of people they have a way of finding it I get that\nBut what you don't get is you're making it illegal you know that that it's illegal and that they can go to jail for it and so it is an issue\nOr Sheryl you're on the news and B it's go ahead show\nI have a question where medical marijuana ... a changed your life not recognize to cope with this current day trader ... so it's not as liberal\nI Wish that the medical marijuana people have enough money to sue over that because the truth is they can as long as they don't get sued\nI mean unless somebody takes them to task now the person that should be the champion of what is North Dakota law because when you voted for recreational marijuana or for medical marijuana when you did if you did you ... you made a lot\nI mean that's what you did you voted for a law and and so if they challenged that if the attorney general doesn't advocate on your behalf because he put his right hand the guide and swear to uphold the law you know who's gonna who's going to advocate\nI mean these people had no money and yet they won was sixty four percent of the board so and then then Cheryl let me ask you a question\nFor them to sit there and tell you that it was such a massive would take this long do you believe that you know\nThe un un the vast majority of people there is no way you can make that argument that that well it took that long 'cause we're so poorly written you don't want the biggest thing they're focused on doing you guys if you dig into this you'll find out limiting the amount of people that can benefit not by using it\nBut by growing and selling it\nTo their narrowing that scope so much\nIt accordance with the pharmaceutical industry on the national level and locally they're making it so that\nLocal good local pharmacists are are going to walk away from dealing with it because they put so many rules and rags you want to talk about people that you know I I stand against regulation yeah All right [noise] yeah right look what you're doing on this part\nAll right we'll be back in\nCombination of separately registered products that are more performing than any other looking like the three\nPeople's morals who if we were having a debate over medical marijuana recreational marijuana and these legislators we're going to vote no on it that's a whole separate issue\nFor you people that are voting no separate issue you get a chance to vote no what I'm Talking about is the fact that there Paul Ready was the vote\nAnd sixty four percent of the people said yes and that's exactly what went down uh and so because of that I think that the recreational marijuana has a bigger chance Justin you're on the news and describe Justin\nMartin Morning to you I'm the medical bill was was butchered a lot of people got eliminated out of qualifying for medical marijuana\nAnd the doctors came out and said we're not going to prescribe it to anybody here besides maybe a document cargo so so you really don't have a choice everybody saying oh you got medical marijuana don't and uh it doesn't sound like are ever going to get it\nAt least for two years after it's implemented so they can change it and add KTBS a depression you know everything that are are ...\nAnd then also it legalized this camp a thick and thin is ... a turning over there\nI Believe there is a refinery to make vegetable oil or small seed oil so him in western North Dakota can you process for oil in their consent\nAnd it's ten times more than a week now and then also to the side value of ham is forty percent pro chain with a little bit of moisture and also it turns their soil and the\nTurns it into a profitable a piece of land\nThat could Justin I'm with you I was one of the original sponsors of legalizing the ability to grow up in North Dakota or the time that we were doing that you know marketplace there wasn't an alternative crop on the north end of the valley in the northern tier and it just didn't make sense to us why the government encouraged you to grow hemp\n... you know before it was clear that if you were worried about it being used as a drug it couldn't be you know when they talked about what you can hide part in the middle of a help field there was all kinds of evidence that showed cross ...\nThe drug it couldn't be you know when they talked about well you can hide part in the middle of a hemp field there was all kinds of evidence that showed cross pollination was going to wreck the pot okay but heaven forbid we'd let you know facts get in the way I'm here's\nHere's the note from a legislator that trust it says originally health department said they'd hire thirty two people for medical marijuana they hired three three or no wonder we don't have this uh blame the governor to Joel that needs to get out there so there are there we are\nUm let's get back to the phone lines in this time it's Bob Bob you're on news this\nMorning Joe morning to you know I I agree with everybody I've heard in the last half hour and my steamed with are copper here's here's the take away I'm getting from this ... he went to court I'm just on the east side of the river\nIt is time for everybody to vote straight ticket

power cooperative\nAnd the north Dakota petroleum council and when ... they said there was only one individual donation that wasn't accounting for so it's all lobbyists and energy\nGoes that sound like some high powered lobbyist clarity you\nWell yeah I just thought maybe there I'd be a name like al Carlson because he's at the top of the list all of this\nWell let me know what I mean they're they're all bad Carlson supporters Larry ... you know actually there is a there was a fundraiser done that raised over eighty thousand dollars in Bismarck for ALS\nPack and and what happened in that Larry and a lot of people got to get elected because of that he can sprinkle the candy Iran right\n... right and here's two grand Joel you're running here's two grand here's you know that type of
