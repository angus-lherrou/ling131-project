compromised\nWhen they get is um [noise] it is cracking and and\nOkay so if we got in there and we started digging away at the wood and getting rid of the paint\nAnd uh there there are certainly ways to repair it\nUm but I Can't tell you if it's if you should repaired or you should replace it that's kind of your decision but we can talk about repairing it if it looks like it's a little too much maybe it is time to go ahead and replace it\nAnd then the other question is how did it become compromised to begin with was the just the paint was compromised\nIn the water got all that and that's what causes the rod or is there something going on above the door that's causing the would the rod so\nReally the pain was compromise\nOkay there's a I'm a product line called Abbott fraud and what

residues they have non non standing a different uh sprays also so I don't know what they used a good all purpose exterior cleaner\nAnd as I mentioned this many times is oxygen needed bleach\nThat are due mole mildew probably it'll do uh they'll definitely do dirt I'm In probably remove some residue products but oxygen they bleach\nWould be um an excellent uh type products that you could use on the exterior home a lot of the hardware stores do carry and oxygen aided bleach whether it's a missionary cleaner or whether it's a debt cleaner a lot of them are a\nA R she dated bleach basis so that's
