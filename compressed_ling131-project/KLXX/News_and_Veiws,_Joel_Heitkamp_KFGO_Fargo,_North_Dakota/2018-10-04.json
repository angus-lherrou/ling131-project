to be [noise]\nSee the team at the unseen national bank\nThere's a fiancee national bank near you member FDIC [noise]\nThree seven five nine for a one eight hundred and eight oh five three four six let me be perfectly clear about my position\nAbsolutely clear is if I haven't been before we do not have a farm bill because someone took the position that snap needs to be out of the farm bill\nHas been a partnership that has worked on behalf of you to farmers you the egg community you the people buying from and selling to farmers used the individuals who\nFor that one bit agriculture has been there for this state for years for years oil prices have gone up\nThey've gone down asked the folks in Williams county which is the hub of\nAll this the base of the the Bach and ask them\nThey know what it's like to be hot they know what it's like to be called oil has produced for this state revenue that we never saw coming recently and some of that revenue if not the majority of that revenue needs to be put back\nAs an investment into the area that is producing that product I've been crystal clear on that as well\nThat we can sit here in the east and say boy it's our turn you know what we're not the one dealing with all the additional traffic we're not dealing with the fact that our school can hold the students were not dealing with the fact that you can't get on the highway with a combine on number two\nWe're not dealing with that they are and so what\nWe can do to improve that is something that the whole state owns to western North Dakota so I recognize I fully recognize the impacts of oil and what it does to our economy I have always been there when it comes to making an infrastructure investment into that\nAnd if you say we shouldn't be involved in schools is a state in terms of building schools expanding schools your\nWrong because as a state we benefit from it [noise] but agriculture agriculture\nLadies and gentlemen is the foundation that our economy is built on it always will be so let's go to what's going on and agriculture right now [noise] here's what's going on in agriculture right now what's going on and agriculture right now is pretty simple to explain\nPrices are down prices went down before the tariffs after the tariffs they're\nDown more they're down more the egg bill is the certainty when it comes to people that lend money people lend money and have to make operating loans work want to know what's in the farm bill\nBecause that's the insurance policy okay so you've got low prices in the beginning you've got tariffs and then you have a farm bill that is in place so what do you have coming do\nWell first off you're already combine and your Soviet soybeans many of you already have you done others you're in what conditions right now in the east where you can't get them done\nBut the truth of the matter is soybeans have been you're saving grace and the last couple of years whether it's healed or whether it's sales or whether it's price or whether it's access to the markets soybeans have been there for the state of North Dakota\nIt's not that way anymore it's not that way right now so I beans are taking a whooping because of policy decisions that can change tomorrow but it's not going to change over all what affects you and affected you Ted day\nAsk them ask the people that buy and sell and move ask up\nAnd say despite whatever political leanings they have will be honest with you I've put them on this show I've made sure people know I made sure we had a discussion about it\nSo let's go to two of the problems the farm bill and tariffs\nJust heard Debbie Stabenow who has worked with Senator Robert ... a Republican\nI'm Bill and tariffs\nYou just heard Debbie Stabenow who has worked with Senator Robert so Republican out of Kansas both as a majority member and as a minority member you have heard the fact that they with over any votes the largest vote total on an egg bill passed a\nThe egg bill in the Senate and that's what they brought to the conference committee that's what they said this is a model that's what Collin Peterson\nWho has been the majority of the who has been the chair as a majority member of the house ethics committee and now is the ranking minority member said is a good bill he's in the house ladies and gentleman they don't normally look at the Senate bills and and compliment them\nThey take pride in their own work but Collin Peterson has had the the\nThe the fiber to go ahead and do that\nAnd be courageous and say look this is what's happening to egg producers he's\nBeen there champion okay so you've got tariffs you've got policy decisions in a farm bill\nKevin Cramer supports both of those and he has he supports the tariffs and he has caused the problem with the farm bill he and the majority of house members by two votes when they hold the majority by way more than two votes\nHave excluded snap\nOut of the whole farm bill situation they're going to lose on that they're going to lose on that big time they're going to be in a position where they have to compromise and snap will be included in the farm bill\nThat the fact they're sitting\nThere saying it's because of a work condition that people who receive snap have to prove that they're working it's already on the farm bill\nIt's already in the fact\nThat's been a policy for a long time in fact Collin Peterson pointed that out as well isn't perfect\nNo\nNo it's not perfect couldn't get better yes it could but to sit there and divide the coalitions and the partnerships that we have made on the farm bill is ridiculous and it puts farmers at risk [noise]\nAnd you can ... you can just probably sit there and say well we show them those welfare moms you know what\nA lot of elderly receive snap\nA lot of people with certain with certain issues and board a certain way receive snap\nSo go ahead find a train push 'em under it go ahead divide and think you're going to conquer\nBut as Debbie Stabenow pointed out it's not the problem of the Senate\nBack with your thoughts right after the\nBut tensions sugar beet farmers villa showed his proud to announce new improved sugary varieties to optimize sugar production and increase profits really showed his combine conventional breeding em testing to develop stress tolerant me to withstand or valleys whether village Shaw\nYou bet I do he showed a temperament that when challenged does not belong on the Supreme Court so that is another issue that I Would have he wouldn't get my vote\nHe wouldn't get my vote no all of you can say well what he's being accused of wrong absolutely wrong the way they handled it\nWho is telling the truth or not clear that I just you know who I Believe\n\nI Believe that such\nWhen ... got a comment\n\nWould be the day I'd sell my soul that'd be the day\nThat I couldn't look at myself and say look you're doing this just simply because of reelection you're doing this\nAnd play catering people because you even though you don't believe that want them to like you\nKevin Cramer wants the president to like him this the guy that went for the hog and got the handshake he wants the president to like him\nI guess that I understand that\nYou know what I respect people a lot more when they challenge me and when they sit there and they want me they want me to think about their position and look at things from their side and not just say this man has my vote a hunter\nUh me to think about their position and look at things from their side and not just say this man has my vote a hundred percent of the time let's get to the phone lines Jim you're on news ... go ahead Jim\nThan my aunt Marta ... yeah I'm\nI'm just listening to mine and I'm\nKevin Cramer has no idea where he doesn't have a clue what goes on on family farms in central North Dakota where I'm from\nAnd he just doesn't get it now Holly's effect in families and and now I'm I'm voting for Haiti all away and um\nI I just you know Kevin came out ... take away his bread and butter and in big paychecks and let him style for a while and then he'll get it\nJim what are the people you have coffee with saying\nYeah I have a coffee was quite as hail farmer and said I grew up on a farm by new Rockford Cancun area and that they're they're really disgusted with these tariffs because its effectiveness rising prices of course\nNo thank you gentlemen appreciate all of you know and I get a lot of the other response I I get a lot of judge Kavanaugh should be on the bench that any vote against him as a vote against what North Dakota is believe\nI get a lot of that um [noise] you know again I I personally couldn't sell my soul to that I couldn't uh Larry you're on news ... go ahead Larry\nHi Joe say I'm pretty much what the fellow who just called in but I'll tell ya I wrote to I write to my my senators and representatives\nWrote to uh to senator Heitkamp early on that I wrote to hold him holding a number of those any good\nBut I wrote a highly early on and then I said you know maybe it shouldn't die on this hill uh just give up the cabin on that will you know let let the ... pound or to the the right on this one\nThem I listen to the hearings and I saw this real Kavanaugh how he\nPolarized Holly work to divide us as an American and he'll continue to do that on the Supreme Court we need people to put us together so I wrote to her again\nAnd I wrote last week and I said please unable to hold them to please vote no on Kavanaugh I'd I don't understand Joel why\nWhy at this point she hasn't come out strongly against Kavanaugh I mean if there are Neanderthals in North Dakota that will hold her to the fire for that when when Kramer is working our agriculture with his supportive crumbs policies I just don't get it I mean why isn't she come out\nBut it's a good question and a question I've asked her myself I'm you know it's it's very clear that Heidi made a choice to run a positive campaign it's also very clear through politics in any state or anywhere that\nYou are that that use the general public in and don't\nYou respond to negative campaigns ... you know why do people run negative ads because they work\nThat among thinkers through largely but that that's why they're you know that and I know that al ... and so you can run a positive campaign and you can sit there and in and look people in the eye and say look I I I did a good job for you you know I held my meetings with you I\nMy certain beliefs and I can't sell out on those but the fact of the matter is you know I I Want to tell you what I did and then let you judge by that at some point you got a bunch\nOh yeah have to punch back\nAnd she and she has given the right to North Dakota orchards fifty nine percent pro Trump and all that has given them a lot of what they want it but on this issue\nShe is entitled to vote on behalf of those of us who strongly support her and support the progressive causes and um she's got to come over to our side on this one I mean she can't give this to the right to\nYeah thank you Larry appreciate it I ... I don't know how she's going to vote I Do not know for people who think I Know I Do not know\nI Know that that when it comes to all of this if she wants to be re elected with these apps one of the things that everybody asks about they don't ask about what the right thing to do is they ask about which way it helps her to be reelected\nIt's very clear by these poll numbers of people keep floating whether you believe them or not\nIt's very clear that people believe she needs to vote for judge Kavanaugh to get reelected okay that should not be your barometer of whether or not you cast a vote\nLet's not forget that Heidi Heitkamp voted for Judge Gorsuch Judge Gorsuch is a conservative because she is someone who went through the trial process he\nHe was appointed by\nYoung man is going to be on a court for a long time it would be very hard if not impossible to get Judge Gorsuch to act the way judge Kavanaugh\nDid with Amy ... are you you wouldn't see him do that\nI don't think you'd see any other person on the court other than that you know Justice Thomas do that and Justice Thomas has not been a good member of the Supreme Court his opinions that he's written\nWhat he has ... he he doesn't even ask a question on the court\nHe doesn't even have the ability to challenge somebody in that room on the court by asking them questions\nSo yes I don't believe that that Justice Thomas has been a good member of the Supreme Court and I don't say people believed that at the time and they took him out for a walk in the hearings and they asked them tough questions and they saw how you reacted that's their job you don't get a lifetime appointment I don't care\nIf they're saying well he had a lifetime appointment on the federal courts already just the Supreme Court playing this gentleman this is the Supreme Court\nThen why we keep looking for individuals\nThat don't met meat or that do meet a certain criteria that they had to go to this prep school that they had to go to an Ivy League law school that they had to do this there are a lot of conservative lawyers out there that would make great Supreme Court justices a lot\nBut we get tied into the individuals that would possibly make sure that if I as a president ever get challenged legally they'd have my back\nAnd that's why he got the appointment let's get to the weather came\nFind out what he's got going on in the whether they're a little with a light rain at all I mix moving in from southern South Dakota spreading northward\nInto the central part of South Dakota little head over toward the Dakotas border area later on today and spread northward from there [noise] uh temperatures and the critical areas of the atmosphere will be cold enough so that many of us will actually get some snow all of this is actually whether advisory for the devils lake base from the area\nAll tonight into early tomorrow morning northern Minnesota gives you a three to three inches\nSouthern half of the valley and software will probably get about a trace to maybe a trace to wander parenting\nBut certainly not a big storm for ... except for maybe the devils like based on the northern Minnesota were a couple of true a few inches of snow or certainly a possibility with this system cold temperatures will continue looks like mainly rainfall across much of the reason we're over the dry weekend for most of us but surely tempted forties today thirties tonight forties tomorrow for most of us right now Minneapolis thirty nine to\nBe on your way to reaching page one a Google Search result my name is Lisa our\nSales manager at town square media I Would like to introduce you to Aaron Brennan our local town square interactive marketing consultant Darren tell us a little bit about\nYourself I Am originally from Ireland that I came here and twenty Thirteen to play soccer at the University of Mary I recently just graduated with my masters in business administration don't sign met the so she can be surely find me was the son coaching soccer learn how town square interactive can help market your small business all seven oh one\nNinety five five feet won three five more online ahead town square interactive dot com we will help town square interactive dot com\n... well I'm Seventy K.

H. O. one forty five ex brand soybeans out yielded as grow a gene double o eight X. seven five five point six bushels per acre in a trial\nCorrect it is a cash settlements it's not a Vegas seed in his cash on hand the form itself does not take long to complete\nAnd um when you're looking at completing that form it's um you know you don't need a lot of information to do that if you have questions uh it's it's pretty right up front with a number to call\nNow let's assume that you have timely submitted the claim form the next question is\nWhen do we get paid we've talked about that cash settlement when do we get paid now the amount that you will receive as a corn producer is going to be based on on like a indicated the years twenty Thirteen through twenty Seventeen Eighteen he'll be paid on the county average which is not a\nA certainly not the best case scenario we're hoping that it would be actual production but it is based on the Kony average\nIt'll be the county average on the acres that you farmed and the amount per bushel will be allocated over a five year period of time so it's kind of a weighted average it's not a hundred percent of your bushels it's a percentage that changes each year\nThat'll give you the number of bushels per year number bushels goes into the pot and then at the pro Bush will once once that pot has decided now what does that pot\nRight now one point five one billion is the growth settlements or the court will decide the costs the litigation costs the fees the attorneys' fees that will be net it out and then you get the PR bushel acreage or costs that'll go to the park roller\nAnd when will they receive payments that it did the last settlement will be payment will be funded by Syngenta sometime in April twenty Nineteen we anticipate payments we'll go out to farmers after that date\nBecause you don't know the date but we did not I don't know how you would and and the other part that you made about you know individually\nThat date okay you don't know the date but we did not I don't know how you would and and the other part that you made about you know individual yields now you're in the after say office I mean I don't know how you know you could make this a timely manner if he didn't use the county average I understand that\n... I get that so how many ... is this because the deadline is really short for when they sign up and I asked you to come into kind of explain this to people have already been doing this or is this information just going out to them now\nNow this is something that the information has gone out over the last several months and so if you're our client you would have received at least for notices from us within the last three months\nSo how many of done their homework and said this in a percentage absolutely absolutely or trying to do here is is tie in with those last stragglers and say you know what this is another medium to try to get older you\nThat says this is and it is the the deadline is next friday do not way to go on line because if you had any problems with the claim process and the deadline passes then you've just lost the opportunity to have that cash settlements\nHow big of a hurdle was that when they switched on her show\nWe did not notice any impact on the litigation\nOkay so that the the the new owners who's paying the the one point five million\nAnd I don't know if the sale has been officially approved in ... through Syngenta is paying the one point five one billion or as far as whether it comes from the old company or a new company that I don't have the information\nSo for you as somebody representing all these clients was there ever a fear through that process that one they were going to file bankruptcy that to uh because of this ownership you're going to end up fighting somebody over in China\nI think the concern was yes how does the sale in fact the litigation and how is it how does it ultimately impact our producers and in this case we did not see the impact um we saw the concern\nBut with any sale of a business you still have the liability and a liability was the litigation and the litigation remained whether the company was going to sell or not sell that liability had to be addressed\nAnd it's interesting I mean how this all went about uh when you say the lead attorney I think that a lot of people don't understand the legal these but talk to me about that\nSo in the federal class action the federal court in Kansas appointed five lead counsel those lead council um are located in in Texas in Kansas and Missouri and we have um contracted to work directly with them\nBecause the the pictures broader correct you or their surrogate here in North Dakota correct okay\nAnd the benefit as when we have issues I can call lead counsel and say hey this is what's going on with our North Dakota corn growers or Minnesota corn growers um can you get me an answer can you help us and and they immediately respond and help and so it's nice to have that direct contact\nSo I Know that you can't talk to me about individual quiet name so I get that but\nCan you give me a number of how many farmers of came in and said you know what I Want to be part of this\nI'm\nTrying to think if we have a number I Know that I'm\nLaw I\nAnd the husband he said I'm not talking on the radio Mr ... good friends are scared of jail\nAnd the news news radio network ... well I think we had over two thousand clients okay twin or North Dakota Minnesota I'd want to do a lot that's an awful lot so they lessened when we when we came about\nIt's okay to in or North Dakota Minnesota client until\nThat is a lot that's an awful lot so they lessened when we when we came about asking I mean you were in the studio a lotta times saying look\nYou gotta get signed up for this I Know that for many of the farmers I talked to was kind of uh what can I lose they weren't paying you to do this work you are taking a gamble on whether or not you could win right\nCorrect hunting and we think are best for over four years I mean so this this hasn't been an easy process and it's been a long process that we have done\nYou know we have done many town hall meetings throughout the state of North Dakota and Minnesota we have been on your show we have answered calls a when you call our office we answer the phone and we work directly with you and that's the benefit\nAll right so if people have questions about this about what you just explained because of that how do they reach you\nSeven oh one two three five thirty three hundred now repeated seven oh one two three five thirty three hundred\nAnd ... and you can always go on the website Anderson botch role and get a hold of me that way you can\nYou can to file your claim go on the website WWW dot corn seed settlement dot com\nThat's easy to remember ... settlement dot com [noise]\nFeel good to be at this point it does does it is it they're going to be bad if I ask this they don't know if you can't answer but what's the average uh I Know it's about you know how much you raised and how much you you know the county average wise but how much are they going to get\nYou know that's a tough one because it depends on how many farmers file a claim ... bushel cost is based upon the number of claims that are filed and so we don't know that last part of the formula\nSo if there's a thousand bushels\nAnd you have a hundred people making a claim versus fifty people making a claim that the if it's only fifty you're going to get more money correct All right I get it I totally get it\nThank you I was pretty law for a week you know that right well you quit looking at me that
