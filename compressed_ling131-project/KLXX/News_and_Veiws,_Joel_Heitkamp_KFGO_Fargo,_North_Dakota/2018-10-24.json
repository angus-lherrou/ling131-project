and had a man\nWho is trying to juggle appalled by the athletes strike right now he's manager of the airport authority after the good news that is that's great to be on thanks for coming his life it's wonderful it's just an exciting time to be in Williston North Dakota so many hours you put a get a day just to be honest\nUh somewhere around ten or twelve yeah it ends on Monday fizzy tell them what what you have going on it's best described by you yeah absolutely\nWe have as a as a mayor was talking about a little earlier we have an between Seventeen and thirty projects going on at any given time out we have all the site utilities being installed we have wrote improvements from our new bypass at the state installed around will listen to connect to the new property under construction right now\nAnd then all of the truly exciting things for me at least aviation related we have a runway or taxi ways and our commercial terminal being constructed additionally our new fire station and snow removal equipment buildings started construction a few weeks ago\nSo all of those different items are constantly in a state of evolved mentioned development\nAnd is truly exciting Everytime I go out there every day it's a different project there's new contractors onsite\nNew walls going up on facilities additional areas being developed for apron spaces for ... for a aircraft parking and for a private businesses to develop their areas so it is truly amazing to see the the uh the development going on out there\nWith any project where you've got the checkbook you put dates and they're when things have to be completed so\nWhat what are we looking at a ... whether whether airport or winter airplanes going to start\nOf their airplanes will start landing on October tenth of two thousand Nineteen so we have less than one year until we're commenting operations and and that's how we we base our schedule off of that date where we push back from there\nAh we have set time lines that we have to meet for our runways are taxi weights especially because they have really stringent testing criteria by the way to make sure that we have\nUm the instrument approaches and things of that nature tested in approved prior to come and see operations\nAnd and then really are our commercial terminal is probably the the longest build time it's about a twenty four months construction period for that it's a hundred thousand square foot building and\nFor months construction period for that it's a hundred thousand square foot building and we need to make sure that it is done and ready to commence operations meets all of the TSA and the ethical standards as well as all of the other tenants that are going to operate their rental cars our uh\nOur restaurant and bar operator and things of that nature so how big of a plane can be a land out there how big of an aircraft can come in\nYeah so we can we can handle an airplane about two hundred thousand pounds so that's about two hundred and twenty five passenger aircraft as the largest we could handle so\nI'm like seven fifty seven or something along those lines but really the design aircraft that we anticipate having more steady service would be somewhere around a hundred and fifty passengers or a hundred and sixty passengers but you weren't afraid to build big enough to grow correct so the city commission really stepped up\nAnd up the FAA\nDetermined that our weight bearing capacity in our our facility should be built to handle no more than really a hundred and fifty passenger plane\nAnd these payments are built the last Thirty years so we wanted to make sure that we didn't put ourselves in a position where we didn't have an opportunity to grow should the industry need to grow\nWith larger airplanes so that the city of well it's been stepped up an added extra concrete for our runway taxi way in our parking areas to make sure that we can handle larger aircraft and what the FAA felt was\nSo are the ones that made sure it wasn't the FAA so correct Anthony I don't know how you do have ads but congratulations to you for doing it I I think it just says a lot about the vision that people have at a community and\nWhen the the the new bar better comes out on a visit you appreciate that that'd be great to have you out how many gates again so we'll have four gates three passenger boarding bridges tied great job just great job I Know it was controversial\nAnd it's like anything whether it's controversial like Fargo dome in Fargo surveys like wow we don't need that now when the ... and boy they need it and when the concerts come when spring comes they need it so\nFast that he thinks it's time to come see us Sean Waco it's going to join us after that yeah that shot or we're going to talk to him about how he's he juggle all these balls and puts it together because it's getting inside some surprises who might be coming to town and\nUsually doesn't but I'll Try again today for\n\nWell I get I that's probably the number one thing that we do get beat up quite a bit in the office I'm of economic development it is we we are behind a bit on the retail ... and probably a little bit on the restaurant specifically fast food\nOr I could tell you this is I've got at least five different developers are that are working hard to attract retail into this community and there was a tremendous amount of interest in in that retail and we're talking the mid sized junior boxes to big box stores\nYou know we want to make sure we compliment what we have you know don't take away from your downtown charm but you know there's certain things that people want\nBut these guys are working hard and there's a lot of this retail is right on the edge and they just haven't taken the step yet there may be waiting for their counterparts to take the step it's going to happen is probably happen slower than I have but that's probably the number one thing I get through so we want more retail we want more restaurants\nOr looking at the back of our cars suicide in mind when we went home last time I would say you're retail is pretty healthy [laughter]\nI left with a lot of things that day and you know I'm not one of those impulse buyers and\nYou know the we bought a lot of things now tell us we've got we've got some unique stores are in and out of some of the chicken for my brother [laughter] whatever reason he's into chickens you know it it and you know the decoration I mean his house as all these ceramic whatever yeah I just described his weird life but\nI so I bought this chicken downtown well is that you saw what airport I came home and I just like oh man\nI never said that I found out what was your ear\nExactly right and we tried to point that out I mean what you know these unique stores that you have in downtown Willis and that's what makes your town you know in in the same thing when you get outside of the of chain restaurants and stuff that you know and not seeing chain restaurants are bad because you need them for community but she always when you get the the mom and pop that has popped up or something unique that's that's what makes your town\nAnd I know this is going to be self serving but\nYou know my wife came with me too well as in one time or I came with her I don't know how you want to define it but she's the the president of Catholic house you know home health care and hospice and we came up for their bank with and I thought you know okay you know\nI never never thought I was going to see that many people in that room and I never thought they were going to raise that much money at night I Know the staff here does a really really good job but man your community got behind it yeah I just was so impressed by that's\nThat's one thing about it we'll see you'll find that the people are very friendly in in the people will get behind the residents of Williston and support the entities that needs to be supported so you know like what you saw a C H I you know that's about the same with about ...\nIt's very surprising amount of money that is raised for these are for that sort of purpose so years ago you and I talked about partnering cities we we talked about you know cities that you can work together on I\n... and correct me if I'm wrong but you had a relationship with Rapid City at one point or was it\nIt was somebody in South Dakota that that you were able to talk to and and give each other ideas are you still doing something like that\nYeah you know we still try to keep a lot of conversations probably closer to home um you know our relationship is very good with the with the with water for cities and in the ... Stanley Crosby is you'll see we've got a regional board that has you know all those cities in the west represented\nTo talk about what's going on on a regional perspective\nUh this summer we actually just had Midland, Texas up here for a visit there was city officials from Midland, Texas and what was unique about that as you'd think middling\nThey've been doing oil and gas for this amount of time and in the city is you know probably two hundred thousand plus you know I'm not sure what the population is but\nYou know you think we would go down there and in really want to learn from them and and they came up and said you know you guys have done some really good things that we want to kind of learn from it we want to pick your brain on so that was that was really nice to have them come up as a compliment yeah we they must be doing something right here yeah you know the other part is that the college itself\nThat most people when I went home last time we talked about this I I was out at well since ... and I try to explain to people\nThat if if you live in a certain county you're not going to pay tuition right that people don't believe me on that show [laughter] and then you expanded the footprint that you we did I I Want to say it's it's within a ten county region now or it gets into eastern Montana and I believe it gets up to Canada as well you know as it should\nFor for those of you who are paying into the state university system\nThat is a perfect footprint for you because what you need in this town more than anything as workers yep and if they come to well a center and they fall in love with will send you a God I'm ripe Afghan ds you ask you Andy and so\nGoing out there and reaching in Montana and can it just makes sense to me yeah and there's there's cases out there where we have seen a individuals' family is from it even outside of of you we're Montana and North Dakota\nThe move to Willis and specifically so their kids could finish high school within that ten counter region so their kids would have a shot to go to college because where they are living there probably wasn't a chance you know maybe it was financial issues that they couldn't go in and so we're we have cases where that has happened in you've got new residents who your community\nShot in the last where it goes to you what do you want to tell people about what we'll send you got a lot of people listening right now they make sure you use that opportunity well you know I Can't I Can't stress enough the the current activity that's out there and this is the city it's on the move\nAnd um I think you're going to see quite a few changes you know going into twenty Nineteen or what I saw a lot in in twenty Eighteen was what I Would say is a lot of people putting their chess pieces into play market came back\nFeeling a little bit more comfortable about the market I think we're going to see a lot of things pulled the trigger and twenty Nineteen so you know don't don't ever think it's slow here because it hasn't been not only going to slow down anytime soon well they didn't leave when the market went to the correct I mean what does that tell you correct tells me you're winning shot

originally from Fergus Falls my brother and I grew up there and my parents threatened Laurel still a run ...\nCenter there and a two years ago the Wilson dealership came up for sale and we looked out at the economic opportunity here and just\nJust really felt like it was the right move to come out here so my wife and I moved out here two years ago and ... and then last year the tickets and Ford dealership came up for sale and required that so my brother\nAs it sounds different style you know you're beautiful country here but it's not exactly legs ... yeah it's it's different I think a temperature wise you can get comfortable with it but uh but the landscapes of different uh the dynamic is a bit different but what's really been great about will stand for us moving in\nUm as a young family ah we just had our first son or four months ago there there are so many young families here and there's a lot of people from around the country that have moved in\n'em and I a lot of local events the women's network et cetera that's really been great for my wife to become a part of the community and a lot of longtime residents have taken as soon as well so\nI'm One of those guys that when I drive around I look at what people are driving in terms of pickups the rest of it I Can't tell the difference anymore but and then in parking lots of hotels which I had a lot for it's got a big footprint here\nThey do they do that at market share is is almost forty percent which are especially on the truck side which which is outstanding nationally\nAnd a ... you look around and it's it's that the type of of uses people have for these vehicles people want trucks they want dependable trucks and uh and Ford makes an outstanding line up and and you know we're trying to make sure\nWe get the inventory in the service to to make that happen oh you know before we went on air would I drive so let me ask it this way is the Ford F. one fifty still the number one truck in America it is it is forty one years in a row and a Ford is pushing hard to make that forty two\nI just wanted to get that out there so for all my Chevy buddies they can go ahead and pick on me the text messages won't comment a little bit so for the Nelson family to say you know what we want to be there we want to be an ... and ... and we want to be A.N Wilson was that a hard call\nA it was it was something we thought a lot about 'em because granted we're one state over but it is it's about a seven hour drive from the lakes country it is it is a different dynamic but\nUm we looked at was especially when they're looking at ... and it was still summer of twenty sixteen the incremental pick up we've seen since then\nWasn't necessarily there yet and wasn't forecast that but even at that time a ... the number of trucks operating out here supporting farming ranching in the production side of the oil industry was was tremendous and a\nA big thing we focus on when when evaluating dealerships is the

I Want to say six or seven different states we have I'm from Michigan we have I'm from Oklahoma we have them from Colorado and even California Nevada\nAnd uh the the opportunity out here is\nIs one wages are good there's no doubt about that I'm into the volume of work that we can keep in front of the technicians 'cause it's a it's a commission based pay plan they're not allowed in about an hour to Mara we can't we cannot match anybody around and then we've been working hard since we've gotten here but it's a multi year process of identifying young kids from the area\nOr that they want to be technicians and want to stay here and and we're working on an investing in them it it takes you know in excess of five years to really develop a full wind technician\nAnd you know the customers come

for some of our fleet and commercial customers\nWe let them know that you know you may do better just bring this this you know excessively high mileage use diesel pick up to an auction because\nUh we

creative I've been a musician all my life music was my first love I Can't take life on the road\nSo my dad actually got a line on this old diamond cutter down in Nevada who is taking on apprentices\nOutside of the Jewish faith before that you had to have a Jewish uncle to be a dime and got her so um my brother and I both went down and applied and were accepted an apprentice or for three years came back to well listed in Nineteen Seventy six and open to small diamond cutting shop\nSecond story above cooks on main way in the back of the building my dad's dental officers were in front\nAnd uh we cut diamonds from rough to finish um after my apprenticeship I went out to the gym a logical Institute of America in LA and took courses there and the jewelry arts appraisal repairs diamonds setting\nAnd I ended up lecturing the staff out there on setting using the grain of a diamond which was knowledge I gained from diamond cutting to make it a safer setting job and uh because of that they gave us referrals for about ten years up here and ... and\nAnd uh\nWe had lots of trade were broken stones burns stones damage stones old mines stones which were cut prior to Nineteen thirty re cut to modern proportions that kind of work\nAnd then we also started a small costume jewelry shop and repair on jewelry and\nEventually went down to main street and bought an existing store and we've been there for forty some years what goes in to training something like that it something that is valuable as that you mess up you messed up you know you don't mess up you know that's why you have a three year apprenticeship [noise]\nSome people have the aptitude for that type of work\nSome people don't it's a lot of mathematics okay\nA diamond it's the hardest thing on earth the the rough crystal lives in ... to ... like a pyramid on a pyramid\nAnd to cut that material you have to use diamond dust but more than that you have to cut on the grain each ribbon on that crystal loser

naturally ... and we smear that um the wheel and that's\nThe diamond that you're cutting basically is a diamond that cuts the time and you start with that dust but when you're on grain all the material that you remove from the stone you're cutting is imbedded in the wheel\nAnd that ends up being the diamond the\nCuts the diamond I'm not talking about art which is really what you're describing to me is a work of art I'm Talking in my day we used diamond vetted a you know blades diamond vetted a you know ... to just cut through concrete you know and and we had to have that or we were never going to get through it and there's\nThere's many many industrial uses for diamond as well I have friends in the trade\nThat I apprentice with that went off in different directions I've got a good friend stayed in Nevada and started an optical surgical instrument company with diamond blades for optical surgery and has been very successful for forty years and\nSo so sharp so tough they
