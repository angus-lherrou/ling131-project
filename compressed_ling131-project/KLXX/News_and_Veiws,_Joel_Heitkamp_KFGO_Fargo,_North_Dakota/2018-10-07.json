Arizona welcome to the Ramsey show bread what's up\n[noise] All right thanks for taking my call do sure how can I help my other question are we are my wife are just getting started and baby step to uh we've got about Ninety thousand in uh\nThree vehicles two of them are mine that I use for work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have a\nA commuter car that I use regularly on most days of the week but the truck I have to use once per week to call a trailer her car she is a it was about eleven thousand on and it's ... percent interest [noise]\nWe could probably get by just sharing my two vehicles [noise]\nUm but we just didn't know since the car loan is is there a ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of some of the dead or should we should we keep it because it's ... percent ...\nThe zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay all the eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off water all three of these cars worse\n[noise] um the truck is probably worth about Fifteen my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell it for about ten\nOkay because one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value OK okay you're not violating that though show or good\nOr the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand good and how much debt other than eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\n[noise] ah we have about Ninety thousand [noise]\nOkay but that it that includes the car the car and what is the Ninety thousand on\nMostly student loans or we have some tax stuff a medical bills\nOkay so can you pay off forty five a year making one forty and be debt free in two years my answer would be yes\nYes and um that would mean that if you want to keep her car there's nothing out of line with keeping it but just at all so I mean we're not going to keep the dad a regardless of the interest rate we're just going to get rid of it but you know so but if you told me you owe thirty thousand dollars on her car and I would sell it in a heartbeat\nFive to two men we'll talk about your life and your\nMoney Taylor's with us in Hartford, Connecticut Hi Taylor how are you\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOr just you know first of all thanks so much tougher for taking my call I've been looking for like eight years now um and I had a question regarding retirement and college when my one year old ...\nI'm a I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby step for I've about Seventy thousand dollars cash mhm um I Know that other than my house\nUm which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I put Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have some you know equity in it\nI mean I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um so I'm going to be putting that into a check five twenty nine I think for him and that kind of\nPicking out some growth stocks mutual fund to kind of short quotes from their real good um so my question is what are kind of my\nWhat do I do with this kind of pile of cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses for\nFor um you know every any given month because about twenty seven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only income right now uh-huh um\nSo I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shy shy throw it towards my house and a little bit every year or\nShould I put it someplace\nWe teach Taylor is a process with all the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation than if you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is ... ... dollars you've done that\nFour or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now uh what do you make\n'em so I'm about Seventy eight year is the household income yeah okay\nAll right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a pension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well\nI'll tell you that mandatory okay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I published it would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay\nAnd that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have I just opened up a ... or re ... with a better man which is one of the the elbow and hide hunters\nFor me I'm familiar with what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo are coming there they're they're doing pretty good but none of them are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in ... at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time and a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would just go to smart faster Dave Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the ... best in business I don't care what you do okay doesn't affect my income at all\nBut people always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument ... you're married\nYet married um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each\nUnless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred is eleven thousand and that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in growth stock mutual funds\nI spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stock mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a fourth in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth in aggressive growth and a fourth in international now once you're doing that any of the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it and mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine\nOkay I just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that and that's baby step three is fit or babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is addressed kids' college and it's different than ... you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it and then once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget\nOr any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nWhich you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house and then I'm going to set up those to run\nI'm going to keep jumping around that house you're probably going to that house paid off in three or four years of this right that's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you doing sir better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand in that a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty abnormal it's currently with a U.S department of treasury\nOn it as a result of having been additional from a service academy or three years ago um and that the remaining thirty case like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously a much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue paying off the smallest at first or should I\nI'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I ask because I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact that will eventually end up any collections that counts if I'm not able to pay the amount that fall um\nYeah um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred ... a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year also\nWhile so I learned you guys are on the side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three in the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can give you got wonderful income you'll be different two years\nIt's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start doing twenty thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go way really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou have to get on a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYeah served so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either ask that served through in the service or you're assigned\nTo the recruitment and death um and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it it goes over to the U.S\nTreasury so you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time and has forgiven [noise]\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge have to pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nCommon theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make\nAs an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full\nOf resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dot com slash Dave\nTo hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new it finds them for you it's powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes identifies people with the right skills education and experience for your job\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago\nBut that never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January took myself you know of of her checking am because\nHeart when I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs you know and and so he wasn't in his right mind\nI rest my case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to participate in her healing\nFinancially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life and make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent from mom of initially\nBut if you can get her back I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual\nAnd independent from mom of initially\nBut if you can get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and that be perpetual but to do that was the I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again\nBut you like go to the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was on healthy\nYeah and I'd like to get her up and running in healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't she gonna hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again broke you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that have it and those that love them but the good news is I have seen a innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nThem now she only did he medicated that she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not Medicaid\nWell there's you you don't want them just you know you know all the rest of their life is\nI mean they add controlled or she has a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen yeah uh as as as we really mentally ill and she is with she's not on a couple of different methods\nWell her ... her only shot then is what we're talking about but our goal is to this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nAnd it happens to people all the time though what did she say right now when they call her on the show you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nYou know you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you just you know because they're going to just I don't think I should be talking she should\nBe telling them to be either one of the I'm not going to long conversation it's I got nothing you get nothing because all they're gonna badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs going then we start negotiating and trying to work our way through the debt right\nWell my husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back more than negotiate\nAnd I are going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah okay I think it's been longer\nThan that I think it's been at least six months\nHow they're going to hurt pliable today but she's got no money and you're not giving or any you know so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nAnd let's say I mean she'll show a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight under their she'd say look it can we work at a deal\nYeah or you know they are Thirteen hundred bucks you haven't seen any money in two years I'm now back up and working again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that in the settlement in Seoul\nWill do it and get an in writing and no electronic access to your checking account because whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's a filthy industry\nAnd so you got a free similar rattlesnakes because they are [noise]\nCovering person here\nWho's going into a rattlesnake then\nShe started making some money you got a warm weather emotionally on that\nBut you can you can give her the cheerleading support\nAnd I think here the right to do all of\nThere's good news show she can make it out if she makes a good choices [noise]\nOkay things are getting ... where it out there I thought the Equifax breach was bad enough it exposes the personal financial info up half\nOf all Americans now we have breaches affecting

help\n\nBut he also picks up his image that he himself is up all of a child of God\nListen to his baptism business at the beginning of his ministry this marked who he was in those days Jesus came up from that sort of the galaxy and it was baptized by John and the good Jordan and justice he was coming up out of the river he saw the heavens torn apart and the spirit descending on him like a dog and a voice came from heaven you\nAre my son the bulk of it\nWith who I Am I'm pleased from then on\nJesus favorite term for God was aqua father\nIt was unique to his experience in teaching\nIn the Lord's Prayer he said whenever we come to God and ask for anything it's all in the context of this we are in a loving relationship to our father and have them\n\nAt the end of his life when his praying in the garden of Eden who does he prayed to a father for you all things are possible remove this cup for me yet not what I Want but what you want and what we're Jesus literal last words\nWho did he address father into your hands I commend my spirit\nJesus invites us into these relationships that's where the human body is you know in marriage there is much to negotiate\nThere are rules that you need to get straight if you're going to um thrived together as a couple but it is really much more than ... isn't it it's a relationship where love reaches out and grabs you and causes you to act beyond any of the do's and don'ts that life would impose upon\nLove reaches out and grabs you and causes you to act beyond any of the do's and don'ts that life would impose upon you\nAnd then the parent child relationship there are all sorts of rules that are necessary to keep a child safe but any parent knows it's more than that it's a relationship\nOut of love that you want to do as a child you out of love for your parents the young child and certain age wants to please the father or mother or more than anything\nAnd there's an openness and ... and this openness and the absolute trust of the child draws out of your love as a\nParent in a way that you never thought you a good experience right\nSo why do we always seek separation independence\nVarious they don't want tips from Jesus on out I have a better marriage not at all they want to know how to get out of it under the cycles don't want to welcome children and welcome them into a relationship so they can no Jews as they want to shove them push them away\nIt's in the garden of Eden is that same dynamic Adam and Eve can't wait to make up their own minds and have a ... or by that tasty fruit\nBut Jesus models the office he models dependence not independence he models trust not down he models law\nNah separation\n\nAs Jesus picks imagery I think stories also tell us well over the years I've been using a stories from this book or tails of the magic monastery and I want to share one\n... to conclude today as well this guy went to the monastery\nLooking for answers but he said I didn't want the little answers I wanted the big answer so I asked the months there to show me the house of\nOf the loving God he did\nAnd I set myself down there quite willing to wait for the big answer I remain silent all day far into the night I looked God and I I guess he was looking at me and the guy until late late at night I seem to her voice what are you leaving out\nI looked around\nI heard it again what are you leaving out\nWasn't my imagination\nSooner was all around me whispering roaring what are you leaving\nOut was cracking\nManaged to get to my feet and head for the door I guess I wanted the comfort of a human face or human voice nearby where the court or where some of the amongst lived and I knocked on one of the doors [noise] putting on camera sleepy voice\nAutomated leaving out\nMe the voice said I went to the next door\nWhat do you want what\nAm I leaving out me\nA third door uh forth all the same I thought to myself they're all stuck on themselves I left the building and discussed just than the sun

we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago\nBut that never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January cook myself off\nOf her checking am because\nHeart when I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs yeah well we know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I rest\nMy case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I\nWant to participate in her healing\nFinancially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent from ...\nBut if you can get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual\nBut to do that that was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again but you let go of the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was unhealthy\nYeah and I'd like to get her up and running in healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life she's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't she going to hit the bridge every\nTime man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again broke you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that have it and those that love them but the good news is I have seen hey innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nOur now she outweigh the medicated that she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate well there's\nYou you don't want him just in a in a fall the rest of their life\nIs I mean they had control their war to the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen yeah uh as as as early mentally ill and she says she's not on a couple of different methods she does\nHer own her only shot then is what we're talking about but our goal is to this girl to be forty four in all this to be a memory\n\nAnd it happens to people all the time though what\nDid she say right now when they call her\n... do you get nothing\nYeah and it happens to people all the time so what does she say right now when they call her and so you get nothing so she does take up the phone you\nKnow you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you just you know because they're going to just I don't think\nI should be talking she should\nBe either want to be among them long conversation it's gotten up and you get nothing because all they're going to badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs going then we start negotiating and trying to work our way through the debt right\nWell my husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate\nAnd I are going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months\nTell their their during our pliable today but she's got no money and you're not giving or any no so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nAnd let's say I mean she'll

brand and the boxing today as I mentioned a moment ago building the Bach and as part of the crude life media network\nOr not a political program nope nope polarizing talk here just facts conversations about the energy industry information you need to live your life\nHere at the crude life media network we generate positive energy with programs like building the Bach and we're able to tell the stories about the people involved with the communities and the companies with in the industry those who are involved\nWith the evolution of the block and oil field and the oil and gas industry my name is Jason space I'm your host than we've got a fantastic program in store for you today already ready for this\nJust in the ... the north Dakota pipeline authority gives us an update on the crude oil natural gas\nCouple records set in the month of July plus he's got to take a look at two thousand uh Nineteen and what to expect we talk about the rail we talk about the pipeline capacity all kinds of information for those people involved with the oil and gas industry just in ... with the north Dakota pipeline authority just in a little bit here on building the block and\nAnd then we got a case for you an interview about a case excuse me\nInvolving the oil and gas mineral rights out in western North Dakota and lakes Akaka we're the state of North Dakota obtained about ten thousand a mineral acres from private landowners out in western North Dakota\nAnd you're not going to believe this one so stick around for Joshua Swanson with Vogel law firm he explains the situation he's the attorney working on a case out there\nAnd uh the north Dakota industrial commission ruled in favor of the government over the land owners you're going to want to stick around for that interview just a little bit later on in the program we've got a fantastic program in store for you today\nOr in just a moment we have an update on the Meridian Energy groups Davis refinery coming to bell field North Dakota it's kind of a little bit of music montage updates so\nUh it's a little bit easier listening to the just me talking about it and just a real quick recap of the Davis refinery it's going to take about a hundred and fifty acres out there in western North Dakota billings county east of the fried burger rail facility in Belleville North Dakota course you know that's like the heart of the market out there\nAnd what they're going to do is forty nine thousand five hundred barrels per day that's how much the capacity is going to be for the Davis refinery so the Davis refiners really going to look at refining products\nFrom local crude oil out in the ... to serve the regional markets so the reason this is such a big deal is because this is the first Greenfield refinery built in the United states in over fifty years so it's gonna be the industry standard globally so what's going to end up happening is\nAfter this Davis refinery has built isn't\nMaybe the industry standard globally so what's going to end up happening is after this Davis refinery and bill is now going to be the new standard so a lot of exciting things are happening out there a lot of people wondering what's going on with the name is refinery\nSo let's talk about that I wanted to ask you about you know the record portion of that you know we're not talking you know oil prices are good but they've been better\nAre are these shaving money at the rigs you know what I mean saving money I called she even money um or is there you know more real happening to take it away I guess is there anything that's kind of leading the charge for us to get a record production\nOf the combination of things to take a call ... levels are are more than adequate industry interested in Russia and what not working our way outside of their during the downturn\nRonald coordinate those boxing but now working their way outside of the court and so during the downturn\nEveryone saw an industry or condense a race for me down and rainy and ... are all concentrated in that area replay [noise]\nUm and it's probably starting to return to a higher level that we've seen here twenty Eighteen industry not only\nContinue to stay very very active in that corner area but as well or move out side of the court so we're seeing more activity ha and one of the ... county on during their long show county and then there is it hadn't seen much interest for several years and how long have you seen the second major factor that led to North Dakota\nAnd punishment ten is the technology changes\nUm I Can't emphasize that enough\nNot to your listeners that the technology that that's been developed over the last several years continues to ... just about everyone thought these wealthier good in the day or or significantly better than they were ... years or more and more ago [noise] and so\nShe takes less ... completion to have a quicker rate to a production girl than in the area to all those things coming together a lean into what's expected to be continued girl for many years\nBut I think that the technology side is really exciting you know I mean it brings in a whole new world of reef racks and the more ... what do we had him on a ten percent of the understanding of the Boston is that the number I saw last time\nAnd work and just the number and Alice what about twelve to Fifteen Percent this is what the industry believes that they can ah capture with\nTechnology okay tighter well space CNN or well completion Tom told their hands are just tearing numbers they were as several years ago just to single digits of\nPercentage instead and five percent or less where some of the earlier beliefs or when there's probably a really got going almost ten years ago\nWell it's really exciting to because it adds a new layer of a job opportunity for those are kind of the white collar jobs if you will to figure out the technology to make it so it's more efficient in order to do the fracking and\nUm it's exciting for for me is I don't know I ... I think it's pretty cool I Do well and gas industry really excites me but I'm Talking about how they're getting away from the wells now you know we've got pipeline we've got real we have trucks\nI tell ya I was in Fargo the other day and\nHad to wait at a at a train Trina laid for about twenty minutes because it look like they're at max capacity now for a lot of the crude oil um ... tankers so are are we seeing a pretty good increase in real er and I'm sure the pipelines were max max for a while\nTo getting us off we talk just criminal now and how that getting the markets and so on the oil it's in her newest majority still leaving a region by pipeline when we look at just a pure market share you know what about Seventy one percent where we help I\nOperate remainder entertainers signed a law which is a much smaller percentage around five or six percent and then a rough there twenty percent this is going out on the rail cars and so while the percentages had been increasing along with that but the volunteers have been increasing so\nI'm no where near the peak amount of grilled traffic recruit by real that we saw sit back and the twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen type a timeframe when you talk to this woman over eight hundred thousand barrels of oil per day by rail car\nOwners are much smaller today but they are growing so now estimate turn right around two hundred and Seventy five thousand a salon\nEr Cox numbers are much smaller today but they are growing that show now estimates run around two hundred and Seventy five thousand a salon barrels per month leaving by rail car um and that number's expected that continue not to grow out one of the more immediate challenges for the industry right now on criminal\nAnd set my expectations are that by early next year\nOr the paradox levels are within the U.S portion of the ... the pipeline capacity again so that tree will just using a coup by rail because there were some marketing advantages and so I'm\nVery soon the industrial robot that elected the scenario and to market forces driving any excess production onto the rail networks\nWill transition in the natural gas because I saw quite a few articles on one ... investment they're putting into the pipeline and\nJust get a get gas gathering if you will uh we're we're we are with the natural gas in terms of you know shipping at the market\nSo natural gas shut us there's a number of challenges associated with it so folks aren't familiar with the natural gas from the documentary pork system called which the crude oil so its earnings together it's not something that industry can they can produce the ... natural gas and so that natural gas\nAs it comes up next to be handled appropriately and marketed\nIn the last ... and so in North Dakota everyone's familiar with the challenges that industry has had were cast capture and making sure that much of that gas goes and excel pipeline as opposed to the clerk in a\nSmall I look at what was taking place this summer\nUh Eighteen percent of the gas was ... in the long run up July which last recently out\nAnd so the root cause us for that flaring just several things at being placed in order to have a complete ... capture system that gas gathering ... small network of pipelines out in the field selves\nMost have to be adequately sized Robin in the right location ... their jobs more gas from the wellhead to one of the processing facility or state or to the next change that needs to be in place in ... and an adequate plant capacity so\nI'm having a silly things that can take that natural gas emits raw form ...\nFrom the wellhead queen of the various ... arms that new one I use as consumers and then I don't think it's wrong call transmission so moving to try the methane gas to
