I mean we scrape or third are not during anyone any period\nYeah well ... let me let me just say what Ajay first said when he was in the studio head shape for former secretary of agriculture former Republican or he worked under the Bush administration former Republican governor of the state of North Dakota wouldn't want to a third seat as governor if he chose to\n... just a tax on the American people\nUnfortunately that's not a good deal right right\nExactly I mean at a time and and okay thank you Russell it goes back to what Mary Ann is talking about I mean she has the passionate get on a plane and come here and and want to talk about issues but really what she wanted was to be represented\nAnd so obviously a you don't have to make huge steps to to understand that it was the passion that came where passions that come with women\nAnd I was watching national pundits or speak to these issues and I thought of something I'd say and I thought of how much trouble I Would get in for saying it\nAnd then I thought are you going to be too chicken Joel to say it because of the ramifications you could have for it\nAnd so there's there's some general let me just do it let me just get it off my chest and and then get your take on it and you can say you know I kept us such a sexist you are so living in the past you are all of those things in more okay so\nYou know hiking up you're such a sexist you are so living in the past you are all of those things in more okay\nI Believe when they're talking about this this whole wave of women voters and how women are going to vote a certain way I Believe that for Heidi Heitkamp to win this race she needs women voters\nI Believe that she has to connect with women voters on issues that affect them\nEqual pay I think that she has to connect with them or when when it comes to a reproductive rights or when it comes to how kids are treated or in preschool on day care or all of those type\nOf issues or how people are treated because women are by and large end up being the primary caregivers for the elderly I I think that Medicare Medicaid those issues are very important to women I think that those are the issues where the where if I was Marianne\nAnd I was knocking on the door I'd be saying look you know you need a candidate that does a B and C and\nD when it comes to two women now\nHere's the dangerous zone here's here's the one in ... I'm about to walk out on there's an assumption that all women have an independent mind when it comes to how their families vote\nAnd I'm not convinced that that's true I certainly with all of a strong women I have in my family if I walked up to my daughters and said you have to vote this way I Would I Am so proud of the direction they would give me\nA you know they tell me to shove it they'll vote the way they want to vote same thing with my wife same thing with my sisters right certainly the same thing with my mother\nAnd and Kelly's\n\nDirection\nAnd that's that's nice that's really thin ice or but you know I could easily say that was true Thirty years ago I cut mhm um\nI think twenty Tom showed us that's not your job but I Can't get into like that because I think the women in droves came out to vote for Heidi Republican women\nI Would say though that just as maybe young people are influence maybe a little bit by their beliefs and their parents because that's kind of what they get at home or what they get growing up\nI can see how women or men could be influenced by their spouse you know when they're living in the same roof and if there's someone that's talking about a lot and if the TV you know kill and to a certain bias politically\nThen maybe you could get any somewhat influence but I think the ultimate decision has nothing to do with if my husband told me about ...\nAnd that's the right answer that's the answer that that you would hope for I mean it really is but you know it it's worthy of a conversation\nIt is whether or not women are more independent voters then men it's worthy of that conversation are also there is nothing more popular than winning\nNothing makes you want to be on a team or then when you when you know if that team's winning it's like oh man that's the one I Want to be on look at them they're kicking but they're winning and the nurse Dakota the state that I live in uh the Republican Party has been winning and winning in droves\nAnd so nothing is more popular than being in a room and being\nThe Republican Party has been winning and winning in droves and so nothing is more popular than being in a room and being able to party after you win okay so you naturally gravitate to that\nIs that right is it is it's certainly harder to go out and make your case knowing that you're in the minority and knowing that you have a good chance of not winning\nI I think that the race between ... and Kelly Armstrong as close certainly way closer than people give it credit for\nBut the courage that Mac Schneider has to stand up there and make his a bipartisan case ... to stand up\nThere and say I'm young I'm hard working I've got a young family here\nYou know there is a separation between me and Kelly Armstrong I certainly believe that eastern North Dakota is not a place to vote against I certainly believe that that Republicans or someone I can sit down and work with them I'm not the former chairman of the Republican Party as Kelly Armstrong is\nBut but that argument that you make it's hard it's really hard because it's a\nDown ballot race all the oxygen is being sucked out of the room\nBy a Senate race and so you need to get people's attention and you need to\nPoint out what you're going to do with the job versus what the other person is done now in their particular race you have a situation where they both served in the legislature\nAnd so for the voters out there they need to do their homework about how they voted in the legislature and then gauge things based on that\nAnd I go back to the oil tax on that one\n[laughter] I Do I go back to the oil tax and if you're willing to give a loyalty um oil companies big tax breaks\nHere in North Dakota that cause my property taxes go up the cause my schools to get less money to cause my townships not to get the money that they need to cause my state highway departments to close down then I don't trust\nYou to do that to represent me in DC and I think that that's the case Mac is making an estimate\nSo that the phone lines are let up a let's let's take another call here quick let's get to Darren Darren you're on the news and views\nWarnings all morning yeah [laughter] I I Can't believe I Would hope is is just kidding because I really believe\nIn our last spring hiding Dakota want is is that Chuck Schumer Dakota or capture them isn't there's somebody from\nMontana Iowa South Dakota some place that I'm going to help rather than like Schumer Democrat into this that's not going to help at all\nOr the problem there and as you said dragon versus them coming in and so I don't think that I had kept his recruiting Marianne I think they know Mary ends choosing to come but but I Would add this there and\nAfter that vote that vote that that Kevin tremors beating the crap out of her over the the cabin I vote after that vote there were tons of volunteers and I know this for a fact within the state of North Dakota\nThat said All right I'm coming I'm going to work I'm going to knock on some doors and so that you know there is there and the advice you just gave is good advice and it's true it's true and it's happening so thank you there and

time I was your dad [laughter] incredibly for about how how good was your dad's ear sausage when it used to do it was\nPretty good but now the big thing is though we've done a lot a doctor in Turkey and\nAll the new things to oh why oh ... okay so you're goose Cherokee and everyone Alice has oh you've got to try to ... it doesn't even tastes like you know good this is really good\nI've never found that piece of meat that I find appetizing you have to try and shit and talent and dressing and then turn it into turkey okay so that's that you guys have never had\nYeah so in fairness to you and your dad and I I I usually have the soy sauce kind of okay and that's my disclaimer\nBut I'm so with Kelly on this side of me and I are people out to try this try this first off if the only way you can take make a meat tastes good just to turn it into jerky\nThat's a bad sign or not the only way it's just the best way okay so if if your dad roasted a dark and a crock pot mhm you'd love it\nNinety nine percent chance yeah okay\nGood good for you I'm All right uh tariffs what are you know today that you didn't know yesterday [noise]\nNo they're still there first of all I didn't know that yesterday but it's just a lot more it's just it's a big hassle is a lot of producers that have been self marketing and I know I talked to improve separate Grand Forks\nAnd he market has been some self leading some to an elevator he tries to sell them directly to the buyers and he had\nCases that to go and the terrorists hit and they cancelled his order so he's still got these excess Libyans he's trying to sell and that's kind of starting a lot of people is the elevators are trying to get rid of these being so they can have other producers bring their isn't\nBut it's kind of going to be a little bit of a creative storage issue 'cause a lot of people are going to be trying to sell their corn so it's going to flood the market with corn and then they're trying to throw the Libyans in the oil crappy oil the crop you ought to be better conditions little harder story than just corn you could store in the bag it into a little easier yeah it's a little easier to store corn\nAnd still have that great quality but soybeans you want to keep the oil\nBecause there have been ... has to be a it's kind of a balancing game of the right time to harvest it the right moisture content and the right kind of storage and just kind of\nAll these things at once they're heading in this weather outside definitely does not\nHelp anybody it'll farmer that you talk to the markets his own ... ... what did he say in terms of the potential of that buyer coming back anytime soon did you have any thoughts on that\nHe didn't quite mentioned that far but he did mention that even going into other markets so today on the news I was talking about Taiwan's um got a new bed where they're going to be purchased a more of a U.S beans where China's not buying anymore so they've gone for buying a\nHundred and sixty five million tons not sure on that exact number but they've gone from mind that much by and there's been no beds in the Pacific northwest to purchase beans which is our biggest exporter since April urge you and\nI always wonder whether or not we here in the far upper mid west are going to change or I mean there's obviously a reason that we use the Pacific rim mhm right that we we ship all raised a and that we get hit with with higher basis versus what other states do because they have other avenues ... Mississippi River or whether it's ... you know what I'm getting it\nAnd so I always wonder if something like this doesn't make\nMake my farmers that that listen to me every day that are my friends as well if doesn't make them rethink our our trade lines ... area if that isn't even a possibility to alter that\nSo the thing is you only have a certain a couple of places you can ship these being out of since North Dakota we're kind of in the middle of everything landlocked\nSo we had really great trade routes set up to go to the Pacific northwest but they're not having any beans come out of being beds come out of there for the other options as to the Gulf of Mexico fisherman him down south but then you lose money because it's so expensive to export those being that way because it's just not set up like\nBut you you can't just tied this to left wing or is it you know I I saw how people react to that the Trump rallies I saw\nA how people hollering at me when I attended one of these rallies I saw a guy get punched who protested that one of these Trump rallies so it is an exclusive to one side of the aisle or the other day but\nNo it's it's I Would say Ninety percent to the left I I could not disagree more like well you don't you're evidently or what not watching the news because\nEvery day there's there's left wing or is constantly doing this stuff and I don't agree with that I mean okay yeah I just you know Heidi is putting herself in the party\nThat is supposedly the calm you know\n... it's just not\nIt's just not right what they're doing now I\nI think a damn it I I watch you know David my point is is I think that both sides of the aisle can have extremists both sides of that can have people that say and do things anybody who's ever went to a Trump rally knows about extremism okay and there's other people that attend Trump rallies that aren't extremist\nBut it's the way you go see get some get some lather\nCertainly in the case of what happened with a\nA now justice cabinet us there were people that took it too far\nTo there's a lot of passion that comes with some of that I agree with you but to say that it's exclusive to the Ninety percent of it to the left\nThat just isn't fair and and that isn't right ah it just factually is not right All right so when we come back to your phone calls right after this\nBasket dairy land sea customer what it's like to work with us and they'll tell you that it's about moving to just missed\nTheir land has been an excellent company to work with them for like a family on that is one of the\nBiggest things that appeal to me about very land\nSea to ask them about our people and they'll refer to them by now\nI'm Joel I was watching uh the protests by those against cabinet they were peaceful or no pushing note taking any signs your caller is just watching Fox fake news\nI'm Joel last caller has memory loss to no one has been more encouraging violence hatred and division or than Donald Trump ah Joel the gentleman who stayed at Ninety percent of the inappropriate behaviors from the left\nUm it said you are watching the wrong news meeting not Fox News apparently people are a joy your last caller's been drinking Fox News a cook [laughter] yes I mean cook okay your words not mine I'm\nJoel goose recipe already shared that one did I ...
