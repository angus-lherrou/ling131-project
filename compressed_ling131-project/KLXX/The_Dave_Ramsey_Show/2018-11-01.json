Ramsey to get the best possible deal that question is from Brenda in Colorado a she comes to Dave Ramsey dot com it's just is dental insurance for my kid I was a gimmick\nOr something I should keep paying don't or insurance is one of the most easy insurance was to figure out that they're charging you more than you're getting\nUm we've had dental insurance proposed to us as a a\nA employee benefits several times and it's really simple when you add up what you pay for it in a year you would never spend that much on dentistry\nIt just doesn't work out it's one of those things you should self insure through now we do have an advertiser that is with us that is a a dental discount company and that is worth it\nThat helps you get discounts on your dental repairs your dental work and so forth and um you know you can check them out as well you can find them on our website one dental as what it is\nWe we couldn't be comfortable\nThan what the what it still makes sense to hire um a financial person for a year at you know whatever I think it's like five thousand dollars a year ago I got five point five percent of what you're\nActually there looking they're proposing a managed and managed to count for you correct\nOK yeah a lot of the industry has gone to the managed to count approach and uh so the question is what do you get for your money that's what you're going to die too and I'm anytime you're investing and when I'm investing by the way my personal money's invested with one of our smart Russia approach okay [noise]\nUm and so the\nThere's two ways to do investing in mutual funds upfront fees\nOr that as you do the investment they charge a fee and then there's very low almost no\nAnnual after that or they managed account or it's a percentage of the balance every year\nAnd they know what are you getting that well they're helping you select the funds and putting you in funds that are out performing the market overall\nUm you know over a long period of time over average you know funds that outperform the S. and P. and of course you've got someone to meet with uncover any time there's a question about anything\nI'm a if there's a change in the market and you're worried about it or up or down um anything along those lines and there's tons of studies that say that\nYou will come out ahead doing those two things one is getting good advice and picking the proper funds and to a you know just not jumping off the ledge every time somebody comes on the news and freaks out you're probably not already not doing that one\nWhen we look at I mean I like to you every day no chance you've kind of got that down there and you're not going to jump off the roller coaster and get hurt you know so that that\nStuff so you know the thing is just asked them to show you okay why are you worse what is your charging and ah you know because you're charging me of the R U worth that are in in most cases you'll find it is\nIt that way then you're going to make more than the cost of the fee in extra returns and certainly in services in terms of um you know education is available to you and um you know there's a thousand mutual funds to go through I don't keep up with a thousand or mutual funds I have a day job\nYou know and so a a a life you know I don't want to do that but those guys that's all they do all day long this comb through those funds it's their whole world they eat live and breathe that stuff and it's also don't work on my own car\nOr I could probably fix my car cheaper than the mechanic fixes it\nBut it would take me longer a there'd be several trial in the errors along the way I might break something in the process and so it's worth it to me to get somebody to hook the computer up to the car that actually has the computer hooks up to the guards instead of me being a redneck laying on the trying to figure this out\nAnd it's kind of like you know investments I don't why those either um I don't even do my own taxes are and I'm pretty good at this stuff it's what I Do I'm a money guy and got a natural event for math and all that kind of stuff but\nI don't why when it gets to the end of the ... the the you know the dirty details so to speak so that's why I think you're going to find the investment is worth that the managers account is worth it but I it's fair to ask them to show you\nOkay the typical guy does this or you've been doing this over here but if you had been with us during that same period of time and here's what we would have had you and here's what the ... and it you know what am I knew one and a half percent more would it cost you a half a percent so you didn't editor for one that kind of a thing um it's a fair question to say hey prove your worth\nAnd a half percent more what it costs to half a percent so you're an editor for one that kind of a thing um it's a fair question to say hey prove your worth\nAnd uh I don't think any smart Mr pro that we have would um tell you that that they can't do that um that they all obviously all believe that they can and then just ask them to show you the question Alex is with us from Charlotte North Carolina Hi Alex welcome to the day Ramsey show\nAnd I are you doing today better than I deserve Sarah what's up\nUh I got a question um maybe a better question for Ken Coleman about my career uh I'm currently in private step too and I'm a welder out worked out of town and I'm Mike around a hundred and forty thousand a year ... and um\nI've got opportunity to go work at home\nBut the pay is about a third of water on my working out of town\nAnd I'm just curious if he thought it was crazy to take like they all bought that I'm\nI'm not married yet I'm getting married next month\nShe making a hundred and forty and you'd make like fifty\nYeah OK at home I'm ... where are you where are you working out of town\nA member going on now but I'm I'm I slipped on we're on um\nYou know my own their own market right now I'm On\n... anything other than that they can file a mhm mhm\nOkay well I think the answer for me would always be see none of the above I ... I liked the idea of coming off the road I don't like the idea of a two thirds pay cut so I got to figure out how can I don't either how can I come off the road and make more money\nWhat am I gotta do to make more money off the road or can I Do some kind of a mix and say I'm going to be gone two weekends a month\nAnd a and go do just ... there's some OT out on the road that way and pick up some serious change as until but is there is there a\nPass a career paths\nAt home or whether it's owning your own shop or a you know [noise] I don't know run running a different kind of a ... a different way of doing this rather than just saying a J. O. V.\nVersus a road jobs is there another way to do this and that's that's what I'm going to be touched the rocks I'm going to be turning over and looking for is to how to do that and um you know where do I want to be one I'm forty and will be on the road [noise] you don't want to be on the road already you told me that getting married I don't blame you I think it's a good idea will be home with a new wife\nMake good question I think you can figure it out but it's a tough one this is the day Ramsey show\n[noise]\nIn the world would you trust some random guy in a Q ... when getting your mortgage you really think he cares about your lungs are money ... doesn't\nThose companies care about getting you and do whatever home loan program they're pushing that week when it comes to ordering a cheeseburger the meal deal works fine well let's get real people were talking about the largest investment you'll probably ever make so don't be naive and trust in order take or who pressures you into a pre packaged alone\nYou know it it works the same as compound interest you know it was a very powerful thing mhm um for the single folks out there working on their debt snowball dealing accountability partner hanging around people that are have those positive positive relationship and influence on you know\nIt's focused because now this day and age where social media all these distractions\nUm life happened to us during the debt payoff and it happened to us you know before the end we were in the dating phase any engagement you know for example um before we were married she dealt with depression for several years dealt with strings of unemployment I had written notice is on my door\nMy rent was only forty five at that time and I have a three straight months\nLate written notices Mm So it was tough times and then even once we got into the ...\nAre a little bit before that whenever I got my job offer I went through a grant program and it was tough we we do some things that were our fault for example when I got to use cars have pictures of him um we had a bunch of car repairs\nWe got those cars right before we moved from South Carolina the Houston Mm So you're
