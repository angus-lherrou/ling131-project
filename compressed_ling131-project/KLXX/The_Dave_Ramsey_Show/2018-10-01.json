sent me this article earlier it's very interesting lawsuits filed against insurers in recent years for their practices around universal life insurance highlight the risks that these products can pose to on wary financial advisors and their clients\nTrans America a X. or Lincoln national are examples of firms and the cross fire of litigation raising the cost of insurance and certain universal for raising the cost of insurance and certain universal policies nationwide life insurance company also privately settle a lawsuit with two individuals in may\n[laughter] mhm\nHe's joining us to one more time rolls [noise]\nSaid fragile made it from the community college I had a year ago\nKenny directly into your phone I'm having trouble hearing you\nI'm Sorry I can hear me now yes ma'am thank you I'm from I'm ...\nYears old I just graduated a community college about a year ago [noise] um\nAnd I might prefer making filling out however I said to myself wait wait and get back here [noise] um I Do not know that for I think it could be a lot of money that I make 'em so if you\nUm how much would you suggest that I said and Michael pick up her paycheck um can move out in a really good time and I want to say to that I Am fortunate enough to have parents kind enough to let you stay within like free\nEvents very uh ... what do you make\nUm monthly about eleven hundred\nAnd is that and that's after graduating say okay what is your degree in\nIt's actually a highly colleges but um I actually got a chat with the tea just to help find 'em my career\nAnd so when we're your career kick in\n[noise] um I'm I'm actually taking a client while I'm a I'm a painter this money to fight them educational take the class I say about that like a year\nOkay well at eleven hundred a month we're talking about a little over Thirteen thousand dollars a year that's you're not going to you're going to make it on that in Raleigh out on your own okay you're not making enough to do that so we've got to get your income up that's why I was asking and so um yeah we need to double your income\nOn pretty quick here fast as you can\nAnd when you can double your income and then I Would go get a you know an inexpensive apartment maybe a roommate or whatever and just get started on your own and the main thing there is make sure you have no bad do you have any debt at all\n[noise] um but I Do have about a primary down I ... truck babbling about it than that I'm which my parents um I kind of up to 'em that they're taking care of that I just thought that I can stop ... and more credit\nWhere do you mean they're taking care of that\nSo they came in and they offered to pay a whole not allowing off to Africa\nOr that you know we don't need you to establish any more credit you don't need any bad you you don't make enough money to breathe hardly okay so when you are one hundred percent that free\nAnd then you build an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses like five thousand dollars is set aside\nFor emergencies then you would start saving towards your home and by then you are also in your first apartment and you just start saving as fast as you can and you won't put down as much as you can possibly put down how old are you you said you're\nTwenty four okay good\nWell you got a good plan so hopefully in the next twelve to Eighteen months you can see that income spike up as you start using your cosmetology degree\nAnd um because you know your Thirteen thousand when you get your twenty six thousand quick as we can this doubling that's still not a lot of money but that'll at least get you out there and get you moving in and get your career to start to build\nSo hey thanks for the call we appreciate you listening Ian is with us a prince Edward Hi Ian how are you\n[laughter] Hi Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up my wife and I we've got five boys five kids and we just moved into our dream on all three years ago or ten twelve acres a lot through 'cause the kids turn around but the last few months we just heard is your plan where they just have to\nAnd we're just thinking um when we got thirty five thousand undead besides the house\nWe want and we need to sell the house just to be free or which is ... through the next ten Fifteen Years and just make it out than\nTen to Fifteen Years remain pale ale house and everything\nYeah like whoa where you know we have twenty eight years left my mortgage\nMhm so what's your house yeah income it's about Seventy K take home pay take 'em right yeah and um then what is your house payment\nIs around twelve hundred a month okay house payments not on the line here that's fun you know but you gotta lotta ... you've got a lot of kids and you're not used to living on a limited budget and you're going to start that\nWere egg yeah because you got thirty thirty five an hour to clean up I mean you really need to clean that up it's probably going to take ... year and a half two years but something like that you you no longer than two years you need to have this debt cleaned up\nRight what is the thirty five thousand in debt what kind of debt\nA part of the law and my parents and part of it is my credits twenty five line of credit and ten grand and learn from our parents\nOkay Mm So just a line of credit what'd you bond with the line of credit\nOh it's just been life has just been there about a piano a few years ago [noise] or just miscellaneous things\nOkay and that's over right yeah not doing that anymore right\nNo no no we were like we are just sick and tired we just want to be free yeah we love the place would not I don't think they need I don't\nThink you need to sell the house houses now killing your twelve hundred\nBucks out of a fifty eight hundred dollar take home by not out of line\nYou're oh you're okay on her house but you do have to get your written budget get on every dollar you're written budget and get that going as quick as you can every dollar dot com and I'm starting to you know using the app on your phone\nAnd you guys need to squeeze every dollar so that you clear there's thirty five because if you can clear the thirty five you're going to have pretty good room in this budget even with five kids\nAnd you can clear I did just going to take a year and a half two years just a year and a half two years or Seventeen five a year out of Seventy thousand take home that's doable\nYou couldn't do that as a lay down and you can do that a thirty five thousand out of Seventy thousand with five kids that means one year I don't think you're going to do that so somewhere between the one in the two and the term landing on Eighteen months Richard is with us Richards in Salt Lake City Hi Richard how are you\nI have a great got how can I help [noise] so I was wondering about emerging until we have a fully funded emergencies\nThat are of three to six months [noise] good and\nI have about ... came out and then now I'm at my job offer an H up they account and they match up came a hundred dollars a year great um should should I fully fund the account and shit I count that towards any of our emergency I found it\nFully funded to get that match that's wonderful and the ... of course can only be used for one kind of an emergency and that's medical bills will lots of other kinds of emergencies pop up and so um do you do you do both of you work in this house for as a single income\nNo signal and okay and what's your household income around sixty and what do you do I don't know if\nA nurse okay very very stable career\nMeaning that if you were to lose a job you can get another one in twenty minutes\nNursing is just a fabulous career field so in terms of ah accessibility even add hours anytime you want to add hours you can back it off you can change direction all kinds of stuff you just really and landed in a sweet spot there so very very good on that given that you've got that type of uh\nAnd all kinds of stuff you just really and landed in a sweet spot there so very very good on that given that you've got that type of a career that's not\nSo specialized that it might take you six months to find a job if you lost it or something and take your six minutes um then given that that's the situation I Would back and do you fully fund you're at you find that I just say between the three to six months of expenses range I Would back down to about three months\nOkay and so that's kind a like partially leaning on the ... say as part of your emergency fund but it's certainly not\nWe're not really counting it because I mean you can have lots of emergencies that have nothing to do with medical on your life when you can get you again you could lose a job you could um have the death of a relative and you had to pay for the funeral or wanted to pay for the funeral you can have all kinds of different things happen transmission blow out of the car\nAnd all kinds of things that can happen that aren't medical and you can't use the ... medical [noise]\nSo I don't generally counted in the emergency fund but I'm looking at your career stability and the fact you got a big fat I just said with a big fat match on it which is just wonderful both of them then that makes me very comfortable being almost three months side of the three to six months [noise]\nRain for your emergency [noise]\nOne question I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance is to replace your income for someone who counts on your show if you have a spouse or you have kids yes unique term life insurance is the only way to protect them until you're out of debt and the build up your\nYeah we were absolutely we were in in in in your guys as ministry that hands down\nAlso very cool well we're glad we're part of it because you guys are heroes man what a great story you're absolutely incredible what do you tell people the key to getting out of debt is\nI'd say there's a few things are obviously one hundred percent if you're not a team with your spouse there's no way you're going to get out of that I don't see how it was enough troubles and trials in life that if you guys on working together at Thursday's when I was struggling that she wasn't and vice versa\nUm and then obviously the plan that you guys set forth um and then you have to be real with yourself and I think not not live the entitled lifestyle that you're going to borrow other people's money to lose I mean\nYou know we talked about this and if you make thirty thousand dollars in this country are more blessed in probably Ninety nine percent of people in the world and I think you just kind of have to wear your shoulders and say hey this is what I Want and\nIt wasn't fun you know she was she was working three literally three jobs she had three different jobs really I got credentialed at another university and I would go in because I have a lot of time off with my job and I I didn't want to I didn't want to drive three hours and stay the night on my days off and and at the university and and work extra but\nYou know seeing them in the rearview mirror made me want to do with that much more and just get it done and it's you know I I mean what did you might get that gift for my average income is probably you know without working extra is probably one Seventy five up much on that extra\nProbably another ten or Fifteen just in the short period of time and then and then I started getting more opportunities at my at my institution um and you know I I got the only lease it I think he would approve of\nThe day Ramsey least um when I sold my truck I was going on Craig's list and I was gonna buy a beat her for a thousand bucks in my dad's got more cars and he knows what to do with and I said hey I'll give you a thousand dollars if you let me drive the Pontiac for the next year and it's an old beat up Pontiac and I'm driving two miles to work and um he said yeah I don't ... so\nI'm you know at
