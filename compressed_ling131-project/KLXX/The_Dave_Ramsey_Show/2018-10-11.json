you know um so I don't have a lot of all and uh for a long term investment because I'm not sure exactly like man I Would have to leave the country [noise] um I'm not really that the fight on hiring again\nI'm not alone but I mean they're like that I'm On there I thought I'm minimum like I thought of it because of the big on getting max and now I'm like I'm back on\nUm thought about going on with that I was going on here I live on that I have I'm saving them my dating back home and in from outside of the gate you don't want to be tried\nI think more than that I'm ... I'm Talking to you\nOr maybe that's not the right they do get um I mean I think I'm ... I'm Out in a long term commitment to it\nBut what about the guy\n... uh I mean the the problem with short term investments says it's very very hard um uh you know short term investments basically savings account and it's going to pay you know one to two percent right now\nI'm you know and when you do long term investments in the new pulled them out short term as you said you can get the market could move down on you and you could actually lose some of the money so um if you want to position some of it in long term investments with the idea\nThat ah the hope that we are going to make some more but the idea that we could actually lose someone would take some risk where some of that that's an okay thing to do um\nBut you know basically if you know you're going to need the money and the actual principals very important to you I you know there's not a ... intermediate investment that I'm comfortable with\nThat I use a so I'm pretty much either putting it in a savings account or I'm investing it and sometimes I'm investing it knowing that I may or may only be in their year and it could be down in a year and but I'm going to take that risk because that's money I can\nDo that I have a little bit of um margin with meaning I Can't afford to lose a little bit of money\nAnd if that's the case then then it's okay but that that's what we're faced with the ... is in Minneapolis I ask how are you\nHey Dave how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] uh Hi I'm a I'm currently in college and I paid cash transfers semester and I'm planning on joining the national guard\nBut I'm Wondering if I should continue going to college after I joined the national guard or if I should go back to my home town and just live with my parents for that I'm basically getting paid to go to college\nOkay when you go back to your home town\n[noise] yeah I'd go this to a university that's within twenty minutes of my parents' house\nAllergen okay if you don't go back home you would stay where you are obviously and you would um can you pay cash\n[noise] ah yeah if I were they were if I can I have the money that I'm making during the national guard and I work on top of the ship builder cashed it\nOkay and how much do you like finishing school excuse me what year are you in school [noise] um I'm a freshman also you've got three and a half years to go or whatever\nWell yeah and then I Am actually think sophomore credit card and graduate in two years\nAgo she got two years to go what are you studying finance okay and why would you stay where you are\n[noise] just because it has a better business a school recognition I guess for the state\nMhm which on the other places water community college or university this local or\nYeah just a local university and not as um right now I'm at the University of Minnesota which a lot bigger I guess too\nRight okay All right well um\nIf you actually get the knowledge of the reputation of the school really doesn't matter much in Ninety nine percent of the jobs out there okay if you actually get the knowledge\nNow if the actual quality of the education is lower [noise] then that's a different discussion okay\nBut I Would not stay someplace merely for its reputation [noise] but there's other reasons that you want to stay in that location you like it there you want to stay in that area you you know you've enjoyed the\nUh the experience of being there and you're willing to work to pay for it if you can pay cash for it\nThere's not a financial problem either direction\nAh it's just a matter of of where you want your degree to be from where you want to live the next two years of study\nAt your age I likely would have stayed where you are because I'm going to work just to be out on\nBy you might not feel that

for taking my call sure what's up I'm okay I just took a position at a at a new company I'm traveling a hundred and ten miles a day roundtrip commuting okay\nI'm I'm averaging about four hundred dollars a month and gas and I'm having a little bit of trouble kind of stomach moving to this new city because of the fact that it's the rental higher up there [noise]\nMy rent right now is only seven hundred dollars a month up there for all and that's on a two bedroom apartment a one bedroom apartment up their start she had to ride around thousand dollars [laughter] so my question is which I Do about that [noise] we're dry out or [noise]\nUm I'm driving to carry North Carolina\nI think you went shopping and one of the town and there's another town Kerry Kerry is not that dramatic it's not thirty percent more expensive than Burlington\nI'm wrong something's wrong with your analysis here\nWell everything that I've done research was I Can't find anything less than non fifty to Allison dollars off for a one bedroom apartment [noise] and I've been digging for almost thirty days now okay I'm trying to offset the cost of gas and be closer to my job\nYeah again that I'm not I'm just not doing what you're doing but I'm a I'm not I don't have the emotional ability to commute like that some people do but I Can't do it my commute seven minutes so I Can't relate I'm the I'm\nSure I I just I really think that I mean I\nI have never seen anything that indicates that scary North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive than the rest of North Carolina I mean now maybe you need to move\nTwenty miles from there instead of a hundred and ten miles from there to get something cheaper\nBut I'm the numbers you're giving me just don't work I I just ah truthfully I think you have it looked in the right places I think you're looking in certain neighborhoods or certain types of apartment complexes\nOr whatever I'm going to continue to shop and learn and I'm probably I mean I'm ... you may need to dial it out pan back a little bit and dial out just a little bit mileage wise from where you are looking to get ... you might be in the most expensive in the town I mean I can imagine that there is an area of carry this that expensive\nBut overall to carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive rents than Burlington no that's just I just don't believe that\nUm I can be wrong but I I don't I've never seen that indicates that the\nBurlington no that's just I just don't believe that\nUm I can be wrong but I I don't I've never seen that indicates that the you know one in North Carolina is that much more expensive than the other and now you want to compare Manhattan to apple in Texas we can talk about this but\nThat's a different issue and that's not what you're proposing so I think you're um you look in a different into town of Kerry or you move a little bit further out of carry but not a hundred and ten miles out of Kerry\nAnd let's see where we are at that point um but I don't think you can um what your your numbers just don't work like thanks for the call Sharon is with us in West Palm Beach Florida Hi Sharon welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nAnd I'm
