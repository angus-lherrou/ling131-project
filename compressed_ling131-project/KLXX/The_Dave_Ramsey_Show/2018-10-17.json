financial advisor get with more of our smart Mr pros and run the actual calculations which are are there there are about five steps too complicated to do here on the air okay but basically you can put in the amount of pain that you would receive and put in an average death age of\nUh Seventy six for a male Seventy eight for a female\n... that's how they're calculated typically on actuarial tables\nAnd uh then you figure out what the present value of those payments are because that's what you're going to receive and\nThat's what they're saying that they're offering you and it's probably the discount rate is the interest rate and it's probably six percent five and a half percent something like that so you probably make five and a half percent on your money and if you die you lose it\nWhen you ... when you die you lose now you know and so if you took the lump sum you'd be making ten twelve percent on your money if you invested in mutual funds and when you die your family get some money\nRight so the lump sum Ninety nine percent of the time comes out better especially if you include the fact that when you die you get to keep the money or you don't like do you know\nYes

is you need to take back control of all your finances\nIf you have to freeze your credit that's fine but you need to get control of your finances because your grandmother for whatever reason is misbehaving we've established that correct yeah there was never money with your ground balls money and with your sisters id and for all we know she's open up credit cards and your name as well correct we don't know\nI'm not sure yet\nI'm telling you need to check your credit and see if she's done that to you as well but you need to shut down a so did you get rid of your checking account is that

checking account\nDisclose and whatever monies in their ... use it to be moved over to a different account and have that bank or tell that bank what's going on that this lady is um\nYou know she's she's misbehaving she's mentally ill she says the we don't know what it is but we need to get all control taken away from her is that all she had was your debit card and checking account\nOr that I have food\nAnd that's all she had of your money or your stuff so you get paid as I as a direct deposit into your account\nSo okay so you need to change that as well ride to the new account number two a day later\nToday yeah are you going to do it today I Am wrong key\nOkay good and then you just call her up and say a ... I got enrolled in a financial class and so I'm going to take over my finances thank you for your help I'll take it from here and then you need to call like sure your bills are being paid call every one of your bills how much debt if you got\nAll my bills Toto that added up a minute ago it's a running around twenty of on how many different creditors to you or\nA ... regular bills are all that's like utility bills and that kinda stuff ... serious you don't have any you don't have anything to you don't have any debt no okay now\nOkay then you just need to call your utilities and make sure where they on auto draft on your account\nAll day then you're going to give them your new account numbers and get all that switched over today show that you take over the handling of your money and you can just like random mother know that you know with grandpa was passing I didn't want you to have to fool with this honey San won't take it over I and I'm I'm enrolled in a financial class and\nI'm going to get control as a twenty five year old man of my life\nAnd I'm ... I'm Sorry she actually in a row now\nShe's in jail why she in jail\nOr my sister cross charges critical Cargill moaning yesterday\nWhile okay well you didn't let her know that you took the bank account or a due to all this weirdness in the family then\nThey're interesting wow\nSo people in the family are not real happy with grandmother right now I take it\nAnd no not at all yeah very sad\nSad to be Seventy years old and that and so and then the next thing you need to do is you need to pull a copy of your credit bureau report and you can do that for free once a year with each of the three credit bureaus and see if there's anything showing up on your credit bureau report regarding identity\nTheft roommates who she is open cars and your name as well [noise] okay [noise]\nAnd let me help you to your sister may or may not have been really mad and she may or may not meant for your grandmother to be picked up but here's the thing the only way if someone opens an account and your name the only way to get that account cleared up\nBut here's the thing the only way if someone opens an account and your name the only way to get that account cleared other than pay it yourself which would be pretty stupid to pay an account that you didn't open when someone stole your identity the only way to keep from doing that is you have to file a police report\nAnd when you're filling out the police report they always ask you if you know who soldier identity and if you don't tell them that would be breaking the law and so your sister followed the law properly when the police report as being filled out and said yes I Know who the identity thief he is\nMy grandmother and I'm I'm surprised that actually that they went and picked her up but they did and uh you know show 'em 'cause it is it is a federal law it is a federal offense now to steal an identity and so um she she's in trouble [noise]\nShe's in real trouble but your sister ... could maybe accidentally activated all of this because she just had to do a police report to get the identity theft removed from her name right but she may have been just mad and gotten arrested I don't know either way's fine with me but um [noise]\n'cause Mormons definitely a thief but oh my goodness what a sad thing though are horrible thing you guys are going through not Cody um well much how much do you make what kind of money do you make\nOf forty thousand a year\nOkay All right are you really ready to take this over and learn how to handle money if you are I'll show you how which in our class\nI Am okay\nBut you don't have to wear your shoulders back now not look for anybody else to babysit your you're too old for a babysitter so time for you to man up here okay you hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we'll get your signed up for financial ... you can go through the clash is our\nGuest\nAnd we'll take good care of Ian show you how to handle money and then you go handle your money thanks for calling in Dayton open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five\nHow devastating\nYou're Seventy year old grandmother stealing your stuff I mean\nI I mean I run into parents who steal their kids identities and that's pretty much gone but when your grandmother does\nOh my gosh it's just heartbreaking\nAnd then a suicide in the family on top of that with grandpa oh my gosh what a mess this money stuff man it's it's a big deal not because money's a big deal but it's just so revealing it reveals everything else about two thousand [noise]\nJesus so descend your treasures where your heart is this just send money problems you have money problem when I had money problems that the problem is symptom or [noise]\nThis is the day Ramsey chef [noise]\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners checkout one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program\nYou can go there anytime\nOff what's your heart and this week [laughter] well it probably slaves good since it's paid for having me alive get so what do you tell people that key was because there's a lot of heart in your story ...

as the bucket hockey coach or show takes you through the five o'clock hour here on Wednesday now oh let's take a look back at the weekend that was in for the bobcat to a very simple as the weekend off a few games\nOr two days rabid as best you can without games buckets haven't played since the sixth of October when they split a home and home series with the by not mandatory Rosa between Bismarck and the ... or ... gets sitting in fourth place in the central division right now Austin when they're only game\nTo take the time breaker into first place they're tied with mine out who split with

game of the weekend\nAt home over Austin who played in Brookings the night before often seen three or four on the weekend Brookings off on Saturday\nDid not get any points on the weekend they sit six one six to ... a very brief intro refer than usual as we bring in Lincoln Lincoln evening Sunni power are you\nDoing great beautiful day here in the capital region absolutely no complaints after you know a was a two weeks ago we're sitting here looking at snow in the forecast so that certainly no complaints weather wise but are feeling a little bit uh an see I think restless without a without any hockey this past weekend [noise] yeah I mean it would have\nA little a little bit or whether I'm at least for the people that were going hunting and and are trying to uh [noise]\nTo maybe hit a rooster or something like that but um you know it's at least it's nice that a ... certain to starting to actually be really nice out right now so\nI felt like at least for the eastern part of the state Seventeen inches of snow is way too much a way too soon so I always thought this kid maybe like um Halloween we usually ... some there were some light Halloween is I remember that as a kid but uh he adds a little bit early for me\nYou know question my wife's home town that had a funny graphic on the New York my picture on the news is a beer can and a half of snow on the decks of an ... so uh it's crazy but it's in the fifties this week it's awesome but again that white stuff going the way that the hockey thankfully coming back this weekend what'd you think about having this off week this by\nEarly in October versus let's say last year at the end of march\n[noise] well I think it's a you know I think ideally you want it to you know you you you tend to look at your brakes and and um you don't really get one for ... I guess we look at your holidays and Christmas and I you don't get one for Thanksgiving and and yeah you get one for Christmas but then usually come back and and uh it's an onslaught of games they're so\nTheir yellow and ah when that they're starting tender ... yeah All right\nUm you know so um [noise] but\nUh yeah I think of the other day or more importantly if you can get your points uh and take care of but I mean look at look at it we play\nAh we play um you know we might not we play Aberdeen we play\nOurs is the division special yeah Austin and um you know broke it and and and and sprinkling a few\nBut ... we play ... the division special yeah Austin and um you know broke it's and and and and sprinkling a few of the wilderness and um you know so if we take care of our points or you know I think that's a ... if you don't then you're gonna start score would watch it\nYeah that that's definitely not a position you want to be unless you're ... you're doing it to see who you're playing in the playoffs in which case you know not a bad scenario to be in but that's still a long way away or let's talk about the focus of this past week um\nWhen you have that much time off or it is much much downtime I should say between games as wasn't time off aside from the the weekend a little bit but when you have that much downtime between games have you kind of balance keeping the guy's engaged and maybe having a little bit more fun than usual\n[noise] plus I think that's a big thing I mean we had a couple of guys that are two key pieces that uh [noise] you know that had been um you know ... has been on the eye are since he played the first game and then obviously ... ah didn't play for us the previous weekend which is a big big piece for us on our back and um\nYou know so I think a part of it was part of it was just making sure we had her legs and having fun and and um you know just trying to trying to be on the ice and have a bit of structure because um\nYou know stuff can stuff can get a kind of why we're only two weeks in what you think oh the amount of practices that we had already I can get pretty stagnant pretty boring so I just tried to have fun make sure we did some conditioning and then a big part was as I met with Mike and\nI'm In those guys are Sanford and said hey you know what let's take advantage of this and let's go\nNow normally we do usually Monday Tuesday pretty tough and then Wednesday is a light day but uh you know we went Monday Tuesday or\nThursday Friday so [noise] um and we went we went to a fault week so I think that's um you know it's one thing one thing worried about being sore on a Friday Saturday and when you don't have to place on a not a big a son of concern at all so we want our guys to to try and green some strings especially our youngest you need to look at the guys that have been\nGood but they've been inconsistent I think that's a big thing\nAnd the timing of it couldn't be better because I think that one of the big points of concern that you were addressing a few minutes ago was about the way that the games to finish the way the games have ended up because uh the third period shot totals or over the last three or four games\nKind of unsightly at this point so being able to get that base of conditioning and have guys a little bit more ready to are are in better condition to give their best effort that their period the timing and that seems kind of perfect yeah\nI mean I think if you if you ... back to you know play aggressive and [noise] and ah be on your toes all the time I mean I think it's I think it's demanding the things that you can do that completely for sixty minutes and I think that's where you've seen our guys struggle I think we've done it really\nReally well at times for forty minutes and then and then of a you know struggled at times to to to play a complete game and\nYou know I think you've just you've just seen those are I feel like we did it against us and we did and sign up but you see those veteran groups or find a way to to kind of see one back from you know when you when you feel like maybe you should have got points so\nYou know I think that's a that's a big key for a you know of emphasis moving forward as is making sure that we're getting more consistent and a a more consistent effort throughout the night\nAnd you know you mentioned it uh the the injuries too because anytime you get rats are the big thing is OK okay here's a chance to heal I'll get some bumps and bruises and folks might not consider\nThat being as much of a possibility after what three weeks of regular season games effectively but you know injuries can happen at any time Dan Schneider got injured his first shifted a second game of the year and had to go on the IRA Julian timber out with the injuries suffered in practice anytime you can get guys back off the shelf is a good time\nYeah especially when they're when they're key pieces I mean one guy quarterbacks a power play and the other guy is a a run in the halfway around the park place\nIt's one of those things where you know those guys are those guys are key parts and and uh you know\nI'm the crazy part is is we don't even start the season we have exhibition games and and guys or it when when you see the the hockey out to come in and the amount of guys are talking to Scotty at a at a at the showcase last last ... an exhibition and that's just that's just the way it goes you know I think that's the reason why you see some teams [noise]\nUm [noise] you know I'd buy not plays many exhibition games do you want to get guys and wraps do you want to figure out your hockey team all sorts of stuff that he don't want to get hurt so\nYou know I think that's why you see a lot of college teams play one game a one game against a team from Canada right or or ... or you know talking with Byron and they they did a a a kind of an inter squad scrimmage that's all they did and um\nYou know the thing that was kind of their their big concern is is not having a a\nYou know a guy go down and um you know so it is what it is and and not everybody has injuries and I know we haven't had a lot of luck with injuries are the last couple of years here but um you know at least they're they're ah they're minor and they're in the early ... and um you know we're we're getting pretty close to\nCompletely help you know and you know the the great thing is is that now we're starting to gear up for talking about hockey again\nThis weekend and we'll go over our three key is that the closer to show up but uh being able to to look forward to games again instead of kind of how to manage this how much that it's still good deal and say hey there's ... there's hockey there's a tunnel in that regard\nYeah just to you know gets uh it it gets long yeah there's really no other way around it I Know talking with other coaches that said you know like a rodeo enough to do for practice and that's just a you know when you think about it when back when when when played college hockey or whatever do such repetition and such a\nYou know a lot of the stuff are are are Tuesdays where the same thing or Wednesday or same thing on Thursday the same thing and and um\nYou know that was just kinda instilled in you know in in in\nA way you know what you did a weather Monday we know whether you swept the of Monday offer you a battle Monday Tuesday or Wednesday you know you worked on systems and Thursdays usually power play\nYou know so just kind of a uh that sort of stuff and then you know when you have a week off to we just wanted to keep a little bit of fun and and make sure that we had conditioning but uh you know what I think that's a big challenge for our guys making sure that we're refocus this week\nAnd um and and making sure that uh we're ready to go friday when you get in a couple of segments average about ... commercial break bucket I could go ... on super talked twelve Seventy and

now bobcats associate head coach and director player personnel Guerra here could evening for doing it doing great oh you know in our first thing we were talking\nA strong start a symbol Lenski we'll start with him an alternate captain on this team and the confidence he came into this year with I think it's been really infectious for a lot of the guys who are still kind of getting their bags to them\nWas coaching staff we feel you know what he's probably not the best one of the best defense men not only in our division within our league just with you know the amount of minutes he plays for us um the poise he has he has a ...\nYou know even even when you start throwing together some shifts where you know we have extended periods of time in the defense of zone getting him over the boards and allowing him to kind of ... some of that pressure by\nYou know being able to break bugs out on his own and you know relieve pressure by making good hard plays um that you need sometimes to ah to get a change to settle things down a little bit when when guys are kind of [noise]\nYou know getting turned around a little bit in the defense of zone and and and scrambling a bit so you know he's a imperative part of our decor and and someone that you know I think our younger players can definitely lean on and\nHe has the experience he's played really good hockey for his last year and you know he's the guy that uh you know we expect big things from this year\nAnd Julian Simba and the other side of that missed the last week into games or with an injury uh but uh when he's been in the lineup I think that just kind of his ... he never seems roster panicked\nHe's got that calm kind of pot possession or that really in this thing and this division you gotta have and it just like Sam's confidence as one of those things that can really kind of\nFilter down to the rest of the young guys\nYou know he's brought a a really good presents to her back and he's a he's someone that definitely bring some experience um but he has such good feet that you know when when he gets blocking the puck in traffic he's able to get a couple of quick strides get out of danger and make a good\nGood decision to give transition hockey or just to get it out of his own to levy it some pressure and you know he's a player that uh you know we were able to acquire early on in the season for the showcase and he's been a big addition to our to our young decor and\nUm I think it's important you know when you look at the decor is a whole to have a couple of guys that have that\nThat experience and you know those leadership qualities that are guys can learn from and you know kind of pick their brains on you know when you know you're not having successor when things aren't going your way you know what can you do as a defense men to kinda [noise]\nYou know dumb things down a little bit and and make the game a little bit easier on yourself and so those are two guys that um\nYou know have played big minutes for us you know obviously we didn't have Julian against our series against my not which allowed some other guys some big minutes and you know it was valuable experience for those guys to be able to play in a lot of different situations and\nYou don't get the opportunity to grow um as a defense but on this team and and find the role and find you know [noise]\nI'm exactly the type of the fence and that they can be to have success in our league but also with her with a group here\nAnd you know we talk about the intangibles that each guy provides but the tangible those points or did they both done a great job of contributing each guy just off a point per game a paste right now Julian with a goal and forces and six games five points Sammy on the other ... and five to seven points in eight games\nUm you know I think that's so that's something that uh you know we want to correct it and make sure we can try and get that sixty minute efforts and um you know you can\nYou can kind of stomach losing are not getting points when a when you move your feet and your work extremely hard and and and maybe they just you know you run into Hochul tender and maybe they make a few plays but uh you know we just want to we want to have that urgency throughout a and play as close to six minute games can\nYeah that and it's that third period that's that that's where it's at right now that it does seem to put together a strong third period after the way they've started these games are could be in good shape both nice\nYeah and that's a that's where I went to [noise] ah we went away scratching our heads and all I I don't know how you how we struggle a liquid insert period and still a great am Seventy three young\nBut I'm at the other day if I feel like if we if we obviously take care of Fox and play the way we could have a you know we would have never gave up to lead so um you you you you know I think there's positive civil side I think with the one thing is our transition is pretty good right now with great and a lot of chances off the rush we just got to find ways to bury 'em but uh you know just has to be better for for sixty minutes\nAbsolutely well and thank you very

Jacksonville, Florida Hi Travis well from what I've ranger\nDave how're you doing things taking my call ... ... you could a shuttle a debate for my wife uh\nOkay so the question that I that I have faith that we have it [noise] um her mother and father passed away last year and uh she was not an inheritance that in ... and she had certain amount of distribution every year for tax purposes my idea for\nThe inherited money I'm is to\nTake one moms come\nPay off all of our debt and then to repay ourselves back off of that to an IRA so that we don't have to worry about continue sleep paying the uh interest game if you will or a worry about that is that she um you know she is going to be coming out aren't good for him that for our retirement\nUm my record good at it this year forty I'm thirty eight we still have a good amount of time to be putting into our I'm telling you count so I guess my my question is should we go ahead and take the distributions help all of our debt about what their laundry paying the\nUm you know the interest rates or should we go at it I hated that down and we are a ... and ... story where you and a half years\nWell we've been using for almost Thirty years a decision making paradigm a decision making structure that is based on the idea of what is the fastest way\nTo well what is the shortest distance the wealth\nAnd I'm In the process what little in other words what gives us the greatest returns and what gives gives us the least risk\nWhat what has a level of wisdom to it um and is not just one sided it's not all investing in mind that it's not all\nThat in mind that it's not anything it's just a process of financial planning process that process has now been proven obviously doing it for twenty five years in many many people become millionaires in multi millionaires gradually not get rich quick using that process\nUm then the question becomes do you guys were you agree to use that process\nAnd if you're just so that the way I Would answer the question obviously may being me is I'm gonna tell you use that process and that won't answer your question what to do with the money\nBut um but you've got a first decide do you want to do that or not I mean that's that's that's the core disagreement here what the process is based on the process is called the baby steps and what it's based on is a couple of things number one you're most powerful wealth building tool is your income\nAnd freeing up your income and not having that not only lowers risk not only increases the peace and the quality of the relationship in the household\nBut it also increases mathematically freeze up all of your income just to make money with instead of giving it to banks and uh and the second part of the things are driving the process is is that personal finance is eighty percent behavior it's only twenty percent had knowledge stuff we're talking about it's not really rocket science here\nThere's not a lot to the math it's it's about fourth or fifth grade math is really all it is\nSo having said that we say baby step one side of a thousand dollars you guys are obviously done that too is to be dead free everything but your house you've not done that\nThree years to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses I didn't hear that you've done that and then force you don't have that for start putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement so how much is in your emergency fund\nCurrently we have about twenty five or so in our\nCome if the inheritance was not on the table or we would teach you to do is take that down to twenty four through the uh or take twenty four of the twenty five and throw it at the vet and then clean up this debt very very quickly it is absurd for you to have Seventy five thousand dollars in debt with a two hundred thousand\nVet and then clean up this debt very very quickly it is absurd for you to have Seventy five thousand dollars in debt with a two hundred dollar household income it was Janine right up on your\nLife or a couple of months ago and I'm a went on a on a life and I was a nice way to earn an eye on him right probably going to go wherever that\nOkay it's absurd that you make two hundred thousand dollars a year and you know twenty five dollars and that\n... ... you know\nYou got to make enough money to have done this the right way you chose not to do with the right way so it's up to you guys but if you're going to do what we teach you know you would use this inheritance immediately to become debt free so that you take all those payments that you don't have any more and you use those to build wealth with you have a paid for home\nIs the correct we we inherited it or not\nOkay All right and how much is in the inheritance in cash\nI I'm not quite a hundred percent go about another somewhere north of ... Seventy five a\nHundred and Seventy five thousand dollars correct okay and why she taking distribution says they're just taking it\nA ... ... what her final ... around her told her that she had to get a good in a disturbing to um [noise] um is it cover or tax a covert each year 'cause here at heart over at the most part because the way to collect the money out of town\nYeah it's a bunch of crap um the\nUh okay because anytime you start making decisions based on taxes instead of based on economics you make bad decisions so I don't know what this money's invested in but I Want to get control of this money and get it invested\n... what would I Do I catch the whole thing out pay some taxes and get a different financial advisor and uh I Would pay off all the debt\nAnd I'm going to invest the rest of it uh in something that I can see controlling know what it is in good mutual funds or in some paid for real estate or something like that I honestly don't think that's what\nYou all are going to do but that's what I Would do um because I think there's a lot of cooks in this kitchen there's a lot of opinions flying around here\nAnd you guys have got to get inside this end to as a couple decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do and show them\nTelling you what to do and uh it's a different different situation so I think she inherited the financial advisor to\nI don't think you picked him and um and that's really a bad medicine\nAs well Ninety percent of the time are you guys need to pick 'em or you need to re pick him and hiring again and this time he works for you but I think he's still works for grandpa even grandpa was dead\nAnd and that's the way this stuff works usually bad bad medicine Travis what I Would do this catch the whole thing out pay off all my dad's\nAnd invest the money with what's left that's what I Would and I would take your wonderful two hundred thousand dollar income and become multi millionaires with it and that's what we've shown people how to do for almost three decades now hold on I'll send you guys are a couple a copy of\nThe book the total money make over

interested in opening a five twenty nine plan for my daughter she has autism so I may open an ... account instead would depending on the severity of autism\nMy biggest concern is that I don't know what happens to the money to five twenty nine plan if she doesn't go to college can you tell me what happens to money not used for education\nOr it will be if you don't transfer it to a sibling um it'll be heavily taxed and ... it'll be taxed and heavily penalize\nSo um\nKnow the five twenty nine is not a good plan\nA for a child that you're not sure what's going to happen as far as their education\nIs going to be and um where you've got a special needs situation like this I Would usually able to count 'em and or I Would just use ritual fun just blurted mutual fund and let it grow and then you can just take care of the child with that money or just marking it for them for their future\nOr they may do a trade school they may do or they may be able to do a full for your academic run 'em they may do a lot of things I don't know how the severity of this I don't know exactly what you're facing\nBut are you simply going to save money it's as simple invest money in your name and you're controlling it and then you can decide to help your child however you want to [noise]\nThe only advantage of the table or the five twenty nine is just the tax advantage still just don't investment in a good mutual funds\nAnd my question is is at our as it grows is going to be taxed that's the only thing so it's a it's an advantage if you have a real high probability of them doing our education\nAbout again where you've got a a a special needs situation most of the time I'm going to say just save it in a regular count saving it in a mutual fund\nIf you want to use the cable that's fine that's what it's designed for and do all kinds of stuff with that but it's a good plan but I probably would just keep it where I can get my hands on it and I'm I'm not a big deal either way the the thing the reason we push of ... those two things\nAre ... in a traditional such a situation\nIt teaches you to brainwash your kid to go to college which is not a bad thing at all and\nThat money to grow tax free and so it's a ... that's a wonderful benefit but is that ... is that the only possible way you can care for your child no\nInterest in a more traditional situation it's the best way the most um you know the least taxes on the thing which is generally what we want to do\nI'm relating to grow but in the situation I I'm not that tax benefit is not worth the pension you in the corner and actually hitting you harder later I'm making you wish you just pay the taxes and and that's the way to work out open phones at\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five ... on Twitter Dave I'm
