I'm about yeah about Fifteen thousand dollars a month and I'm just blowing through that crazy sex addiction\nUm I'm spending just in the same amount of money about ten thousand dollars a month on the prostitutes and strip clubs and um ... all the above and I don't know what to do have tried everything that goes sex addicts anonymous\nUm and but I I I I Want to know what you would do in the situation I I've done well I spent about how that money on buying a house and I'm ... now and I'm doing well with that\nKind of that since then it's been a long project finished but I don't know what to do about this how should handle it or anything else that you would try to I have\nA cold or I mean twenty two and um\nThe inheritance came from ... who passed away so my dad passed away about two years ago I'm a he was missing plane and I might be coming into a lot more money\nYou talk to her um [noise] I cheat sheet at the picture\nI ... as you know job and I'm not a therapist I'm not a a trained councilor um I have worked with addicts for Thirty years ago one hundred percent of the addicts end up broke\nIf if they don't feel their addiction and so you are going to destroy\nYour legacy\nYour dad's legacy with the money that was left to you and you're going to destroy all your future dreams that this money represents if we don't if you don't get the help and he'd the help and fight to win against the addiction\nSex addictions in pornography addictions are the fastest growing addictions in America that we see that in our offices with financial trouble um people in your situation more than any other addiction\nWe see we still see cocaine we still see 'em and we don't treat for that but we ended up helping them with their finances we still see alcohol and uh but gambling and sex are both just ... the the\nPornography is a is a is gone crazy because of the Internet the access and um uh it's affecting every part of our lives in good ways in bad ways but the access in this case is causing\nExcess and gets people in real trouble with gambling and porn checks addictions um\nSo you're you you know you named off a couple of the right things and that's getting an essay getting in a um a an anonymous group I'm getting in a with a therapist is the second thing I Would do um the third thing I Would do\nIs um [noise] it it sounds to me like just a guy talking to a young guy an old guy talking to a young guy that all of your family structure has gone it's just you didn't have it with your mom and then your dad died and so you you're just left without any authority\nStructure is a twenty year old young guy there's nobody in your life kind of standing over your shoulder is going to stump you when you grew up your life\nYeah I I I Do have some family on my dad's side I'm actually a\nGood way but they know what's going on now so I Know\nThere were ads problems going on like over a year ago like effect and that's just a and I I never and whenever I tried it goes then they kinda they were like a cheesy oh you're just being picked on this that and I never kind of trust again okay with them so I just kind of put off the illusion that okay and that's okay but\nThat's fine so that there are no help is what you're saying yeah OK\nOr no help but they they they're they're good but I just I don't know how\nWell I Know that all behaviors obviously have a psychology involved um as a person of faith as a Christian I also believe behaviors or spiritual and show to treat or something like this only as a psychological thing is usually a half\nTreatment treated only like it's a spiritual thing might very well be half treatment but um there there's something that you're obviously searching for\nAnd there's something that you're missing 'em that's causing you too I'm literally go crazy in this part of your life right\n[noise] yeah I I I think it's like I'm just beyond lonely I don't know if in fact um but um [noise] I I I don't know honestly I\nThink that's probably right that doesn't sound wrong [noise] how can I can resonate with that I can imagine you being there in that situation and it's amazing you\nYou know but you can be it's very very real I'm just so the last component I Would add to it um\nAnd you're asking me so you always get my opinion when you're asking me and that I'm an expert on my opinion [laughter] so ah what I Would tell you do is find a great church and will help you do that and and sit down and get\nPastoral counseling to go with your other counseling get west some young guys in that church and become friends with some people who have some character\nHave some integrity and that are walking a straight line not perfect there isn't any perfect people over there are at that church ... churches got people in them so you can find that out pretty quick but you will find a book\nOr synagogue or no you're Jewish okay cool that's more effective than let's get one of the rabbi dude let's get the spiritual element of this going because there's a there's an aspect of that\nThat goes with this and if that's your heritage and that's your your your faith and wonderful on by caused the town that has a lot to say about the issues that you're dealing with um a lot\nAnd um so yeah I that's the only thing I Know how to tell you though because I Can't just yell at you stop it or you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy you've already realizes just ruining your life\nAnd um you know that I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is and you're finding this from the twelve steps is that one of the thing is you realize you're powerless\nAnd you know God has to step in and I've got to put some structures in my life and I've got a you know figure out a ... there's some careful psych self analysis and say well loneliness is the issue so how do I fix loneliness well obviously I'm fixing it inappropriately and so how do I fix it was more wisdom\nAnd that will be hanging out with good people are that are lifting you up I'm\nObviously not hanging out with paid friends which doesn't work for anybody whatever version of pay to friends you have and yours is one of the more gross\nSo um but that's you know that's the only thing I Know how to tell you I I I Would make sure I really lean into getting a group of people around me that I can trust and if there's\nA group of people that um are are working on a social project that is worthy and you've got to get with a bunch of young men doing that and you had some good guys around you um then that's very important I've got a group of guys I get with once a month those were the last night as a matter of fact I'm fifty eight\nUm that group of guys got all our son's together that are in their twenties or the other day and we all encouraged them and they all agreed\nThat they need a group of guys you ain't got a what my friend Stephen Mansfield calls a band of brothers in your life\nOr to walk with you in these situations so I'm a man\nI'm just a guy I don't know how to help you I'm afraid for you to tell you that and hold on all have our pick up we're going to send you a copy of Mansfield book he's got a lot to say about this kind of stuff and then look man\nMansfield manly men or whatever it's called and I'm ... and you need some guys around who do that's what I'm thinking and and you need some spiritual well\nHad it as a component to this this is the day Ramsey show\n[noise]\n\nYou know what I've learned after talking to so many people who have been victims of ID theft they feel violated

in the process of trying to consider buying a house the challenge who are running into is that we own to rental houses and we currently rent the one we live and then we don't want to take on more debt and and so we're trying to figure out whether we should sell the rental properties or\nUm you know how the just sort of cynical that and I'm not getting into too much debt\nOkay do you have um what is one of these rentals worse\n[laughter] well what are the challenges that we face it the rental properties are actually out of town on them I'm a military guy and we're currently living in Dayton, Ohio but a rental properties are in Georgia in Virginia so but I'm the value sell them\nYes I Would not long distance landlord okay\nNo that's your health and they were asking for trouble you need the money you're in the military are trying to buy a home and you need the money and you don't need to be like you got you did not set out to own rental property everywhere these rental properties by\nDefault was not there you're not you're five your strategy to buy rental properties all over the United states\n\nTo 'em that's been the inclination that I've been getting from a couple of folks that have been talking to my mom I haven't been seen though is that they've been successful I've had renters that have been paying the mortgage and um it seemed like there there's the possibility of value going up\nAnd I'm about to go up but I'm also sure somebody's gonna change their Harley or when you're living room because you're out of town [laughter] this is going to happen I I I've got rental properties man I got a bunch of them I won't rental property for forty years and um you've got to be I I just don't do any long\nDistance land or they don't have any property that I ran out

idea\nEighty eight percent of the time that people take that Khan solid Asian looms out they don't change their habits and they're on their debts back up the only time I tell people to move that into a debt consolidation is to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure and you're not asking me about either one of those\nSo I think your bank wants to see you deeply in debt does that's what banks do\nSo well is when a bank says\nHey I've got a great idea what\nThey're really saying is hey I can make some money off of you\n\nI mean really it's like playing with a skunk and wondering why you got sprayed

pretty serious dose of drama to the contest\nBut a big savings spiked by Johnny Roberts vote by Adams' taco empty net go get a ... a three to one when on home opening night over the might not mandatory was ending might not win streak at five consecutive games\nOn a Saturday things started well for the broadcast again ... getting a power play go from a sharp angle shot take one nothing after one bobcats again would start to just do nothing\nNikki Jessica moments after a power plant and making your redirect from jak all send it to make it to zero but my not came roaring back in ... five on three goal in the final ... five and a half minutes excuse me ... the second made it to one after two and then the third my not\nBlew up ... got the tying goal and unless the minute later on the short hand brake ... not to give them a lead they wouldn't give back\nIn the final five minutes in London David Rice and in scored\nTo put the finishing touches on a five to to win Vermont out the two teams traded home opening victories and so the bottom cats are ... come into their by week\nAnd the same place that they came in home opening weekend two points behind my not for first place in the NHL central division of course my kids have no points this weekend I so going to be doing a lot of scoreboard watching but also a lot of a recovery andme recuperation here\nIs it's what happens after it to you watch it on film but uh\nYou know just the just the just the effort the ... you know it's one of those things where you can't take you can take two minutes off and and uh\nYou know it's a balancing pocket is what it is in semi tries to keep it alive in a in a for effort was a little better or on the ... like you know the guy that the guy the guy that got the puck\nUm after it bounced or semi stick didn't score a goal or that's the whole key into the end of the whole sequence so we just need to make sure we not only you take care of Fox but uh that's the reason why I left him on the ice says hey the there\nThere are there are top unit right now they're they're click and their score and goals or what whatever I had confidence in those guys to go back out in a you know when when when certain stuff like that that happens I would've been a [noise]\nI'm pretty [noise] um I guess maybe animated or or whatever the word is to get them off and get the next year bomb but I had confidence in those guys going out and and uh and trying to redeem themselves so um you know it is what it is I'll take a call takes them with a there in that spot uh for the Next Fifty two games\nNo question about that and you know these two games more than anything else just pretty standard is mark my not NHL games there there are a few little tells that it was early season kind of hockey but by and large the rivalry was mid season formed by the middle of the first period on friday night yeah\nAnd and I think uh you know it's um it's it's heated and it's a [noise]\nYou know there's a there's John going back and forth and I think that's what makes us rather refunding and uh the just the competitiveness I think that's where you see in her early really rise and and and the depth and the parity\nEspecially in the center vision I just I just feel like it's a it's it's soda and go to [noise] um you know we we obviously expect that night in night out with a with a string of uh I've called strength of our schedule I'm from from our opponent so we face every night and um you know the dust on the newspaper but\nYou know you look at whatever dean did and the robbers and cup last year last couple of years in a ... or two years ago ... and might not last year I just I just feel like the ... uh the central division has gotten a\nDeaf so much depth that I feel like it or the team that comes out of this division is going to have a great chance when ...\nYeah the division strength right now is bananas none better there than it will be no real separation yeah most of\nThese I'll take any team I'll take any any team in this division against the the top five or ... whatever team isn't any other division ... it doesn't challenge any assaults whatever you want anybody wants

this it seems like a really nice time to have this week off to really kind of recalibrate everything\nI think it's ... it's a it's a really nice uh timing for the fact that um I mean if you look at our first six games obviously we'll to showcase then we make it turn right back down to Austin which ah [noise]\nThe logistics of that or or or not the easiest and and I think it's nice for us to uh

got to get the skates ready to go make sure there's a no holes in any of the gear and make sure they're safe and ready to get out there and give it their all\nAbsolutely add um it it's not just game days either a everyday practice day off days or\nWhat does that look like for you get the fans in idea of even with like a practice day like today what ... what is your morning with like while the guys are out there practicing\nUm well usually get there about an hour before and just a set up everything make sure everything's good to go um and make sure nobody needs any gear repairs or anything like that\nA during practice is kind of nice I just kinda sit there and enjoy the hockey and enjoy the drills and make sure everybody's good maybe a run into the locker room for a Jersey you're a backup stick here and there\nUm so yeah\nAnd it so that this is the first year the bobcats have had a dedicated equipment manager um what's the feedback then like particularly from players who were here last year like material in the Jacob Marty John Roberts guys like that's what's been the reaction from the players are to have you in there helping out\nI'm so far I think they love it they ah they seem as if they've been saying it's a huge difference and\nIt's a big help um so I'm Glad to be part of the team and glad to be helping everybody out and making things easier on all the players so they can get out there and get us those points\nYou are from northern California I aren't talking about this earlier in the office today ... has it been a bit of a culture shock moving to a place where there are big snowstorms on October fourth yeah real winter yeah I uh\nAnything below fifty degrees is kind of way too cold for me so living out here it's been a pretty big adjustment I uh\nGo buy some pants the other day yeah that that was that was running ... around the office the last couple of weeks Trent from California has never needed actual hands before he has his shock and awe for the bobcats other than that no actual\nLong pants this is quite the adjustment that you're going through right now I had to go up by some genes it's short shorts just aren't working out here anymore I uh the cave in\nA a it was kinda hoping maybe it just wouldn't happen mail get lucky and North Korea just wouldn't have a winter yeah OK yeah best of luck on that one guy I don't know earlier than I thought it was too ... was it was it genuinely shocking because I I kind of vaguely recall the look on your face and I looked at the window and they said hey Trent look outside it's snowing [laughter]\nI don't know if you're necessary believe me no not right off the bat it literally to see it for myself I uh\nIt's I thought it was too early to start snowing and it's never too early to start stuck around for a little while too so I Believe I've been told that the only ... months in the entire year that there hasn't been snow in North Dakota ever is August every other month fair game\nI oh I Believe it now so yeah getting ready for all of that so with this off we get it's kind of an interesting thing\nEvery other month fair game I oh I Believe it now so yeah you know ready

eight to five five\nMany years ago I discovered that there are thirty one [noise] proper [noise]\nWhen you read the book of wisdom in the Bible written by Solomon there's thirty one of them which\nMakes it fairly easy to read one a day so if you don't do anything else in your spiritual walk or in your search for wisdom you can read one proverb a day\nAnd if you do that over and over and over twelve times you will have read that book in one year right and I'm Thirty years later I have read it a bunch of times\nAnd uh you know ... book wisdom and I you know what if you actually understand the stuff you will get wiser\nIsn't that interesting you know and here's what happens when you get wiser your life gets better\n\n'cause he quit doing stupid stuff you know I'd have figured out the less stupid stuff I have a better life for her\nYou know it's fairly simple isn't it you kind of get back what you put out you report you show if you plant corn corn grows your plan stupid you

instance proverbs tens as a slack hand causes poverty\nBut the handle the diligent makes rich translation lazy will make you poor and you work and you'll have money\nSort of hard translation as it a slack hand causes poverty but the hand of the diligent makes rich\nInteresting\nDiligent was diligence diligence is excellence\nOvertime\nContinued excellence my one moment of excellence but continued excellence and ordinary things when you do ordinary things with the level of excellence and that's called diligence and by the way that makes one rich\nInteresting isn't it the hand of the diligent what's the hand the hand of the diligent makes one rich\nSo here's one of the things I figured out I read this study years ago and now of observed it in all the millionaires we meet with and talk with and and it showed up again in this millionaire study that Chris Hogan and the team just did for the everyday millionaire project you know we interviewed ten thousand millionaires among the things we found there and one of the things we found in this study before that that I read years ago was\nPeople who have wealth and keep wealth and building well have a long\nThank you for joining us America that all lives in San Francisco I don't well some of the day for him to show\nHim how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nSo I'm forty five and I'm looking to retire at fifty five I'm I have a pension and I'll be getting like Seventy five percent of my pay\nCheck in four one K. and stuff like that but um [noise] I've been recently started listening to you and I've already paid off some of my dad but um what's left is only about thirty four hundred\nBut I'm sure I'll be on the path of Ninety Days after um [noise] but my question is I've been looking into refinancing in my house because I have an F ha and so I have PM I and I\nWhen I Do the math like the six thousand dollars and closing costs versus a hundred and eighty seven\nMonth ends up being three years plus my interest rate is\nGoing to go up so I'm not sure if that's the smart thing to do because\nYou're going to stay in the home longer than three years that's the only way you're gonna end up getting gravy on that biscuit right yeah for sure\nSo um that's how you analyze it um that's\nThat's kinda borderline that's the tipping point is much longer than three years I probably on your break even analysis I probably would not but if you're you know Ninety percent sure you're going to be there longer than three years you're going to pass the break even point you are making money even at a higher interest rate is what you're telling me right\nI'm In a while I'll get out of having to pay the hundred and eighty seven\nYeah but where your interest rates go up and offset that\nHe well he acts like a three point seven five now and everything I'm getting quoted about like for you know so you're not going to make any money so is it better just to stand and hate us\nArmy you're gonna be able to Washington You're probably gonna be at four seven five on a Fifteen year right\nNow uh today and so that's like a one percent spread 'em and so what is your a loan them out\n[noise] this one is a hundred and sixty six thousand\nOkay and so one in three years I've already paid off ten thousand now about\nOne percent on a hundred and sixty six thousand increase is sixteen hundred dollars a year\nOkay and you're only saving Eighteen hundred or a hundred and eighty dollars a month which is about two thousand dollars a year so no I wouldn't do this if that's the only if that's the numbers yeah I'm okay everybody sickly breaking even to refinance and I wouldn't do that I pay the loan off\n[noise] and then add one other question I just joined ... P U and in my area everybody's already in session but some of them have only done one class\nJumping I still don't even go in yeah jumping you'll be okay All right\nYeah the first classes on savings and you're already ahead of the game on that you're eating machine and and go back and watch it on with your own line because you've got a one year membership and you can watch or listen to everything on line for a year okay\nSo yeah you go and watch the blessing one and then when you go in Iraq whatsoever zone listen to your right in sync okay yeah no troubles are you doing great way to go dawn you killed a ghetto Christine is with us in Boise idaho I Christina how're you\nDoing well thank you Dave\nI'm so we have it as a great situation for our family but I'm not quite sure how to proceed we I'm told her home in California and walked away with a lot of equity and has since moved to Boise how much but we um if they got so much equity\nAbout two hundred and forty thousand boom boom love it yeah um so we're here just renting while we kind of thing\nAbout two hundred and forty thousand boom boom love it yeah and um so we're here it gets renting while we kind of figure out you know if we want to build their by [laughter] um but I'm not\nQuite sure because they already have our our savings we have our retirement we have all that\nOut of debt that we get go yeah we don't have any debt good um but it we just go and maybe take cash for a house yeah what we want or at home we have what we wanted we want where we were you know we want something they've been caught that more than what we have all\nKinds we'll put a small mortgage on okay and what what would you be talking about building or buying or pressuring\nOh preference between four and six\nOkay and you have to forty in the bank mhm okay so if we should for forty as an example Utah over\nTwo hundred thousand dollar mortgage right mhm outright ... company that all five years\nReally dabbling yeah no I mean just knock it out how old are you guys\nI'm I'm forty five and my husband fit\nYou have any money in savings or investments to this not in a retirement account\nYeah there's all kinds of it [laughter]\nAll right well my rule of thumb is never take out a mortgage that is on more than a Fifteen year mortgage and the payments more than a fourth of your take home pay you're not even going to approach that way way and I may be close to that and so if you take out a two hundred and fifty\nDollar mortgage you're going to really find house in Boise idaho for half a million dollars that's a long house that's wonderful property and about what\nWe're hoping more Korea property than that but they have\nNow and it's a whole different world though obviously from where you came from rights\nAnd so I'm mean your bang for buck is huge in Boise compared to you know a big City California so um yeah you you're going to make a huge progress here and you know you just about whatever if you take a small mortgage or out in a small relative to your situation in other words\nI'm not going to yell at you know I don't borrow money so ... we'd be buying a two hundred fifty thousand dollar house and then we'd be saving money and we'd move up later\nAnd that's how we would do it because I mean we don't borrow money for any reason ever but if it's the only thing I don't yell at you for borrowing on on this show and in your case though just have the different mindset\nThat the mortgage is just more like a car loan and we're just going to knock it out real fast I mean like other people's ... to ... like five years or something you know let's just put on there and\nHow fast can we knock this thing in the head and let's get after it and that's how I Want to think about it it's a really good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Sarah is in California Hi Sarah welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] and I was wondering if I should tell my car worth about eight to ... ... pay off my about forty thousand dollars a day and start my emergency fund like card paid off\n... what is your household income about thirty thousand a year\nYou should not have an Eighteen does ... what do you have too much tied up and things going down in value when you're how when your car or things with motors your wheels of any kind added up equals more than half your annual income how did you end up with an Eighteen dollar paid for car making thirty grand\nAnd I was married and we refinanced our how can they included the car in the mortgage\nAnd then he got and and then we\nGot a divorce and we sold the house and the cart was paid off\nGot it okay and I got the kind that so\nIt takes away most of that spread when you when you you know when you factor interests 'cause we're there is risk when you have mortgage now is not a lot of risk because you've got the money in the bank today to pay it off but er an investment to pay it off but there is risk\nAnd so uh you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of the foreclosures occur on home with a mortgage there is rich and so I'm getting rid of that\nWhen I found this it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula\nBecause when you don't have a mortgage you start making different decisions with your career you start making different purchase decisions you start having different levels of enjoyment with your money\nYour relationship with your spouse talks to have a different depths because there's a level of security in your overall life that there wasn't before and those things are really hard to put on paper so\nWhat I have figured out is I'm going to live a hundred percent that free\nAnd I'm going to invest like crazy the rest of the money that I have in cash that comes in and I've ended up with a ton of money doing that because I don't have any risk and I'm just investing real money not borrowed money so all of that to say if I woke up and your shoes I pay off your mortgage today\nAnd if ... if this discussion good sour on you and you think they ran she's crazy a year from now just get you into the mortgage\nNo I I I I completely agree I mean I for one thing that he got space just give it a lot of money I'd go you know I just go I mean I like that and get paid off but my ... back and forth\nAnd I what I'm trying to point out is is that your the your gut is not intellectually wrong your mind is your minds using an incomplete primitive formula\nGot it\nThat's what I'm pointing out is that makes sense completely yeah paid off the you got this thanks for the call open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five seat your heart story it's not really you guys your heart your heart's where you measure risk my heart's telling me pay off my house\nMy hands telling me I could make more money on these ... Mooney with your heads missing some stuff it's missing risk\nAnd um it's kind of a fun thing that I was doing this for the class of MBAs speaking to them and uh 'cause MBAs or all talk you know masters in business they're all taught strategic thought and they're all taught to borrow money\nAnd uh I got a finance degree I was talking to borrow money my broke finance professor used to teachers to borrow money and so um you know it it's broke finance professor is like a shop teacher was missing fingers right people so think about this right so I got it you just can't think that way and you
