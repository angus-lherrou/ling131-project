like that and often\nTimes you don't really have access to those do you have it administrators town\nIf I Do yeah I guess at Liz straight I created a kind of horror but when I tried to log in that case are looking for the delay neighborhood\nAre all yeah so you need to go into the uh you need to go into the networking settings and in turn that off um let me see where that would be as long as they haven't set it up because it's not unusual\nBut says sometimes business is set up that you can't change that you know if you give a computer to an employee you don't want them to mess with it

sure where it is is it when there's a network yeah yeah [noise]\nChange network setting change optional [noise]\nSo I think if you go my my guess is if you go first\nThing I always do by the way is just go in the search in a system settings and search for whatever's bugging you in this case if you search for a domains you'll be able to it says go into the account settings and under the account settings there's a a entry called access work or school\nAnd you've you've almost certainly got\nIn there um\nThey set up that says you know log into the domain you should be able to remove that

he went out there with a Jerry McCrary of a short tracks guide services and we're going to have Jerry on in the next segment I Know he helped you out a great deal but uh you've been out there a few days they had a whole discouraged I Know I was talking to talking to Jay your dad and he was saying well you know they're out they're training camp show a\nNonbinding anything a little one is so forth so you were there was the last day\nWell technically it was the last day of my aunt or it it came to a Wednesday which Blake and I have actually alternating hunts Monday Tuesday\nAnd Wednesday and Thursday was going to be all day for me and then left it was going to be all day for him and I had already hunted the morning and we got a little bit in the afternoon and then we're going to ... hunt and we're in the set\nAnd we're down to the last twenty minutes of light and quite frankly I I really think is going to happen we're sitting here we'd only seen literally two elk\nA spike in a nice six by sex and that had been on the third day and you know we're sitting there lake was telling me were down in a set Jerry been trying to call\nAnd we're just sitting there and I'm thinking well\nAnd I even made the comment Blake's today you're the one more interview I'm going to come on you you know\nTold about you know there's about Fifteen minutes of light left and tell us you know what's\nFor the gunshot and it sounded like it was kept on yards away so he made a call went in for another guy that wasn't making calls but you know twenty minutes to go I Do my interview not ten seconds after I said that Blake's like you know it only takes to insects the change of heart\nAnd I'm thinking yeah right whatever so I'm sitting there and Jerry is actually left about ten minutes ago behind us he was sitting there call and well he came the way we walked in there is a big overlook where you can see this big past year and he actually ran up there and took it upon himself to you know to try to call something in\nTen minutes late life now and also we hear crash and I'm thinking I'm looking straight ahead going Blake something come and like some common\nAnd no it was Jerry coming from our left from down a hill to get over your head over here he's come in and now I'm thinking for one yeah right and then all of a sudden he's got this look on his face like\nIt's happening so I look at black boy looks to me and we're running around and we'd go up this hill\nThat's when you realize how to shape you really are when you're up in the mountains you're having to run up this hill we get up there I Can't see the elk\nI get down and get my six down and look and look in Blake's on the hook right behind me you know trying to film everything he gets up and he's looking at the ... going to take them\nAnd I've got Jerry over there saying take him and I don't see it I'm On the ground going [laughter] you know it's been raining um look and Jerry's calling trying to stop him well then I kind of catch a glimpse of them but I Can't get and shooting range because there's a ... way\nSo I look and Jerry he's got this friend it looked like pay you need shoot you know\nLike like I got 'em on can go ahead take the shot and um you got guys I I I don't have them you know Jerry keeps calling all of a sudden he says okay now now on something and now what you know when he tells me down on the crawl so here comes the belly crawled I mean it's it's something out of a book I mean it it's almost too good to be true so I'm crawling them crawling I'm calling I finally get up I get my shooting sticks I get set\nI'm trying to look for and look for I finally got them well now he's quarter and down and they think he's running away they're both yelling at\nThrow cap Adam [noise] you know I've got Blake saying take him I've got um and I see him quarter and down and then he's going kind of parallel with this and he looks to be a long way\nSo I'm looking I'm a hundred from Missouri I'm not used to this you know this is my first ... I'm pretty confident in myself 'cause I started in real well with the night rifle up to a hundred yards so I'm sitting there I don't have a ... year back there\nWere up there we're we're kind of you know Jerry stopping them he finally gets settled and about what I thought was in my range but I'm Still looking going man he is a long way away\nI'm asking my camera and Blake Blake gimme artist give me ... and he won't say anything so that to me you know my heart's in my chest going\nThis is a long shot well finally he stops again and he's broadside I'm thinking okay stick your time and I'm figuring it'd be about two hundred yards now and I look at him and I put that night rifle and I know what you low laughter drops a little bit\nI take my time cock that tree or ... or the hammer getting ready to snap it nothing [laughter] oh no [laughter] yeah [laughter] I had another choice words [laughter] so I look at it and I you know what it was it like I said the man upstairs must have had a plan for him because I didn't freak out I didn't panic\nWith the head the night rifle has to say if you will say exactly it had to click one which I had done and then it has been on the hammer that had the firing pin that you have to push them\nSo I just like pulling back hit the frying pan then Jerry my savior over there has been called on to this guy we have a de corps down to our right he just doesn't know what's going on is getting closer but he's not moving right now I pulled back I put it right on top of his back right about the middle\nAnd let her go and booming I mean you know

didn't go the way he was facing extend jump back and went back towards the the other way and I'm sitting there and I'm Still in shock that everything just happen just now in a matter of ten minutes and my camera guy says I think you hit 'em\n[laughter] thanks [laughter] you know so I'm Wondering I'm Wondering Well Jerry comes running over and you know he's waiting and we kind of the the joy wasn't there yet because I wasn't sure we kind of were sitting there and you know we're going over what just happened and Jerry all of a sudden stops us and so you hear that you hear that and he said

Oh yes of course okay now I'm the old rule did have any drinking or same problems not really now is your home shady\nUh yeah that some shade and part of the house yeah do you get more strict on the front of that I just feel just that in front of a little bit late right like above the entrance of the door you know but I got like a a by shape how a ... type out show\nOne in thinking here is that typically the area where the roof rafter touches the roof sheeting right where the would basically isn't solid contact\nThat's a cooler spot than the areas that are right and left of it so sometimes when we get these stripes on the roof it's a condition is called ghost thing\nHas because you get more condensation are in those areas that are cold in the areas that are warms the left and right and\nNow also on the shady side of the house or wherever you have shade you're also much more likely to pick up a little algae or like in or moss\nAnd that can also cause standing on the roof so before we jump to conclusions what I Would suggest you do is use to take a very simple approach does a roof clear out there that's called spray and forget\nIt's available and ready to use bottled you basically just snap hose and a garden hose onto\nAnd then you could spray the roof down and just kind of walk away and see what happens I actually haven't had an extremely dirty shed roof that has so much moss on it and it was crazy 'cause it just hadn't done anything wrong time so so last summer when I was\nPainting the fence and doing the repairs outside of decided I Would take care of that and I got the springs forget\nAnd put it on once and then I walked away for about a month notice that almost all that was going to put it on one more time and it's perfectly clean and put it down doesn't happen instantly because basically what it does that stops the growth from forming think of it in a sort of a weed killer for the moss\nAnd it brightens the roof and then there's a residual in stays on it and kind of protects it over the long haul so I Would try or products like that it's very simple fairly inexpensive and see if that doesn't pay and then if it does then you kind of know what you're dealing with\nUm one natural thing that you can do to ... though that group down to teach me try to get a little more sunlight on that area sometimes I've told folks ... trees and and that's should just enough light on it 'cause sunlight is a natural Mildred side as well so that makes sense\nAll right I'll give it a shot\nAnd hey you gotta flooring project in mind we got a two hundred

North Carolina where we lack in dealing with problems but the\nThing that and try and have had a part of that argument\nAnd a lot of march around in our apartment and more like planting flowers it's that that they are tiny spiders and at that are low spiders and then there's brown fat or that are as big as corridors\nBattered I've ever seen in my boy\nAnd in the brown spiders that are as big as quarters they sound like brown recluse spiders which can bite so those we don't like it all\nRight but I have ... stuff on lies I've tried all kind of fat out inside my house that our ran outside that they're impossible to get rid off\nSo I hate to say this but have you considered hiring a professional and you probably stay saving some money but whenever I hear somebody is buying lots and lots of pesticides spraying it inside the house in spring and outside the house I'm kind of the opinion that by the time you do all that you've expose yourself to so much\nAccess pesticide that you would have been better off just having a pro come in because they can buy stuff that you can't buy plus they're specifically trained on where to put the insecticide how much deployed\nAnd also the insecticides that they are very specific and they remove only insects that they're supposed to remove and they don't remove the beneficial insects that you want to leave behind so if you're having that much of an infestation\nI Would stop shopping round pesticide and call a pro and have them treat the house and once you get the populations down to where they are manageable kind of more normal than you could try to use some of those other products just on a maintenance bases that makes sense\nIt sure does but here's that here's down the question when everybody else is having the same problem and the mall kids all around the ... entire neighborhood it's made by and going to help stop at\nWell yeah it'll increase sort of a barrier around your place but let me ask you is this a apartment you rent or says a townhouse what was the former\nSlack up at that gets built this how labor neighborhood at new apartment like forty three apartments\nOr their rental apartments yeah okay so if you get the ... the exterminator out there and they tell you that you've got something like a brown recluse spider there\nAnd you bring that to the attention of the rental agent and I think he'd give them plenty of reason to treat the whole apartment complex and not you know nor them and to the point where people on kids start getting bitten\nOkay I think pretty firm action\nWhen this whole time in your house
