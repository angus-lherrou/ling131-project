On a buying the house later in life in retirement and I'm Wondering what would be a good idea on how to invest that extra money I have to put my house in Middle East now you know that's a\nGood question how old are you a fifty four fifty four and you're single\nOkay and how many years do you think before you buy a house\n[noise] um I'm thinking at least sixteen okay\nAll right cool well as long as you've got more than five years I Would use a simple growth stock mutual fund or a series of them\nFor something like that I probably would just shoes and ask them be indexed bond because it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out I as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in\nAnd so I start to a person is in the five hundred and fund an index fund\nAnd use that to grow for the next five ten years or so until you buy a house as long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nAnd that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar things\nExtra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment and um even if I don't have five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and uh 'cause I can afford to go down if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robby is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve once up\nA thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick craft and uh so I Am a nurse or by perfect for me to go to a call now I'm thirty two years old and my wife is\nUh twenty nine we make a combined

cash flow than on the out of pocket and can you live on her income or you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school [noise] um but I don't think I can cash anything right now because I I and I also don't have a house or at the moment so I was\nYou know planning on buying a house or or putting at least they're putting a down payment for a house next year before I start school so\nThat then you need to wait until you can pay for school or whatever but you never in Thirty years or during the show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school okay you got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter when you do it and what you put first what you\nPut second you might plenty of money to come up with ...\nYeah plenty of money and you

to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you\nBetter than I deserve how can I Hope\nI Am calling because my husband and I are coming out of bankruptcy about about a year and a half ago only ... pm and add them kind of creating I got snowball and going through everything\nOne of our student loans and now I'm currently ed on our credit report and so we have no contact information\nI have no idea how to get a hold of these people um my husband came around and so we're kind of in Charlotte to ... just leave it alone I'm afraid I'm a case knocking on our doors\nDown you're going to they're going to come after you start on student loans are not bankrupt the ball and they're going to come find you it's just sitting there piling up we need to find it but you don't have a single piece of information on this long\nSo my I think that they are going to um I'm I'm much more organized when it comes to our financial um hell I guess that on my phone and resold and on train track because it was a private can chase 'em so\nSo you know was it like you have the trace account number [noise] probably somewhere I'm generally I that's I guess that's the first place you would start ... with that account number and say\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nComing up at the bottom of the hour Ramsey personalities rented personality Anthony Neal will join us I don't think he's got to ... probably one personality and he's going to join us at the bottom of the hour he\nIs a teenage experts many speaks with teens all over America just did a wonderful talking smart conference on what your teenagers want you to know whether there's something to think about\nNow he's the author of the graduate survival God five mistakes you cannot afford to making college if you are a teen or you're a college student or you're a parent of one of the above and you've got questions about anything Anthony will be here the phone numbers triple eight\nEight to five five foot two to five were opening up a couple of lines for that right now\nHeather is in the lobby of Ramsey solutions from Spokane, Washington where the question\nI other Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up and I just finished baby step three and now I'm working on baby steps three ... saving for a house got your emergency fund good for ... yeah and I wanted to know how long is too long in baby step three being the flashing move on to maybe step for\nWas not a magic answer the concept or the or the critical thinking skills for the answer is simply this\nIf you stay there so long that you don't save for retirement you screwed up your retirement Mm right yeah or if you don't stay there long enough then you don't have a good solid down payment and you'll end up with other problems on the mortgage so it's the it's the pull between those two things\nAnd most people that means you know three years four years something like that uh but if you're if you're fifty nine that might not be that long or you're not fifty nine now how old are you\nAnd twenty eight on friday\nCool and so I mean if you stayed out for four years and never started any retirement until thirty two\nBut you had a really juicy down payment on a house and got a ... at you know how to plan to pay it off in a few years because of that you're not you're you're still going to retire multi millionaire you know if you do that it it but if you're stayed out for Twenty years ... been called that baby steps for obesity problem\nTalking on a Fifteen year mortgage by forty five the mortgage is paid for us not sooner and uh you will have saved thirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't work\nIs going to make you a millionaire multimillionaire usually I'm doing this so you're in a safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than they Ramsey says never go more than three years that's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other\nOr because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go that's all it is hey thanks for stopping by thanks states open phones at triple eight eight to five five to to find Julian is in New York City Hi Julian how real\nHigh Mitt to rent it can you hear me okay\nI can how can I help\nThank you very much for taking my call so I'm In a a bit of a unique position I'm I'm twenty four next year I'm going to medical school and uh I was I'm very very lucky and very appreciative uh I'm not going to have any debt to after graduating medical school and residency residency included\nI if I decide to specialize um and uh\nDid you get a ... or what\nUm uh yeah I'm not entirely certain is that what I Want to do yet I Know I'm asking how you did that\nOh oh um yeah so so if they get from my\nFather and my grandparents um wow I Am very very very appreciative yeah\nGood now yeah you should be that's amazing wonderful so how can I Do\nUm [noise] yes away when I was Twenty one uh I was given a essentially control is funny 'cause it's under my name I'm but I'm Sorry I Apologize I'm Joe I'm\nA yeah I was I was given control this money and uh I've been given a very good financial advice my father who's helping me manage it but\nUm because it's under my name and he he's essentially asking the rain stopped me or I Would like that a second opinion as to what to do with this money I can give it a little bit of a money for a living expenses um and I've said that about five thousand dollars from\nSome small side jobs at hospitals but I Want to know how to capitalize on this and I had set myself up as best as I can for after medical school\nWell the the thing I Would be most concerned about is that the money is available and enough to get you through medical school\nUm it it definitely is um about one third of it is invested very securely and two thirds of it I have in savings I'm into two thirds we were discussing putting into at AT T bill on a three month renewal basis until I needed to take them out to pay my tuition and and I would just reinvest the rest\nUm well I probably would not do that and the only reason is is that the bills basically or bonds and a bond interest rates are yields go the bond values\nRather go down as interest rates go up and we are in an increasing and the interest rate environment so if you put a hundred thousand dollars in T. bills that could turn into Ninety pretty quick\nAs interest rates increase so that's not a very safe investment in the environment that we're in right now um but if you wanted to have some portion of the money invested I probably would go to something like gross income type funds but I'm okay if there's enough there to do simple division and it doesn't have to really earn anything\nIf you want to keep it all very very safe because that would be okay with me because the most important thing is for you to be able to graduate with zero debt and if you screw around with his money in some way and it loses value and you're not able to do that\nThen the whole you know is like a ... we were concentrating on the wrong thing And Julian is the right thing to concentrate on Julian ... debt free graduation\nWe're concentrating on the wrong thing to know Julian is the right thing to concentrate on Julian ... debt free graduation is the most important part of this math equation not what this money is paying\nA it'd be nice to be a little bit sophisticated about it but if you get caught up in some kind of a sophisticated process and you end up losing money trying to\nTrying to just get a little bit more on this lump sum or you you defeated you're on purpose to shrug herself in the foot so to speak so [laughter] that's the process you're looking at I'm going to keep it pretty safe or if you want to go toward something that's fun but I wouldn't use bonds\nFor anything right now a possible play Kimberly is in Pensacola Hi Kimberley how real\nThing even though I'm great thank you so much for taking my call sure\nI I just wanted to thank you for all you do um this December Wal Mart has it been seven years since the husband and I have paid off our debt I'm following your plans to go for that\nUm but my question today is um my sister in our little concerned about our parents are hoping you could give us some advice on how they could got them\nUm my parents live in North Carolina and they live in a flooded area of heart problem area and I'm so every time there hurricane come through um they they experienced some flooding it on their on their property at their home as well as my dad's business\nAnd we were to monitor and what can the end as far as the shit they sell it um they have not that they do have um some savings and my mom has a ticket for one\nToo often does this property blood\nFor well and not on a um it flooded and it was it got like forty answers and the house and I think about ten feet in his shop\nAnd then two years ago um it got and my dad shop I think about three feet or so and it almost felt like about six inches from getting in the house again and I'm so ... there's only been two major flood but um but they're in their sixties and it\nIt's very emotional for them at any town a farm and it's just\nA throughout this past down we actually packed the or I didn't my sister was able to help them I was out of state but they packed up all their belongings and let them put them away and you know because they were afraid that\nThey're so whatever else who is living there has become more painful than not living there but those are the fear of rising water here is not founded we once in Twenty years is not that bad but bottom line is is is developed a phobia for them\nAnd they're not have my own living their service on living there why wouldn't move\nI don't know I mean the actual threat of blood to disagree with what you've given me I wouldn't be concerned about what they're absolutely panicking in return the weather ... draining\nOn the lizard\nSo you know it's more of an emotional decision rolled out on the lizard movie\n\nHeard me talk about I detail for years and now it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go\nAnd how it's only a matter of time before you become\nA victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity theft last year yes sixteen million twenty six\nAnd um I Know this is a ... a world class one half of one percent athlete\nUm but they are twenty two guests there and the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills are developed they are the size of a key uh yeah [laughter] but it doesn't mean that their life skills have developed at the same level and you know so\nIt it's it's kinda weird I told somebody during one of these ... like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um because he still is football skills are are the best on the planet yeah\nI'm In his physical acumen his physical a cue the things you can do with this body in mid air or it's just circus like it's amazing what those guys can do it but what happens is when you watch that skill level especially if you're just watching on TV you think of that guy as\nYou know a forty year old who she is a mature developed a ... as you know strong ...\nYou think of that guy as you know a forty year old who's a mature developed\nA ... as you know strong marriage has all these other things and these guys are college kids are now is they were in college last week yeah you know there's twenty minutes ago and even a player that's been in the league three years yeah they're still young and they're still I'm twenty five years old ...\nAnd so it's uh it's interesting in the same thing happens with music people when they get a success level earlier they thing where you're spotlight then you get a success level\nAnd your skill is world class in that thing does not mean you have everything else together yeah yeah and that's true with the you know teenagers in general is one of the things we do this entrepreneur tool box is they can start to develop some of those skills you know running a business\nYeah yeah they and that's absolutely right you know you say this all the time when an American nosy nosy for saying this but the NFL stands for not for a long and these football players young football players know that like hey I Need to develop something now because in probably in three years I Would not be in his late ... um and the most\nMoney these kids will make will be within their first three to five years of the league if they make it past and\nAnd so I I I told them like have you have to get focus but when we look at these twenty two year oh this is why I'm so passionate about that Fifteen you wrote about that Thirteen year old getting you know the peanuts from North to about ... getting the graduate survival guide a book and also taken our financial foundations curriculum is out of a classroom\nBecause all of that teaches what the older professionals do not know mhm if they can get it at Thirteen like these middle school kids day four out here now taking our middle school curriculum you know they are um a head of the game like they were teaching me some stuff earlier today I'm like wow like what in the world\nAnd so just to see these young kids are getting it taking our curriculum learning learning how to budget learning how what is the difference between the credit card in a debit card and these kids like me and I'm not financing anything like that just it gets me excited\nYeah his dolled in in a life skill yes life skills stuff and you need life skills whether you're Seventeen or fifty seven yeah you know and this this money thing\nYou know the basic stuff of being out of there being on a budget having your emergency fund the stuff we talk about her every day on the air it it really does work for teenagers and the interesting thing is they're not um\nYou know that they're not like rusted into place for ... you know they're they're pretty they're pretty\nUh uh elastic and their spirits in that they can receive this stuff sometimes more than some of us are a little older and we get a little stiffer yes on our spirit and we don't receive is quite as well they're like okay let's go let's do that right\nRight and they're not like old docked in and go now to argue with you about it or ... ... ... it's a it's easier to get through most of the time you know big argument like they have to have a credit card you have to have strong loan you don't\nHave to have a car payment they don't hear all that from the fourteen year old when you're able to sit and talk to them they're just ready to go what is it we need to do to win\nYes sir and Dave you and I was talking about isn't smart conference me when Hogan I was reading an article they're saying that this younger generation teens and millennials are not entrepreneur and I'm like man that's that's a bunch of baloney they're more entrepreneurial in any generation to generation that's stupid [laughter]\nAnd so I get excited because I'm seeing this younger generation they're making stupid mistakes because no one never taught them once they learn\nThey tend to not make that same mistake in the areas of finances but they have to be taught at first\nSo that's what I Love about what we're doing is we're giving them life skills to business skills through the teen entrepreneur to a buck kid we're helping them understand how to deal with their finances and how to make the right decisions earlier on with our middle school curriculum with the graduate survival guide\nAnd when I see these young people come up to me saying that\nBut for teaching me earlier on because we make learning about money Dave and our organization where young people coolest hey that's right you know and so it's by\nAnthony O'Neill joins us this half hour if you are a chain or the parent of a chain

'cause I I Do want to go to ...\nWell I mean the way we decide if we're going to do with conferences do we make more than it costs us\n\nIf we're going to if you launch of the wedding wedding ... the wedding a conference if you're going to do that if we're going to go to a ... radio conference are we going to make more than it cost us to have a boost their if we're going to go to a whatever book expo or something to show one of our books are we going to sell more than it costs us as a result of our having been there\nAnd um I have two friends one of them and I'm\nAsking me to go for a business\nOr like a friend um subway business so I was thinking about taking a loan for that and my other friend is I'm all for me like to go buy a house with him to just share like a two family house so I take one apartment he thinks other\nThan it's going to be with a mortgage slowing chose so I wanted to know what should I Do\n... okay well\nWe tell folks don't have to borrow money around here if you listen to the show very much the shortest path to wells and peace and your finances is to avoid that and on top of that I Would tell you to avoid partnerships is the only ship that won't sale\nSo um what that means is is that if you still want to remain friends with both these guys I Would suggest to say no\nBecause at the end of these stories are nightmare\nGoing in partners was somebody in debt to go into the restaurant business would you know squat about is a good way to end up bankrupt and lose your friendship forever going in partners with somebody to buy a house\nAnd then he doesn't pay is half or can't pay his half or you don't pay your for camp by your half is a precursor to the ending of our friendship and a foreclosure\nShown no I wouldn't do either one of those and that's my reasoning I think you'll have a lot better life if you avoid both of those paths and\nYou can you can develop a career path that does not involve you're going into debt to start a business it's a matter of fact most businesses start without that\nThey just start small\nWe started this one without the card table my living room we didn't have a big fancy studio we went down to the local radio station drove over there and they let us use their stuff because we work for free there\nWell you figure out a way to get going and you what we call bootstrap it and it works\nBut you don't have to go get an SBA loan and go deeply in debt to buy a subway franchise in order to be in business that some mythology Thomas is with us in Philadelphia Hi Thomas how're you\nDave thank you very much for taking my call\nSure what's up\nI'm I just graduated with a degree in actuarial science back in may wow and I'm working at McDonald's making nine dollars an hour why I I've been applying and applying and I just I Can't find a job and I don't know what to do\n... well I I Would assume that the primary job before that would be an insurance companies correct\nYeah I I've [noise] through me and my last year of school I got very turned off the actuarial science so I've been applying to finance jobs and I can't get anything because every one kid everyone wants to have experience and\nI don't have the experience and I I graduated early so I did I did summer classes and they can't get internships summer classes\nSo kind of any kind of went into a job where you tried into\nFinancial analyst financial I'm like I've I've been even doing accounting\nLike accounts label and ... receivables entry\nLevel stuff mhm oh you do is get your foot in the door\nI'm OK well here's here's one thing I Will tell you and Ken Coleman will tell you this is will go to the Ken Coleman show dot com and download his free PDF on how to put together a resume but resumes in applications without relationship are useless\nUm I'll give you an example uh we have\nWork on our team we hired a hundred and fifty to two hundred last year we had Fifteen thousand the applications for those moderate hires\nYou get lost in that room and it's not that I don't wanna answer and talk to every one of those Fifteen thousand people it's just a logistical not reasonable\nAnd so what ends up happening is you get lost in the stack of that stuff unless you know someone that works there and you don't have to be best friends with them you just 'cause I got to tell you we don't ever hire somebody because somebody called me and says are ever but we would give them an interview\nAnd pull their pulled her resume out of the stack\nYou got to get out of the pile you know and so some of these places are trying to get on with you need to figure out if your sister that's married\nA kid plays soccer where the guy that works over there or something like that where you can find someone that will put in a little bit of a word for you to at least get the door open\nAnd that'll get you in the door again you're you're not going to get hired because of that kind of a reference matter of fact there are very few references where you just calls up somebody and I get your hired\nAn almost never happens that'll decent job anyway I mean if\nHiring just bodies you eat at all or something like that but at a good job they're really going to want to interview you and learn about trees and that will be true here so we don't guarantee anybody a tires but we will at least talk to them and\nYou know what might be a very short conversation no you don't qualify than setting or look at all but at least we'll all go and get their resume out of the file [noise] if somebody knows I'm Sorry go download that and listen we can tell them to show he'll help you and all this stuff is very very difficult out there I think you can leave some\n\n[noise]\n\n\nWhy in the world would you trust some random guy in a Q ... when getting your mortgage you really think he cares about your longer money goes bowling doesn't\nThose companies care about getting you and do whatever home loan program they're pushing that week\nWhen it comes to ordering a cheeseburger the meal deal works fine well let's get real people were talking about the largest investment you'll probably ever make so don't be naive and trust in order taker who pressures you into a pre packaged blown\nWhat I tried to get doctors to do most dogs come out and go\nFinally worked all this time I've gone to school my whole life mhm I deserve a new house a new car I deserve a trip and they spend money like water you've seen him do it oh yeah definitely and I it's crazy and this did all you did was ... years kept living like a broke college student\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years out because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important stuff that I thought\nYeah 'cause now I I mean you make three hundred four hundred and five hundred wherever you make it it's you're going to be unbelievably well for him so you said your whole thirty thirty one thirty one wow\nWas this fabulous income congratulations I guess I'm so proud of you who was your biggest cheerleader I Know you have

talked a lot about you and we're encouraging me to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans\nYeah yeah so I mean you went from being completely crushed by student loan debt to completely own in it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the day I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't really have\nAnother planet so I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty

minutes for sixteen years uh about her Nineteen year to me I was one of the labor I'm doing every day for about the last six years I've been able to replace myself in a laborer I make a decent living now\nBut I'm just content I'm kinda happy with where I'm at a question it is that I mean\nI don't know I mean it it it is it bad to put that if it if I'm if I'm content and\nBut there's definitely room to grow so my question I guess was ... I I'm not sure which direction to head because I'm at a spot where I'm fairly happy\nWiring so tell me why you're happy defined it briefly\nWell I think possibly and I asked myself there's a lot maybe my dreams are picking up off the blade but I'm I'm happy because I Know my business close to home I don't travel a lot anymore and um I've got time and I get the money they're too\nWell congratulations well it's almost like you're feeling a little guilty for being content you know days purchase contentment Rachel cruise almost wrote an entire book on content that content that does not\nPlace I think you're happy you're thankful you're you're grateful you've been able to work hard and get into a new space I think what you're feeling is the itch to continue to challenge yourself and by the way that is also a good feeling you can be content meaning I'm grateful for what I have\nBut I'm not happy with who I Am so I'm very content I\nI'm honestly living the dream this is the greatest time of my professional life I'm having a blast however\nI'm not happy with who I Am as a husband I'm not happy with who I Am as a father meaning I can be better so I can be convenient and grateful but also want to continue to improve you got a great business I don't mind that you know\nI think you become a successful yeah ... and ... as well done um the thing I did when I kinda hit the same place you are was I started the first stage of business and you passed it substantially is to take care of your family and to survive\nOn the end for the business to survive and they don't you get her has once you get past the desperation\nOf that stuff and uh then the thing starts to you control some of the variables and you brought in somebody to do some of the work you didn't want to do\nAnd you brought it closer to home and you're making good money and show that that's the next step and that's what I Do as an example uh when I hit that stage people started saying well you'll never be successful radio if you stay in Nashville all the big radio shows are in New York or LA\nAnd I'm like well I'm not going to be big radio show then 'cause I'm not going to live in New York or LA I don't mind visiting people but I'm not living there\nI like Nashville and uh well you got to have an army I have a seven minute commute and I live in a huge freaking house I'm not leaving you know so that you know that's where you get to so then I started to go how can I expand this\nWithout how can I expanded and scale it without destroying the parts that are finally achieved and so can you hire some people can you expand your product lines can you make it digital or I mean what can you do to grow the business\nBut do it from a position of content ... now that you've got the variables controlling and that's that's the way to go at it\nSo I I think you're doing great man\nIt's going to answer Ken very good answer\nKomen Ramsey personality joins us this half hour your
