hundred dollars per thousand for that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that

dollar amounts with every one or just share with each individual what will affect them\nUm\nAnnually would be you're meeting and I only share with people who are emotionally mature enough to handle the numbers I don't tell a four year old that you're worth ten million dollars because they will go to kindergarten and tell it\nOkay and they're not emotionally capable of handling that information our children in our case did not know our wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did unveil it and they were in their early twenties it was shocking to them because they were raised\nLike regular people but\nI had a lot of wealth in the background\nAnd um so I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't need to make assumptions about\nBut then as we presented it to them it was presented as a responsibility\nNot I will do we hit the lottery possess for me in my house we sort of more\nMeaning that you don't know anything you're just managing for God\nAnd that takes a little of the ... who all of it\nSo they need to be emotionally mature and share it with him and we do it about once a year [noise] this is the day Ramsey show\nTime to take

just was always interested in finances but really never knew\nUm where to start or where to begin and we picked up on your program and within a few weeks I purchased a total moneymaker ever read the book I talk Courtney I said we got to get on this I said we're doing it all wrong and we started it out\nAnd uh she just kind of followed my lead on it oh I Would just like that yeah it was it was I mean she's a follower and she\nWas really good I have some leadership\nShe is in our\nWord she didn't read the book really at all um and then eventually after I don't know about a year into the program she was starting to get mad at me because of the program and everything I said we just need to\nUm instead of yelling at me we need to go see financial peace and then you can hear it from the source right from day one and then you can email it takes me on my back exactly the\nYellow yell at the video guy you know very cool okay so you got in there then and you saw\nAnd uh it was it it was hard\nI mean two years and four months running and yeah and that's something that is a long long time but it's a hundred and forty three thousand dollars and you killed at all if you ask how old are you too I'm well we're about twenty eight and you're not even Thirty years old so some of these rockstar also millennials I talk about all the time [laughter]\nVery good good for you guys thinking well time very cool\nHow does it feel now that you've climbed the mountain\nIs so great it's incredible [laughter]\nI think it's one of the bad feelings it's nice to know that we can move on to the baby steps now and we just want to living if like no one else when they were excited for him to keep travelling through the baby steps\nYeah woman you're making a hundred fifty thousand bucks a year and not even Thirty years old and I made payments in the world in life is pretty good [laughter] [laughter] yeah that's awesome so who are your biggest cheerleaders\nI think it was kind of each other and the very beginning we we didn't talk about it a whole lot um and we kind of had some friends and families that were saying like what what are you doing and I think after we got rolling through the process and we were getting some traction pan of quite a bit of money ... are quite a bit of debt\nPeople started to come around now when you look at somebody go already paid off a hundred thousand dollars a comes shuts 'em up you know an absolutely yeah yeah it's like you don't have to shut up it just says it\nSounds good yeah that's great very cool you guys very very well done what is the key to getting out of that\nFor us I think it was giving it together first of all the also being\nWilling to work very hard I work three jobs and worked every time but um and also never really strengthen the path I feel like once we decided to jump into the plan\nWe did not stray from that and honestly whenever I Would buy something like if I spent too much on groceries I Would feel bad because that was money that would be knocking out my lens ... no\n... no I gave you gave your boundaries on process yeah what about you oh I think the the the\nI\n... it was it was it was good I mean we we we weren't where it was a key for him for you a main thing that got you out of debt do you think the work\nExtra ... or yeah the um the raise your income over fifty thousand dollars\nCourtney finished a residency program that is huge for her um she got a big raising them you know I Would I Would say call 'em and and be dispatched to utility company and just uh the extra income any chance you could get extra overtime home do it you know it it really helps the snowball just\nPlow through and go to the finish line\nYou know there's something about that because you're getting traction if you were working like that and you didn't know what if you're doing any good at it you you just be exhausted but it's weird how it's exhilarating 'cause you know you're winning ... you know you work your butt off when you're winning absolutely and it changes everything and now you can crank back down to a normal people hours now and not have to be so crazy but\nIf you want to go for something you know how

income or capital gains\nAlso aren't capital gains tax much lower than earned income uh that is not considered earn income it is considered investment income\nAnd it depends on what the money is invested in as to whether there'll be capital tax capital gains rate or tax on an ordinary income right\nIf the investment is paying off on something that is less than a year old it will be at ordinary income if it's coming out of a traditional i._r._a. where it's never yet been taxed\nIt'll be on an ordinary income if it's coming out of a four O. one K. traditional not Ross it will be taxed at ordinary income as it comes out\nUm all of the money will be a hundred percent not just the returns because none of it the growth has never been taxed nor the money you put in has never been to act\nOn a traditional so you'll pay ordinary income on those\nIf you have investments simply invested in the piece of real estate you don't pay any taxes until your salad and then you pay taxes on capital gains portion you own investments like a mutual fund\nOr a low turnover mutual fund you'll have no taxes on that are virtually no taxes on that until you sell it and then you would have

is I've just immigrated to the United states and I've lived a frugal life I'm like save my money than capital the fed them but since I've arrived in the United states um I've had a ... some of my ... was telling me\nI'm that you'll frugal living will make your social low cost you if you do not buy inexpensive laws and expensive cars and all of a status symbol of them are you will be treated as a social locked Austin I'm came to understand what would be your take on that\nI Love it or did your emigrated from\nA United Kingdom United Kingdom okay and where did you grow up um I was born in India I immigrated to the u._k. when I was Seventeen okay and you're how old a twenty nine okay and how long did you live in a ... eleven years were you a social outcasts there [noise] um no [laughter]\nWell uh where did you live in the u._k. a city called ... off right pretty good size city it is it's it's a nice of you know we're legitimacy and you weren't a social outcasts there for being frugal no but um I was like oh what do you live in the United states um I live in San Diego\nThere to [laughter]\nYou might be a social outcasts there now are getting okay there are people and certainly in San Diego that have common sense as\nWell so um I don't know what crowd you're running with was there but um it's different than the one you ran with an India or the one you ran with an ... for sure uh because they have been been bitten by the bug of consumerism but plenty of Americans um\nIn any city um will or not consider your social out cash for having good common sense values now or that's assuming you're you know you if your clothes are not necessarily expensive or at least clean mhm\nTrying to take your freedom from you with ah forcing you to conform to something using a social pressure but not all okay and so I Would treat it exactly the same way as hard as you have fought\nThrough you know twenty nine years of your life to get to be standing here um I wouldn't surrender my freedom set of crap to stuff\nAre all in the name of someone being impressed generally speaking a here's a good rule of thumb people who are impressed by\nThings that you have or aware or not impressive people\nWhen you get inside of their hearts and inside of their minds they're what we would call shallow and so um the very people you might attract by having some bling by having some jewelry or some watches or the proper\nClothing are the people that you really don't want influencing your future and your character in your life you've paid a huge price to get to be here and enjoy the freedom and so you're a man of character\nAnd um the uh ... and the show the people that are telling you that are probably not people I Would want\n'em to be influencing me I might want to influence them and try to help them but if I were in your your your shoes I Would say that doesn't need to be your inner circle that are teaching you how to live mentor and you decide billing you and so forth um and so\nYou know check out a folks that have a little more depth of character and aren't judging you based on what you drive now again it needs to be if you drive an old car um that's a while you're trying to achieve a financial go or something what needs to be clean\nAnd maintained you don't take good care of it but um it doesn't it doesn't need to be dirty and doesn't need to be missing the same thing with your clothing or your hair or whatever else you take care of the things that you have and and manage them but most wealthy people or do not by\nA expensive things to impress other people\nAre a few do but most don't that's how they became more if they know they do by some expensive things that I buy some expensive things but there for me\nAnd for my family and for my wife and that kind of thing and they're not for what someone thinks I'm I'm I've got a really nice home but I don't buy it for somebody else are we live there you know and what you think about are good or bad doesn't really matter to me\nAnd so I I don't know is that helpful is that helpful part of the matter is that what you were looking answer I think I needed to hear that that'll come what
