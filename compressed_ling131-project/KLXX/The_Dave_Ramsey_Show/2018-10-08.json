[noise]\nJudgment on my credit now a collection called out while I Do um I like I said he hadn't been fired from a fulltime job all I can get right now\nIs a part time job that barely cover the

this it sounds like you've been through hill I'm so when did you leave your fulltime job\n[noise] um it's been a couple of years now and ...\nYeah I haven't been able to find anything else comparable to what I did um since then\nI Will you let me tell you you're emotionally not pass that because you're the way you're describing it it sounded like it happened yesterday\nYeah I mean it used to living in the abuse aren't you I mean like in your head [noise]\nYeah I mean my kitchen I we we were homeless for a while we we've just been through a lot and I read he tried to\nGet custody of them I had to go to court trying to deal with everything and it's been a lot\nI hear ya so basically none of these bills the foreclosure or all the bills that he opened up and your name have been paid for years [noise]\nYeah correct you haven't paid anything on them for years so there's really nothing on fire today that says you got to fall by friday right [noise]\nMajority of the humor was the lead your Kimberly is with us in Alexandria, Virginia\nKimberly welcome to the day Ramsey show\nGay thank you so much for taking my call Charlotte was a lot that blew my\nMind my question is is my dad is Seventy five years old still works He works in a steel plant makes not for fifty to six fifty a week um about a couple\nOf years ago he got sick I found out that he hadn't paid\nHe's behind on a lot of itself had a somehow got in a fifty\nThousand dollar loan from the bank and uh he doesn't have them attention he gets about Fifteen hundred\nAnd some security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do at this stage for him um I didn't provide him so I took over other bills and I do provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that for him to buy food\nAnd what are you doing with the rest of the gas [laughter] [noise] I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money [noise]\nI'm paying on and on than on his cell he still has about um Fifteen\nK left from the equity loan ... ten thousand on a credit card mhm eight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd how much are you able to put on the edge [noise]\nI'm putting everything was a turning out the auto [noise] everything on on that much money does that amount to [noise] what is it [noise]\nA month [noise]\nI think it amounts to about [noise] four thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get the right\nTo aid on a car eight on a house and chew on a credit card\nOkay and do you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done and the year [noise]\nOkay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a dead earlier right rankles to get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and he's still working a steel plant that I understand that right yes that was going to come a moment and it'll come suddenly the he just can't do that [noise]\nAnd I'm afraid of you know my prayer is at least that he gets through this year [noise] mhm and that way your debt free and if he's a hundred percent but free Alison\nFree house and everything you can probably make it on his Social Security if he had to write okay not yeah not ideal not what we want but we can probably get there\nAnd uh then the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get debt free then let's build an emergency fond of three to six months of expenses but we get past that and then let's start building some nest egg for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement it's clear that dead and to have that emergency fund and blood\nAnd is still the baby steps in other words [noise]\nOkay my parents get asking is why a bank and now I'm someone at Harris H. B. K. and uh you know four and a and it could be paid off in twenty forty three and knowing that\nHe went to live that long\nWhen two reasons one is they're stupid\nAnd the second reason is is they're counting on the house I've got a lien against the house right now that's yeah\nAnd so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is you know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry\nI mean that they'll they'll loan anybody this were either not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nAnd ... and so the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and then there's like no they would've offered a dog that credit card\nSo I mean dead people get credit card offers so it you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off or it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how are you\nOn the umpires have I got to require retirement okay\nI'm fifty two here about a year ... and I'm a ... century I don't have a four week Kay off a pretty good ... I could hear the ethics to would be better to file for Social Security and weight while before it does it take before we pay for\nThe whole entire movie or\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it to say now is if you wait from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know and what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes in you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking after four O. one K. or some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier\nUh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation\nOh that would definitely has\n[laughter] yeah\nThat equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation\nOh definitely yeah so you got you got to kind of gas and you got to say you know average depth age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six\nAveraged ... deaf age of a female in the U.S is Seventy eight but once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old got real shot at Ninety according to the stat tables right now\nAnd so um that that's what you've gotta walk through and think through in the process so good question man thank you for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Todd is in New Hampshire I taught how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nWell um I Wish I spoke to the lady she said I can ask your question and I just got the starter pack off of your website for myself for my for my daughter who's thirty one I'm fifty two and\nUm I've been a dream or I guess for a free spirit as you would say from listening to your show addict now for the last two weeks [laughter]\nI Know who you were before that it's All right but um my wife and I sat down and we've never been able to agree on money um she's the shaver um the spender and just I don't you know I don't know what the money situation is where I go and spend it [laughter]\nAnd I'm five we've set aside step one we've got a thousand now we've put aside to the shaving she wants to say more than that but [noise]\nShe I'm she's always ran the show and I've been kind of just kind of go along with her at this point um we paid off to credit cards and we paid off another credit card my question is is\nBy doing so many things right now I'm In the one thing I'm concerned me it's about down the road is my retirement and I've worked for a company for Fifteen Years and I've got\nAbout ... eldest daughter pack was the total money make over a book in there\nYes it is I started to read that I haven't read it\nJust totally make over has every detail about the seven baby steps as the seven baby steps on steroids\nAnd so it's going to walk you through first thing you do you say the thousand dollars you know are written plan you and your wife are in agreement and we're gonna we're in agreement that we're going to work this plan together okay and once you do that then you're first goal was to squeeze out of your budget as you say that that was in dollars if you've already got money saved\nThan we would save only a thousand dollars of it stop all investing\nTemporarily temporarily temporarily and then you move on to baby step two which is your debt snowball and that's where you pay off everything except your home by lifting your debts smaller slug\nWas caused by getting rid of those debt payments and now you've got the ability to invest\nAnd make sure you and your wife or a woman does\nFace it this is a hectic time of year but here's the deal it's not an excuse to lose track of your spending especially when we made it so incredibly easy for you with our sorry budgeting tool called every\nDollar with every dollar you give every dollar a name at the beginning of the month and then you track the expenses against your budget throughout the month it's really that easy\nAnd I'm just let them know

going to save money I'm going to make savings a priority I'm gonna make investing a priority this is what people do to build wealth\n[noise] and so yes I Would [noise] famous evangelist\nMartin Luther said I'm no it wasn't it was John Wesley on Martin Luther what am I thinking was famous manual is they got that part right Wesley said if you'll give ten percent and saved ten percent and live on eighty percent you'll always be okay and you know there's not a bad formula\nBut that's also putting God first few seconds and then living on eighty\nAnd figure figure out there to live on your income after you're giving in you're investing\nAnd you'll always that money that part is accurate and then we you know we have we involved that a little bit of the baby steps works when your own baby step one you don't do anything do you save a thousand dollars and baby step to you're not saving any money and baby step too including stopping all your investments temporarily\nBecause you're completely doing your debt snowball you're focusing on the debt why so we can save more later so that's the technical parts of the answer but in general you've got to put your giving and you're saving at the top of it\nLife priorities because you're gonna have a better life if you always give and save [noise]\n... new or whatever you're going to be something along those\nThis is the Ramsey [noise]\n\nCourse

[laughter] you have to go back in thousand years really to understand how this culture got started back when you add these people that we're living off the land what they did is they use fire and the last\nI hear these old growth forest or a lot of them old growth forest\nSo we have like lonely time and the east and ponderosa pond and to call you on red woods and the west that Indian and tend to these forests than they open them up and they built the cathedral like forced\nBy using frequent light fires because ... and wants to walk to hunt through briar patches and get all scraped up and get eaten up by ticks and red bugs and\nEverything else and so they opened up the land of the new country will forests and that's what they did was about opening up the canopy and letting just enough sunlight the get down to grow the grasses and we'll get back at the wildlife 'cause most wildlife doesn't meet trees they eat the grasses and we give them they don't eat brush and so the\nTrees need the space to certain distance apart the optimal for a good life our ecosystem so the navy people's all over the world\nBuilt up blood with seeded the U.S when they die from the season conflict and when the Europeans invaded in the United states and also elsewhere around the world you lost your navy fire managers who were using frequent far as the livelihood they would burn ... patch\nYou burn it and after two years that fruits out unique fibers for several years but then you have to burn it again or otherwise a brush will come up above the shade out your briar patch or you have to ... past a certain way you have to burn\nFor blueberries a certain way you have to burn for different kinds of wildlife and beer and Quayle and Turkey's whatever a certain way so\nThey went through the woods burning with different kinds of fires back farther relate lie hit bars where they wanted a really clean out an area or whatever so they were ... they were using a very ... of what we call ... culture today as they were economically develop their substance from the land\nAnd they had this deep relationship intimate relationship of land because they were part of nature and they were dependent upon nature and so they represent nature and that had just closed intimate bond\nBut what happened then thousand years ago when\nLady people started the population starting to build up from technologies of you know bows and arrows and stuff whenever you have more people\nHe had to deal with a farming which you know people know farming is that there's a lot more work so you're not going to the farming unless you've got a hot population that you've got to the inside of they got him in the farming as soon as you Europeans have gotten in the farming and using slash and burn agriculture\nThey started the light wasted the for us and as I moved in the cities and villages they mind the force which seemed limited use them for trees for building houses whatever for firewood for all these other different things and so they devastated most of the fourth year up\nDuring the last few thousand years so there's very few residual amounts of old growth forest in Europe so\nThe cultural memory of the Europeans colonized hers is so far back up being part of nature whereas a lot of the native peoples that were conquered\nHave a cultural memory we're living close nature and living in nature is not that far away so what happens is people have got divorced or Europeans got divorced from nature they separated from nature they've decided that they were to conquer nature\nAnd so what happens with this separation from nature ultimately result in what we have the day because what happens is that they wiped out by force in Europe they came over here and they start logging Jamestown and they started allowing new trees for ships first take back the\nAnd the trees in Europe anymore and so you started logging in the early part of the Eighteen hundreds I just started widespread clear cutting down the whole eastern part of the United states and they're not all moved out west later in the Eighteen hundreds during the ... revolution\nAnd people got even more divorce from the reality of nature and being part of nature and whatever this process what happened was was this cutting all these big old growth forests of the Navy's people had been tending\nAnd laying waste all these for all this debris from that you know the tree trunk is part of it but what really burns is to find jobs and the leaves and all that kind of stuff and so\nWhat happens is is he started getting some catastrophic fires in these cut over areas as well as there was no native peoples there to really manage to continue to burn it and you are you like in the southeast whereas in nature would burn maybe every four or five years\nYou know in the southeast but they were permanent looks more frequently and whatever and so the for sure that came over in Europe got caught up in these wildfires and a lot of part of the Eighteen hundreds in the early part of the century\nAnd they had to fight the fires and instead of really blaming themselves and blame people for what had happened they blame nature and they blame far then they started this arch Persian policy in the early part of the Nineteen hundreds that continues is that you protect play out in the western United States where\nIt's been so ingrained us and it's\nQuite different they've had fires in Florida back in the twenties and thirties and forties that was that it was in California but the culture between my father and his associates in some of the forest service people that actually rebelled and covertly started prescribed burning after some of these massive wildfires in Florida\nThe culture never got stabbed at first blush culture never got established but that was that did and so it's just constant thing now the forest service is paying\nOver half of its budget on the president fires instead of wildfire mitigation and write a lot full reconstruction projects right whatever they're caught in this try out more and more feel better and better fire fighting with more and more fuel and\nYou know people like myself are trying to show that with the like the ... is the the million acre plan for the western United States is the way out how'd you how'd you get out that this catch twenty two how you get out of this\nCultural trap that you got yourself into\nRight well that was a yeah I have to say that was a brilliant dissertation you really I'm a condensed that down and and um\nI did a great job

have people worried about kicks in and and they're saying is at an outline diseases near epidemic proportions but you know the medical establishment doesn't really want to talk about it\nOr is that then tied into this this whole fires erosion cultured that Lyme disease epidemic\nHere in the southeast United States where I live in an odd things can burning for clients as well as for myself\nAnd I

from\nMy waitress uh-huh so I'm a big concern that if a part of the budget mhm sure sure go ahead and do the other sorry continue paying them minimum on the four one K. and just to be part of the budget or should I go ahead and just for a good show security\nNot because it's part of the budget and I'm not because of interest rate but because Social Security or repayment on that can have hit\nWith the government which has no so and so I I Would get them paid as fast as possible because I wouldn't want them out of my life\nAnd show for that reason I'm going to you know that's going to

month\nOr five hundred dollars a month you just have to pay the whole thing off or pay the payments and so what you do is you just build up a big chunk of savings as your last bit and then when it

and then you've added to it since with your continued research\nWhat were the ... was there anything that just shocked to win the findings where you should go out and see that one coming\nOut you know we worked a lot at um some of the mistakes though in that kind of behaviors that millionaire maker related to investing and I think what what I was\nJust like any of that they're trying to do the right thing on millionaires make mistakes along the way to an ... a lot of that sort of the ... the email that they make related to him I think that that was surprising\nAnd then I think I think the issue is that why hasn't things in terms of the kinds of or rather the amount that they're spending on things like a furniture and clothing and things like that that some of the things that are surprising that were sort of similar time\nYeah I was speaking in a church a couple of days ago and I told them one of the key points that I've seen over twenty five years of doing this one of the things you have to do if you want to build wealth is you have to be careful who you hang around with because you become\nAnd uh she on the back of your book and understanding how those around you influence your financial buddy here's what did you find on them\nYeah absolutely I think that again you see it's very clear from the work that we've done both with populations in and out and just every every day folks like I like\nThat they are um that that that social indifference that not caring about what others they driving and buying and wearing the really key factor and building well no it's related to network regardless of how old you are how much you make\n'em and I think you know now with technology it's really hard to ignore what other people are doing research for media and so forth but it continues to be a factor are just not caring about what other people is unreal that it is one of the wave itself out\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because one of the benefits would going broke or do I do it in my twenties where his violently\nWas ... at that point I just reached all I wanted to do survive\nAnd thrive and reach a point I just don't care what people think I still don't care what people think and I think there was a big contributor to me\nPersonally to be able to to build wealth again after going bankrupt but I see it with other people is when you don't care what other people think about what you drive where you live what closure where when you've been on vacation you're not trying to keep up with other people's Facebook version of themselves then you've got the ability to win\nAbsolutely and I think like just like he said I think that that on Facebook version of what is a lot different right than what's really going on in our lives to set up something to keep in mind but we definitely see that and that research\nShe'll gaining knowledge and composer to invest in ... well that is a great word come closer to grow ... what do you mean by that\n[noise] but you know when we study that related to making decisions on that comes to our investments that it really you know you could apply to any kind of major financial decision they are making a few he kind of calm yourself before making this decision so I Know the example we get sometimes there's\nGoing to rain but not a great time to go out and look for in a car because you're not a skier and an emotional state where you are so excited about the new income level that you have all of a sudden your decision making is a little off so he can stay home and come as\nA matter what the financial decision bar then you'd have a better chance of making the right one\nAnd I often here we've got a ... personalities as a career show on you know choosing a career and there's all this stuff about following your passion out there\nBut you guys have you found yet again in this new set of data the idea that ate a lifestyle related freedom does not equate to less income or less wells that actually ... to ... or will the new [noise]\nYeah you know I think that's right I think that you know understanding that against your passion or or your interests let's say for your career has to be grounded in some kind of reality um and and I think that that's something that\nYou know a lot of people don't want to hear but it is true and so um if you had a passion for the arts and that's really where you want your career to go um you know you have to take that with the reality that that means that certain things are going to have to be set aside\nFor that kind of again it's a lesson that a lot of I don't want to hear but um we can have a happy parents in Seville though\nYou know there's a price to be paid to build wealth and it's worth the price and nobody does that accidentally they'll do it with a plan\nI absolutely yeah that that's one of the things that we keep thing over and over again and again we're talking about millionaires or does that are on their way to becoming a millionaire but that time sense planning and and looking at your goals and monitoring what's going on in your financial life and not you know sort of keeping your head in the stands\nAnd planning and

Chris Hogan asked the audience were three thousand people there how many have you work when you were in college I mean it's like Ninety percent of the audience raise their hand\nNow maybe the people that didn't work when they're in college and listen to my show I don't know but it appears that most people work when they're in college that's what it looks like and so um I I think if I'm you I'm going to continue that route good question thank you for joining us a ... is with us in Houston Hi Lucia how are you\n... I was I got to talk on here and my husband and I lay on the baby sat getting at it that Mollie ... me and made them for a down payment on or how much ... than most of them that we're looking right now at about ...\nPercent about them I frequent down on our how come before I'm Donald type ... about one class size on after about mixed it moves cycle out\nOh I'm trying to make sure that I think about like how much how I feel that we are understanding on the um\n[noise] I I I think he recommended and afford to have your take home pay exactly at OK pack the inside I wanted to make sure that like right now where I have with a million markets calculate them right now we're kind of had a funny one hundred and five of\n'em that comes up like that we hit a ball comfortable on now and I don't want to learn about it I think number I guess I have little or\nNo it was a big number it's a lot better than you're paying now but if that's what that's a fourth of your take home pay or less and your debt free with your emergency fund and blows you have the mouth spread to prosper if you continue to budget and stay on track but again that's not what you should do that's the most\nYou should do so you can do less if you want to 'em or you could put it on a shorter term if you want to\nAnd you know I'm all by less house at Twenty one hundred and paid off in ten years there's nothing wrong with ... five years I don't care I mean you can do a lot of stuff but the most I Would ever tell you to do and I I don't even do that 'cause I don't borrow money at all\nFor anything ever is a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payment is no more than a fourth of your take home pay Luke is whether it's in Dallas Hi Luke welcome to the Dave\nRamsey show [laughter] Hi Dave area better than I deserve what's up [noise] so\nUm my wife and I have a ... for many years actually I my dad got me Leslie when I was a young kid and I'm stupid Lee I did not take care bye And I have student loans and um [noise] we are considering taking a cash out refinance our house\nTo knock out the high interest you know and then start paying the debt off on the house because it that much lower interest rate\nAnd how much they want to do it ... the you know he [noise] um right at forty eight thousand okay and what's your household income\nFluctuates between takeover forty to sixty so I own my own business so last year we did sixty five this year we're looking at probably doing I'm probably going to bring a little closer to forty two\nOkay I I don't know what you've been listening to on the show but in ... uh twenty six years I've never told someone to do a refinance okay take care of to pay off their debt over except to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure and you're facing neither ...\nAnd so on now I've I've never told anybody do that\nOkay and the reason is very simple you make enough money to pay this debt off in a couple of years calm you got to work like a maniac and you're gonna have to have no life\nBut then you're going to be debt free except your house and then you can work on paying off your house I'm from there and of course start working on your retirement and the other baby steps that we want people through but you can't borrow your way out of debt\nAnd on and if you pay this off within two years the interest rate on this becomes mathematically irrelevant\nAnd then also fast it's like you're keeping it for Thirty years it's a two year thing and and really not forty eight thousand for two years more like twenty thousand for two years because halfway through you're going to be halfway through\nAnd and so yeah you guys need to get on a budget really really tight budget\nVery careful very Donald in touch your lifestyle nothing do everything you can wear your business to increase your income because you need to clean up a student loan debt I agree with you on that part but no I don't I don't tell people to borrow to get out of debt you can't borrow your way out of debt it in words you can't dig your way out of a whole\nDigging out of a whole is a an oxymoron statement that we all make which I'm digging out of the whole you're not\nYou can't dig your way out of a whole\nDigging out of a whole is a an oxymoron excitement that we all make which I'm digging a hole you're not digging out of hope you dig out the bottom of a hole gets deeper and she can't dig out of a hole to fill in the whole you know to climb out a whole maybe but you don't dig out of a halt\nUnless you dig into China and work so no you can't you can't you can't borrow your way out of that\nAnd that's the same exact situation so you got to stop that you have to break that cycle\nBut on the sand and say well not borrowing money\nEver ever\nVicious that Iran's you show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it there or a ball they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nBecause we we lived in a very high end area and it was just amazing how much did everybody had and were like wow like you know there's a big support group and you know this is a great way would start with the baby steps mhm\nAnd we did that we
