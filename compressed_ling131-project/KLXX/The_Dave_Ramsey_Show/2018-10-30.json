deserve how can I help serve thanks\nFor taking my call or my wife and I were moving out to a San Diego station out there or we have to pay for a house here in Pensacola and um I Know you normally say not to buy a house if you're in the military\nUm but I've made good money last two times I've done it and uh I Am uncomfortable with having my whole network in I'm In the stock market basically 'cause we'd be looking at the house about three hundred fifty K. um you know we have three hundred and Fifteen came retirement already in [noise]\nBut I Would have to take out two hundred twenty five K. and non retirement investments in order to be able to afford a house up there and also you know I don't want everything in the stock market so don't want everything in one house ... gonna leave their short time and I wanted to know your advice [noise]\n\nUm I don't have a problem with you not wanting everything the stock market I Would not long distance landlord in order to accomplish my goals though so you're talking about keeping the homeless by foreign Pensacola when you moved to San Diego is that what you're telling me\nYou know sure ah we have it on the market I I I Am going to cash out of this now suddenly they're going to die out while their cell phones ... ... ... about three fifty\nOkay in a you're not going to be able to buy anything in San Diego for three fifty\nMalone not unless I catch up on retirement investments should ah you know at two twenty five ... you know I can afford something up there\nWith how much do you ever been on retirement is that all you've got a two point five K. non retirement they don't know about a half million dollar house then his or her what's your household income\nOr about one eighty [noise]\n[noise] the reason we tell folks to not buy in the military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough for it to appreciate enough\nTo sell it and make a profit and also sometimes some military markets have an over supply of\nAlso sometimes some military markets have an oversupply of homes on the market they're hard to resell\nSo you get stuck in it and you lose money on it in some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see incredible\nAppreciation and incredible market activity in both of those markets you should so so you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing\nAnd you should be able to do the same in San Diego\nAnd I do agree real estate prices are up substantially um\nI'm not sure that you have to use all of that I Would probably if I were in your shoes what would I Do if I woke up in your shoes or I Would either a rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought in San Diego\nAnd that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not gonna I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of been spending five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and on retirement um or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable\nIn order to have a house like that with having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now if you re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash a non retirement cash and money from this other home\nAnd it goes up to seven hundred and when your salad you're probably next move moving to a cheaper market\nThere's not any more expensive markets for you to move to in the military than San Diego\nThat's about the ... I mean Hawaii ... Hawaii maybe okay by a there's a couple of other main there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper than San Diego I think we can all agree to that so if you make some money and you're there are three years\nAnd you sell out you're going to put money back in on retirement investing in by a less expensive home may be a larger home but less expensive home the next by in the next station does that make sense yes or the so it's not really a permanent\nDecision even if you use all your non returned my cash although I'm with you I don't think I'd want to use it all I'd probably try to buy something and the foreign hundreds instead of in the five hundreds leaving me with some cash\nAnd non non retirement investing a but the point at your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all in one house and I don't like it all and I don't like so much of it being um I don't like using up all my non retirement investing from a portfolio standpoint my answer to that is is not for that long\nYou're not going to be there ten years and if you are that that\nMakes us going to change during that ten years\nUm but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of real is different expense of real estate in the next next location that your station I thank you for serving your country sounds like you're doing a good analysis on it I'm just kind of joining you in the discussion Jason is with us in Tucson, Arizona Hi Jason how are you\nHow you doing better than I deserve what's up\nUh I I own my own business and I'm not trying to figure out how not to be a crime and under or when I'm ... years old ... retirement should I go or oh\nOkay well you need to start or retirement and I guess\nDo you ... well the first thing we teach folks to do is to get out of debt and have an emergency fund before you start retirement and the reason is because if you don't have any payment you are more money freed up to put in\nAnd before you start retirement and the reason is because if you don't have any payment you are more money\nFor you up to put into retirement and then we want you to put Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement ... what do you make a year\nAh it around a lot of average probably right about a thousand elite\n[noise] okay so somewhere around fifty grand a year okay yes right and how old are you\nOn thirty four\nAnd okay good do you have any debt no good for you are you single OK okay does your wife work outside the home\nYesterday she that nurse machine make a rabbi fattened it\nOkay All right so you got about a hundred and twenty thousand dollar household income\nAnd no data\nAnd you're thirty four years old well done well we want to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses that grandma's rainy day fund and then we would tell you to put Fifteen Percent of your household income\nInto retirement and that's going to be about Eighteen thousand dollars a year in your case going into retirement and now you're asking how to fund that if if she as a nurse has a thorough three B or four one K. available at our hospital or a doctor's office\nYou would put some money there especially if there's a match and then you both need to do a Ross IRA you can do five thousand five hundred each that's eleven thousand dollars of the Eighteen that we need to be putting in right there\nAnd put that in good gross stock mutual funds and Jason to help you set that up and teach

about the time to solve a lot of them but Donald income comes up ... minutes yeah what what was the hardest part of this for you all six\nAnd a good\nAnd I think for me the hardest part was I'm starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see that a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper\nOr to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and um\nSo I think when we paid off our first student loan um that was just such a victory feeling for us um so it was really hard at the beginning to go from letting our money kind of flow out wherever to really nail down a budget and in the envelope system and that was ...\nIt's just the the sacrifice um you know the world we live in just the spirit of comparison and just seeing everyone around you spend money and buying new the nice things and I'm just constantly you know talking ourselves that will be later and you know when we went through the class and I know it's kind of what you always say but it really\nIt's been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can look like no one else has been really close to that because there were

on the program for about two years ah everything's paid off and we all uh I work for the government in my wife's a teacher [noise]\nUh so we're already putting a ten to Fifteen Percent of our income into our ah for myself um I actually am a I went to the government version of a financial peace university [noise]\nUm so where are you talking about the ts aid I have my job my wife has a ... a three day I'm funny thing is is I'm actually one of the uh coordinator for uh\nFor for that program so you're\nWorking or it'd be so four or five and six you got your return but going your debt free you have your emergency someone in places you have a house that you live in and you have a I guess or rental house as a second idols that one of you used to live in is that\nCorrect correct and as the other house rented\nIt's her her brother is living there um he's living there by himself he's paying us a alternately after the mortgage and the uh association fees and the taxes are paid and we're actually losing about a hundred and thirty six\nDollars a month on the house and lawyers or some sort of housing her brother\nWell it's not that we're subsidizing him um\nOf mentally I Would just rather or at least this was the mindset was that I Would rather have him there and uh we get some tax benefit from the house so I assume that\nThe law hundred and thirty six dollars amongst that we're losing our actually getting back at the end of the year to at least break even or maybe still make some money on on the home\nAnd stay home or even I'm All right so you you got this is that her house or your house but it's person says her brother living there\nCorrect okay if you didn't\nOwn the house she wouldn't go buy that house and called tax benefits and subsidizing brother a good plan\nStar

screen crush dot com mhm mhm mhm mhm [noise]\nMarisa is with us in Lafayette, Louisiana ... how are you\nYou better than I deserve how can I help\nThat question and I had anything I graduated a year early and I stay here with my parents made because of the scholarship opportunity I Do not know how to cook for myself while Don King nursing school because nursing school effects eight time oriented program\nMhm okay a\nShower in ... I'm Sorry ... show you how old I said anything you told me that I'm sure you know and you stayed there because of a scholarship yes our to nursing school\nYes sir it's a it's through the state I graduated here and parents need to get the job opportunity\nOkay so the scholarship is partial Yes sir how much of a scholarship that you're good\nAt twenty thousand every four years that it wasn't a large like\nTwenty over four years and it's a four year old program I take it if they're dry and what does it costs\nIt costs ... nearly\nNo kind of which you have five it's actually need eight Yes sir plus you need to eat yeah there's that detail right where are you living with friends family what\nI'm living with Frank we split out in the country because it's cheaper\nYou and some friends were roommates yes our current and so you have rent and electricity or shear and you have food and you need to get out and you need a thousand dollars a year and yet they're okay so when we add all of that up what does your rent and other stuff cost you a month\nIt cost me about nine hundred dollars and they are going on like and I work\nMinimum wage and I do things like clean and people out there and things like that trying to make a little bit of extra money\nMhm okay\nFifteen dollars an hour or ten dollars an hour cleaning houses I'm walking dogs uh other stuff so I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage\nAnd by the way you make enough to work your way through with the numbers that you and I are discussing here I'm In um you are going to be working all the time though\nAnd if you but if you can get a situation like that the semis self employed where you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever [noise] um and you\nUh uh\nYou can control your time and you can make more money you can control when you work and how much you work now you are going to\nStruggle because you're going to work and study and go to class and that's all you're going to but you can make it if you knew that\nThe other thing I Would do is I Would apply for a bunch of scholarships the third thing I Would do is investigate some of the hospital companies that are out there\nParticularly in your immediate area talk to the nursing school and see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school how much of the nursing they would pick up for you\nOkay kind of an indentured servants type program if you've ever heard of those\nAnd I married a hospital that accent planning out like that I won't forget all life can't lay it out like right now in fact body\nWell let's see if we can get a job over there now and let them just pay for it now\nRather than have to pay you back for student loans because I'm trying to keep you out of student loans with the math were you in are doing here\nSo I Want you to apply for a hundred more scholarships you'll get turned down for most of them but if you get another five thousand it really helps the situation a lot I Want you to think about doing different things for work that make you a lot more money and you can control all the time\nAnd I want you to investigate with this hospital or what they will do and talk to the nursing school about ... anything they can do to help you as well that you're working your way through but\nYou you sound like you are to me just talking to you you're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old and it sounds to me like you're a rock star thinking and so I don't think you need to play beer pong his real\nHigh [laughter] I\nThink you don't mind working and and grinding and hustling grind to get your way through this and not come out of this with\nYou know forty fifty ten thousand twenty thousand dollars a student loan that you don't need to\nBut you're going to have to make some very distinct and very careful choices to do this and the good news is you're living expenses are very reasonable Andrew tuition is very reasonable and the third piece of good news is you've chosen a fabulous career in terms of employment you will be able to get employed instantaneously\nI'm mean nursing is just there's always a shortage\nSo you're going to do very very well but I Would go talk to that go talk to the hospital administrator at that local hospital just set up an appointment with them and just walk in there like you own the place is a kind of think you can do that\nAnd uh just tell them that they need to pay for your school and then you'll promise to work there how's that work\nAnd how can you help me get through school because I don't want a bunch of student loan debt I'm trying to not be a statistic and you know get get him impressed with you and and let him\nHelp you be a hero in your story and a him or her that hospital administrator who by the white needs nurses so they're going to be very intentioned are very very in ...\nThat a hospital administrator who by the white needs nurses so they're going to be very intentioned\nA very very inclined towards helping someone in your position especially someone who walks in and ask for help and walks in and says what can I Do to earn some help and so on and um you know get get some people on your side helping\nYou accomplish this um this task lives in front of you but you're on your way you're doing really good congratulations very proud to talk to you call me back if you need help as you're fighting through this Greg is with us in Milwaukee Hi Greg how are you\nDave thank you for taking my call how are you today\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] [noise] well I just have a question for you I'm On a way out our account for oil and get your opinion on a couple of things here um my wife and I don't have any at all with the exception all of our house\nUm we do at least our cars and um [noise] we do that um I have a customer and that and a good client of mine that\nI reciprocate or the money that they spend with me back with them so it's kind of a win win situation um for both of us here the main question that I have is we have the\nUm [noise] ... invest bench I'm over a hundred thousand dollars with\nI'm Tim Roth IRAs and some mutual funds and that type of thing uh she has four one K. I have a four one K. actually has a pension I'm SOL and right now we are\nPaying above and beyond our mortgage I'm On a house by about ten to twenty percent and and putting that toward the house with the amount of investments that we have diversified compared to what we're putting into our houses is that the right formula\nWe tell folks but Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement once you're dead free except the house and have your emergency fund and above Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement and your debt free except your emergency fund then I Will put everything above that towards the house until the house is paid off\nShow took your income sounds point one five [noise]\nMake sure the total of all the Roth IRAs four one\nK. close to reaching you're doing is essentially that enough raiders and that is greater than that back some of the contributions down a little bit and throw the balance of the house or if it's not up to that let's get it up to that or the balance of the house\nLynn we suggest you put the mutual funds\nFrozen broken income aggressive growth and international [laughter]\nAsked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance was not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide\nYeah they all use back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house of them will pay cash for 'cause my incomes going to go up and goes back and uh yeah I'm I'm not going to camp anymore fifty five it was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game\nBut that but you're you know you got past that stage now your back is that okay yeah it's cool thanks for dropping by saying open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta\nGeorgia made clear how are you a good day how are you know good how can I help\nUm I have a question for you so we've\nCalling your data for a little less than a year now and I feel like we are on I had on retirement but we're behind on college savings for two kids\nShow how old are your kids and they are twelve and ten okay and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement I'm a little over a million though your head congratulations ... so what's your household income\nThat's an only child that way yeah we\nAre I mean when you have more than a million dollars you're a millionaire yeah okay yeah you're you're right [laughter] yeah so ... what is your household income a little over two hundred okay so why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get plenty of money for college when you've got eight years before college\nWell we're paying for private school right now as well what are you paying for proud to how much cash how much twenty thousand a year per kid or total\nTotal okay you make two fifty went looking to get you don't have to make two hundred I leave me one eighty\nThey're total turtle okay you make two fifty we're looking at you like it you don't have like two hundred I leave me one eighty okay\nAnd if you can cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's who that cash flow can return towards casual in college too if they choose a college that's a reasonably expenses\nYeah OK okay that's a good point yeah nine\nSo I I you know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement you don't need it\nYou're in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the moral\nBut I don't think your house to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for kids to school today\nWe're going to offset some of that was cash flow in some college but some college we want to set aside and put Fifteen Percent of ... side so we're talking about thirty thousand are such fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in return I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say something to college you say\nTen grand a year per kid another twenty grand you can do that a front for from now until they go to school don't have plenty of money\nI mean you just Jack up to five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control and saw that five twenty nine get or the one of the smart rest her prose and they'll help you do that ... day Ramsey dot com for a list of them in your area the people we recommend them sit down when you help people that five twenty nine together\nAnd top ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut return back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you are not working our plan at this stage\nBecause you put Fifteen Percent into retirement until college and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and then you're a baby step seven to increase return wrote me on Fifteen Percent\nAnd Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand thirty ground so that that's what I'm doing the math here I think you can do it\nI think you just gotta sit down and not have this vague worry about it and instead of having an actual game plan will lay out and go this was important\nThis is more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing show that we can do this and that's ten grand a year per kid for college to kids at some point granted if that's what I mean you've got is where you are so\nGood questions thanks for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Donald's on Twitter at Dave Ramsey\nAt Dave Ramsey I guess what you're saying that we're just buying

have well my wife and I were a debt free except for our health uh-huh and we've got a one and a half year old little boy\nYeah hey and we want to oil [laughter] we want to play approved college but before he goes to college you're most likely for our faith going to sort of a two year mission\nRight and I know that probably doesn't apply to the ah the college savings plans mhm oh we've got a\nChunk of money right now about seven thousand dollars were willing to put somewhere but we're trying to decide whether we should put it down on their mortgage which one way or the other will be paid off before he goes\nYeah or by a couple of good ah or she has to be something um to to build up that the future mission and college fund\nGotcha okay and your debt free except your home correct\nIn addition to the seven thousand dollars do you have an emergency fund a rainy day fund up three to six months or expenses\nWe'd do you how much is in that about good okay well you're out what we call baby\nIt's maybe step ones with thousands saved too is that free but tiles three is a fully funded emergency fund\nBaby step for is putting Fifteen Percent of your household income into retirement which you should just start doing that as a part of your savings you're investing plan right now maybe step five kids college and beyond that six is pay extra on the house as you can\nAs fast as you can show what I Would do with this money is I Would hear a market for school\nAnd mission trip 'cause you guys are obviously LDS right we are yeah\nOK cool so what what I'm going to do is say out of the seven thousand I'm probably going to drop five thousand of it into a five twenty nine for my one and a half year old into a good growth stock mutual fund that's all for college has to be used for college\nTake the other two thousand and just said it in a mutual fund in your\nName no big deal just a regular mutual fund in your name and you just on the file when you drop the paperwork into a file right mission trip on the file\nBut it's just earmarked for that it's in your name your controlling the money\nAnd if everything goes as planned and he's going to do is to your mission trip and ... then that two thousand will grow into enough to help him do that the other five thousand you'll add to it periodically throughout his life so that there's enough in there for him to go to college when he comes back from mission trip\nDespite becoming a catchphrase\nThe day do you to watch\nWe just finished SP you\nWere on babysat to\nAnd for the last five years we have been building our home\nPaycheck to paycheck\nAnd um it's not a hundred percent completed yet we had to borrow money on it a kind of get things rolling a little bit but um\nWe got an offer to do a care taking position and the guy a died a four hundred dollars a month to take care of his vacation home I'm In the same town we live\nUm [noise] do we tell our home or do we keep it and continue to make a payment on it\nIt's not completed well it were at that point it means a paint and flooring and you're living in it no no um well we were living in a mobile home\nAnd but then we got this offer to live in this house basically for free and he pays a live here and take care of\nI got that are okay so that's ... so you've never lived in this other house no okay somebody will tough to sell it and the conditions than yeah like they can't get financing on it right so you're going to take a whipping\nA what will it take money wise to finish it\nUm\nWhat never had a professional answer on that but probably about eight thousand ten thousand dollar yeah and what is your household income um well my husband he worked forty hours a week what her household income [laughter]\n\nProbably thirty seven thousand a year\nOkay so your husband's the only one working well we have a business um that doesn't make it out and running but it doesn't make money\nHis income is about twenty seven thousand in the business makes about Fifteen thousand nearly okay and then getting the care taking position or will be in about forty eight hundred cash but we get housing for free\nYeah I got that part in till you get until he decides he doesn't want you to care take anymore and then you don't have housing for free anymore that science so I mean he could walk into more and fire you pretty much I changed my mind and then you you have a housing issue again right so um\nYou have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring as it is\nUm [noise] well we had a appraisal and if it were completed it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand that smart completed so probably a hundred and fifty hundred and twenty five\nNo no not if it's not completed it won't know um because ... it's a further discounts and the cost it takes to complete it it's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer cannot bothers house\nOkay because they don't have any money and they're trying to get a mortgage and they can't get a mortgage on this house and\nSo that limits your in but they didn't limit your selling tools to investors and they're going to discount that I'm a lot deeper than that if you get a hundred dollar she'll be flying I'm thinking\nSo um [noise] how much will be borrowed against it so far\nAbout how the south we do thirty thousand but there are some property attached Jay how altogether it a hundred thousand\nYou owe a hundred thousand against the house and the property yeah which would bring a hundred and sixty if it were fixed if you sold the property is well yes okay\nAll right yeah I I Would look at trying to pick up the other ten thousand dollars in an additional loan and get this house finished and let's get it so as soon as possible\nAnd then just continue fattening money and how we yeah\nYeah we'll have you know you should have some equity in your pocket at that point I mean I'm not a ton but you're gonna get a little money out of it so you know it it just hasn't worked out for you you realize that right yeah you've got way too many hours in this house\nAnd and really didn't get much out of it went all the smoke clears here right you'll get a little bit but it's not it is not worked out very good so you know you're going to have to reset that and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you guys need to look at your income\nBecause your household income as you I'm very very low income and ah so I I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term and I want to think about some part time jobs in the meantime\nBut um yeah I Would get that house finished up I'm saving scratching and clawing painting and [noise] you know if you borrow three thousand bucks or something that's fine but let's let's turn around and get it sold as fast as possible now if the land is such that you can sell off a piece of the land\nWithout selling the house in order to have the money to finish the house that's what I Would do first\nSell a pig showing acre also corner use that money to finish the house then get the house so in that way there's no more debt involved\nOlivia is with us in Lexington high Olivia how are you\nCouldn't hire you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nAnd I had a question and I had it can it can amount of debt and and I'm wanting to pay that off the eighth grade

um ...\nOkay All right well no I'm not going to put therapy on hold right now this is something you need you need some account sort of walk with you as you finish this life transformation and that that is essential to you having a life would you agree with that statement\n[laughter] now what I Would do is is number one it's not a permanent situation um the therapies not permanent is not going to be there the rest of your life fifty years from now you're not going to still be going to the therapist okay I Hope I'm and then uh otherwise therapist\nIs not very good [laughter] but ah at some point you'll you'll pull back from that and the second thing will happen is is that as you continue to address your income and you're out go you're going to find ways to make more income and as you have more emotional healing you're going to feel more energized to make more income\nAnd so if this month you don't pay any extra on the debt that you pay your therapy\nGood if next month the same thing happens okay but by this time next year\nLet's do something let's kick her life in gear and let's start to clean up the mess to ... for today Seventy five whole day's you've been clean\n[noise] that's a great start right but it's not like you told me you've been clean for two years mhm by the time you're going for two years we ought to be have different having a different conversation about the money would that make sense to you [noise] so let's get Hugh healed and then let's see oh your money\nAnd as you go and it's not going to be a suddenly\nLike a switch flips undergo OK I'm OK Now getting the money no it's not all or nothing it's coming gradual it'll be incremental\nYou'll feel better you you know when you're Ninety Days or your four months you ought to feel different than you feel right now and you ought to be able to do more than make Moran save more and more and you know you you all have more focus on the money 'cause you'll be more he you'll\nHave to spend less severe emotional energy just coming through this right now your game on just getting through this is that right [laughter] okay well I Want you to finish turning the corner you've turned the corner once you're finished turned the corner and let's let's gone out\nAnd then as you make incremental progress\nMore and more than money from your new income and your increased income\nThe debt size for today we want to take care of Olivia you need to be taken care\nThis is that I ... [noise]\n\nHow often do you look at your bank account and wonder where all your money went how often or you're stressed about bill's afraid your paycheck will last the whole month you shouldn't have to live like that you shouldn't feel powerless over your money and you don't have to you can take control of your money\nWhere the financial ... membership you'll learn to manage your daily finance was pay off debts spin and save wisely and invest for your future if you follow the scores and do the stuff we teach it works every single time\nAnd uh our youngest has Down syndrome\nAnd so uh well right now we're actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church\nAnd we're just getting to the part where we're ah we're working on it will be good and so because we have this special needs a issue we we get involved or attorney in getting our wheels together good and through that conversation we ah you know I'm\nA we've been discussing a special needs ... world I'd have to play in planning for our baby future yeah your animal ...\nSure uh originally a kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs stress kind of functions the same way that the other boys have a college fund in baby steps five\nUm the uh and that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special condition who special rules because of course\nAh you know his his features are boring it's too early to know what is your fully what his needs are we've been blessed that he's [laughter] he's healthy developing well you know there's this guy could limit for him just like anyone mhm um and we don't have to ah\n[noise] ah you know it's hard to really didn't know if he ever have any limitations [laughter]\nBut uh but now as we're getting into it and we haven't found anything quite yet but if it comes down to the wire why things that I'm uncomfortable with is that you know if I start investing any money or finding trying to I I lose control of that to the track speed we've named didn't while while I trust the ... the inability to go with their wishes that makes me uncomfortable\nNo you don't you don't need a special needs trust unless both of you die right the special needs trust does not need to be funded prior to your dad okay so that it it sounded from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth\nOkay\nIt's not ... I wouldn't even have it formed accept upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as I Want to he was alive as long as one of us alive to manage your ass that's one of the things you're going to do is care for this child\nThat flew out of those assets now they don't win the trust is needed is if both of you die it gives the trustee me the the the the direction on how to handle the assets and disperse them to take care of this child's needs\nAnd um and what that needs to be is a a a big hairy term life insurance policy that ... that is the beneficiary of it is that special needs dress or a portion\nOf the policy you know thirty percent or twenty percent of the policy in the beneficiary line goes to the special needs trust in the event that both of you\nA policy you know thirty percent or twenty percent of the policy and the beneficiary line goes to the special needs trust\nIn the event that both of you die kind of a thing where the primary beneficiary is your wife okay but then past that the secondary beneficiary is\nSome portion would go while you got minor children into a family trust to take care of the minor children your oldest two until they get them through college the other portion would go into the special needs trust to perpetually care for this other child throughout life\nNot just through college and so it's a larger amount needed to do that and then what happens is let's say we fast forward Twenty years\nAnd this child is Twenty years old and you've got a million and a half dollars and mutual funds okay your other children are grown and gone or close Twenty years from now right that the dream the dream that's like yeah we're kicking them out so they're going [laughter]\nThat's the legacy by [laughter] but it's out of that than what we've got is we've got you know some portion of my million and a half dollars in my example is gonna be parked in the special needs trust in the event both you and your wife or to pass the rest of it would go to your\n... more traditional airs directly\nSure but you know we put a million dollars in a in the the youngest child special needs trust at Twenty years old because he's going to need care and that's eighty thousand dollars a year it'll produce ... that'll take care of him and maybe one of his brothers is the trustee\nBy ban\nYou know what you would you build it had like we're doing right now with the formula trust as illegal activity no now and I'm David unfunded or would not let it could have put make a clause in in the well\nWhy not why would I Would just make it a clause in the will to be formed upon both of your deaths\nOkay because you don't need it now you don't need to be filing tax returns for the next twenty five years on this thing you don't need a shorter than all the time you don't need to go all the legal expense to form the trust so let me give you another example okay special needs ... as a as a special conditional\nVersion of just taking care of minor children right then the differences that might be perpetual\nOkay but you know my children grew up\nAnd moved out on her own their own show my need for a trust to cover my minor children\nA in a live in both of our best expires\nFormed a trust for my minor children at that time in the need for that expire\nAnd I would have done it for nothing in this case is not going to be for nothing you're going to need a trust for most of that\nDo whatever you want and that's that's how we do\nGet asked all the time about what people need to do to improve their families money situation to the most overlooked things

I save time and twenty thousand dollars in cash and I just started um Iraq IRA I'm right now and they have about five thousand dollars and now you will\nThank you but so I just uh within the past couple of months here and listening to you I'm credit and such that me and the one thing that I haven't heard of ties is actually I'm paying off my student loans [laughter]\nUm so and listening to you and following your baby steps I um I decided to go ahead and take fat twenty thousand dollars um or Eighteen thousand dollars of it and put it towards my student loan\nRight now I have about Eighteen thousand dollars left instead of on I'm which I'm trying to rapidly attack\nI'm the one thing though is that um oh and then I also stopped I I was putting on twelve percent of my income into my er one K. and I got an ... and ... percent I'm the one thing though is that I started talking to my friends about what I'm doing\nYeah I just feel like you're crazy you're a woman who how could you only have

gum Jacob is in Washington and do you recommend putting Fifteen Percent into retirement I worked for the local fire department and I have a pension plan do I need to say Fifteen Percent over and above that or count that\nSay Fifteen Percent over and above that or count that as part of it well what I tell folks is that you need to put Fifteen Percent and most of the time and a pension plan you're not putting in anything\nAnd you don't have any control over what happens with the pension plans you don't choose the investments you don't get to um you know if the ... municipality in your case is poorly run they could break the pension plan it's happened before doesn't happen very much\nBut um no I think you need to be voting Fifteen Percent of your income away in Roth IRAs Ross four oh one K. is whatever you got to do along those lines\nAnd and that's the thing I Would tell you that the reason is is that what you've got that's money you choose where it invested and if somebody mishandles something at work it doesn't mess up your four one K. it doesn't mess up your Roth IRA you are controlling your destiny are not waiting on someone else\nThe people you work for it affects your life that's a big deal Johns in Pittsburgh hey John welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHow are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm great um reason I'm calling is here's my question uh my wife is sixty five but I'm sixty two were just now into getting on the on the snowball we have a ... or ... ...\n... we're looking for a new place to live the house was Iraq right now is just way too big for us my wife and I both got bad knees bad backs them up and down the stairs opinion about all the time okay um my question is\nUm the rentals around this area and now are skyrocketing because there's new cracker plant going in so people are coming in from out of state sucking all those up [laughter] [noise] but I found a couple of houses that I could purchase\nAnd the pay my rent right now it's eight Seventy five a month or my payment would drop to about six hundred and thirty dollars come up mhm [noise] um the other part of it is [noise] uh when I retired from the post office I rolled my ah first savings plan into an IRA and good\nThat I can borrow enough from right now with that I already jak can be able to put towards ... percent down ... on the house so I wouldn't have to pay the PM Iowa's law\nMhm I Know it's just like you know if I see I'm a I don't go down ... percent no you're you're you're turning your two broke to buy a house you're in debt okay you're in debt you get your borrowing\nAgainst your retirement I mean you're straining every corner to pull this off okay um and besides that you if you're moving from an eight Seventy five rental to six hundred dollar payment you are moving down in a house substantially\nSo we're going to move down and how substantially moved down to a different rental and let me tell you if the rental market is squeezed because of a plant that has come in the buying marketed squeezed as well so what you're telling me is not logical you're using this as a rationalization by out of order\nI if I were you when you call me and I ask what you should do I would rent something else move out of that rental moved to a cheaper rental that'd be fine\nAh for a short period of time that while you clean up your debt your debt free you build your emergency phoned up three to six months of expenses then you have a good down payment and you can do all of that and a few years if you're careful and watch what you're doing and then make your purchase\nBut when you buy a house and you're broke you're asking for trouble I mean a Murphy will move in your spare bedroom bring his three cousins broke desperate and stupid owning a home when you're broke and be a financial curse rather than a blessing\nSteven is in Virginia Beach Hi Stephen how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nWho are to be a right now I have a higher rate and my name and I know you can only put five thousand five hundred into a year yes or no hypothetically at me and my wife only had\n... mouth that amount of money five thousand five hundred to go toward than investing\nWhether it be smarter to put all of it into my ... is or should I open up a rock for my and my wife's name and then flip the five thousand five hundred and put two thousand seven hundred and fifty in each of them and watch her grow that way what's your household income\nOr a household income and fifty thousand\nOkay Mm\nSo Fifteen Percent of that going in it baby step forward into retirement\nIs more like\nA ten thousand no way would be more like Seventy five hundred okay um [noise]\nOkay so you wouldn't fully fund to but you could put some it it doesn't matter\nUh which one you do\nMathematically let's say you chose the exact same mutual fund\nThen you put three thousand in more than three thousand and another okay one in one Roth IRA and your name one Roth IRA and her name or are you put six thousand in the same mutual fund it's going to grow exactly the same so it really doesn't matter uh\nHe'll I even had like a thousand dollars I can I could open up one have five hundred and my name and five hundred her but you have the exact same exactly\nIt doesn't it doesn't have you any mathematical advantage whatsoever [noise] the only advantage is just a relational\nIn that if she feels like that you know you're fully funding yours and she's not got anything for retirement which is not true because if you ever got divorced or died or anything else she's going to get half of that money even if it is and your name\nOkay okay so it's not true but sometimes people just you know like she just wants some and her name that's okay so you can do half and half if you want you need to get to the point you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement that's baby step for and that would be after you were out of debt and after you had your emergency\nFund them ... which may be why you don't have the money right now\nThat's why we put baby step forward after getting out of that and after having emergency if I Would do folks temporarily not to save for retirement until you clear your debts that way you have the money to put a Fifteen Percent away\nAnd a Fifteen Percent is more than one Roth IRA for you guys but conceptually if you just even if you did Seventy five hundred and thirty seven or fifty bucks each\nAh that'd be fine or if you did fifty five hundred and two thousand and the other name that's fine if they're in the same mutual fund you're going to get the exact same results or whether you split it or not doesn't change a thing\nJames is with us in Fort Smith Arkansas Hi James how are you\nGood thank you for taking my call sure what's up my wife and I are planning to fire hall next year and or had a little trouble deciding or or agreeing on type house would not want to get up out of line and towards getting a fixer upper\nThere'll be a cheaper house with lower mortgage payment ... and that gives me the opportunity to learn learn how to do those holler payers myself mhm and she wants to move in ready house\nMhm okay and uh be your first phone\nThat they are second all we've had a house for a while ago and then we moved in with an rent printing for well over a year now you\nKnow the other home that you had was it a fixer upper it was not able to live and ready okay right and so what is her fear\n... you know and all that kind of a hassle Amanda how mhm I didn't want anything major just some minor cosmetic type stuff\nBut what can you do it for you moved in\nA financially I think we'd be able to pay for rent and a mortgage\nNo I'm saying oh yeah okay so what you're saying that you use the fixer upper would take a few months may be and you wouldn't have recommended ...\nI'm a part time real estate agent so I live in a house for two years and then turn around and sell it I can sell it tax free\nAny word got out of my goal is to shelter for anyone\nTalk to their real estate I just saw how stretch where you first residents will be living in two years Dr for growth on anyone for anybody [noise]\nI don't think there's a there's a right or wrong answer but this is just a question of what you guys want to endure it is your home and we are homeless topsy turvy because it's being renovated all the time\nSome valid points on her you're not going to make as much money on it to your point so it's a valid argument\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches or being reported every day and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy the I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked\nOut when they become an identity theft victim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans\nFind out really quick how unprotected they are in so many ways that's why ... says Anders id theft plant to our benefit package was such a smart move the Sanders plan covers all types of ID theft takes over all the work and even coverage or bank account if it gets act\nYeah but are you healthy yes\nI Would take it as no survivor getting more and by Fifteen year level term insurance to cover your wife if something happened to you it's a better deal yeah go ahead and take all the money you can get you know\nOkay I currently have a four hundred thousand dollar term policy so\nOkay yeah then that she's probably All right without the survivor benefit because that's going to replace your forty thousand dollars that you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay that that that invested ... percent will be forty grand so that that's pretty good you're in\nGood shape and you can probably do it this way um I Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\nYour ear in a way above average shape I'm In good shape is ... is is way above normal because normal just sucks okay you got to weigh better than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life\nFor the next forty years is going to get old\n\nAnd you don't really have any income coming other than that because your investments aren't big enough to create it and so I Would you know you can do it you can do it but I think you need to have in the back of your head you may be going back to work at some point\nI'm considered that I've thought about it for health insurance and um [noise] um and I've heard of these men to share programs do you\nThink this is not driving this for me for what's driving it for me as you don't have much\nMoney right and you got the pension but I understand you know think about what what are you\nKnow forty thousand dollars is going to buy in forty years when you are Ninety\nNothing yeah nothing\nThat's the problem I've got here so it doesn't have a good long term prognosis of you guys just being able to live and we can figure out how you could live in other words if you had a million dollars a mutual funds this becomes like a no brainer\nInstead you're not like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe if we scrape everything together after the failed around properties and you know the farms got value but it's not producing any money so what my what I'm thinking as an ... and again you can do whatever you want to I'm just talking at through with you OK\nI'm not saying you're you're you're you're wrong or you're bad or something but that's my concern of what I'm hearing is and so I probably would think about what we always called an encore career and say what could you do that would be really fun\nThat you could make fifty grand or a hundred grand doing for the next five or six seven years\nAnd you didn't enjoy doing it start a business you'd have fun doing it and make some bank and bank all of it and health insurance as part of the day I don't care if you're working for somebody else you start a business but just do something what you're doing that and make you smile anymore so you need to get out of there\n[laughter] you picked up on that huh\n[laughter] yeah and so you know but I but I mean when you're you're young you have a lot of uh a lot of\nService to humanity left inside you that you could get paid for ideas concepts things you could do I don't know what it is but\nJust a little bit older than you I'm fifty seven of them do and I plan on work and it's not 'cause I Need money I don't make any money I got money coming in my ears but I'm working because I asked\nYou ought to find something like that and then you can work in the hunt and fish and work to hunt and fish and farmers you know but but you know I'd like to see your bank another five or six hundred grand and the next eight years and have fun doing it\nThat's what I'm saying that's what that's the only challenge I've got is I think there's God's got something inside of you there is something you could do more than a hunting and
