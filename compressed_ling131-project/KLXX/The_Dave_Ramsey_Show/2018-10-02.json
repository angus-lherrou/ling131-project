or Eighteen months or something like that how long you want to save up to do that and I I think that's what I Would do probably in your situation\nUm that yeah I think it is Karen is with us in Miami I Karen how are you\nSherry's with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Sherry well to limit Iran's you show by then\nHad um he was a great how much it I'm about thirty thousand dollars maybe a little bit more depending on how fast is [laughter]\nAnd we were kind of figure out what city we have one last one I ever see the ... ban on our house mhm we probably\nPretty cut off that we've got our emergency finally started finding retirement and we have time to do that or nine years old and we didn't know hounding their college fund or if we could pay off and the other country than on the house ... on\nHow much is that the ... percent and without that he got into where we use it all up they would take it all OK and what's your interest rate on your home and ... you can shoot about market there and you are a hundred percent sure that thirty thousand dollars will cause the amount of be dropped\nThe populated out it'll be like thirty one about anything that we have we have the money to put the okay\nYeah and you can argue confirming that with the mortgage company prior to doing it obviously you're not going to just send them the money but they only want to make sure that the ... going away okay and PMS costing you watch\nUh the salary than quite put him on them and only a hundred and Ninety nine dollar they called fat [noise]\nHousehold income or around like put a hundred thousand\nOkay here here's what here's where you are in our baby steps and you probably already know this but let's review show our other listeners are caught up you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement orange you\nCorrect yes baby step for five is kids college the Sixers payoff files are like so really the question is where we can put this on five or we'll put there's ... there's not a ... there's not a dumb or wrong answer here either one is fine whatever makes you feel good whatever's good idea\nI'm I'm probably going to take twenty thousand of this\nAnd put ten each in five twenty nuns for these girls\nOkay you're getting your college sneaking up on you fast\nAnimals for all the other ten at the house um and then I'm gonna system and then I'm going to set up a monthly amount to add to the ten beginning at the first of the year so that they five twenty nine pounds are kind of on auto pilot and so you're going to put you know ten thousand and plus a hundred bucks a month each or something like that small that among\nThem but because of the line I Do have a four year old\nGirl and then you know then we can just spreading around but however you want to do it but ... I Want to put a substantial amount porch college and then you make enough\nTo be able to just beat on this mortgage pretty rapidly but six hundred dollar a year or return on a thirty one thousand dollar investment is not that great\nBut yeah so I'm going to start the kids' college and then I'm going to just start paying off the house the natural result of working your baby steps Sixers you're going to get down below the market that dropped but then you're just gonna keep beating on the house to after that and it's going to go away completely so good question it's an interesting analysis to

or how long they're\n[noise] how long will you be in training oh I'm until about ... oh wow so you're separated alone time yes they're\nOkay [noise] out well the easiest way to do it is every dollar plus and every dollar we lost what that does the app that connects to Europe or you put it on your phone and it connects you your bank account and the two of you both have access to both of you put it on your phone and put it on your desktop whatever\nAnd no matter where you are in the world she can look at the budget you can look at the budget as long as you get Internet access\nAnd they'll show and then you just you can obviously disgusted by phone or email or whatever else you want to do on them but you've got um just lay out a game plan that encompasses your expenses there in San Antonio which should be very minimal because I'm guessing you're on base housing right\nHere on base food right yes there so you shouldn't have any expenses if your families back home trying to get out of debt you know your ship and all the money home right\nYes and so are most of it I mean but you you just basically going to get a small miscellaneous aligned aunts and then the rest of it's going home for the baby for the kids and for the get out of that plan or whatever you're working back there\nBut the um the ... the you know every dollar plus allows you to follow exactly any expenditures that she makes and vice versa because you're dealing awful one bank account and we pushed that through that way so\nNot aware of that one of the oh I'm Sorry they're not going to go into\nIt it's one of the issues that I'm having with is a you know it's just kind of explaining how small details of the ... like that\nYeah they feel secure and stopping her investment store while one K. or or are towards taxes or anything like that and ah\nWell that's not an issue on how to budget apart that's an issue of wearing disagreement on what we're going to do right these are different issues so I mean

they do have little marks on our credit such as a bankruptcy\nI'm due to divorce or medical bills and a collection and um some one of our perspective tenants actually just has a um\nThey are slowly paying down but all three of them had actually gone through financial Pete's university and hatch certificate that they've all for it at me and and they have their emergency tiny and they had\nUm terrified income because I Am wondering it is that I'm a show of a determination a good enough to write to them even though they have a checkered a credit history pack\nYeah I read the people will check or pass all the time or I'm worried about their future and handed it to the extent that their past as an indicator of their future you don't rent to them if they got an ugly past\nBut a lot of the authors of those stupid stuff in the past the question is are we still on that road\nAnd they don't like that around and in this case all three of them are at least making some level of effort to

young as you are how old are you too\nI'm forty six and ... forty seven paid for house boat just like that and all because of you I didn't pay any of it in a fire that made you think you could do it so he went and did it wow that's cool well tell me the story two and a half years ago what happened\nWell Dave about two and a half years I started listening to your show mhm I listen to the podcast on the radio at home and I became very obsessed with it actually I talked to everybody I got I was ... relatives giving her head yes and I I did become a little upset don't you think\nYeah Dave actually the term I coined at some point in this process LEDs honey I think you need to go to Dave Ramsey rehab [laughter]\nDetox [laughter]\nI Love it well there's worse things to get addicted to

choice you your voices on to\nEnd the mess I'm getting ready every day so it was a you know I was in full bore and I and just Destin was the driving force but it was really easy to get on board\nSo you guys are looked at it and together in all seriousness other than the overdoing the Dave Ramsey part I'm you looked at it together and said hey if we really rolled up our sleeves we can pay off his nose that's it yeah I had an a ha moment huh\nYeah and we're we're a good team we bounce ideas off each other and we always dreamed of the same conclusion as to what we were going to do and and here we are\nNow you don't have a payment in the world not that and and the grass does feel better when you walk on it I'm telling you it's not an exaggeration it's a great metaphor but it's also the truth yeah very cool very cool so how long have you been married eleven years have you ever been dead for a while you were married\n... know this is it recently or were you ever go back\nAbsolutely not too good to be free and gave my favorite part of our story in our journey is\nWe have that almost Seventeen year old daughter and and the term that we've heard over and over is more ... than taught and just seeing how true that is with our daughter because it's such an amazing thing to see and she literally is\nYou know a senior in high school and preaching your program to her peers and this is going to continue on and on and on\nWell so the family tree is changed yes settled out I'll just with the money part but with the lessons learned yeah well done you guys think when you tell people the key to getting out of debt is\nPlanning having a plant communicating with your spouse and being real strategic with your money when we whether it's shopping for groceries we'd go to the discount you know grocery places\nAnd being real strategic with your money when we whether it's shopping for groceries would go to the discount you know grocery places whether it's going if we're going to go out

single time so things like that and I don't I'm I'm not a big shopper so all my clothes come from discount stores I never buy anything on sale that's just how and and I don't see that changing ever settle it it can change if you want it to I mean you you don't have any payments\nNow and then my DNA I'd I go straight to the sale right on well\nThat Sharon she always tells me how much money she saved me which means it costs me something but yeah I feel nuts but nowadays we can afford it it's not a big deal if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else and you guys are in that position so did you have people thought you were crazy or detractors or did you have a more cheerleaders\nAh we definitely had cheerleaders around us and no negative comments it through

I have some a lot I mean does the orders and I just I get denied or I'd have an outrageously\nExpensive policy and I just I'm trying to think outside the box I'm not stuck in a job that line happy because of this one issue you know I don't know how\nYou're going to be making more at the other position\nIt'll be the same okay I'm going to be\nBetter I only have to drive ten minutes instead of an hour [laughter]\nI Wonder if the new place the new hospital or whoever has enough flexibility that they had some insurance programs to their group plan to allow you to buy more\nI asked\nAbout that and they said the man I spoke with said that it's by no package and he doesn't believe that's the case\nMhm\nAspect with um our investor and he um he said he got to buy your credit for that as well and he's about to manage bond account\nNo that's not my principles [laughter] I've never heard of it not well I'm not gonna start buying bonds to offset the fact that you don't have insurance so it's not you know that's what he's doing and that no thank you um\nI mean you you need to build up a big pile of money called wells and then you don't have to worry about life insurance and that's the general principle that you move towards a or about\nTo pay our house off in December so they don't have any debt um\nAnd so you know as a matter of fact and the more wealth you have the less and less we need to worry about replacing your income for the\nGood of your family mhm right if you have enough oil that your family's fine and you have no debt and your family's fine without your income then we don't worry about the subject anymore because you become self insured your family's funny because the point is is the family major income to live\nRight under the extent that don't need that to the extent you don't\nYour family is fine 'cause the point is is the family major income to live right on to the extent they don't need that to the extent you don't need life insurance now have you actually shopped or are you making an assumption that you can't get insurance\nI got denied about seven years ago I tried\nCalling ... calls and their insurance and the market has changed dramatically\nBut I got another guy and I said back in March that when I let a life insurance and this diagnosis that um they basically said get denied but I haven't tried Zander\nYeah try them I mean there's no it doesn't cost anything to ask mhm let's talk about it and find out that I don't I think you may be right I mean if you know you probably found some valid research you're probably not insure all you know so the only question is just you know if your family only got a hundred grand instead of getting five hundred grand how old are you\nThirty eight and and uh the auto immune that you've got I mean how are you know you're a health care professional uh does do you have a real threat here of losing your life\nYou can't there's different degrees of it and mine mild but I um when they hit record it kind of\nGone down by the actual fact you die and I am Lee is left without you what's the probability of that\nLand on at a ... I'm In I'm In good health so I mean it could get worse but you know I mean that's how old are you thirty eight\nOkay so I mean in the next ten years a typical thirty eight year old who have very low probability short of an accident\nOf passing away and yours is slightly greater resolve and it's not like to have a terminal cancer diagnosis right right okay so I'm not going to worry about it I'm gonna take the job I Want and then use your fabulous income what you have\nTo build wealth and to become debt free in the family but I mean if you're sitting there with a million dollars in mutual funds and your four one K. and mutual funds and everything's paid for house and everything and you passed away I think your husband get struggle through [noise]\nYeah I think you know\nAnd that's what I mean by self insured by becoming wealthy\nAnd they shot about three hundred thousand in retirement yeah and your house is paying for ... and you get a hundred thousand and insurance so you know he is he going to be OK yeah you'll be OK yeah plus I'm guessing he works right hey we're here now so I mean he's going to be okay so I'm taking the job because the call Center for\nInformational purposes and just double check your assumptions OK okay thank you thank you Michael is with us from Charlotte Hi Michael how are you\nGood thanks thanks for taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nAh

people when they ask how you get out of debt you paid off a hundred and fifty three thousand twenty three months no matter where you met that's not easy\nIt's not I I think the biggest part with having a budget and having a plan together and they think into that plant every month\n\nAnd a safer for me I think that you know I just feel that we're wherever the willingly left and the fact that\nUm while before we met and I can look back at my financial history where I made bad decisions after we met and we got on the we got on the plan separately we've we've never gone through those dumb decisions\nUm we've never had to deal with those stupid purchases or we've never had to look at something that we've done as a couple and said that was dumb now we've got to fight back out of it
