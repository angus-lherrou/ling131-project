sure I'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training and I finally received like commercial helicopter state typically it\nUm however I unfortunately I Need a the by eighty hours or more training I've I discovered a this I mean there's trees highly regulated by insurance and in order to become a share of NATO out two hundred hours and I'm trying to\nFigure out how to pay for those eighty hours and be ready to work the upcoming season I'm as a commercial up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a copilot and yet the hours\n[noise] no I unfortunately uh they are the jobs are there any out as a single pilot\nNow that that moment you just said the wrong thing you should do the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida and you know ... what's wrong\nWell I I didn't tell you another thing or two days I I work as a firefighter show that's my primary um income choice there's this kind of like a secondary thing that that kind of went off in bed and that's a\nThat's why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as a ... ... jobs that I ... I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than ...\nAh you know I Believe it or not firefighter a definitely make are\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or a career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nYes yeah so that's what I Want to do [noise] okay\nUm and you show U.S forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work an irregular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited value\nYeah it's not that I think it's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this is like a like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I just I feel I'm too far into it to just\nWell I'm not suggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except just slow down and go I'm just gonna take me a little time as I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do the hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job done me up and there was a child is not worth that much [noise] yeah it doesn't pay that much either that's what I mean\nThey're not worth that last compared to what you're saying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training in the first year\nNo mayor right now\nSo not to mention all the money you've already put on it so um what I Want to do is look for a place I mean you've got connections\nThat you can get some hours and the co pilot she can get some takeoffs and landings and get some of that council actually\n... those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently find a Robin ... symbol type aircraft gotcha not even a turbine yet but um\nI mean I I've even reached out to people that own their own aircraft and and you know offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get does or or Jerry ... and are far chill out a lot of those guys are very busy so I can get and our air and our there but nothing really counts as\nTo who you're going to end up paying for these hours what is it the eighty hours cost [noise]\nWell considering some of the hour and a place of a you know on the cheap you can get some at two fifty a three hundred five hundred it all depends on the aircraft and what kind of a deal you ... you know so\nThat she won a thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much already my chair and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on just take your time and cash flow it because you you now have\nAs we continue the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level um ... the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more and so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah yeah definitely ... passionate yeah why not you know I there's nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah yeah I mean I I've got a I I collect handguns and shoot them a lot and uh and and also I\nBurn through some MOH but it's a ... I don't make any money doing um I'm trying to make money doing it but I was just a hobby\nAnd so that costs money hobbies costs are on in this one was not going to cost you money is actually gonna make you a little once you get past this but up until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just going to put another twenty thousand bucks into this thirty thousand bucks into this before you get paid\nAnd um that may take you two years to cash flow that instead of one year you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season I Want to pay for it in return you promise to work there are three years or something like that you know\nAnd they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody looking for a pilot that\nYou know with that much intensity uh\nSometimes or an employer will pick up some education costs in order to get somebody on board if they're having trouble finding the help in that area\nTo hell in destruction [noise]\nThis today Ramsey show [noise]\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're

Twitter and get the latest movie and TV news on screen dot com\n[noise]\nBelieve the case until something indoor I get home turn into millionaires the original book started everybody talking about those back in the early Nineteen nineties\nWhen I wrote my first book when financial piece came out it was a book called the millionaire next door\nBut Dr Tom Stanley changed the way everyone thought about millionaires I got to know ... a little bit a while he was living and I've gotten to know his daughter since then and I'm big fans of each of theirs and we're big fans of course of anyone who's in this millionaire space doing anything\nAnd as you guys know Chris Hogan has a million or a book coming out in January but Sarah for law is with us a Tom Standage daughter and a ... this was the first time we've ever talked on the airwaves topped off the air and she has a new book coming out all of the in well almost some of her dad's original research so Hi Sarah how are ya\nI'm good how are you in for having me on well\nI'm honored the new book is called the next millionaire next door in during the strategies for building wealth and it it's out this week right\nThat's right yeah it was a labor of love and I haven't either but you know it and like I like about it\nYou know if you guys didn't know her her dad passed in a car wreck or four years ago it was and I don't see that with the team that's right yeah well I'm just thinking I remembered that about there and\nI'm a we had had him on several times over the years as we discuss this whole subject to millionaires and\nAll of the some of the mythology litters around millionaires so you used some of the research from your dad's in Europe are professional researcher to like he was and uh and I put this together tell me about the background on that part of it what if this or did you do and more of it was combined the what he had done\nYet I think that that trade had we had worked together really on the initial survey for the buck on you know really started back in two thousand child thinking about the ... anniversary of the millionaire next door like he came out in their nineties and work together on kind of what books should include and\nBetween you'd research what were the ... was there anything that just shocked to win the findings were you should go out and see that one coming\nOut you know we worked a lot at um some of the mistakes so in that kind of behaviors that millionaires make related to investing and I think what the guiding was\nJust like any of us that are trying to do the right thing um and millionaires make mistakes along the way to ... to a lot of that sort of the behaviors and then the the ... the role that they make related to and I think that that was surprising and then I think what was surprising was that why hasn't things in terms of the kinds of\nOr rather the amount that they're spending on things like a furniture and clothing and things like that that some of those things are surprising that were sort of similar time\nYou know I was speaking in a church a couple of days ago and I told them one of the\nKey points that I've seen over twenty five years of doing this one to five things you have to do if you want to build wealth is you have to be careful who you hang around with because you become who you are running around with and she on the back of your book understanding how those around you influence your financial by ... what'd you find on that\nYeah absolutely I think that again you see it very clear from the work that we've done both with populations in and out every every day folks like I like\nThat they are um that that that social and different that not caring about what others they driving and buying and wearing the really key factor in building well you know it's related to network regardless of how old you are how much you make\n'em and I think you know now with technology it's really hard to ignore what other people arguing that social media and so forth but it continues to be back there are just not caring about what other people and you know as as as one of the wave itself well\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because one of the benefits of going broke like I did in my twenties where his violently was ... at that point I just reached all I wanted to do survive\nAnd thrive and reach a point I just don't care what people think I still don't care what people don't and I think there was a big contributor to me\nPersonally you'll be able to to build wealth again after going bankrupt but I see it with other people as when you don't care what other people think about what you drive where you live what closure where you've been on vacation you're not trying to keep up with other people's Facebook version of themselves then you've got the ability to win\nAbsolutely and I think like he said I think that that on Facebook version of that is a lot different right then what's really going on and I live here so that's something to keep in mind but we definitely see that and that research\nShe'll gaining knowledge and composer to invest in grow will that is a great word come closer to grow wealth what do you mean by that\n[noise] but you know when you say that related to make independent when it comes to our investments that it really you know you could apply to any kind of major financial decision they are making it matter to the kind of call yourself before making this decision so I Know the example we get sometimes there's\nGoing to rain but not a great time to go out and look for in a car because you're not a skier and an emotional state where\nYou are so excited about the new income level that you have all of a sudden your decision making it a little off so he can stay calm and come as a matter what the financial decisions are then you'd have a better chance of making the right one\nAnd I often here we've got a ... personality does a career show on you know choosing a career and there's all this stuff about following your passion out there\nBut you guys have you found yet again in this new set of data the idea that ate a lifestyle related freedom does not equate to less income or less welded actually ... to ... or will the new\nRelated freedom does not equate to less income or less welded actually which to greater engagement greater will then you're\nNot you know I think that's right I think that you know understanding that against your accent or or your entrance let's say for your career Hackney ground it and I'm kind of reality and and I think that that's something that\nYou know a lot of people don't want to hear but ... is trailing um if you had an accent or the art ... really where you live your career to go out and you know you take that with the reality that means if certain things are going to be satisfied\nThat kind of again ... ... a lot of I don't want to hear but I'm very happy to hear it and said they'll\nYou know there's a price to be paid to build wealth and it's worth the price and nobody does that accidentally they'll do it with a plan\nI lately yeah that that's one of the things that we can't thing over and over again and again we're talking about millionaires their on their way to becoming in there at that time bent planning and and looking at your goals and monitoring what's going on and you're alive and not\nYou know keeping your head and and um that that relate to building mouth and return it to it but in court and go do it while\nWe're talking with Dr Sarah Stanley follow all of a ... in your last night about offsite correctly\nAt la la la la la la la la yeah it's like\nThey told me about one on there and a strong mess it up there I'm so sorry for law and a daughter of Dr Tom Stanley a comic or called the millionaire next door a lot of you've read it if you add them ... should and you need to reach ... new book that she did combined with her ...\nResearch project that they were working on together when he passed away the new book is called ... millionaire next door it is now out and you need to read it or you know we've got a book out called a ... called everyday millionaire and let me start if you want to be a millionaire there's not one book you read all of them and you learn from everyone over there is no competition\nThat's where we answer on we've been friends with them for years we'd love that she's got a book out come in the same year that we do and we want love helping her we want you to go by this book right now it's called the next millionaire next door Sarah thank you for being with us today thank you kind of like am I mean\nThis is the Ramsey show [laughter]\n\n\n\n\nYou've heard me talk about our deep for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me in shows the real nightmare the people go through when they become a victim\nOf the sixteen million victims of identity the last year yes sixteen million twenty six percent of them have to borrow money from family or friends twenty two percent of them lost even more money by taking time off work\nAnd I'm like she knows my situation\nAnd she ... she will see that on open box and she will give me a lot of crap because she knows and I can't have that\nA good sister rules are actually [laughter] so I'm like before she gets here I'm signing up for a class and that was the\nMotivating factor so I finally got it so it's her fault for minimum wage to do her debt free scream you get shamed in the process that causes you

before I go and they say oh you're about to blow a tie rod and some other things that's about a thousand bucks and it's\nOkay thanks and so I just do that and then I go on to the Montana trip come back and came back in ... and uh my Lehman was also all of the tires were were just shredded and there are other things wrong so in a five week period I had twenty three hundred dollars\nWith a hari

I Am not a band aid off slowly guy that crap does not work and so what I Would do is I woke up in your shoes as I Would live on fifty thousand dollars a year or less\nWhich would make me debt free in under three years okay and then I Would start my life the great news is you have the ability to delay pleasure for greater outcome we know that because you've gone to school your whole freaking life\nMhm and you're very smart academically or you wouldn't be where you are okay\nYou have the ability to delay pleasure which is a sign of emotional maturity and you have a great intellect let you use those two things and apply them to this mess that you are in called deeply in debt now you can do it the other way but I'll tell you that\nYour colleagues are walking around out there\nCalled deeply in debt now you can do what the other way but I'll tell you this your colleagues are walking around out there with three hundred four hundred two hundred thousand dollars worth of medical school that for a decade because they play with it and they never kill the disease\nThe only way you kill it is extreme treatment\nRadical and that's the only way it goes away it's going to stay with you forever otherwise so that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes I Would treat it like I Am I broke doctor because I'm a broke doctor and broke doctors don't by fifty thousand dollar cars are going to develop more vacations\nSo you're not doing that crap anymore you get on a tight budget beans and rice rice and beans and clean up this mess because if you take the three year old older than you are now you and go forward with a three or four hundred thousand dollar income and no debt urine it'd be so wealthy it's going to be blinding\nIf you watch what you're doing\nBut if you just screw around with this thing and keep it like it's a pet it's going to be a problem for you Laurie is with us in Boise idaho Hi Laurie how are you\nHi Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up I'm at this point where I could be giving 'em\nYou can't fight now live there and my mom has been in a nursing home for ten years mhm and I moved here I suppose of and if she is in a very very small ram and have a large one and I was wondering whether that be considered give in\nTo help get her ... her semi path that ran and help pay for her cost of living\nTrue must have been giving 'em would it be typing no but it will be giving yes um I don't have I mean I don't know what you mean by giving but um you have the money to do this or you baroque or what\nNo I haven't been many pecan okay and you're you're out of debt yes okay\nAnd you have or how much money in your nest egg\nThree hundred thousand and how old are you having good very good okay what's your income about Ninety thousand cool you're single I'm Single and what are you talking about spending here\nIt will cost me about a thousand dollars a month\nOkay so twelve ran out of Ninety and you can keep saving doing that 'cause you don't need that you can keep investing so you retire with dignity and you can take care of yourself when you're in the exact same situation later right\nThat's what I Want to keep you want to keep you where you don't put yourself exposed to the elements so to speak by helping someone else but I think it's wonderful you have the money you've done a great job you're out of debt and you're in a position and you want to give twelve thousand dollars a year towards your mom's sure\nNo problem with that OK absolutely what do they\nWant to be the right thing and it and like you said about giving

live and the ... like no one else was very very cool\nTony is with us Tony is in a Washington Hi Tony how are you\nI'm well how can I help\nI was curious why you advocate a money market accounts are low yield accounts for like a murky coupon\nYour emergency phone is not an investment it's insurance\nA money market accounts are low you account for like a murky on\n'cause your emergency fund is not an investment it's insurance it's there the principal has to be there and accessible and liquid\nBecause if you're transmission goes out or you lose your job you've got to get your hands on it\nThe right of return is irrelevant it's insurance the ... of the things that does make you money to see what happens if people don't have an emergency fund act accessible and they got to set up in something where they get penalized if it comes out is not liquid and then they they have an emergency you know what they do\nThe bar owner four one K. long\nLike a four one K. along the ... the cash it out worse yet\nAnd they create a mess because I got to do that to save their house 'cause they didn't have money that was like what they got stuck because there were all worried about trying to make an extra point or two on the money instead of Kurt treating it like it's insurance insurance is ... is an expense\nMoney tied up at one percent you would agree is an expense because it sucks it's horrible right of return it could be invested in be making more\nBut that portion that five or ten or twenty thousand dollars or whatever it is is just sitting there just as a barrier\nBetween you and the life\nAnd that's all it's for it's not an investment it's insurance investments make money insurance costs you money to protect the things that make your money and this is insurance so a good
