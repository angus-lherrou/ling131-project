I deserve what's up in your world\nA so recently this week uh found out that uh my wife had kinda racked up about forty can a credit card debt behind the scenes of a kind of\nSlap to the face you know kind of found out this week this last weekend so pretty pretty tough to swallow\n... so she was hiding it from you\nYeah I'm ... and I you know I Can't just blame her I mean I I gotta take some credit because I never kind of went in and look and kind of a\nPaid any attention and this is the second time so about two and a half years ago and in the same thing and I kind of laid out a budget and then kind of slipped away from that budget and I think it was it just kind of roll back into it I soon to everything was going okay but it just kind of wasn't\nOkay so you gave her a all of\nThe responsibility of handling the money and you weren't involved in the money\nA hundred percent okay yeah yeah it is your fault yeah yeah um\nAnd it's her fault or but basically she was out of control didn't know what to do and uh just borrowed her way into a mess and\nNeither one of you had your head and the game\nCorrect okay\nSo ah are you already to stop the cycle I can show you how\nYeah a hundred percent and as a this this week and so there's a I don't want to say more\nTo the the problem with that kind of a solution but a on Wednesday this week I got a I received it twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance check that I haven't put in the bank yet because I wanted to wait until I spoke with you to see how I or go attack us I don't want to\nI don't want to do any other things I Want to continue I Want to start from scratch off the debt but I got to do it the right way\nOkay let me ask you this then it sounds like you're taking ownership for having kind of a dump this on your wife and abandoned her or is she taking ownership for the shame the\nFact she was ashamed and so she hid this from you because she didn't know what to do but she knew she was screwing it up\nVery interesting topic the topic of financial infidelity read but my guess into the service of thirty eight percent of you\nLie to your spouse about money [noise]\nWow\nAnd you wonder why your marriage isn't top on out\nIs uh Dawson [noise]\nNow I mean it can be a little white lies the target bags under the bed Snickers snake or write or or it can be big time credit card debt\nIt can be won over years running a business and is running up debt down at the business and not telling your spouse because you're trying to live your dream is turning into a nightmare [noise]\n\nLet me just kinda clarified this for you there is no positive effect to your marriage when you were allowed to your spouse\n[laughter] was that helpful you didn't already know that they do [laughter] well I'm trying to avoid it by ear you're all you're doing the cooking it up it's going to be a bigger fight once it cooks up [laughter] you see as whatever smaller by quickly so here's the thing\nIf you're afraid to discuss with your spouse [noise] a purchase\nOr a financial issue that you want to discuss that is not a financial problem that's a relationship problem\n[noise]\nNow I got to tell you there's times I I mean I I have a ton of money and my multi millionaires times though I think I Want to buy something and I'm going to sit down and talk show and hey I Want to buy this toy\nI Want to buy another gun she's like you don't mean again you have too many guns already people already would think you were crazy if they know what I mean under I collect guns by the way so\nYeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're going to find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something but I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so you know you don't need another car you don't need another ... you don't need another inner tube to pull behind the bar actually collect those I got too much too many like toys right\nOr for the grandkids and for the kids to play on and so you know I I get ready to buy a toy ... and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our\nBut I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked about this she gets ready to buy a purse it's too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys was too expensive but like she\n[laughter] ah well maybe maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know isn't it funny how as adults that have the money even\nWhere there is a lot of stress on the finances have it a little bit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your lives not there's the one of the seven habits says talk about money even when it's hard and it's almost always hard\nTo talk about it keep it clean and if\nYour spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas one is you've got a broken relationship and they are intimidated by you\nTo the spouse is an arrogant\nRebellious immature prints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with their lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child and the grownup body and goes and buys whatever they want to buy but know that it's wrong so they hide it from you\nMost often we find hidden that though is the what the guy was on the last call\nOne other spouses has been given all of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling well ends up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and now the shame is multiplied\nAnd it shame based hiding its guilty condemnation based hiding so they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job of handling the money\nIn which case if that's your spouse you are partially responsible just like that guy said he was he on that because he should have been more involved you shouldn't have dumped this on his wife and you shouldn't dump it all on your husband\n\nYou shouldn't dump it all on either one of your both of you should be involved no one ever you again can carry the ministry of weight once all the decisions are made but every body ought to know where every dollar is going\nPretty simple stuff [noise]\nSo you probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who it almost been on Oprah more than anybody Oprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we can get on I've been on every other show back in the day you know I've been on a sixty minutes I had been on Larry King remember Larry King was on the air\nAnd Sally Jessie Raphael you remember her with a red glasses you know all that I've been on all these different shows\nYou know everything out there and except I couldn't get on Oprah and they would call and teases so finally they call and we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah\nAnd the very first family of course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into\nA sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with\nOprah [noise] why would I Do that because Oprah was wrong [laughter]\nIs what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea\nAnd uh I had told the producers I said was partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not loving his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars if unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy hadn't got he he doesn't know what's going on under his own roof he's three can clueless when his relationship\nSo Oprah's reading the script and she's like and Dave you say that it's partially spoiled and he ...\nI'd agree with that and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology because he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand all over the debt and he don't even know what the flips going on under his own roof\nAnd she's like well he delegated it to her I said oh this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you're delegate in business you would always inspect what you expect\nYou would ever just walk away and hope it happened you wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that this is marriage is not a joint venture God did not say and now you are a joint venture he said and now you are one and these two are not one they're not on the same page and so\nYou know the poor lady sitting there crying because she's so ashamed and overwhelmed and the guys angry 'cause he's finding out he got eighty grand and debt that he didn't know he hadn't oh man they looked like a Jerry ... Springer episode or something and um you know and I'm a I'm ... I'm making him apologized to her for not being a\nGood husband because of your wife can run up your husband can run a\nHundred thousand dollars in debt and you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life or their or psychopathic liar\n[noise] one of the two but most of the time but you just did you just dump it on them and then and then you cry because they didn't do it right after you dumped it on them and walked away enclosed your eyes\nAnd what we'll do the ... well you know you thought but you didn't even care enough to get involved in what was going on\nAnd so Oprah's all upset with Dave goes Oprah was wrong [laughter] didn't work out what all the rest of the show what we got through it [laughter] so here's the rule of thumb then\nWe see couples who have a good marriage had been married ten years or Fifteen Years or Twenty years\nSit down and start doing a basic budget together where every dollar has an assignment every dollar has a mission every dollar as a name before the month begins on paper on purpose every month before the month against a unique budget it takes about ten minutes\n[noise] once you've been doing it a while but it takes about three months of doing it to get really on the same page and get a rhythm going [noise]\nWe see couples that agree on their spending before the month begins on paper on purpose increased their level of communication\nIncrease their level of cooperation\nIncrease their empathy for each other for the stress the other one's been carrying that they didn't even realize\nThey began to agree on their goals and their productivity with their money goes through the roof\nYou feel like you've got a raise when you learn to do this together on paper on permission before the month begins give every dollar a name that's why we named the world's best budgeting software\nEvery dollar give every dollar\nYou know there are more than two million real estate agents in this country two million when all you want to do is buy or sell a house you don't have time to sift through ads\nOn line or email twenty different people to find a few agents you want to interview our real estate EL peas have years of experience and are the top agents in their markets in fact\nAnd so God just begin opening those doors and we were able to pay off with a much quicker re a lot quicker than we thought because\nLike we didn't even mention in the beginning it was definitely very overwhelming I mean just looking at all the student loans we thought how are we going to pay this off are we going to get home do all these different things started family but um you know definitely go with our side and and of course you know he was able to open up those doors for us to get on the same page and be able to you know pay off this in a pretty good time\nYeah how how do you explain to other people because I Know I Know what the answer is but\nHow do you explain to other people the level of intensity that is required 'cause you guys I mean it was not panic but you were focused to the point that you sacrifice so deeply that normal people looking at you all had to think you lost your mind I mean you guys were on your game on\nAnd yeah I don't know where do you get that fire from was it desperation\n[laughter] yeah I think it was a ... mostly bad living with a stand in line with ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou think you know friends while auditioning for friends Cathy Griffin and Jane Lynch became actual friends while

he's in gamblers anonymous and he's seeing is pastor and he's seeing a a counselor and he's doing everything he supposed to do does that mean she just turns over the checkbook to him and let him go run havoc again no\nNo it's a matter of fact we recommend that when someone's recovering from an addiction like that\nThat that they not have control of and not have any access to money\nFor a while until trust us rebuild over time but ten years later ... should be rebuilt ten months later it should be better than it is now two years later or should we better than that it should per aggressively rebuild trust and so if ten years later you\nYou're still or you know you have not bet on a football game again you've not lost any money gambling again argue trustworthy at that point yeah as much as anybody else's and so we're\nNot going to treat you like you have no ability to handle money the rest of your life but for the short term yeah we're taking all access to money away from you too you prove that you can have a little\nBit absolutely but then gradually trust is rebuilt and over time it's rebuilt [noise] if you cannot when someone has [noise]\n\nOn something like we're talking about here has ... has not when when someone has demonstrated over an extended period of time that they're\nNot entering into the negative behavior\nAnd you can't forgive them and you can't begin to trust them in that area then it starts to be on you and two years [noise] clean if the guy's clean from his double life adult for survivors or whatever he was doing porn addiction whatever it was sound like it was all of that [noise]\nTwo years is a long time you should be some level of trust rebuilt assuming it's all real now if there's indicators is not real\nIf they're still looks like he's sneaking around if he still got behaviors that make everybody question whether there's a real then that's different but I'm assuming this guy straight and if he's great\nFor two years than you know it starts to be your problem if you can't begin to trust at that point especially given that his wife already she might just be an enabler she might be\nShe might be ... and that could be what's going on [noise]\nCould be\nThat he's cleaned up is alive and you're just suffered you can't forgive\nThe that's the difference there's a difference in forgiveness and reconciliation they generally happen at

E. they've got football they got cheerleaders cheerleaders\nGuy lockers man if I could get over to middle school I'd be happy then you remember that\nAnd then I was in middle school I got to be about the ninth grade and I was fourteen Fifteen Years old and one of my buddies got his driver's licence\nThat time and since then our income has gone down and we added another child and we've gotten into a credit card debt and they had a ... now and we can take the money out there even if it over the past three years without the\nChilly here that are hitting me ... path right that can leave that Ninety and continue contributing to their pre paid plan\nHow much is in there\n[noise] um about eighty six hundred\nEighty six hundred dollars and how much do you own your car we have a ten thousand and what do you own your credit cards off five thousand okay\nAnd um are you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nStarted at ... and that's and I realized that we did that they got out of order like having that Peter Pan ... played pan and then I don't know it could get its point\nGotcha okay I'm In your household income as well [noise]\nUm my husband makes twenty five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand give or take All right um no I Would not cash would stop adding\nTo it um and um you do need to get on a budget and policy with what you're learning in financial ... University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to it you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a new emergency\nOr no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college in a five twenty nine or an ESL and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plants here is the recent anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\nAnd so if I prepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of the increase in price 'cause that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an interest rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now\nTuition for the last Seventy odd years as average about seven point two percent\nInflation right\nSo that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent average annual return over that same period of time minded\nAnd so are you make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is\nA ... and it's a blanket statement but ... and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans in the process I mean they're just horrible administrators\nSome states are well run my state happens to be well run if I were in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current events\nAre you are well run my state happens to be well run so in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be\nConcerned today under the current administration with a with the stability of the ... still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say I would roll your eighty six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned to call to vacation because you're broke and you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt so you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things\nAnd that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas hey Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent or want to thank you for ... for a a help I was going through a ... for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ... to my question because this is a wonderful thing that's fixing to happen\nOr we were my family my parents have received an inheritance of mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a few oils but not not a time mhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter]\nOr over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell mhm and cash out or hopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom [laughter] and we want them out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly mhm\n[noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual uh oil prices that sustain a drilling a and and that's the only reason west Texas is struggling run our oil prices are so far down that there's no boom okay I mean when gas for five dollars a gallon it was a boom by you know what I mean\nBut uh and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does on turning on and off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue\nAll of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all to get just about everything I Know just in a [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell all those at all or none\nNo it's not an all or none ah what do you it's it's simply a they're looking at the three million for all the and or or you know obviously one point five for half\nOkay so you're just added on ...\nYeah and my biggest concern is the risk yeah and we are not oil people\nYeah I think I don't think I'm asking is women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling half\n[noise] we're deciding on how much to sell\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't\nKnow much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it\nI go by oil rights with it my answer would quickly be no mainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit\nPersonally okay but that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars by the kitchen table would I go go by what rights in West Texas where the if the answer is no then it's time to sell for the same reason I think you know that you wouldn't die and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know when we're afraid the stock market crash\nYeah well it might but I got to start getting less rock markets less risk than growing holes\nYeah we're hundred percent sure that you don't have I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be all person to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just sell like yours off\n[noise] you know this is I'm I'm helping my mother and father and make it to say\nOh I see so it's just they they can make the decision for the whole thing or not yeah All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least to sell Seventy five percent of it [noise]\nOkay I probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they're just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death of ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that you know if it struck out right after I sold it I don't regret it the rest of my life\nYou know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that\nSome advise set of families entire portfolio three million dollar networks we caught\nI wouldn't do that personally and if somebody asked\nAs a financial coach 'cause I knew that I Would\nI Would take the majority or all of that\nThe news to have a blessing like that\nThis is the ... [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just getting rid of\nIt they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share exit team they have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've accepted thousands\nInterest a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and I still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nThen you know going in the

following you and gave me some information and I had been struggling at the single parent and I just got a new job in the month of march and and I'm like I make enough income but\nIt's like I don't

car have eight thousand less so that's not bad\nBut your your take home pay three thousand is thirty six thousand a year so that means you're only making about forty five thousand before taxes is on right\nNow and go home at each paycheck is about and then something fell in love with a I make my twenty two hundred a month from my job and I get about nine Ninety ... till about three thousand of my\nYou know how it all in income\nOr a little over three okay there are well you don't have a lot of wiggle room here\nBut let's just let's stop a second because it sounds like you're paying bills

eat so you do your grocery budget and you set that money aside and then what's the next thing you know you pay your life in your water\nOkay then what's the next thing you do you do your you pay your

take ... right I don't know what you want to know and they don't even have that much left those are food um\nBut you know you've probably got twelve hundred maybe not let's just call it a thousand you know after you just you run those actual numbers right down the page child support plus my checks minus ... minus ah my my uh food bit budget whatever my set up for food\nAnd um mine is my rent minus my lights and water now I'm living and I've eaten and the kids have eaten before we do anything else out now we've got by a car payment or they're going to report that\nThing and we've got to put gas

for taking my call there sure how can I help\nI have a question are we are my wife and I are just getting started and baby step to\nUh we've got about Ninety thousand in and we currently have a three vehicles two of them\nAre mine that I use for work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have a\nCome your car that I use regularly on most days of the week but the truck I have to use one per week to go a trailer her car she owes about eleven thousand on and it's ... percent interest\nWe could probably get by just sharing my two vehicles [noise]\nUm but we just didn't know since the car loan or they're ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of some of the dead or should we or should we keep it because of course are among\nThe zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay all the eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off water all three of these cars worse\n[noise] um the truck is probably worth about ... to ... my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell her for about ten\nOkay cause one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them totaled up being more than about half your on your own income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value OK okay not violating that though so we're good\nThe second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nForty thousand good and how much debt other than eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\n[noise] uh we have about Ninety thousand [noise]\nOkay [noise] but that it that includes the cars and I went down in the car and what is the Ninety thousand on [noise]\nMostly student loans or we have some tax or a medical bills\nOkay so can you pay off forty five a year making one forty and be debt free in two years my answer would be yes\nYes and um that would mean that if you want to keep her car there's nothing on the line with keeping it but just off I mean we're not going to keep a bad ah regardless of the interest rate we're just going to get rid of it but you know so but if you told me you owe thirty thousand dollars on her car and I would sell it in a heartbeat\nUp on national news and the top stories maybe headline\nFirst flight weekday from seven to eight AM to protect Seventy [noise]\nFive to ... to a new job and we'll talk about your life and your\nMoney Taylor is with us in Hartford, Connecticut Hi Taylor how are you [noise]\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nAnd college planning for my one year old mhm\nI'm I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby step for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars cash mhm um I Know that other than my house\nUm which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I could Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have some you know equity in it\nUm and I had about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um so I'm going to be putting that into a chat five twenty nine I think for him and and kind of picking out some\nGrow stock mutual fund to kinda see where it goes from there ... um so my question is what are kind of my\nWhat do I deal with this kind of pile of cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses for\nFor um you know every any given monsters about twenty\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with their child so I'm pretty much the only income right now [laughter] um so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shake shack throw it towards my how little that every year or\nShould I put it someplace\nElse we teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation than if you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nUm and that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so at twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate\nAs adjusted an emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now uh what do you make\n'em so uh about Seventy eight year\nIs the household income yeah yeah okay\nAll right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a I had a pension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well\nI'll tell you that mandatory\n\nOkay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four one K. U. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have just opened up a rock or re ... with a better man which is one of kind of the rubble and high hundred\nMe I'm familiar with what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo are coming there they're they're doing pretty good but none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in a row boats at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time in a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do with some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would do just go to smart but\nSmart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the ... best in business I don't care what you do okay I don't think my income at all but people always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you you and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each ...\nUnless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there are fifty five hundred is eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded a Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds\nI spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stock mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a force in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and force in international now once you're doing that and you know the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got in and mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine\nOkay I just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that that's baby step three is fit or babysit force Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different being there in you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it and then once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget\nUh any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr what you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I'll find in my budget I'm going to keep jumping around that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years of this right that's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you don't or better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have ah currently two hundred and twenty three thousand a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty normal it's currently with a U.S department of treasury um it as a result of having been additional from a service academy or three years ago\nUm and the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously a much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um\nReason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact that will eventually end up any collections account if I'm not able to pay the amount that fall um\nYeah um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred two hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year also\nWhile so you learn you guys are on the other side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three in the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can 'cause you got wonderful income you'll be different\nTwo years\nAnd so what I'm going to just put this tonight for in the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can 'cause you got wonderful income you'll be different\nTwo years [noise] it's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start to untie thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money you're getting a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I have never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies\nGot this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYes or so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either ask that serve through in the service or you're assigned to the recruitment\nAnd um and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time and has forgiven\nAh yes or harbor in my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with this I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make\nAs an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid now because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago\nBut that never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January cook myself off of her checking account because\nHeart where I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs yeah and and so he wasn't in his right mind the rest\nOf my fellow so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to participate in her healing\nFinancially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a little ... to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent for mom of internally\nBut if you can get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual but to do that time I was there I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again\nBut you like going to see last time not because she was healthy but because she was unhealthy\nYeah and I'd like to get her up and running and healthy you know we've got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't she going to hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again ... ... you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that habit and those that love them but the good news is I have seen hey innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nOur now she only to the Medicaid if she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nWell there's you you don't want him just in a in a fall the rest of their life\nIs I mean they had control there she definitely has a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen yeah uh as as as early mentally ill and she is voices if she's not on a couple of different methods she does\nHer ... her only shot then is what we're talking about but our goal is to this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory can happen\nAnd it happens to people all the time though\nForty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nAnd it happens to people all the time so\nWhat does she say right now when they call her\nUp and so you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nAre you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you're just a you know because they're going to just I don't think I should be talking she should\nI be either one of your among them long conversation it's got nothing you get nothing because all they're going to badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs go and then we start negotiating and trying to work our way through the debt right\nWell my husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate\nAnd I are going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months how their their during our pliable\nToday but she's got no money and you're not given or any no\nSo they get nothing they get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nUntil let's say any show a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight and get their ... hey look at can we work at a deal\nYeah or you know they got Thirteen hundred bucks you ever seen any money in two years I'm no backup and work and again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that the settlement in full\nWill do it and get an in writing and no electronic access to your checking account because whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's a filthy industry\nAnd so you got to treat them like rattlesnakes 'cause they are\nCovering person here\nWho's going into a rattlesnake thin\nShe starts making some money\nYou got a warm weather emotionally on this\nBut you can you can give us a cheerleading ... without giving them money\nAnd I think you're right to do all of\nThere's good news show she can make it out of this was she makes a good choices [noise]\nOkay things are getting ... weird out there I thought the Equifax breach was bad enough it exposes the
