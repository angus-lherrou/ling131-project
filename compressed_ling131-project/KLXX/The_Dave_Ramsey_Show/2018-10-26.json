Amanda how are you\nI'm good how are you to have better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] I Am looking into starting the baby steps and my concern is that I have a son who just select soccer and that costs them money it's not too expensive but I don't feel like pulling the rug out from under him just because I've made mistakes so how would you suggest they handle that\n[noise] um what do you select soccer cause\nIt's only seven hundred and fifty dollars a year and not with all of his um uniforms and everything\nIn your household income is what I'm just under a hundred thousand okay and you\nUm uh\nYou have how much debt Seventy five thousand [noise] okay um\nI mean it's not a deal breaker and seven hundred and fifty dollars and the thing that sharing and I did when we were looking at things like that was we would if we found one thing like that that we were going to\nNot cut to hit our debt free go we had to find something else we're going to cut deeper okay\nSo like that means that if you were going to cheat and go out to eat once a month now you're not got ya or the if you thought you were going to do X now you're not man it's hot jak instead we're doing select soccer\nUm and how many kids do you have three okay and is he the oldest or the youngest or he sold\nThe oldest okay All right and um well I mean you get yourself out of debt and the other kids as they come up can do you can do whatever you want to do with them in terms of uh you know activities in sports and stuff you can afford to do all of that the thing that we decided was that all of this is for fun [noise]\nBecause um I mean Daniel my son played ice hockey all the way up through high school we knew at six years old he was not going to play in the show\nRight we we're pretty sure at that point you know and uh so we made decisions to invest in ice hockey to have fun right\nNot because we were trying to create a future career for him\nRain and not play we went with the way that there are a couple of different options and when we put Atlanta's less than half the cost of the others yeah\nYou know and you know so parents go bananas on this stuff is my point and uh some of them you know they spend ten thousand bucks on whatever and you know in a sport that the kid is never going to go pro probably not even going to get a scholarship\nDuring the day room\n... is with us in Jackson, Mississippi horrible how're you\nDoing very well thank you for taking my call I'm sure what's up [noise]\nWell how are they ... is that um there's three in the household and my husband and myself and um my dad passed away two years ago so mom on the\nLine with us [noise] so um because she couldn't make it on her own so we just kinda combine our income [noise] um our monthly income with three of us combined is thirty four hundred and forty two dollars I've done the everyday dollar budget and\nWe're like forty seven dollars I'm not over budget as things stand now um\nWe had back in January we had some identity theft going on in our account and that that that is almost twelve to Fifteen hundred dollars in the ... that the bank to far overdraft and stuff so that really does\nI mean why why did the bank charge you\nAnything if there was a unity\nAnd be it well it was ... that was charged to our account\nI Know but if it's identity of the bank shouldn't be charging you anything\nWell they did and they said there was nothing they could do about it a lot can change banks\nYeah we did okay wait we actually closed banking and we just have a debit card that um it's like one of those little Walmart charge you know so we don't even go through the banks anymore\nIt's just a debit card but um they charge us like six nearby six hundred dollars in overdraft mhm and they wouldn't take them back mhm but I'm here in that\nTime because that was going on we got behind on our house payment\nAnd I'm a couple of more thanks for the smaller next that we had well without the smaller nights but we're still have a hand on our house opt out to the house and loan people and they're working with us but we're having to pay extra a month on our mortgage payment\nSure how old are you guys fifty nine\nI'm fifty nine and a thick the mom Seventy nine\nOr you guys on some kind of a fixed income for some reason\nAnd none of you were able to work no I Do a little fad business with crafts and things like that\nOne is the nature of your disability\nIs I think what's wrong with him down as it gets back uh-huh and as a um a sense that bone begin close is fat mhm\nThen he also had a trip back surgery\nA few years ago when he had a female later and he's got like twenty five percent of his heart mhm mhm okay\nWell what what you guys have more than anything else is an income crisis right due to the fixed income and that's why I was exploring the question that does sound like you've got some pretty serious limitations\nUm but what I'm going to do if I'm In your shoes is what you've kind of started doing there with the crafts\nAnd even in his shoes are obviously none of you all are going to be involved in physical labor of any kind of crime but if there was something that you could\nDo like I talked to a lady the other day who was just going to garage sales and she was buying clothing for a quarter and a nickel and showing it on ... for a dollar and two dollars and she had done that like ten thousand times and made like ten thousand dollars mhm\nOkay and that didn't involve any heavy lifting obviously it involve the keystrokes on the computer to set up an ... account and sell some stuff on ... I'm not saying that's what you do I'm just saying that something like that that is\nThat that that is in the line with the limitations that you guys have because if we can add a thousand dollars a month only your world it would change your life\nWouldn't it it will be dramatic and how old is mom mom Seventy nine\nAnd how much of this thirty four forty two comes from her\nEleven forty seven yeah\nShe passes away you don't get a real problem correct\nSo we've got to solve some of the income issue one way or another here um and how much is your house payment\nOn a war for Seventy eight they increase\nIt with that kind of that's on your that's just due to taxes and insurance going up ...\nNow and what's the home worth it for a ride at a hundred and on July of ... we only ... only want to go to this you know I sure would be good when you know\nSo I think more than anything that the the magic wand here is some kind of an idea for you to create some income and I don't know what that is what I Want the three of you to sit around and talk about what you could do a ... you're obviously not going to do\nAnything this physical I get that you got some serious limitations I understand that\nAnd I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help you uh but it man a thousand dollars a month would change your whole life thousand dollars a month for a year and you pay that house off and that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem\nAnd right now you being a serious problem two thousand dollars a month income change\nYou feel like you were rich like you were multi millionaires or something it would change your life that much\nAnd so in is that possible yes that is possible it's very possible but you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or whatever and again it doesn't I don't want\nSome things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or whatever and again it doesn't I don't want to put a bunch of strain on you physically but um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation with you over the phone so you can have an intelligent conversation with somebody over the phone sell them something\nRight and that that's possible thing you can do um the the you know and it doesn't cause you to\nWork forty hours a week necessarily but if you can do anything that creates a thousand two thousand dollars a month it would change your world and that's\nThat's really what I Would work on rather than try to solve the forty seven dollar problem that you've got what that is just symptomatic of the fact that you're struggling with income\nAnd legitimately ... you're struggling it's my pleasure lazy or something like that but it just hand if you could come up with any kind of a small business idea that your husband than you could do together um and just get them to get the needle to move a little bit here\nAnd it would change everything for you\nAnd thank you for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Benjamin is in Oklahoma City Hi Benjamin how are you\nToday how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so my wife and I graduated college about a little over a year ago and we got a good job good and bought a house good and I'm Wondering in your eye on what are we paid off about half the ... and ...\nAnd your eyes or your parents away from a financial perspective is a good time to start thinking about having kids 'cause she likes getting kind of pushy and you know that it I'm sure mhm ah so I just wanted to get your thoughts on it\nNow I was actually the one on a kids' faster than sharing a shot of several she won but um [noise]\nUh I I don't think that there's a financial manager other than just being completely crazy like if you don't have sixteen kids if you're broke that stupid okay that was crazy but you guys are in great shape your sharp young couple whenever you're ... whenever you're emotionally in relation to ready to have kids and God says it's okay to have kids\nDon't have kids I I don't I don't tell people that need to be out of debt and have their emergency when there's not a baby step for kids\nUm you know you're not going to be a certain place you're going to be fine a child is not going to destroy your life financially or as a matter of fact you probably won't even hardly notice\nEverybody talks about oh children ... five hundred and sixty two thousand dollars to raise you out really not really they eat the same broccoli you eat after a certain point\nThere in the in the same warm house you're already in after a certain point and so the actual cost of a kid is just not that\nIt's not devastating\nBut again you don't want to just load up a whole house full of them if you're broke and that that will cause a problem\nBut to decide to have your first couple of children\nI mean it's that's not something that's between you and God and your wife\nAnd you guys are in good shape you financially smart you're already moving in the right direction\nYou want to start now it doesn't bother me at all\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nDid you know that if you combine that data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every American had their personal info

not know available on screen crushed dot com [noise]\nThank you for joining us America ... is with us in Singapore\nI'm doing quite well thank you very much and good afternoon how are you going to get a better than I deserve how can I help [noise]\nYeah so our first of all like to thank you for everything you're doing a sense of listening to actually have a few dollars truck together great\nUm my question is basically about I'm a ... a voluntary retirement scheme that I'm as an Singapore so I can put up to thirty five seven thirty five thousand seven hundred dollars a year and I would get tax relief on that\nOr the calendar year ... which translates to about four thousand dollars a ... ... now I Want to take half my emergency fund\nAnd put it into that account because I might not reached a thirty six thousand just cash flow and get something my salary\nMhm [noise] what are the penalties\nFor ... shoot I Do that one of the penalties for withdrawing I don't read for ...\nYeah it's about fifty for a ... percent on taxes are but I I really don't need\nAnd fire emergency fund I currently have thirty thousand I'm a picky picky and fifty thousand and put into that I can rebuild my return my emergency founded about three months\nIf you don't need it why would you rebuild it\n[noise]\nI mean I don't have to have all the thirty thousand I just built that because I feel very comfortable with having that as a cushion right and what is your income a year\n\nAbout a hundred and sixty\nOkay so what is three to six months of expenses\n\nIt is about joining the three thousand\nOkay that will ... that'd be three months or six months that will be six months okay right so you can\nProper amount to have in your emergency fund there's thirty thousand dollars and the answer is no don't drain it down because this is not an emergency you use emergency funds for emergencies period if the proper amount to have in your emergency fund\nWhich means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later\nSo you decide what the proper amount in an emergency fund is when all the smoke clears but don't tell me you're using your emergency fund to fund this and then you're going to put it back\nWhich tells me you don't agree you know you've got it in your mind the proper miles thirty grand I think is what you're saying and so the answer is no don't put the money and retirement [noise] don't use your emergency money to do that but if you're willing to reassess your emergency phone and say I've got this thing over funded\nI'm going to back it down in the twenty range than I might go ahead and do this deal a because we're not there but but if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies\nAnd don't monkey with it is merge and she found this is just foundational before you move on to investing of any kind so you got to decide your definition that's what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash one and it sounds like emotionally given the unusual situation that you are and you want to keep thirty grand around\nAnd so you should keep thirty grand around sets it don't mess with that but if not if you're going to permanently lower it then use some of that money to do this then hey I'm just fine with that a cage is with us in Salt Lake City Hi cage how're you\nHey Dave how's it going better than I deserve what's up [noise] hey thanks for taking my call today I'm I'm a college student I'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance um\nBut the more that I go through school and the more that I listen to you it makes me want to I'm really make a living being a financial coach dresses in many years ago and still here today [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I wanted to get your advice on whether you think it still possible or somebody like me to run this type of fitness that maybe you're biased on [noise] the basket and this model to maximize success on the early going up starting\nTo well the um you know see based financial coaching where you pay someone pays you a fee just to sit down and do one on one coaching which we do some here and we ... we we have a program where we certify people that do that that comes to our training to do that\nIs it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that\nUh because it's it's very much uh the inventory is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours in the day for enough money to equal a good living\nAnd I it can be done but are coming straight out of school difficult to do\nI'm not saying that can't be done but I'm just saying it's not it's not a slam dunk okay it's not an eighty thousand dollar your job your first or two years out\nIt's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side and work with someone like one of our smart Mr prose as an example and those guys are in the business gals are in the business of selling investments\nAnd there's nothing there's ... there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact that it's almost paramount that you do coach people while you're selling them an investment so that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're selling some on a home near coaching them into this house is gonna you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is is a really awful\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're selling so I'm On a home you're coaching them and this house was gonna you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is is that really out of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that you're in a sense your financial coaching them and so but you get paid a commission when they buy a house\nAnd so uh you know this idea that some people have that everybody gets paid a commission has a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd\nThere's plenty of people on strike commission with high levels of integrity that do the right thing so you might explore\nThat angle because truthfully you can make more doing that then you can\nJust doing a ... billion by the hour and I'm not saying making more as the whole answer but you know as a as a young guy coming straight out of school as a financial coach you probably don't have to get a little bit of miles on your before people are going to trust you\nYou know I could be I mean there's some people trust you and if you're really good you know you're no you're stuff than you'll you'll get business\nBut uh I'm just saying it's it's a tough road to just do what we did back in the day and it's one of the reasons is not is one reason we quit doing that as our exclusively but we did you know we started doing events we start having a class where we started\nDoing other stuff to go with it um because it's difficult to make a scale up when there's only so many hours in the day you can bill out at an hourly rate\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Amy is on Facebook dot com slash day Ramsey they'd do you put all of your rental properties into an El Al seat yes I Do as a matter of fact I no longer own anything

management thing but I actually I actually don't anything I'm pretty poor personally [laughter]\nExcept that I Want all those companies that on all that stuff so that's okay I guess but I mean it's a

this the better your estimates are going to be because once you've did battled with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing it what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in as a budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand or the duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month\nIf it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know\nA\nWhatever a line in your budget for medical expense ongoing chronic medical when just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money

well ...\n[laughter]\n\n\nThanks\nTwo to five Andy and Trish are in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped\nBy cars that were in the neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska [laughter] it's not really but thanks for coming by guys are you have an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go there we're going to retire from our jobs and laugh in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n[noise]\nThe camp will be a the the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... ... all and we'll be rented or on we currently on that property currently on that property and we'll be living on at a\nTime and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of\nYou know you need to get with insurance broker and what kind of our insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I Would be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the time that they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or you and the company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\n'em things that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest\nBusiness so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying as a treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of interests people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it they might but you wouldn't want by there even if it is so huge that you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you how that how the liability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means in insurance where they find somebody that writes your policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs this much and this kind of a company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it caused this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that\nCan you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing you want is liability do do hold harmless agreements a carry any weight in any of this\nUm no I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\nThe ...\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from ... you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was right and then one of the cabins okay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless you you are liable for that\nUh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh and because we didn't\nYou know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a hall Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called ... those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk I but I hold harmless is\nIt what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps on his people honest right it's like do you know you\nAre you are walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you trip\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not have to write him a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nUh and it'd be proven that you are liable regardless of the hold harmless but I\nI Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and having attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but you know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition owns\nWheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles use on these two page documents that are often Brenda about how if you die you're not that they're not liable they're still level\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you hey thanks for the call and you're you're joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll talk AAA eight to five five two to five All right Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm Dave how are you better\nThan I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a Christian and I'm a new American I Apologize if this is something that you've touched on a white um so I'm new to the baby step and I know that number wine you'd have to eat out a dollar\nA emergency find my question is do you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing to happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid\nFungus funding and how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would dare okay he's in an unstable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry I'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years and never happened I mean really lucky we never been laid off from place to go in and they get home pretty quick I mean within a\nCouple of weeks she'd have a couple of weeks to do something and he's going to work\nOn something when he comes home if they did get laid off so\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I Would push paws on hold them want to make a little baby step thing and just pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program that functions like a membership\nClub think of it like Costco you join for a small yearly fee and you say big every time you use it I'm Talking discounts on all\nAnd I do that first in Ross IRA and then I Do it in a Roth T.
