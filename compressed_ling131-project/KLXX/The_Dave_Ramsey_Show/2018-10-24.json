insurance and see what they can write you\nWe're in the process of having them do that kind of a double check\nOkay on dry out or something yeah because you know every day that goes by you're going to be more and more trouble in your situation so that's great news just ... hopefully as a short lived a issue\nOkay because in other words I think I think you're gonna be able to get insurance I just don't know exactly when or what it's going to cost that's the other thing you've got to look at your door and he could be unreasonable but I'm diabetes is a real tough\nDiagnosis for life insurance really tough so um anyway\nThe answer to your question overall is if someone's uninsured people yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental\nThere would be your cause a except that you've had the diabetes issue um but otherwise I mean you statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidental death as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kind of gimmick insurance is what it is a\nDefinitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay you know to the very last moment and if you're a term ... is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nNo I have not I didn't know about those\nSometimes they do\nAh sometimes it's very very expensive um but again you might be worth it or if you've got a non medical renewal it may just jump way up like triple or something what you're paying now kind of thing um so would you have like a ten or twenty year term it's run out\nA purple eight to five\nFive two to five\nChelsea is in Los Angeles how Chelsea how're you\nDoing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up in your world\nI had a question for you in regards to um\nOur the papers the salary ... my husband has traditionally trick condition but where they're going to be giving him a pay raise but with that pay raise their I'm saying that he also has that are going to be transitioning him into salary pay she usually works between five and twenty hours of overtime each week\n'cause I Want to make sure that when he they haven't given him an are far more accurate yet but when they do want it to make sure that how would you how would you recommend\nCalculate whether that the salary rate is comparable with sample the hours that she was working before and the pay that he would get what overtime\nOr somebody will be simple you've been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that and overtime correct correct answer what was his income last year including the overtime with about forty thousand and how will that compared to the salary\nBut that's the kind that we don't know yet\nConservative shower ... salary is fifty that's raised if the salary is forty five and the same number of hours or expect to be work its effect of Lee or pick up\nRight\nYes because that makes sense it's like yeah like as we were I was kind of weird because it's just more of us were in the ... member too mhm I Know that he has the potential to work more hours so because of that I was kind of\n... but the question the question and it's not just more hours the question is is this a good deal for him apples to apples not a ... and ... and has he got the chance to move up in the company because he moved to salary\nYes he's going to be listening to the management because it shows\nBut I mean further up later oh okay but let's say they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary while we'd be dancing wouldn't we yeah okay\nAnd I'm working the same number of hours you know it's like it's almost like you picked up more hours but didn't have to work on usually what I'm saying but it but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did in my favor and it's a ... and he gets paid forty but he's working in the same number of hours where he's working when he's making forty eight then that's not a blessing\nYeah it's just making sense to you yeah that makes sense\nIf it's even if it's forty eight to forty eight we still like the salary because of the upward potential\nOkay\nLong term it's a long term good career movies moving into leadership and the management and that's where he wants to head towards long term\nBut um [noise] ... you know\nYes but but again you just compare it to last year's income so the whole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand\nWhat's this hour because that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently Chris is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how are you\nI'm doing good day thanks for taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nUh well right now I'm a I'm like income about thirty one thousand dollars a year I got a fourteen hundred dollars in credit card debt a battle eleven thousand a student loan debt that ah that that about six months ago was\nRight about Nineteen thousand I've been working working hard and save money and paying it off as much as I can good\nOr not it cooks right now I came up with the idea for an invention ...\nAnd I don't know whether to keep you know steam rolling my debt plan and doing all that are just\nYou know kind of jumped ship and say hey this is something that could you know be my future and potentially mhm\n[laughter] so I'm kind of want a you know maybe your financial advice from you know what to do with the remaining dead I have and yeah my aspirations [laughter] because I'm In the process I've been have into a\nV a home loan and I was just about their so any advice you can give me I'd be greatly appreciated right\nWell I'm going to avoid buying a home until I got the debt cleared the only question is then how can we start working on the invention idea and make some money now 'cause we don't need to make a a bunch of money five years from now we need some money to a day\nWhen I'm twenty thousand dollars today show the invention you came up with as a physical product\nYes sir they say a odor the odor either slash a mold a little small machine that um [noise] people getting on their home\nOkay and you've made one\nI just made a very um rudimentary proud of the ... the next the next phase I got is like either the at the end of my rainy day fund started coming in my regular cash flow and like mine a computer and get my three D. modeling\nAnd get me a couple of silicon prototype so I can go you know take it to a you know take the next level or what I Want to do\nSo again ... jump off my my debt plan more do I have a kid my invention [laughter]\nOkay um well what you're talking about you could spend anywhere from twenty five dollars to a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it there's really no in between them and you can just go anywhere you want to go with this there's a lot of money to be spent on something like this\nAnd if you were a billionaire and you you know you ... what you would do is you would build a couple of them and you get them out there and test them and make sure that they work and that there was a market for it before you went into production\nBecause you don't go into production on prototypes that our own tested or from an R and D standpoint or you don't go into production on something that I've got no more\nBecause you can let you make a hundred thousand of them and having them in your basement or if you had unlimited sums ever be able to show\nYou know ... I'd like trying to ah continue to do with the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one and let's find somebody to put one in there in the property and a commercial applications\nAnd let's say let me give me just let's just make up a pretend example okay\nHere would be like your ideal thing you build one or two in your garage and you'd convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the ... the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works\nAnd if the idea works then and what I'm going to want you to his place in order for ten of them or thirty of them or a hundred of them for ... for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside the test it and then if they place that order they just place in the closet with large enough\nTo build the order ... and it finds itself that's called organically cash flowing something\nIn other words you you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order with enough of a deposit to feel to manufacture your first order out\nDo you think I should dial down uh my ... been all my extra capital towards paying off my credit card debt and my student loans that\nI don't think you have time and much capital on this you've already you already built one in the garage yeah build another one [noise] okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right [noise]\nWell I keep it in that but I I just see I'm going to protect us I Want it to be you know a good good looking kind of\nThat's it's a ... there are no protections [laughter] very they're very purpose of a prototype despite all the crap that's broken\n[laughter] gonna get it perfect you're going to put it out there in the in the marketplace is going to kick it around and you're going to learn foreman function changes informing function changes in this which has to be on that side of this which has to be made out of this has been to that and you're only going to learn that if you beat up about a hundred of them but let's get two of 'em in somebody's restaurant\nIn there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later are two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got um you know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got to have the ... I'm ... and then they give you enough money [noise]\nAnd they're a deposit for the initial order for you to do your\nManufacturing and basically you got almost nothing out of pocket [noise] except your brain power and your sweat\nAnd that's how a lot of these things get off the ground\nWay a lot of people lose a lot of money on them is they go into mass production before somebody approve a new marketplace where the actual voting\nYou're talking to a guy who's lost money that way the stupid stuff so [noise] do easy man go easy this was the day Ramsey show\nFor years and one of the most asked

Would say the other thing that you know God was great to us throughout the process and one of the things we were constantly communicate about is\nWhat does it looked like when we're debt free like that go what's that dream which that's the thing we want to do small goals along the way and then the long term goal you know one of our small goes again we discover you right when we got married so

change it\nAnd this is the day Ramsey show\nI get asked all the time about what people need to do to improve\nTheir families money situation to the most overlooked things are term life insurance\nAnd disability insurance both plans make sure that you have income to pay bills and take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen preterm life you need to carry ten to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most families stay away from\nCash value or return a premium plans there just a rip off disability insurance is just as critical how are you going to pay your bills or if you're unable to work disability is the leading cause of bankruptcies foreclosures that's why I send you those and\nTheir insurance they've been helping my listeners

puck across the ice found ... alone in the right wing circle he one time at home in the ... nothing after one\nThat lead Vermont out ... deep into the second fear but the bobcats got even a novel lucky bounce when Semmelweis he dumped the puck hard around into the mine out zone it bounced off of gold tender Nick grab go straight to the side of the net Tim Piazza gravity tabs in tied the game was Seventy seconds left in the period\nAnd less than a minute later Jacob ... struck\nA during a four on for a while delayed penalty was on the way to my not Julian temperate found Marty streaming up

or tied the game and sending it to overtime\nIn overtime another power play golf or mind that did you attend Brandt on a broken play better puck at MIT air and and and the bobcats felt free to to an overtime but took\nAaron Nelson brand and we'll down hunters Shepard will all Rick Ryan you on a now Johnny Roberts fourteen straight years with one or more goal is on a team committed the what ... what do you think when you hear that number [noise] well I like it [laughter]\nI bet you do position that I played so um\nYeah I mean it's pretty pretty special run there and uh you know it's um\nI don't know it's been it's been it's been a lot of fun to work with a [noise] um you know the majority of those guys and and and see I'm you know where they've where they've gone and obviously Ryan and\nUm you know getting a crack in the American hockey league in in a you know as recently as hunter shepherd when national championship so [noise]\nUm you know it's a um it's a one position that I that I Know very well and and and and I'm able to relate to so you know I think it speaks volume when a when you can talk to somebody or or go over a goal that uh [noise] um\nYeah you know maybe maybe you felt could have done something differently and and I think it's a [noise] it's um it's it's tough to explain until you been in that position to even a goal tender and um you know I think it's a um\nIt's just it's a it's one of those things where you know growing up here um my goal tending coach uh passed away last week and in my Kaylee and\nUm it's when you when you when you go back on things and you think of why it was a good goal to enter and\nUm he was a reason and um you know he was a reason why there was a lot of good gold centers coming out of Bismarck if you look at it are back in the day and I think that's one of the things that that I can give back to a ... or any gold tentative steps in our program is is I even if it's advice\nUm the game has changed all we know all that sort of stuff but uh you know we still have my beliefs and what I was taught and\nUm you know to have that day to day basis with with with your goal centers I guess ah it's invaluable\nThe other number that we've been talking about in the office I talked with dared about it today and you and I have talked about it a few times but it is October twenty fourth\nJohn Roberts committing the one next seven players on the active roster right now not even counting the lungs out there that may be closing in on a commitment but seven current bobcats committed division one before Halloween wow\nFor it's a pretty good I mean it's a I just think it's where it's where the leagues on I mean it's a you know you [noise]\nUm I feel like you're you're viewer a literally a pulling teeth I'm no pun and that one\nUm get to the tooth pulled today's uh for the show he literally couldn't help his not so he's been a real trooper so top marks of this guy right here um you know it's a it was like pulling teeth to get a to get one or two or three kids committed and um\nYou know I think you've seen the you know my uh my first year as an assistant coach with fire and uh that team was pretty special and the amount of the amount of commands but uh it would have seen the scene the league from\nFrom there I'm as a whole\nAnd the amount of the amount of commands but ah ... the senior league from\nFrom there I'm as a whole ...\nAll the all the all the teams are in coaches and staff had done such a great job but I think it's just a respect the league is getting now I mean it's a you know you you have the usa Joan and uh that to me there's another league that ah\nThat compares to to us right now it just uh the amount of commitments is is uh is getting to be um to a level that\nI I guess you could sit there and say well do you think you'd ever get there I don't know I mean it's a it's gotten to be a the opportunities that we can do these uh these young guys is a pretty special and it's it's crazy we look at\nOver the last ... years since that two thousand nine two thousand ten team with the fourteen commit last year was the first year there are more than five guys\nOn the active roster who wound up with the visual commitment that with a weapon last year which was a crazy high number and the teams are tracked you had to match and possibly surpassed that\nBut before that no team had between rather two thousand and ten and two thousand Eighteen no team and had more than five active players ah it's crazy to think about some of the great teams that have come through here

I'm\nSitting in for their brands in the shower and joined by Rachel cruise we're taking your calls about money life career\nIs what we talked about um become Coleman show and the Rachel proof show we're here for you\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five somebody calls a day you need some help you need some clarity today's did they make the call now\nBefore we went to the break I told you that I had some shocking information Rachel I cannot I'm beside myself all the excitement to let you react to the people don't notice you and I love a good spirited public conversation you know whether it be politics sports legit we enjoy a\nGood or say if we can have another radio show that wasn't working for the money in Korea as attorney that we have a current event will be good so she is a current survey yes\nAll right now here's or at least set the scene as of June two thousand Eighteen according to the Federal Reserve\nIn America the consumer debt was three point eight seven trillion dollars oh that's a lot of debt or to the point that some Americans responded to a survey from my bank tracker\nAnd it's a small percentage but when you look at the total amount of Americans is going to blow your mind and here are the basic freedoms here me when I say this folks\nBasic freedoms that these people were willing to forgo if their debt would be wiped clean or reading high camp here we go [noise]\nTwo point four percent of Americans that's about six million\nAmericans get don't they present it let's see like ... million so that they again six million ... million Americans said\nThey would be willing to give up their freedom of speech if you took their [laughter]\nWe have a\nStudio audience in the lobby of a financial piece plaza Ramsey solutions Roy headquarters there shaking their head ills that are really nice to be able yeah there's a guy out there with the Georgia had all I Know how you feel\nFamily you know not have the freedom to choose not to further away for a family work and pay off debts you're just using that you're just like he was all freedom you're ... food\nYou know let's let's break this down for a minute we're having fun with this\nBut but I I I Want you to jump in on this so these are people there's there's three point five million Americans who are going I don't want to sacrifice cable TV on sacrifice going out on an as a vice you sports I don't want to sacrifice my rent a couch I don't want to sacrifice my effort to fifty it's costing me seven hundred bucks a month\nOr I don't want to sacrifice that\nTo get out of debt through Dave Ramsey ... I Want to go to jail I'll go to jail\nBefore that ... or ... or a three point five million dollars who have not heard of the baby says or does nobody they just truly I've lost all hope that they will never ever ever ever got out of it\nYou just hit the point they walked out so they think I'll go to jail and then when I get out of jail I don't have any data\nThat's it because they may I I Want to believe and my the glass as half full cup that there is London glass as half full cup that's not right now wants to have full I get asked Georgia go down to opinion what do you think about that in the lobby\nHe's like this he literally put his hands up and looked at these guys should I what I Want to believe in my optimistic view yes\nThat three point five million Americans this is an optimistic but that they just don't know that they can sacrifice lifestyle you can make different choices you can live on a budget you can take out an extra job for a short period of time and pay off that data is\nBut the sad thing is that they I've read like that they've just lost hope they don't think you're ... you're exactly my hope I hope that someone someone doesn't say I would rather not I'd rather not give up cable and go to jail because in jail didn't have cable in jail [noise] no I don't think so I mean I don't know\nI think it's limited and it's like murder she wrote for Thirty years ago so here's the foreign Dave Ramsey has a plan so we're having fun with this crazy stuff but the reality is if you're joining the show today and you feel that loss of hope you feel that\nDesperate that your basic freedoms you would give up your basic for and\nWe've got a plan is called Dave baby steps total money make over walks you through it joined the show the conversation on a daily basis take inspiration from the men and women that are showcased every day on the show do their debt free scream\nWell and on this show and the right to cruise shall we always have a couple of come in and share their story and when I left in it and it's ... you're listening to what you\nIt's it's everyday average Americans that's where these people don't make crazy incomes they don't have like a Superman Cape like no these are everyday people but choosing something different this room and that's it you have to choose something different for a different outcome and so that's that's the power in it but again anyone out there you can do is\nDrinks doable AAA eight to five five two to five is the phone number that is how it started to take the step today triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Eric who's on the line and Kansas City Erekat can wield\nHow's it going good how are you sir\nGood um so I have two options I'm a registered nurse and I'm not going to grad school either nurse practitioner scores see aren't a school\nWe owe a hundred counter housework is free otherwise um we have a four month old and we're looking at having a second baby and the next year\nI'm In the school like a cash flow and work fulltime through high school would be a little bit longer it's about a five year program and totality a budget prerequisites and and I could not work two to three years\nAnd the dead of that would be Ninety thousand dollars at the end of it\nAnd so I mean the payouts are different obviously in ... make a hundred K. give or take a journeys may be one Seventy five\nDo you really want if all those money things weren't an issue and you had the responsibility of the wife and the children in the house and all that which one would you want if you could snap your fingers\nAnd one if all those money things weren't an issue and you had the responsibility of the wife and the children in the house and all that which one would you want if you could snap your fingers\n[noise] [laughter] it's hard for me to personally answer just because there was a manager than disadvantages to [noise]\nUm I don't think I Would take it away and they are in a more right okay but I mean I Would be happy as empty as well\nOkay so the question becomes a can you take that next step or what do you call it the ...\nIs that right yeah nurse practitioner okay\nIll okay in ... and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\nNot without going back to that tree or program and doing the same prerequisite\nFlight but my point is let's say you're in ... for five to seven years and you've got a no debt you may even pay your house off in that time and so you can cash flow your way through that as you move up the ladder how old are you\nTwenty nine\nYeah I just wonder can you do it just logistically can you do if you go into the in the situation you're going to casual that so no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to cash flow your way through that ultimate role [noise]\n\nI'm really not hearing what are you making now [noise] sixty\nOkay so you'd have a forty grand bump basically a year with that and how much is ethical caustic and he said that you the cash flow\nOr that one would be forty K total and the other one is nine thousand correct correct\nYou could you just start bump that salary honestly\nAnd go and do that is forty can invest that but you're going to make forty came back in a year the Atkins right if you do that I Know from the point is that many years have at that and then go back to school yeah you may not be able to do it and that other school right now like you said that you don't the cash for it so now don't go into student loan debt for that\nBut go ahead and go through the school get an upgraded job upgrade basically and you enjoy other one in a sense that's an increase in income at least\nAnd yeah and then move into the school and a few years and ... you know\nThat ... I just want you to have that idea in your head I think well you\nPause you're sitting there trying to run the numbers and I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there's a ladder to that ultimate goal might it take you seven or eight years yes but guess what\nEight years from now you're thirty seven [noise] you can cash for your way so I think it's both fans that's what I said because both of them are what you want to do also or something this you're gonna find folks more of your calls about your life your career your money here on the day for him to show don't go anywhere [noise]\nYou one of the millions of empty nesters are look around their house and just see unused space there might be time to downsize but when you raised a family and I have a lot of emotions tied to your home it can be\nTough to separate the facts from the feelings and that's where an experts advise comes in handy Anna in Portland, Oregon knew she needed a real estate agents help when she decided to sell I had lived in my own for twenty five years and it was overwhelming\nPeople in the families that need the specific help it that they can give you the referral a cause that would be huge as well so that that takes a little bit of time to kind of build up your book a business I mean that financial coach but it's totally doable and to make that money for sure and so I definitely would go through our training on that route\nAnd I think you bring up a good point racial Chris at twenty eight I think you do need to look at the differences even if they're somewhat nuanced somewhat specific between the coach\nAnd the plan or because I think you can be a financial planner and make that money a lot faster and it's still a coach mean Dave says all the time\nWe go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that's that's our one of our local guys if I sit down with Jeff and I we want to know what he's got the heart of a teacher all that's on Yahoo page right so I Do think you've got to do some specific research there Chris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me\nAnd at twenty eight you have plenty of time to get there but in the meantime while you're pursuing the plan I Can't say this enough\nYou're not being dishonest you're not being a shy stir in the current job so let go of some of that guilt um and and I think you're going to be fine I just would not let that way on you\nTriple eight to five five two to five is the number and Komen Rachel crew sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour let's go to Kimberly who's on the line and nodding home Pennsylvania Kimberley how can we do [noise]\nI can um I Am fifty five years old I had been teaching and public school and the health care for 'em Thirty years on and I just found in the last few years that on a plane or something else\nI'm like the back of last year really then I'm drawn to real estate I looked into it\nUm yeah I can collect my retirement I retire with for a little bit\nAs opposed to going all thirty five years and my only on a challenge or block is unconvincing my husband that's a good idea\nBecause it would be a bit of a difference and they are about twenty five thousand dollars in salary but I Know that I can make that um I I really think and then\nOn helping people find hung up early and I find that really interesting okay not what I Love my teacher and but it's time for it\nI get I get good news I got good news for you and your husband okay so for you to become a realtor a successful realtor it's going to take you a little bit of time\nAnd I think the fact that you just reveal to us and our audience that used to enjoy teaching there's no big a hurry you're not calling in a completely burned out and so I Would not take the penalty either I how many more years just for fun real quick how many more years would you have to stay in the role\nOf teacher before he retired without penalty for five years\nOkay I just want to throw a scenario of what is over the next five years you build your real estate business showing homes at night and on the weekends\nI think that's extremely doable anybody who's ever been successful in real real estate knows you're going to build a pipeline your husband's always real concern sounds like to me rituals that he doesn't want you to lose that twenty five thousand dollars that's a that's a scary thing certainly your age\nWhat if you kept the teacher salary for maybe three years still take a little bit of Hillary but I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business\nOver five year period is going to be here before you know it you step into retirement full benefits and by that time you should have easily replaced if not\nMaybe another extra you know twenty five thirty percent above me on what you're making I think you can just absolutely double your income while still being a teacher I think that's the thing that I'd want you to consider Rachel\nWhile they're saying that great situation to be an because real estate usually agents show how those when people aren't working so that means it is night than it is we can that's what the busiest time and so to say hey I'm going to commit for maybe when junior husband can decide that a year two years three years or ... even go to five years if you can\nWhatever it is and say okay we're in commitment of time and if you start to see yourself like well I'm really good at it because you sound very enthusiastic about it you sound like a people person which means you're gonna be a great residents of the major 'cause most people do great when they have great people ... sounds like you can really so\nEven though you're enthusiastic he's still may not be great at it you can kind of get them things under your belt while you're learning for again a year or two\nMaybe three years whatever your husband decide\nAh and the kind of step into it yeah I wouldn't go cold turkey by any means but I think that this could be excellent because having a great real estate agent here and do anything about it is it still commission base that you get to decide what you make basically like how much you work how many how you sell super fun versus going from where he wears a salary of the teacher\nTo do something like that can be very incredible for you personally and you may find that you're really good at it and maybe in a year's said about\nUs and I think once you show the hobby replaces the twenty five or ...
