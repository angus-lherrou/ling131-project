here in Philadelphia Hi Jim\nAre you good they buy from it\nUm my wife and I work currently in baby steps to uh we started this time last year with about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in debt ah we've been because they all intents and paid off our thousand dollars wow as of this month yes a\nSold my brand new pickup truck sold a race car um wow everything yeah though we um we have and an interesting situation a we have one child and we're looking to expand our family however we're going to need to I'm related to ivy F um we still have another\nSixty six thousand dollars left or the pay off what what is your household income uh were making about a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year right now\nSo you did a hundred in a year but a lot of that was from selling stuff I'm pretty much\nA large like under what what's the math telling you that it's got how long is he going to take you do this or the sixty\nUm [noise] if we if we continue on this course where we have literally sold everything so the rest of it's just going to be working really hard I think it's going to be probably about another year maybe a little bit more\nThat's what I was thinking that's what I Would ask him on a cell that OK cool and so what is the pricing model of uh VS that you guys are looking at\nUm well we actually met with a doctor a few months ago and we got a ballpark of about twenty thousand ... um [noise] uh just you know we haven't\nFound anything or start any any process is yeah we're just still kind of shopping around but twenty thousand or we're looking at a we've spoken with other couples and all the click and who's got around there\nUm let me give you a little inside okay this comes like a lot because babies are important\nBut I mean having kids is a big deal it's an emotional thing and it causes people to uh\nYou know to to change their financial directions and the to violate things and everything else so let me tell you I I absolutely know nothing about medical things I I'm a medical idiots okay [laughter] but uh I have actually been involved in about this decision probably a hundred times over the years\nAnd what I Am hearing\nEven as late as last week a with couples that we are coaching on this is that when they press in they find several different pricing models\nThe ... in Atlanta is her grandmother died\nFamily couldn't keep up the house side he's moved in it and they're paying the mortgage and\nWanting to know what to do whether you should fool with us or not and whether you have a credible wider work it out or however\nThere are some really what you told me so far sir\nYes okay so the the ... renting out Ninety five thousand dollars on the house that's what it takes to pay the mortgage off correct\nCorrect okay\nAnd the next thing you need to do is you need to talk to a real estate agent and find out what this house was actually\nWorse because right now you don't know\nYeah I don't I don't know I don't know ... it's it's my wife my wife is a great grandma so I Know where I live I Will always say there was a it's a hundred and thirty ... I don't know if that's even ... they're not\nAre not like it's not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion purposes okay if you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy it for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that\nGreat a by [noise] I just being okay by it's not like you're getting right great deal there where you just went wow that's the best deal ever right because as I\nLike to even get kicked out 'cause someone gated or should I leave or should or should I go back ran over well\nWhere do I want to be long term whether you want to own their own\nWife she we kind of didn't want to own because we got a daughter she's four and my wife she that school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now\nMhm have you got every angle and I'll be like an area it's like I say my wife great grandma's house and she'd been here her whole life so she likes it it's like about two and a half three acres mhm and um it's kind of in a country well part of Atlanta\nGotcha okay and how old are you to\nUh my wife she turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one a couple of days so we both twenty now\nMhm and you got a\nA one child yourself and how much debt the your house\nOr we don't have any okay and what's your household income\nUh make uh every player but I'm trying to get in school but I had to kind of work with or Santa that was that I don't watch I\nDon't know what else\nUm I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month and your wife\nOkay that's pretty ... on your budget [noise]\nThis is very tight on your budget [noise]\nYeah and we just found out about you not long ago one of my friends from church he recommended me to start listening to you so now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff on how to eat and we're already kind of you know trying to start it off a little better\nToo good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is the uh the relatives that are involved that would be the air's a this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren [noise]\nThat would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court you know to get a lawyer and go to probe a court in probate court would have to rule that the house could be sold and would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done [noise]\nOkay I don't think you need that experience right now [noise] yeah though\nWith all the new the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages paid I doubt they're going to get thrown out\nYeah 'cause that's what I was thinking should I because I feel kind of want to actually start even going into real estate because I Do construction and that's what I Do know I kind of this house has kind of it's not me to this kind of be the same fight the last few years she hit her head and like other relatives staying there kind of beating it up so I I mean I don't know if it's like\nMaybe work more maybe you know what I'm saying they Lincoln flip it and get another house\nOr an Olympic ... unless you become the owner of it\nYeah and and that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to you'd had I see in a statement and they said they did hurry up and now I think my name or should I tell you what I\nWould do if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from this house some day when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it [noise]\nYou're probably not gonna ever bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about\nOkay so ah what I Would do is pay the rent or pay that payment of rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't frets about becoming the owner today\nIt's inexpensive rent and the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing [noise] yeah it's going to be in it's going to be a really\nStrenuous process with the courts to become the owner of this because we don't even know who the errors are\nYeah well I don't I Know a couple of the day is this is not that many on 'em\nOr that they actually even know about it like I said we we may here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried that I'm staying here paying their oil and I just keep paying it\nIn because that's not such a you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYeah but I'm I'm just worried like can't nobody command me out 'cause it's not in my name\nYeah they're going to take you out the people that own it can there are the heirs but they'd have to all get their crop together and they're far from doing that\nYeah and they're they're they're far away they're like in another state and\nYou know but there knowing that they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than a vote on it if it was valuable now there'll be some sharks and the water circling right but it's not got any value because it's not worth any more\nDon it if it was valuable now there'd be some sharks in them water circling right but it's not got any ... because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it 'cause some that you're just gonna walk off and leave it\nYeah 'cause 'cause I've already done paying eight and ... before they had some something you know in the late in life because\nThat's like whatever money whatever money you spend and make her happy is money is\nGone when you leave because there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing the probate court\nAnd get to be transferred to your name and you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that\nAnd um and you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent\nThe place you kinda like living and uh you know six hundred bucks written in line is not a bad gig on two and a half acres so I'm sitting there in front of you for now it's not hurting\nAnything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and some day you're just going to move on\nQuite worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner then get\nReady to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months of pain in the bud court actions and you probably can work this through if you can gather up all the people you need to sign on it\nAnd that's what you're facing so it's an interesting situation but um my guess is it's not worth any more than his vote on it [noise] my guess is ill as probably fairly close on this if we thought it was worth two hundred thousand bucks\nIs a relative thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks and Ninety thousand was old and they were going to get a hundred thousand their pocket when is old oh sharks would already been circling\nThey'd have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get the courts do it when you die without a wheel and you don't have to go in and the judge has to you know authorized the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs are just like it would in a will but it's just a lot bigger mess\nAnd there you can't get clean title to this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become the owner of it any other way than doing it properly and getting clean titled 'cause you won't be able to sell it if you don't get clean titled so that's how you do it if you decided to do it later but for today I Would treat it as cheap rent it's a rental house\nHow much money would you spend on a rental house\nThat you're going to move off and you don't home not [noise] not any that's what you would do\nHope that helps man's thanks for calling in this is the Dave Ramsey shower\n[noise]\nGet a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their

just nutty people on there and I was trying to help them with their money and it was just like I'm the only seen one of the old dead gums that it was crazy but there was one of the lady that um that

thing and that was a it was those shows those kind of show and um she and I ended up talking in the green room after that and she was the one she gave me an shouldn't be in a study\nAnd I read through the whole study I was amazed there was a huge correlation\nBetween extreme levels of financial control\nAnd domestic violence so if you have a friend who is not allowed to go to the grocery store by herself without her husband\nOr her boyfriend if you have a friend that is not allowed to touch money in any way because her husband her boyfriend is incomplete extreme control of every decision around the finances I'll give you a Ninety percent probability he's hitting\nHer [noise]\nThat's how that's how strong this study correlation was\nMean there's just because there's so many it's a it's all about control and it's all about bullying\nSo there's just the sicknesses involved there and it shows up in the money believe it or not and and you can see it\nAnd and after doing that reading

think it's planning having a plan communicating with your spouse and being real strategic with your money when we\nWhether it's shopping for groceries would go to the discount you know grocery places ... whether it's going if we're going to go out to eat um we're looking for coupons group bonds some sort of deal when you know when we go out to eat and\nWe pretty much every time we go out to a meal we share a entree that is like\nNo I mean every single time so things like that and I don't I'm I'm not a big shopper so all my clothes come from discount stores I never buy anything unless it's on sale that's just how and and I don't see that changing ever settle\nIt can change if you want it to come in you you don't have any payments\nNow and then my DNA I'd I go straight to the sale right on well\nThat share and she always tells me how much money she saved me which means it costs me something but not but nowadays we can afford it it's not a big deal if you're like no one else later you can live and give like no one else and you guys are in that position so did you have people thought you were crazy or detractors or did you have a more cheerleaders\nUh we definitely had all cheerleaders around us and no negative comments it through the whole journey and and we love seeing you know our friends are part of our family it's just been wonderful\nWow so there there were

position to cover any repairs\nUm no I Would not pay for that and I would get in a financial position to cover the repairs it's called your emergency fund\nSo you need to work your way out of that like we teach and that's maybe step to paying off everything but the house using the debt snowball\nAnd then from there once that's done once you're out of that everything but the house then we're

day Ramsey show\nHi Dave thanks for taking my call today sure what's up on the health\nInsurance question for you and I'm hoping you could give me some insight on it we adopted our two children about three years ago and they came from the foster care system so we don't get a lot of services but one thing we do get is health insurance until they're Eighteen and it's provided through our state Medicaid system\nAnd every year my husband and I kind of go back and forth on whether or not to keep it or to put them on his plan through his employer and we're getting close to that um [noise] time of year to make that decision\nOkay um what would his employer's plan cover that Medicaid is not covering\nWell they've both been healthy thankfully I guess her and you know the thing we always come back to as unknowns of any kind of health issues that they may however\nMany services because even though the Medicaid coverage is crummy you know and a lot of ways a lot of doctors don't take it and it's a basically welfare insurance [laughter] um it has covered their needs up to this point because those kids are healthy and they've had you know minimal minimal\nIncident afraid if they had some kind of a major event that he'll Medicaid would not do a good job of covering and that his insurance might\nActually it's more the opposite I'm not worried about the major stuff because like we've had to go to the ER for you know my you know a scrape and a bump and they pick up the tab for everything it's more the ongoing care there is um you know it's very hard to find providers who take it there's a bit of a steak than we feel\nA little strange having that kind of coverage given our own financial position you know that our kids are on a\nUm ... there's a bit of a stigma that oh I don't feel they're having it so it's just it's just kind of a dilemma we face every year and\nI and you are you know in November we can make your average you a a you know free food stamps because you are adopted a foster child you know that would feel the same way as what you're saying um\nIt would yeah I mean I I well I don't look at you know and he has already been stripe\nAnd that takes care of

years we've been to a younger hockey team in in a you know everybody's like well you got a bunch of returns coming back this year and you guys are you guys look really really go to the showcase and I'm like\nSix six returns signature and a and they're like they're like wow like that that can be ... you know we've got some really good young talent and uh there's going to be some consistency in there\nAnd and um you know what's best for us to grow as a team and as a group and and try and get a try and get four points uh you know friday and Saturday Night I think that's the maturity of needs to happen with this group\nWas it nice to see this team compete and get a split in a couple of defensive struggles after is kind of an offensive slugs is for them to showcase\nWas it nice to see this team compete and get a split in a couple of defensive struggles after as kind of an offensive slug fest for them to showcase\nYeah I think it's nice when he can win games different ways and and uh you know I thought on a thought on friday if you watch [noise] I ah I don't like our\nOur um\nOur only minutes right now and I think that's fair to say I'm all the way down through our team and and you know we take penalty with six minutes left in the in the third period and\nUm to not allow them to get set up and and basically um you know I thought our last our last six minutes with the PKK ... was what made a I think our coaching staff who are really good from takeaway from friday night just a way you know when they when they are able to pull their goal and\nYou know we'd be to ... and just the for the last three four minutes was was was pretty awesome to watch so [noise]\nUm you know defensively you know I think if you look at a um in our goal tending and and the way Johnny uh can play I mean you know we can win I think when you win games one nothing to one three to a but it was nice to a nice to see other than a you know seven three or four or five\nTo game yeah and the give John Roberts and mean fifty nine for sixty two on the weekend extremely above average for John in that and some of the saves he made a great save on leave I stop or on friday then he said against Sandy Williston at two and one's there period on Saturday was outrageous are really stepping up early to help lead this team\nYeah and you know I I Know the one you're talking about on friday and now that we're pretty good on friday we didn't we didn't allow or or or you know forced him to make too many huge saves a you know when he came across and got and got that one of those toll was a huge save their traffic but you know he got the majority of us work on Saturday when we when we\nWe've got to show up at riverside until probably about a ... thirty eight forty five and ... Fifteen so [noise]\nYou know I just don't think we're very good as as a team on a Saturday and and obviously a needle or that put a lot of weight on Johnny shoulders and or play very well give us just won a game actually thought we um you know should have got points out of the game\nAnd the the defense you know you kinda know a little bit where you have with family and ski and joined in a couple of veteran guys but a ton of young guys on the back and it seemed like a lot of the young guy stepped up and played their best games are on the weekend especially on friday\nYeah I think that's if you look at a you know when when\nYou look at our roster I mean you you you take away a semblance skin he's our only returning to the fence been back there in in in a choir and joined timber was was was huge for us\nUm but if you if you take out ten by me and you're looking at a one defense and back there that's got a\nLie or do we think is the best defense spending this week uh which is a bonus for us because we don't have a lot of returning guys back there but we have a lot of good young talent and and that's where I think you're going to have your inconsistency and it's a [noise] you know with our guys up front and and and on the back end but\nI'm a size ... you're not playing twenty five games you're you know even midgets is just a it's a different type of game and and I think that's where you know you're going to see our guys to have good nights and you're in Sierra ... our guys have bad nights I think the big thing is make sure we can keep watching film keep learning and and keep making improvements every time is that when the ice\nThat's the big news from the weekend the ... games in Austin the first place showdown with the Bruins are the big news today of course are the NHL released its preliminary central scouting ... players to watch list for the two thousand Nineteen\nNHL Draft and for the second straight year or ... has been lifted last year as a couple a with Ryan

Kirk has had a sense\nIs uh on the players to watch list for the two thousand Nineteen NHL drafted crazy or the rights to Kirk has had a ...\nYeah and I think there's a you know we we were a U.S as coach is a bit of inside information on that and I think there's another player that's close to being on the watch list for us but we won't mention his name but for Kirkland I mean it's a\nI don't know I mean it's a it's right now it's it's accomplishment after accomplishments in or does it get any better from being from Bismarck at I think that's something that a pretty special for our program and\nUm you know I think it's just a I don't spend a lot of fun in the last the last ten years having the the amount of ah Bismarck players that have come through your and played for\nA place for a program so um you know I I think her class or the\nSays earlier but I think it's going to be one of many accomplishments for him and and um you know that might be a might be one that the print salt

we're gonna have big fun if you get some confusion you're dealing with in your career maybe you're scared you know exactly what you want to do what you just terrified well there's no shame in that\nWe all face those fears that we've got to step into those fears and maybe you're just stuck you're stuck in a job where it's just sucking the life out of you and you can't wait to get friday afternoon if that is due to day is your day make the call we're here to help triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five will started off with Katie who's on the line in Ogden, Utah Katie how can we help\nI think are taking my call Cher I'm feeling really confused about um life right now I'm a little background about five years ago I stopped going to school when my husband and I found out that pregnant and since then I've worked all kinds of jobs to pay for him to finish\nAnd he recently finished you got a great job now and we're starting\nTo kick our debt but they ran out I'm such a difficult and to help out I've been applying the creatures that I don't really want truck out because you know we need that money and I don't know how much else going on for me and I'm trying to fix I've got two kids I'd like to stay home um\nBut I you know I Want to work and I want to help out and I and I feel like I've lost myself and I have no idea where to even start to find my interests are my strength yeah\nWell I understand that you feel that way but that is an absolute wiser you have to acknowledge the fact that that's just a lack of confidence there's some self doubt it's creeping because you've been at home for a while\nAnd here's another reality reality is that right now to Katie in America we have more jobs that are available than there are people who were unemployed it is a fantastic job market even for stay at home moms meaning you want to stay home but work from the home\nAnd so what you have to first do is get very very clear you're in that first age and that is the stage of discovery\nWith your business or your career\nBut that's what we're taking a shower come on come on Tripoli eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five five two to five and we're going to go to put ... who's on the line in Tampa, Florida how can we will\nDo thank you for taking my call jerks that's certainly so\nYeah ... ... you know eleven has um I'd love to say you know the city of that function guys out wellness center ourselves off or\nNot this little guy the financial quilting and other things to cook for physical mental and emotional health thought I was thinking about selling our house buying that he'll play you know\nWhere I live up here and there will be the wellness center like concern that that is that um well it would there be some sort of liability\nWell go ahead you\nKnow like if someone wants to get hurt a lot I Know that can apply for the and they go out there if I were to go so they will go after the fitness but if I Lived in the same building with that there but I don't know ... wondering if that would be an issue well\nYou've got a couple of things going on here put chicken I Want to own a a spend a little bit how each of them first of all I'm probably gonna be state specific so you definitely need to look at the laws in your state in any type of regulations\nI'm you're going to have liabilities regardless whether it's a stand alone studio or it's where you live so you're you're going to have liability if somebody gets hurt and you need to know what those are and to protect yourself with insurance on professional insurance products based insurance if you have a product that type of things you want to look into that\nBut I Do just want to challenge him one thing for ticket I Love your idea\nI Love the idea of a wellness center I Love the idea that you're helping people but here that are traditionally encourage people to do\nBecause you don't currently have a yoga studio and you don't have\nAnd have a yoga studio and you don't have any idea of validated I Want to challenge you to start a little bit smaller in a little sooner so I'll give you an example where\nIs there a wellness center community center yoga studio ... studio somewhere where you could start your business sublease third base in their off hours build your brand build the demand you have no risk no overhead no upfront cost\nAnd you're able to validate your idea until the business justify you getting your own space be that a duplex that you have about or your own stand on space I'll give an example there are a lot of churches that will operate when they're getting started out of elementary schools the elementary school right next door household they don't have to go on Sundays so they rented out to a church that use it on Sunday\nAnd it's just a great deal to win when it's additional revenue for the school the church has a place to go without having to afford a whole building seven days a week when they can't justify it\nAnd I've seen a lot of businesses do that so I don't think your idea is a bad idea I Would just talents you just start smaller in sooner on a lower risk level lower cost level and validate your idea and build those relationships build your brand in your demand\nGet that going and then when you're ready to have your own studio it's the next logical step it doesn't feel like a terrifyingly so we want to look into laws and regulations for liabilities but also when you think about your space before you make that big commitment\n[noise] Patricia are you a lot of phone are you working full time right now\nRight and that was quite a lot I work full time and I think I'm going to Iran and on I was planning on going back for miners practitioner and that way um I I've been making more money but it'll help them find in my business as well\nYeah well of course you can I just wanted to know that fact because this this that piece of information plays beautifully knew what you're saying\nShe's going to have to do this on the side anyway she's not in a position to open up anything I don't think you would try to go right on open it right um I I just want to see you maybe do a little bit of yoga for some people maybe two or three moms when I see if you can get a small group of men pay you\nBecause it's everything you just said but it allows you to tip toe into it or the nurse practitioner thing that's going to school to get that will make more money I Love that too is going to lower to cash flow have more cash piled on when it's time to to operate so I mean you you nailed it there I I just think ... you know don't rush into\nThe well and the other thing I Want to call out for anyone listening right now that has a service based business like a yoga studio\nYou have a tendency to think that the studio is the business it's not if you are and what you can go anywhere you can go to people's houses you can go to the park outside they're coming and paying for you so don't feel like you have to have a location\nBefore you can start your business because you are the business so you can start tomorrow Patrice ... out of your living room if you want to learn on the street and by the way you should go ahead totally yeah don't wait for the studio studio is not the business you are the business point people don't care I Know for him as they enjoy it they're coming for you they're not coming for the building\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five ... sitting in for a range of this hour taking your calls about your business your business idea or a career career change career question let's go to bill is on the line and Detroit Michigan bill how can we help\nAnd it will crush the outer to get a few good things are calling how can we'll hope I've\nBeen only achieved films for about Twenty years and to the point that really hasn't been I haven't progressive Charlotte clear as I originally hoped than wish there was\nA long story short is I'm back in January was that I went through a pie view and\nA long story short sales I'm back in January was that I went through a pie view and as we're about to a baby steps one step too right now\nGoing through some of our stuff together grabs sales go on a we came in to some old home movie a fish from stuff that she had gotten from bad um when he had died um and\nThrough all these things we found you know we had a lot of all eight millimeters old VHS raw stuff and it's like okay we have all this stuff\nUm I started to ... and I really found a passion for that that I have an ad in the future heart a while and I'm thinking okay this sounds like something I could turn into a great business and love doing going forward\nI'm looking at this point they lead\nBill let me interrupt what is the bit to get right to what is the business with the military or what is the business\nI'm converting I guess the format like later VHS wide cells all that uh could digital content and properly preserve them\nOkay and so what's your question for us then\nI'm not a question I have is just a how to get started um I definitely want to get started and I just want to make sure I'm stepping throw it a properly and ... the um\nMore tell you what Bill crushed that\nBill ... he's ready to go she can cause we only have a little bit of time here I Want to be able to get to your your solution\nWe want to make sure we help yeah here's the thing about the great used as\nA when you were entering a space where there's already people doing what you want to do it means the ideas prevent so you're not doing something that's never been done before there are actually businesses have similar type services what you didn't know is yes you're solving a problem and if you're solving a problem it's a viable business idea\nYou just have to find the people that have that problem that had the eight millimeters they want to preserve on and you're going to learn how who that person is you're going to go after them and build a business for them so you're going to price them you're going to create marketing language\nThat speak to them right where they are to the best part about this bill it you know the idea is valid because it's been done before what you're going to do is you're going to build your business and you're going to get better and you're going to serve your customers and they're gonna want to come to you because you make a unique space for yourself\nIn that market a bill I Know my book is for women but I'm going to send it to you men read it all the time to business principles are the same and it gives you plan to take that idea to market I Hope it helps ...\nGreat plans for follow it and and here's this thing a ... a lot of bills out there he said something that's interesting\nHe finds diesel things and you realize way I don't have an office and and you were giving him the steps the book is going to walk into it but I wanted you said when they try it just tested on channel ... last call here's why some passion should be ...\nIt changes things when you turn it into a business is that what you made a great point other people are doing this he just got to find people that are willing to pay him to do it\nAnd keep paying him until others hey if you need is done me tell you about bill he's got to start really small but start right away stop thinking about it stopped getting Miami just you know in the water just doing triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five coming up more of your questions about career starting a business\nDon't go anywhere\nYou heard me talk about id there for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim\nBut I run across some numbers that even surprised me and\nShows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity the last year yes sixteen million twenty six percent of them had to borrow money from family or friends twenty two percent of them lost even more money by taking time off work and nine hundred thousand\nSo they're different companies okay I'm going to see at two of them are kind of action I own projects I work on out here in Minnesota the other one is there a company I used to work four years ago that you contract work for\nPerfect okay they don't pay that salary yeah\nThe reason I'm asking is because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part\nTo validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can I run this whole thing without having a boss that kind of backs me and you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited to Haiti because you're just going to do more of what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken\nAnd um when you're going to start increase your family household income in other ways to your husband but in the meantime if you want to spend the next two to three months building up the demand to clients their relationship even just taking people to coffee starting together interest\nOf other independent projects you could run on your own that could run through this new architecture firm that you're going to run as an independent person you're building it up and of course it will be crazy first season because you're getting more and more demand but then\nWhen you decide to leave your fulltime job it the next logical step where the business can support you the income is there of course that's only going to help and your husband has income so you're all ready I Would say\nTwenty to thirty percent down the path of doing this you're not starting from scratch or not like I have a full time job and I want to do this totally different thing how do I started out\nYou're already doing it you already have clients you're working with I just want you to do more of that and then the next few months as you build that up that will start to ramp up as her husband's income comes in and it looks like first of the year you probably should be able to comfortably leisure leader named them\nYeah and it comes down to a formula you gotta work days baby step stays babies to fund the dream so when you put enough money aside plus decide businesses there and then that's how you get to that number where you can step aside into Christie's point does not have to be ... jump right it should be a nice move and it just takes a little bit of time and patience lays on her way\nThe light at the end of the tunnels an important point can cause so many people feel like how can I sustain this well you're not till January when you'd that landed in the telling you know this is the first season him to put my head down for a season them and had the rewards and it's worth it things aren't\nAll right let's go to ray real quick in Orlando, Florida re how can we help [noise]\nHey how you doing guys I'm OK though I've been in the field for the past
