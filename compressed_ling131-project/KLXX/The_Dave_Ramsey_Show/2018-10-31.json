there Sean how to make sure we do start to get to wants to talk to wealthy\nHey mark how are you [noise]\nI'm fine and yourself better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nWell the reason I'm calling today to talk about bankruptcy so my wife and I combined we have about a hundred and thirty four thousand dollar than that I'm\nA hundred thousand of student loans and the balance would be a credit card debt\nWe recently met with a financial advisor and they suggested that we filed for bankruptcy because they will take us a long time to pay off the bat they suggested that saying that it would be better for us to just start fresh and I just wanted a second opinion\nWhat is your household income sure\nOh combined it clear about eighty five\nOkay you have any car debt\nHarder mhm ah no we don't our cars are paid off okay what are your car's worth oh\nI Would say about twenty thousand combined\nOkay right well\nHere's the facts that the quote unquote financial advisor didn't know um apparently or he wouldn't have given you such stupid but advise student loans are not bankrupt double\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah we did talk about that during the conversation they never go away but he was thinking in terms of the amount of credit card that we have\nBob are really really have allied um at wait a minute this moron suggested your bankrupt with thirty four thousand dollar for the credit card debt with a household income of eighty five thousand\nThat's absurd dude that's what I was thinking\nAnd you're a hundred percent that free in one year what are your car's worth\n... work or a corner OK each\nUm her to a new or my over oh they're so proud of ours are working on her her's is worth what about Thirteen thousand mine of about ...\nMhm okay\nWell um you can do what you want to do I if I woke up in your shoes I have to tell you I've worked with families that were in dire straits over the years that were forced into bankruptcy you're not one of those\nIf you choose to file bankruptcy just cause you to dead young lazy to address the situation let's say even say you did it over two years\nIt's only Seventeen five a year\nAnd your debt free other than your student loans and I'm not talking about the student loans will be gone in one year I'm Talking about the credit card debt to be going in one year\nSo how fast do normal people that call the Dave Ramsey show that work our plan pay off a hundred and thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five about four years probably\nAbout four years yeah\nThat's the normal routine for people around here that would be student loans and everything and um you know I I Would not move down in car initially\nOut of your wife's car into a into a six thousand dollar or five thousand dollar car initially I might end up doing that as we go along we'll see how it goes what do you do for a living sir\nI'm operations manager\nI'm okay and what does she do for a living through the past the okay All right cool um does she ever do any outside speaking for money\nUm you know I mean the ... gun or does she do speaking I Am and he says she speak on Sunday mornings yeah see that's very secretive thunder okay All right\nI mean I Wonder if if you know she might feel do some ... occasionally for somebody that was ill or on sabbatical or something in that congregation pay or a little bit or\nMaybe she works in an evangelist to outrage and they pay you are a little bit for speaking skills or maybe dot dot dot you do something I don't know I mean if you add ten Fifteen thousand dollars a year to this equation\nOf income and you guys tightened down your budget to nothing I mean nothing where you have no life because we're going to clean this mess up you know you can clean up the whole thing and for years maybe three but four for sure\nUh any clerical student loans really really really fast as a part of that equation I'm Sorry though that credit card debt as a part of that equation really really fast but you got to cut them up you've got to quit using them and you've got to stop living the way you've been living goes it's not working agreed\nOn was that was that makes sense yeah something like that now\nThe Bible says that no discipline seems pleasant\nAt the time\nBut it yields harvest of righteousness you guys make good money so I Know you're not stupid people you're not ... they're not dumb\nYou just been doing some dumb things which makes you just like most of it was added a lot of dumb things in my life dude\nI'm with money in particular has high end up teaching is because I got a PHD in to you and be but ah you know if\nI don't I don't know who it was it gave you this advice but you need to stay away from them because they gave you really really bad advice that's my opinion I think you can not only can work through this I think you should work through this I think it'll be a testimony to God's power and you're all his life that you turn this around and that you attack at an attack it\nHaving a sense of self control this sense of discipline and it'll change your marriage on communication levels it will lower the stress when you're working the plan

college\nTake the other two thousand and just settled in mutual fund and your name\nNo big deal just regular mutual fund and your name and you just on the file when you drop the paperwork into a file right mission trip on the file\nWith us from Springfield, Missouri river in order to YouTube what's up\nWe just finished SP you\nWere on babysat to\nAnd for the last five years we have been building our home\nPaycheck to paycheck\nAnd um it's not a hundred percent completed yet we had to borrow money on it or to kinda get things rolling a little bit but um we got an offer to do the care taking position\nAnd the guys have died a four hundred dollars a month to take care of his vacation home I'm In the same town we live um [noise] do we tell our home or do we keep it and continue to make a payment on it\nIt's not completed well it were at that point it needs a paint and flooring and you're living in it no no um well we were living in a mobile home\nUm but then we got that offer to live in this house basically for free and he pays a live here and take care of\nI got that are okay so that's ... so you've never lived in this other health\nKnown okay somebody will talk to show them the conditions fan yeah lucky they can't get financing on it right so you're going to take a weapon or want to take money wise to finish it\nUm\nWhat never had a professional answer on that but probably about eight thousand ten thousand dollar\nYou know and what is your household income um\nWell my husband he worked forty hours a week whatever household income [laughter]\n\nProbably thirty seven thousand a year okay so your husband is the only one working well we have a business um it doesn't work it out and running it don't make money\nIn his income is about twenty seven thousand in the business makes about Fifteen thousand nearly\nOkay\nAnd then getting the care taking condition or will be like in about forty eight hundred cat but we get housing for free\nYeah I got up or until you get into if he decides he doesn't want you to care take anymore and then you'd\nRight so um you have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring as it is\nUm [noise] well we had a appraisal and if it were completed it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand\nIt's not completed so probably a hundred and fifty hundred and twenty five\nNo no not if it's not completed it won't know um because ... it's a further discount than the cost it\nTakes to complete it it's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer cannot bothers house okay because they don't have any money and they're trying to get a mortgage and they can't get a mortgage on this house\nAnd so that limits your invent that limit your selling pool to investors and they're going to discount that a lot deeper than that if you get a hundred out of there should be flying I'm thinking so um [noise] how much will be borrowed against it so far\nUh [noise] about how the south we owe thirty thousand but they're from property attached to it how altogether it a hundred thousand\nYou owe a hundred thousand against the house and the property yeah which would bring a hundred and sixty if it were fixed if you sold the property is well yes\nOkay alright yeah I I Would look at trying to pick up the other ten thousand dollars in an additional loan and get this house finished and let's get it so as soon as possible\nAnd then just\nContinue fattening money and how we yeah\nYeah we'll have you know you should have some equity in your pocket at that point I mean I'm not a ton which are going to get a little money out of it so you know it it just hasn't worked out for you you realize that right yeah you've got way too many hours in this house\nAnd and really didn't get much out of it went all the smoke clears here right you'll get a little bit but it's not it is it's not worked out very good so you know you're going to have to reset that and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you guys need to look at your incomes\nBecause your household income as you I'm very very low income and ah so I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term and I want to think about some part time jobs in the meantime\nBut um yeah I Would get that house finished up I'm saving scratching and clawing painting and [noise] you know if you borrow three thousand bucks or something that's fine but let's let's try and get it sold as fast as possible now if the land is such that you can sell off a piece of the land\nWithout selling the house in order to have the money to finish the house that's what I Would do first\n... showing acre also corner use that money to finish the house then get the household and that way there's no more debt involved Olivia is with us in Lexington high Olivia how are you\nGoing to hire you better than I deserve what's up [noise] and\nI had a question and I can ask an amount of debt and and I'm wanting to pay that off the eighth grade [noise] um you know when I saw in recovery for an addiction and an idea that it's going to therapy so [noise]\nUm [noise] I ... ... budget and pet therapy at the end it likely not going to get aid in town kinda adequate that have not really sure way to pay in the budget [noise] or how big of a priority like\nHow long you been clean and they're good for you well then what is it [noise] um actually addiction ... okay\nI'm not going to put therapy on hold right now this was something you need you need some accounts for a walk with you as you finish this life transformation and that that is essential to you having a life would you agree with that statement\n[laughter] now what I Would do is is number one it's not a permanent situation\nUm the therapies not permanent it's not going to be there the rest of your life\nFifty years from now you're not gonna still be going to the therapist okay hold 'em and then uh otherwise they're just not very good [laughter] but ah at some point you'll you'll pull back from that and the second thing will happen is is that as you continue to address your income and you're out go you're going to\nFind ways to make more income and as you have more emotional ... you're going to feel more energized to make more income and so if this month you don't pay any extra on the debt ... therapy good\nIf next month the same thing happens okay\nBut by this time next year we ought to be making more money right let's do something let's kick her life in gear and let's start to clean up the mess to but for today Seventy five whole day's you've been clean\n[laughter] that's a great start right but it's not like you told me you've been clean for two years by the time you're going for two years we ought to be have different having a different conversation about the money would that make sense to you [noise] so let's get you killed and then let's see all your money\nAnd as you and it's not going to be suddenly\nLike a switch flips and you go okay I'm okay now I got the money no not at all or nothing can be gradual it'll be incremental\nYou'll feel better you you know when you're Ninety Days or years four months you ought to feel different than you feel right now and you ought to be able to do more and make more and save more and more and\nYou know you're you all have more focus on the money 'cause you'll be more healed and have to spend less severe emotional energy just coming through this right now your game on just getting through this is that right [laughter] okay well I Want you to finish turning the corner you turn the corner you're finished turned the corner and let's let's gone out\nAnd then as you make incremental progress\nMore and more than money from your new income and your increased income\nThe debt size for today we want to take care of Libya\n\nHow often do you look at your bank account and wonder where all your money went how often are you stressed about bills and afraid your paycheck will last the whole month you shouldn't have to live like that you shouldn't feel powerless over your money and you don't have to you can take control of your money\nWas the financial ... membership you'll learn to manage your daily finances pay off debts spin and save wisely and invest for your future if you follow this course\nAnd uh our youngest has Down syndrome\nAnd so uh right now we're actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church and we're just getting to the part oil or we're working on our wells and so because we have this special needs a issue we we get involved or attorney and getting our wheels together good and through that conversation we ah you\nKnow I'm a we've\nBeen discussing a special needs trust or world I'd have to play in planning for our baby's future yeah your animal\n... sure uh originally a kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs ... kind of function the same way with the other boys have a college fund in baby steps five\nUm the uh and that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special condition who special rules because of course uh you know his\nHis features are boring it's too early to know what is your fully what his needs are we've been blessed that he's he's healthy developing well you know there's this guy to limit\nFor him just like anyone mhm um and we don't have to ah [noise] ah you know it's hard to really didn't know if he ever have any limitations [laughter] but uh but now as far as I'm getting into it and we haven't find anything quite yet\nBut it would come down to the wire why things that I'm uncomfortable with is that you know if I start investing any money or funding try I I lose control of that to the truck the that we've named and while while I trust the trust the inability to go with their wishes that makes me uncomfortable\nNo you don't you don't need a special needs trust unless both of you die right the special needs trust does not need to be funded proud of your dad\nOkay so that Ronda it sounded from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth\nOkay\nIt's not ... I wouldn't even have it formed except upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as I Want to live as long as one\nAnd it's not ... I wouldn't even have it formed except upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as I Want to be was alive as long as one of us alive to manage your ass that's one of the things you're going to do is care for this child\nThat flew out of those ... now they don't win the trust is needed is if both of you die it gives the trustee me the the the the direction on how to handle the assets and disperse them to take care of this child's needs\nAnd um and what that needs to be is a a big hairy term life insurance policy that ... that is the beneficiary of it is that special needs trust or a portion of the policy you know thirty percent or twenty percent of the policy and the beneficiary line goes to the special needs trust\nIn the event that both of you die kind of a thing in the primary beneficiary is your wife okay but then past that the secondary beneficiary is\nSome portion would go while you've got minor children into a family trust to take care of the minor children your oldest two until they get them through college the other portion would go into the special needs trust to perpetually care for this other child throughout life\nNot just through college and so it's a larger amount needed to do that and then what happens is let's say we fast forward Twenty years\nAnd this childish Twenty years old and you've got a million and a half dollars and mutual funds\nOkay your other children are grown and gone or close Twenty years from now right that's the dream the dream that law yeah we're kicking them out so they're going\n[laughter] that's the legacy baby [laughter] but it's out of that than what we've got is we've got you know some portion of my million and a half dollars in my example is going to be parked in the special needs trust in the event both you and your wife or to pass the rest of it would go to your\n... more traditional airs directly\nSure but you know we put a million dollars in a in the the youngest child special needs trust at Twenty years old because he's going to need care and that's eighty thousand dollars a year it'll produce ... that'll take care of him and maybe one of his brothers is the trustee\nBy them\nYou know would you would you build it had like we're doing right now would you formula trust as illegal activity now and we've been unfunded or would not let it would have would make a clause in in the well\nWhy not why would I Would just make it a clause in the will to be formed upon both of your ...\nOkay because you don't need it now you don't need to be filing tax returns for the next twenty five years on this thing you don't need a shorter than all the time you don't need to go all the legal expense to form a trust so let me give you another example okay special needs ... as a as a special conditional\nVersion of just taking care of minor children right then the differences that might be perpetual okay but you know my children grew up\nAnd moved out on her own their own so my need for a trust to cover my minor children\nA in a live in both of our best expires\nFormed a trust for my minor children at that time in the need for that expire\nAnd I would have done it for nothing in this case is not going to be ... you're going to need a trust on most of that\nThat's what I Would do whatever you want and that's that's how we do\nI get asked all the time about what people need to do to improve their families money\nOverlook things are term life insurance and disability insurance both plans make sure that you have income to pay bills and take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen for term life you need to carry tend to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most families stay away from\nCash value or return a premium plans there just a rip off\nDisability insurance is just as critical how are you going to pay your bills or if you're unable to work disability is the leading cause of bankruptcies foreclosures that's why I send you to

Gainesville, Florida Hi Peter how are you\nDoing welfare how are you better than I deserve what's up\nGood thank you have that I got a follow up on all the millionaire if that were just call in and um but I just won't let you know an avid listener and I can't believe I'm finding myself in this situation a little background a while back I was entering my apartment complex and on the cake shutting on my vehicle and cracked my will shift\nI tried to collect from the complex for the damages caused to my vehicle and from there was contacted by that requests and seven hundred and Seventy five dollars to pay for the gate the clothes on my vehicle\nDamages caused to my vehicle and from there was contacted by them required in seven hundred and Seventy five dollars to pay for the gate\nThat close by my vehicle um come back and forth conversation I was ultimately refusing to pay them just because there was no indication of that it was going to close the Trade Center I thought everything was clear after I stopped sharing from them and this past week I got a call from a collection agency I'm just wondering if you have food by\nHer attorney that hire an attorney for seven hundred and Seventy five dollars for the damages yup okay what about do you think that small claims court could be an option yup\nBut I I'm ... and I think if you hire an attorney for a couple of hundred dollars and they write them a letter or you may shut this whole thing down I don't know that you don't have to go to small claims court\nOkay into and I mean I mean conversation with the a collection agency cracked it has nothing to do with the apartment I'm like you\nKnow yesterday they still on that and they're the ones that hard to collections agency I Would say like I was ...\nOkay so I Am in college as well just come back on the part that goes on that you think my my next that should be to talk to an attorney and be in contact with the um with the apartment complex and no way could I could write a check that a collection agency\nMore if you think that the gate closed improperly and you weren't doing anything wrong in the stupid thing broke your car they need to fix your car and not charge you for the gate\nRight right that's what you're telling me and if that's the case um you know\nA letter from an attorney may solve the whole thing uh but they're not scared of you obviously\nA show we need to get someone that gets their attention because basically you're getting run down I ... a corporate ladder here uh this is probably a corporate owned or ... owned apartment complexes being quote unquote professionally managed\nThirteen points and into games is pretty goes defense when I'm you know I mean six or seven is just a I Believe is where he sits right now and and\nYou know eight points in the last six games so\nAnd five goals in October overall\nYeah and um you know goals are goals or I was the toughest demon uh I think the next two guys that you'll have on have on the air here uh can attest that but uh [noise] he'll send me can really shoot at 'em he can one time and he can he can he can snap it\nUh to me that's why he he's a he's a difference maker not only with a with his brain but ah what he brings in the power play and and uh and obviously a you know I'm\nJust a just what he brings in the back end is is a is a difference maker and I think he's seen a single handedly on Friday nights\nNow and Saturday Night you mentioned it it ... it was a close game as a low scoring game and\nThe often said didn't seem like was hurting for chances it was hurting for finishes I think 'cause you could probably look back on\nFour or five opportunities and the second and third period after Aberdeen took the lead that I wouldn't call them ... chances I've probably call them grade a plus squaring chances because if they hit the net or the deflection has made its goal\nBut the finishes weren't quite there but the close yeah\nI thought we had a lot of good chances I'm ironically we didn't get a lot of shots off and I think that's a that's a big thing so um you know even looked a from Joe ... to ... just a you know at the end of our power players was a great look and and uh [noise]\nYou know I I don't know if there's another guy\nOn our team than a take than twenty five with with the partners are on a stick in the ... and and uh [noise] you know it was just a you know he mishandled Lipton and um they don't come to his own just seemed like a at the end of a at the end of regulation that uh that was kind of a way it was going to go on and then we had some really good chance to enjoy strata makes it\nMakes a mix of save 'em you know friend and make that save it was Jewish right on the goal line and uh that shift is really good we were [noise] um I Know from from watching their coaching staff last seven eight minutes they were [noise]\nAh they're ready to pull their heroin I thought we had a really good push late late in that game and and um you know just a just wound up a bit short but um you know when you put yourself in that situation too and I said we can expect to ah to get four points\nMeanwhile in that another sparkling performance for Johnny Roberts ah on the weekend made sixty four out of Seventy saves and its second week in a row he's faced Seventy shots\nAnd a coming out of it again with that are over nine hundred say percentage just making volumes and volumes of saves to give U.S team chance to win both nights [noise] yeah and I think it's a it's one of those things\nWhere you think you've seen a no of course the years here um it seems like every time go to every day and there's there's a lot of shots and and and I think they get all happy with their with their ah what their goal tending um you know shot single\nEvery time good Aberdeen there's there's a lot of shots and and and I think they get all happy with their\nWith their ah with their goal tending um you know shots and go for the for their home team but uh\nYou know it was opposing ... obviously I Love that every time I went to a building as a goal in and I got extra shots of the is it going to help your say percentage was a it was a plus but um you know Johnny I mean when he makes when he when he's called upon to make a you know big time said [noise]\nUm he steps out for us and I think that's the difference between a you know A L o won a in a one being asleep\nNo question about special teams kind of\nJekyll and Hyde had and we were close to where it is Halloween so we can even go at the monster references on that one as a our sister associate head coach rise to power wheels behind us um I [laughter]\nI didn't know what there's ... that's what it was it was Garrett to having a little fun here to measure homes that are but I'm\nSpecial teams no power play goes on friday and then Saturday get into gold from Sam five on three a penalty kill give up three goals on our give to goes on friday clean sheet on Saturday was the difference between the two games\nI don't know I mean it's a you know I felt like our power plays been so good\nI'm early I felt like we kind of hit a little bit of a rough patch share with power play in a [noise] you know I feel like we've scores and timely goals partly a as of late but I I feel like we've kind of taken a step back as far as uh\nYou know both units and and um you know definitely definitely comfortable with her [noise] um\nMaybe five on three look a you know I think it uh it got into a little bit different looked in what we want him but at the end of the um you know when you when you can move park\nA between starch a you know Tim ... Sammy uh up top in any one time park um\nI'll I'll take it any day of the week and and it's going to go back and that's quite a quite often so I'm you know I think we we wanted to or we wanted to address our power plants to want to change them um you know so uh what we had last week is is is quite frankly no where we're at right now\nAnd moving forward we want to or want to have a you know to looks at a they can go out there in ... any time we we will you know we need one or or or we want to um you know have that opportunity and I and I feel like we have enough talent uh on two groups the\nPenalty kill on the other side we talked about it after the game on friday and on Saturday friday's goals on the power play one was amiss coverage and nice playing transition on flat at school the other just a an unlucky bounce\nTo ... off of a block pass or was that the difference just luck or good bad luck turning to even neutral luck between friday and Saturday\nWell I think one of those lock I mean their first probably go I think I'm\nScott he would tell you to it's a\nYou know whether it's a full body or whatever it's a it's lucky you create your own puck luck but uh [noise] that's

just cruised atop the page which of the show ends or click open a new tag we don't mind either way click shop now to get tickets for friday and Saturday Night and\nGuerra one thing that\nKind of has been in the early storyline of the season is the difficulty of this schedule that this team has faced facing first or second place teams are teams that have been in first and second place in the division in every weekend\nUp until this weekend how do you think that first of all I think that the teams handled the challenge of what computer rankings of legitimately says the toughest scheduling leagues so far\nYeah I don't really look at any of the computer rankings um we look at our group day by day and we feel that our group has come together as a team I'm\nYou know from day one 'til now we feel we've grown\nExponentially and so it's it's one of those situations right now where we just want to focus on ourselves whoever the point is that weekend we're going to get prepared to video I'm but our games not going to change and that's something that we want to make sure that we focus on because\nYou know sixty game season it's a long season but the most important thing is to make sure that we're playing our best hockey game sixty and beyond into playoffs so\nUm it's a learning curve for some players that that do not have the experience of junior hockey if this point but the nice thing is you know what they've been thrown in the fire against some of our biggest rivalries\nAnd up to this point we've done a very nice job so we're excited about where we're at and you know where teams are going to continue to grow\nAnd they the old saying is iron sharpens iron it seems like as the teams to rise to challenge against not just rivals but really good teams it's told us a lot about this team and it's just Halloween right now\nIt is and you know what our whole divisions really strong and so we don't anticipate too many weekends where it's going to be an off weekend some other divisions have that opportunity and that luxury but um you know from top to bottom our division you know tends to be pretty strong every season and so it's it's something where every week and we\nUh whoever we play against we know what's at stake and we know that we have to play our best sixty minute effort you know on friday and Saturday Night to get the W\nYou know you talked about the video scouting and that's one of the I think the coolest things that you get to do during the week is be able to kind of break down individual plays the players and groups\nHow has that evolved from when you first started doing beyond say during the two thousand twelve to ... team the first time I saw you doing video says your first year here with the bobcats how was that evolved in the last six years well you\nKnow when I first started here a lot of the video was\nUm we wanted to opponents video or make sure we broke down the opponents what what their tendencies where their power play penalty kill 'em and then over the last couple three four years we've brought it to you know even six years ago we did our own film after friday night game but now we've got involved in to do an individual film with players\nAre doing lined lines film\nUm you know doing a lot of different things with with our film and with a you know statistical analysis and so\nYou know as a sport grows and how different ideas come out from some of the people that have a you know obviously ... higher hockey IQ than I Do um but as they start coming up with different things that can help players develop and help players have success that's something that we've tried to implement here in Bismarck and\nUh you know hopefully we can continue to grow in in ...\nHelp players have success that's something that we've tried to implement here in Bismarck and\nUh you know hopefully we can continue to grow in in what we're trying to do in the amount of video that we shore guys\nWithout showing them too much to where they're too focused on you know what they're you know job is each and every night and so you don't want to show too much video to where they're thinking about it on Friday Saturday night you still want\nPlayers to play from the belly because it is a game that\nIs played pretty fast and you have to have instincts to be successful so we want to give them kind of you know an idea what to expect in areas that they can focus on getting into the week something that they can ... that they can utilize in practice but once the game starts you know you need your hockey players will be hockey players\nAnd it seems like a lot of it just kind of getting to observe of watch them from my desk to your desk during the film sessions one of the big things is just kind of little reminders like okay you're here maybe if you're two feet to the left\nThis is something just to keep in mind almost kind of little prompts a little refresher is that it's not overwhelming to the guys but just little tweak so they know this isn't a huge thing if I change this whole thing the outcome could be wildly different\nWell when you get to this level you're not trying to ... changed the identity of a player you're trying to change a little habits and it's something that you know let's face it if if you play the game for Seventeen Eighteen years up until now you may be haven't seen yourself on video too many times and so to be able to see yourself for the first time and\nYou know let's face it you always think maybe you're playing a little bit harder than you are and and you see some of the mistakes that you might make or some of the lack of effort situations that\nYou know tend to happen over the course of the game it it just might give you a different perspective perspective so um I think videos a huge tool um we don't sit there and try to change of players style or how they play the game we just want to give them a little helpful reminder so that they can be a little bit more successful in that next up and coming we consumers\nWill get we thank you very much for some by Cheryl times they're a little insight into some of the behind the scenes parts of a week to week

Blue Book private sale yeah yeah my husband is that at thirty two that's how much it's I'm currently live I I'm Sorry thirty two or twenty\nI made a mistake it that the early badly thirty three ... and the Kelley Blue book is thirty kill oh gray not too far\nOkay so you can only lose a thousand dollars by selling that car you'd only write a check for a thousand dollars it'd be sold it for thirty two but you had to give the least couldn't be thirty three to get the title you're a thousand and the whole right right right now your lease payment is how much\nMy [laughter] at least eight minutes five hundred and forty two dollar them I\nMean how many how many payments do you have remaining well we have about eight Kmart payments okay\nI'm just putting that in here that's nine thousand five hundred Seventy six dollars mhm mhm so if you sell it today you lose a thousand if you keep it you lose ten thousand\nYeah no brainer salad okay okay you see how the analysis now let's look at the second one then right what's the value of the second one\nSo the value of the second vehicle is twenty five okay in the early buyout on it\nThat early buyout on it at ... o'clock in the early ... twenty five okay I haven't done the Kelley Blue book 'em out but I'm sure it ... I think actually I'm at but I live in town then for that one where really in the hall okay and what is the lease payment on it\nAt least payment is two hundred and thirty dollars a month or right and how many of those are remaining fourteen my payment\nK. so that um let's see here to thirty or forty and is thirty two hundred dollars if you keep the car till the end of the leash and hand them the case right\nYeah ... ... s to thirty times fourteen okay and that one is somewhere around fourteen thousand and the whole today okay so you get to drive this car for free\nUntil the end of this lease on that one you keep it because I'd rather lose thirty two hundred and fourteen thousand and I drive the car\nOkay you see what I'm doing yes comparing a total of your payments\nAgainst the amount you're in the whole\nSo that one that one I Would probably keep it for your husband's numbers are correct on the value I suspect there and I suspect you're going to keep it anyway because I don't think he's going to be that far off I mean we've got a fourteen thousand dollar deficit right now if he if he's eleven value is right\nBut even if he's half wrong it's still a seven thousand dollar deficit versus three thousand to keep it\nSo that one we keep\nOkay and you pay it out now is it over on miles\nNo that wasn't the way I'm drawing mile\nOK and the wear and tear you're going to keep it up so you're not going to have to write a check when you turn it in fourteen months from now\nNow they're both saying that well that one's in great condition\nOkay good good yeah that one or you see how I did that analysis\nYes yeah that really clear that out track we were really struggling with what you\nI don't know really being that one and\nAsked a baby step to\nOnce you've gotten rid of the the big car the more expensive one and once you've gotten rid of all your other debts except this but if you still have this one with the two thirty payments were just renting a car all the way through the end here and you might as well keep the car you get no advantage to turning it in our early\nRight right you're going to write the three thousand\nTwo hundred and twenty dollars worth of two hundred and thirty dollar payments no matter what you do so you might as well drive the dad gummed car you know and um if you want to put thirty two hundred dollars aside extra in your emergency fund just to make sure you got that plus your emergency uncovered the call yourself in baby steps two and three then that's fine\nBut that's how you do the analysis on whether to keep a leash or not and um most of the time unless you're close unless you're close to the end of the lease you're going to be selling the car and that's what happened with the more expensive one there it's killing you know that one was a beast\nBite ya so good question thank you for joining us ... if you've never heard the saying it's kind of a country saying you're getting fleece\nWhich means it it's it's like a a a sheep getting its for removed that's where it comes from your getting ripped off this ... means that's why I call them car fleet says because if we take the value of the original\nMarket value of that car that thirty three thousand dollar car on the expensive one there for those folks and I put that five forty two into a calculator and then I put the in value into a financial calculator with residual value at the end in other words the residual values what you can buy the car for at the end of the lease\nYour your games up number at the end of the least you put those numbers on the calculator you come back out what the effect of interest rate is\nIn motion of the time it's around fourteen percent they call it cost a capital and they don't have to disclose\nThe interest rate da PR to you you know if you get a car loan you get this there's truth in lending sheet that the Federal Trade commission makes makes them show you the a PR the annual percentage wretched you're being charged but when you're leasing it's technically not that\nAnd so you 'cause you're renting a car [noise]\nAnd so they are not required federally to disclose the cost of capital or the interest rate [noise] but you can figure it out with a calculator that'll make you view [noise]\nI mean it's ridiculous that's why we call it's leasing is the most expensive way to operate car the car leasing is a disaster\nIt's a disaster as a financial issue [noise]\nIf you just do the math you can understand what I'm saying\nThis is that Iran's ... [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make\nAs an example if you're a business owner needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dot com slash Dave to hire the right person\nWe don't Carolyn how are you ready to for you know pirates of the world is Thirty years\nMark ...\nOn the grill\nYeah and I don't you know we had some hard times we did not everything was not easy you know wasn't it wasn't a just a cake walk the whole time but but we are we worked hard and I think it brought us together for sure we um we always had a goal that was\nThat was right in front of us and that that was one thing we didn't fight about I mean like any other company we fight about stuff for sure who was that when we were I Know that wouldn't be one of the most important ones we were not Iran sent bridge\nLove it yeah that's one of our biggest things even with a telling people when we when we're hosting are leading a few classes biggest thing is guys get on the same page because we never fight about money mhm awesome really cool\nSo do they listen when you tell them\n\nI think we definitely had some resistance definitely you know it's um all all the stuff you talk about why would you if you get zero percent there was an interest why would you not do it it's free money ... no I don't get it\nThe differential what is the key to getting out of that you've done at your coaches your blood classes you've done everything\nI think the key is vision I think you have to see where you're going I think
