with me [laughter] but anyway the uh uh we tell people not to buy a home unless your debt free how much debt do you have\nTo get it we have about forty five thousand dollars and ...\nI Would pay that

year membership\nYes sir\nYou think so why she's pressure off of it\nI think that me and my me and her mother would sit down with her and explain to her um\nGo to the house it's free okay I'm going to give it to you but I'm only going to give it to you on the condition that she attends with you OK because if you go by yourself it'll cause a divorce is you're going to get more and more and more and more\nExcited about getting out of debt and living with a plan and you it's going to drive a wedge further between you own I don't want to do that\nSo I just if you can talk her into just attending

financial position rusty membership\nFor a year and that includes the nine lessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else um but do not do this without her it's a it's

kind of make the U.S back anything we kind of let them know we weren't going it alone in the more money because\nThey had made no effort to to reimburse anything of it\nAnd and there was no communication to indicate me on her famous back well you know as life goes several months later they're only vehicle broke down\nAnd um and it could not be repaired and my son had no way to get to work and this is where it gets sticky let 'em knowing that my wife had to take care of her parents trustworthy dispersion funds to all the fisheries recruiting him\nWe both agreed to front about Ninety percent of what the what we see with the understanding that he would immediately pay us back when the checks or in\nSome of the logic was it they were bar income is on that they are already ... her parents\nToday we have not distributed that many but it's getting it's getting a little stick here here it's going to be distributed next couple of weeks and we wouldn't do what you do in the

to work to help out\nSo my angle is ten percent of marriage and because they have not given a tribute to responsibility pain backyard alone I have strongly suggested that and I think that's about as far as that goes to my wife's side that my wife write the check to them and had to come over and sided over just\nAnd we would write them a check for the balance of what they did ... how do we didn't we didn't read them and it seems simple I mean we know that if we approach it that way that would be successful\nAnd what a lemonade the temptation that using them and I said right not ... the greed

I work for the postal service that have been a student loan debt of like um about Fifteen thousand dollars [laughter]\nAnd um [noise] I have two friends one of them as I'm\nAsking me to go for a business\nOr like a friend um subway business so I was thinking about taking a loan for that and my other friend if I'm all for me like to go buy a house with and to share like a two family house so I take one apartment he thinks the other\nAnd it's going to be or what a mortgage growing too so I wanted to know what should I Do\n... ... well\nWe tell folks to borrow money around here if you listen to the show very much the shortest path to wells and peace and your finances is to avoid that and on top of that I Would tell you to avoid partnerships as the only ship that won't sale\n\nSo um what that means is is that if you still want to remain friends with both these guys I Would suggest to say no because at the end of the stories are nightmare\nGoing in partners with somebody in debt to go into the restaurant business would you do know squat about is a good way to end up bankrupt and lose your friendship forever going in partners for somebody to buy a house\nAnd then he doesn't pay is half or can't pay his head off or you don't pay your can't pay your half is ah when I was a precursor to the ending of a friendship and a foreclosure\nShown no I wouldn't do either one of those and that's my reasoning\nI think you'll have a lot better life have you avoid both of those paths\nAnd you can you can develop a career path that does not involve you're going into debt to start a business it's a matter of fact most businesses start without that\nThey just start small\nWe started this one without the card table my living room we didn't have a big fancy studio we went down to the local radio station drove over there and they let us use their stuff because we work for free there\nNow is figure out a way to get going and you what we call bootstrap it and it works\nBut you

applying and I just I Can't find a job and I don't know what to do\nWell I I Would assume that\nWould be an insurance company is correct\nYeah I I've [noise] through the end of my last year of school

I've been even doing accounting\nLike accounts male any ... receivable [noise] you know entry\nLevel stuff mhm are you there is get your foot in the door\nI'm OK well here's here's one thing I Will tell you and Ken Coleman I'll tell you this is will go to the Ken Coleman show dog Tom and download his free PDF on how to put together a resume but resumes in applications without relationship are useless\nUm I'll give you an example uh we have\nEight hundred people here just under a hundred people work on our team we hired a hundred and fifty to two hundred last year we had Fifteen thousand the applications\nFor those honored hires you get lost in that ...\nAnd ... there's not that I don't wanna answer and talk to every one of those Fifteen thousand people is just logistically not reasonable answer what ends up happening is you get lost in the stock of that stuff unless you know someone that works there and you don't have to be best friends with them you just 'cause I got to tell you we don't ever hire somebody because somebody called me and says are\nEver but we would give them an interview and pull their pull the resume out of the stack you got to get out of the pile you know\nAnd so some of these places are trying to get on with you need to figure out if your sister that's married a kids play soccer where the guy that works over there or something like that where you can find someone that will put in a little bit of a word for you to at least get the door open\nAnd that'll get you in the door again you you're not going to get hired because of that kind of a reference matter of fact there are very few references where you just calls up somebody and I get your higher that almost never happens that'll decent job anyway I mean as\nHiring this bodies you see at all or something like that but at a good job they're really going to want to interview you and learn about trees and that will be true here so we don't guarantee anybody a higher but we will at least talk to them and\nYou know what might be a very short conversation though you don't qualify than setting or looking for at least we'll all go and get the resume out of style if somebody knows I'm Sorry go download that\nListen we can on the show he'll help you and all this stuff is very very difficult out there but I think you can leave some\n\n[noise]\n\n\nIn the world would you trust some random guy in a Q when getting your mortgage you really think he cares about your lungs are money goes boy doesn't\nThose companies care about getting you and do whatever home loan program they're pushing that week when it comes to ordering a cheeseburger the meal deal works fine but let's get real people were talking about the largest investment you'll probably ever make so don't be naive and trust in order taker who pressures you into a pre packaged alone\nI deserve a new house in a new car I deserve a trip and they spend money like water you've seen him do it oh yeah definitely and I it's craziness did all you did was ... years kept living like a broke college student\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years out because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important stuff that I thought\nYeah 'cause now I I mean you make three hundred four hundred five hundred were a remake ... you're going to be unbelievably will the hit show you said your whole thirty thirty one thirty one oh\nWe'll just fabulous and congratulations I guess I'm so proud of you who was your biggest cheerleader I Know you have to have the tractors that was easy yeah but who is the biggest cheerleader uh I Would\nSay my parents ah my mom had followed you for years and older people in my church family as well because they are I talked a lot about you and we're encouraging me not to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans\nYeah yeah so I mean you went from being completely crushed by student loan debt to completely own and it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the day I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't\nReally have another planet so I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later\nYou pay them almost two hundred thousand a year for two years ... ... you were on which is pretty incredible but you're making four Fifteen minus taxes which takes a big chunk of and so you weren't living you weren't the orange barge on anything now\nAre you weren't starving to death but you weren't splurging and just completely lean to show as you're going along you're you're hitting this thing when you're hitting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah I'm Fifteen to twenty a month to only given month\nAt what point when you started doing that did you go wait a minute this was actually going to work how far in war you before the before kind of the ... which kind of flipped for you\nWell I paid off all the smallest ones first I had a total of twenty different student loans and so I was able to attack the smallest ones first and then once I saw how easy it was to do that\nAnd then I started to have some more hope that that would be at what a pay off the largest ones I think my largest individual alone was right around fifty thousand dollars and prior to that I just looked at it and it was like there is no way like there's I'm not going to be able to do this\nSo your trunk and some of these like one or two a month yeah knocking on the little baby ones when he first started yeah and that yeah but I had to give you a lot of emotional boost deaf in his debt snowball really kicked in for you than they did what he was supposed to do it let you know that this is going to work\nMhm wow wow wow wow wow wow\nAll right so what is the big takeaway when someone says oh I I'm a ... year hundreds of thousands I Can't get out of debt you say yes you can here's what you do you do this\nI think the most important thing is just to stop running from it stop trying to hide from it like I was trying to do um I was I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never get a day and I once I faced it and once I took personal responsibility for it\nAnd you realize that I'm the one who signed the papers balloons you know I Need to get myself out and then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change or your parents' good with money\nAnd they are their income is much less sure didn't know what mine is but I learned most\nPeople's [laughter]\nYeah I definitely learned how to live on a budget for my parents and also um they had been in quite a bit of a credit card debt in the past they always told me you know don't be stupid with credit card ... I'm ... smart purchases and so I think I learned a lot of those principles and then\nYou know there was a there was a sense a character that came from them that they cause you to be able to do this that's what I was thinking\nYeah very good very good well I'm proud of you know they are well done very well done what a great great story we've got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired that's the next chapter in your story\nAnd we want you to go and be a millionaire you'll be done about twenty minutes and uh and outrageously generous as we go along well done very very well on\nTouch down April from state College Pennsylvania hundred and eighty thousand dollars paid off in twenty two months making four Fifteen E.

leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off I'm Alone when it doesn't include all the interest from\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time so the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that when it's what's fake by the car off and get the title in your hand\nThen you compare that to KB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sale what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole probably not far off of what you're going to find\nSo four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer and so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the hole\nIdle for the buyer and so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole that your hand the amount that you are upside down\nAnd the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank\nAnd you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car for as much as you can possibly get for it which is more than they will show at four in the report lot so bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the difference is greater\nAnd you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession\nAnd so you cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are\nSo um they ribs utility to borrow money no direct she's telling you to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the doubt by doing that and so you borrow and cover the amount that you're upside down\nYou know guys we been talking a lot about this millionaire mindset around here and

coming\nAnd yeah I was a um April nineteenth the duty great\nYeah excited so with that I was a ... going to use you know get the thousand dollar emergency\nFund and he was forty six hundred to pay off bills yeah but now with the baby\nAnd what how we should kind of attack that\nWhat I Would suggest you do is push paws on your total money make over ... okay and pile up cash has begun pile as you can pile between now and the time by becomes okay and um\nAnd then whatever you are piled up and and then when mommy and baby come home from the hospital in everybody's fine in April\nWas that event is then behind us in any worries are frets or anything we would have had about that is behind us right\nUm well I mean there's the whole thing of raising the baby but I you know eight eight years yeah there's now but I but basically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery and everything goes and we don't have any hiccups him when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now it's about a Seventy seven thousand okay\nSo let's say you save up twenty five thousand hours between now and then to you until you twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your total money make over and take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it at the at a student loan you will have lost no ground\nOkay unless you go baby spending crazy during the next few months\nWe had a lot of stuff like this is our second child ... you had a lot of stuff the only thing that would be a little bit different and if they skated

ready for\nYou know an eight pound human being I mean they just go nuts and so if you'll just calm down and just you know manager budget like you were trying to get out of debt but instead of throwing it at the debt you keep everything tight you throw it in a pile of cash and then we don't spend it on baby a than is necessary for my survival\nThey don't have you been doing the best [noise]\nThat there was this episode of you think you know movies and make sure to subscribe like as long as they used to look both on Twitter and get the latest movie and TV news on screen writing dot com\nMhm [noise] [noise]\nI'm all for ABC News up on top of the hour we're talking well\nThe day room she\nWas always a AAA eight to five\nFive two to five Brittany\nIs with us in Johnson City Tennessee Hi Brittany how are you I'm good how are you that it's better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] okay so my husband and I got a piece for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance part before we purchased our life insurance and we got part permanent part terms and of course we watch the insurance part last night and we just got\nOn the insurance about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and we immediately wanted to get rid of the term or sorry the permanent and just have term and he said Dave Ramsey is talking about oh a permanent insurance not portfolio base permanent insurance which is what you have\nTo do is it still bad shall we still didn't get the terms\nI don't know what you doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey [laughter] because they Ramsey does not ever invest I was real clearing the lesson you heard me yeah when you are never tell you under any circumstances to use life insurance and investment vehicle\nOne hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhich so you need more new financial advisor okay that's what I Would show you you don't have a natural advisor you have a life insurance salesman okay the shelling you in church\nSo what we were thinking we should do is put to four hundred thousand just of term H. and then the money we were 'cause it was like three hundred dollars a month which I'll do a lot yeah um and just go ahead and open up our rah rah are IRA and start getting money into that\nAnd in bed with mutual funds okay that's exactly what you learn in class was uh yeah so you already knew what she said yeah he just language tells me one of the things you do this guy's a lawyer or he's are ignorant\nBut [laughter]\nHe's a family friend who's in the\nUm actually one of our friends just apparently gave them our number because they use and for it as well\nYeah yeah okay so I don't know which it is I mean I I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nAnd the last thing it on our term policy\nThat sounds like well Oregon that down on him and and that they actually\nCount right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically [noise] um\nThe people who sell investment based or [noise]\nWhole life or permanent life or portfolio or universal or anything where there's an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me and so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap crap in a bag that's what it is okay\nIt's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred percent [noise]\n\nSometimes up to forty years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees\nEven after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money and that's where you should be when you die with cash value permanent portfolio universal\nIndexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you about ready to return and when you die they keep it all\nThis is a bad savings account it's bad investment for over the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nAnd that's what they Ramsey has always said for twenty five years here on the air upset it for twenty five years is a line of owned myself\nI have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind ever not did get a horrible northwestern mutual\nWhole wife grotesque\nOld school and one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college came around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from it\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never own that and since then I've never told anyone to buy\nAnything other than Fifteen to twenty two year term life insurance\nIn anything other than Fifteen to twenty two year term life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you\nThe best way to buy life insurance is through a broker that shop several companies the best way to buy insurance have any connoisseur a broker that shop several companies and get you the best possible deal\nOr the ... car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance sure life insurance or insurance of any kind letter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deals\nAnd that's why we've indoors for about Twenty years ... insurance Jeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from Zander and I don't own Zander insurance around any of it that show that why that's always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement\nBut the reason he done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds and they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either\nSo that's why I've endorsed it's real simple it takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much so just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again\nYet again yet again yet again yet again yes you need life insurance out by the way a broker ... you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with could get with the help they usually indoors local providers for your ... what we called PNC property and casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance\nYou can shop\nMost people say three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business a captive agent can sell for one company like a state for major\nForeign nation wide in Asia\nPeyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent [noise] was it nationwide that's nationwide and now\nBut um and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that but you're paying for those guys\nWhen you when you use that insurance is ... it's built in\nAnd neither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nFocus is one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for their new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this\nOne was the last time you checked on your financial plant you heard me or do you even have one\nHome with a mortgage\nSo we just we quit borrowing money so you do whatever you want to do will be your friend either way but the way I live my life is how I answered questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability and up terms in down times\nEnjoy to not have
