Chevy put good shepherd lazy preferred Chevy dealer bobcat hockey puck which Chabrel a respect comes standard finding heroes [noise]\nGet over one for the bobcats here this evening is they've got to find a way to play sixty minutes um hockey obviously last night's game a big improvement over the previous two games against my not because the bobcat didn't have an entire period where\nThings just wear off my kids were able to put together a very strong first period to search of a strong second period and three quarters of a strong first surgery to use\nThis as opposed to or not having very good search periods in the previous two games against my not before the Thirteen day lay off so being able to find it\nMore of a consistent effort for the bonds get very important last night\nUh especially against the minor league team that always works hard there's never going to quit and if we don't get to be able to summon that kind of effort against their arch rivals very telling about uh what kind of character this team has after especially what a tough period they had the last time they were here\nBack on October the six\nSo that was an encouraging sign for the bobcats but still last night there was that last eight minutes of the search your second period after vigilance he made a three nothing and the first five or so minutes of the third period for the cats were able to get it together and to re exert their will\nOn the pace of play in the position of the game and\nThose were really dicey at Harry [noise] seven or eight to ten and eleven minutes of the game for the broadcast my master I forget about it but [noise]\nIf the bond cats hadn't had a strong ever from John robbers especially at the end of that second period you think about the safety made on power six and a half minutes ago right after a while in skis insurance go and then the huge save he made on but while with just over a minute left in the second period\nWithout those two states you're talking about a much different game heading into the third period inside the markets where the third period the three nothing lead a lot of them played differently than if they'd had a one or two goal lead and that allowed them to get a little bit looser and get back into their style of game which again once they settled into it was about Fifteen minutes left\nThey kind of pulled away and control the rest of the way\nEven tacking on another goal off the stick them seeing Malinowski so\nVery very promising for the bond gets but now they need to find a way to take that\nEleven twelve Thirteen minutes fan where things were a little rickety last night and be able to route that out as well and it's certainly possible we know that the teams got a lot of talent ... it's a matter of putting it together and we saw that a little bit more last night it's no surprise\nPossible we know that the teams got a lot of talent it's a matter of putting it together and we saw that a little bit more last night it's no surprise when you think about the light up the bobcats had last night because ... death was bonkers for the vibe yet because\nAt just the fourth one last night what line last night and look at the charts none of bears this was the fourth line\nWas Kerner Irene and granted [noise]\nThree college do you want to come\nIt's absolutely insane that\nThat was the fourth line for the

related with symbol last night and runs out of that\nAd bars that vice it into the mix and bart out there with Taylor and Marty was a one man Wrecking Crew three points\nIn his bobcat debut and all of a sudden the bobcat just went through the roof and so not only because they didn't play last weekend but also because of the crazy depth and the coaches knowing that they could just send out whatever line they wanted to have confidence and that's\nAble to get more rush for everybody else the bobcats were more fresh is the game went on and that showed as their effort improve and their output and their results improved\nAs they gain got deeper into the third period on Friday nights\nNow just because they have that job right now does it need that they could just say okay we got the debt for good the efforts got to continue and having that effort through the first second third period sixty minutes job one key one on your public Tripoli freaky the gate and takes us to key number two\nOn the buckled Chevrolet three keys here this evening and for the bobcat is again that five on five off and the thing that you like about the five on five often says that it's worth three goals last night in fact because up by them five out scored the power play three to one it's now\nIn terms of goals scored so far that he's been for the bobcat as that they have thirty goes on the air fifteenth scored on the power play fifteenth scored vibe on why and [noise] the thing that you like about that is the bobcats were very opportunistic and were able to score\nWell in transition both vice and goals scored in transition\nThat it it didn't mean the bucket Israel to get to go on to the fore check\nWhich they only have two votes on the porch echo season before last night's it's not that based

Internet search 'cause he's raw public documents\nAnd then you contact the owner now you hope it's the bank because if it's still in the name of the previous owner or they're going to tell you to go pound saying they don't care I mean they're losing everything anyway I mean the worse that happens\nIf you get a judgment against them let's say three hundred dollars okay just get in line because we've lost our house but he didn't got credit is like already\nThere and their distaste and their son took off\nThen you have to find out who owns a property 'cause that's where you going to go or you just pay for it and just suck it up I mean the people that are squatting next door they don't have any responsibility or how bad is your problem with this\nWell it it to the point I haven't done I hadn't said anything to anybody 'cause I don't see anybody coming in and out but it it\nIs a hanging over at least half\nIraqi are it's a lot how much do you think it's going to cost to clean that up\nWell I think it's quite large and the author about ten inches wrong\nOh yeah All right so you've got an issue I so I get a bad and I don't know how well how you doing for money are you living get paid for oh good All right because then the next question was going to be like are you living in a dumpster and is it nice and clean and ah\nSo that's not the case I Would just pay for it and just have it done and then find out who owns a property and just send the bill oh okay that's and then a threat in the same small claims court as I said if the bank owns that they'll clean it up because that's just what they do I mean they're\nTrying to sell the house and they don't want any liability and ah [noise] they're they're pretty good about that especially if you're talking small potatoes
