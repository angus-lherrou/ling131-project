in my writing are out there that had like hot and dry the charge for anywhere\nOr did you call the dollars that\nWe can do a maximum of five hundred dollar and I said I read provide my credit card number a new days later I when I log on my online credit card account and noticed that there was a Indian charge for forty five hundred dollar I immediately contacted the credit card company and said hey look\nYou know I only authorized up twenty five hundred dollars and I've seen them hanging hard forty five hundred\nThat day to day stand look you know that that was on the Indian lie to bank however wanted accurate registered that won't be level and the holy my window and all the ... when the party actually posted it was for over five thousand dollars\nYou're going to lay off ... days later I logged back into my online account and ... there was another man in charge of the same hotel we're over seven thousand dollar reach out all the credit card company again that hey look there's a larger role as having a thousand dollars\nIs this is Roger ... a being use right now I only authorized them really my hundred dollar how would you there's already a vote them out brokered by the house and\nUm and they said to me they said you know there's nothing we can do with it and in charge and has been with your vendors already charging hard want thinking how many times they want and at the end of the day there was over twelve thousand\nDollar home and your friends spent twelve thousand dollars of one hotel Iraq while there was a friend there is a friend of yours brilliant\nExactly my question to you is that when I reach out to the credit card company before getting providing right around the credit card number and they gave me the word that they're that no more than twenty five hundred dollars would you charge job and then\nYou know quietly they're building ... or drop drive and you have a record\nYeah you do and here's the problem you're going to have though and a daddy is uh they're simply going to deny it oh we didn't see that or a policy has led us to do that and I wish you and send an email or to the credit card company but I don't know how many people would actually do that\nBecause you know your friend you didn't know your friend with the the uh you to come for their word and so I I'm not I'm not going to call you idiot on this one because I think a lot of people would have done the same thing I I probably would've done the same thing so you tell your age your tire issue is\nUh that uh the credit card company I told you that you're reliable it's twenty five hundred dollars that's all they're gonna charge and then you started arguing the dispute everything right down the line now on there and I'm Sorry go ahead\nOh you're going to have taken those dams and I just you know these charges and through their quote unquote investigation they come back and said you know what we're going to stand by those charges you are held liable\nWhen did they what did they say about the twenty five hundred dollar limit conversation\nUh when I when I discuss with them to hang around with representative I spoke with several conversations with different rebel and tried to climate change within the credit card company some of them said oh you know I mean it's unfortunate that there is representative made a mistake when she authorized only up to twenty five hundred dollars but you know what it's her mistake\nThey don't want her ... her mistake and it doesn't matter that she works for us a mistake come on give me a break on that one now or is there any record in your file that says twenty five hundred dollars a limit have you talked to anybody to look at the notes\nI've asked that they got him to look at them out and yeah you don't get very involved this now I said look obviously all your all your phone call\nAnd I went through to one of the younger than she acknowledged that there were several conversations that he would walk in with them and I can tell that are out here on the phone call as you can understand why would come ... come from the heart of what\nI'm hearing on the recording thing that I received a letter on if I could have an army doesn't oriented obviously they have no right but I think\nIn the mail the there were conversations only or different days and so we documented on their\nLead writer so you've got so what's going to happen is going to turn it over the collections you're going to disputed a collections or get a danger credit and at that point unfortunately I'm even when they you just tell them sue me just go ahead and to me uh and we'll talk about this I Will later on what you have to worry about is your um does your credit\nThat this was an hour ago where I was in the payment on the credit card\nWait a minute have you gone over the twenty five hundred dollars I have not ... that's why we have right right and then here's here's the only advice you go up as far as you can in the food chain\nI and or if you've done that and just keep on going over and over again find out who the vice president is in terms of stupid employees or that put a lot more on credit cards and they should there ... there are certainly a vice president that does that somewhere in the system and at the same time I had the collection well once you uh\nI Would cancel the card and talk and just get right into it and say hey because what's happening is you're paying interest on the entire amount and you're going no place and that's just stupid to\nPay interest on twelve thousand dollars when I was twenty five hundred dollars so I you just I Would stop paying let them know you're stopping a payment based on this you're disputing I'm assuming you're turning over the collections I'll be fighting that\nAnd there will be legal action taken if my credit and if you try to collect that simple and then I Would call and you may even want to go to a lawyer a collection lawyer a debt a quick call was a yeah just collections lawyer and died and buying an hour of time or just ask\nA is am I doing everything right and we are I mean I don't know ...\nAnywhere anywhere else to go I mean fighting credit
