you know and Saturday not Sunday here in the mid west but Saturday was whether only ... oh my gosh that little just a little bit of snow on on Saturday morning a little sleep windy that was bad when you were down by Clinton, Missouri which are kind of in the central part of the state more or less kind of a\nMore to the west side board at West side\nSame thing only different cold the wind was bad

fishing there you know you don't slip in a minute or anything but they're not insulated you and the problem was you've got these\nBig thick padded feet and you gotta Abou crammed in at ... on it\nYou don't want a real type ... when you're going out into the swamp and these were way too tied by the time we got done and I could barely walk my feet hurt so bad\nAnd yeah and that's how they do have some sympathy or no shot the hell out of all we did we got our limit those days I mean it was off I tell you what man ... mostly\nMallard we've got a few ... a couple of a deal and a couple of wood that if anything have you ever tried to what that is I have have you ever found anything in their throats this first one that I that I grabbed a hold of it had a big not and it's fair to me it was it got cancer or something it was a pecan it was like a small pecan but it was a nonetheless a con\nHey thank you thank you for the invite\nYou bet ya well Bob how you doing my buddy out there a duck hunting today\nMark I'm going to say well we had a hoot today a went out this morning or early Twenty one ducks are we a finished up about twelve thirty one o'clock and uh you know hunting good we need a migration in the state of Missouri\nNeed some cold weather we need cold weather definitely we need more snow and the Dakotas\nLenny brag about Bob for our listeners that don't know Bob Bob is a ten times or he said that calling champion and eleven time regional calling champion man those attacks on top of that he's just truly one of the good guys and the doors that Bob just not no stranger than the only downside to Bob is he didn't know how to catch\nCrappy [laughter] hopefully one of these days I'm going to be able to learn you about that [laughter] I Hope you can mark [laughter] well\nLet's talk a little bit of duck hunting here let's start off with them you got any tips for for ...\nI Want to tell you what the more the merrier I mean that's the key it depends on where you're not if you're hunting in flooded grain a you know ten twelve a three dozen quality because I mean these ducks or worry now these are wise ducks\nUh we're dealing with a bad kind of a crop for as productive reproduction\nTook part in Canada we're dealing with really older dogs right now and I would say I mean it the better quality ducks you can put out and the more you can put out I mean I usually hunt oh five to seven hundred\nOh you gotta be kidding me no no I mean Neal this year we've we've been plagued by floods and the whole bottom ground or to North central Missouri and south central Missouri\nIs just been flooded out and there there's not a whole lot of feet so it's going to happen quick and fast to the doctor and go stay around for a long period of time\nSo I'm a big bunch and a big\nGroups I mean if you're ... next to the refuge and that's where my place he is my place borders on like wildlife refuge in North central Missouri\nI Would say I mean if you're hunting potholes everywhere they go with the quality good larger oversized ... ... I mean we spend our days spinners or legal to state of Missouri they're back legal in Arkansas and ah we hundred eight spinners today\nSo you do like some motion and it was\nAs I Love motion love motion I mean but I'm gonna tell you what sunshiny days that's the key sunshiny days are the days to hunt\nDo you have a like gay I said you spinners do you have a a certain number that you use or\nUsually we marquee just hunt with two or three but I've got some gifts from Iowa down here right now and uh right now I mean were they brought some spinners along ... seven day spinners day I mean we broke from groups of\nThe got 'em belly up the cause and uh it was pretty quick fix I mean it was it was nice seeing them set up we had an east when were you hunter my pits before the court the ducks had actually had to come over the backside and ducks do not like to come over anything for one or coming into the other ducks\nSo I mean that's the key for as\nIf you can minimize that every ... or in the mid west forest Mississippi fly away\nPredominant Windsor south south west\nEven during the wintertime a even during the fall migration south south west and if they can face their blinds to the north north east they're going to have that when they're back and ducks in your face that is the key for a successful though\nYou talked about the motion with the spinners can motion be a detriment I mean can there be a time when they split birds\nToo many too many at certain times so now cloudy days we hunt no spinners\nNone at all there is a smaller ... as far as these little ... out now that the little spinners small motion we have used those on cloudy days and been successful but I mean this last week this last week we didn't see sunshine in Missouri for six days\nNo that's right well we killed a hundred and forty ducks and six days I mean they you know I mean by using just one spinner and small motion now today the sun broke out we broke out the spinners\nNow I Would have thought it would have been the other way round spinners on a on a cloudy day because listen his ability in and less on a sunny day because of the increase in his ability markers\nNo rhyme or reason [laughter]\nDeal of it is I mean sunny days and this is the key for waterfowl hurdle cross country is that sun blocks out and partially blinds ducks as they turn into it and if your face and if you've got to southwest when in the fall\nThe son is in the south west to speak those ducks are company into that will they can't see it as well so I mean they fall and then come to the call uh-huh so I mean I like shooting blind a\nLot easier [laughter] I Need all the advantages that I did I hear you are you able to turn your centers on an awesome inside the mind do you have to get out and do that\nI don't ... I just turn 'em on leave them on and you get what you get\nYou and what you get what about if the wind changes direction or if you're coming out to another day and wins out of a different direction do you make any just with ... you know if you're saying that five hundred just leave him there and that way for the whole ...\nWell what we've got five hundred I mean we've got we've got two pit bond side by side and or or what I say we're hunting five hundred because they're actually out on each side in a horseshoe formation\nAnd the whole is facing northeast\nNow what we will do if like we get a strong south wind\nWill bring Fifteen or twenty ... around and make the hook for those duck some place actually ducks don't like to cut in over other dogs I mean they like to have a shmooze sliding area especially for the diver duck hunters\nDiver duck hunters wide open area that's a key so you clean the decor is out of which way the wind's whipping\nWhich gives you more wave action so I always say and it works much better for us the wind is coming out of south west\nWell you would make a hook that would come around to the north east and those ducks would want to land and that hook\nHuh Interesting and is it true if you got your your decoys set up in a body of water that's clear should you be that water out to make it look like next meeting in there and as a matter of muddy\nWater is a key I'm going to tell you I mean\nRoad right will drive vehicles we've got muddy water for floodwater anyway because I mean we flooded out we flooded out twenty seven times since the first year\nUp here in this area and crop is minimal but to answer your question block it out I mean get six or eight guys for guys go out there and walk through the because\nAnd make the water muddy 'cause I mean feeding ducks are churning up okay turn in the bottom up and make it look I mean a brown chocolate chocolate milk colored water perfect great perfect\nBut tell you what are some great tips there Bob and we got about a less than a minute left here in the first segment with you we're going to bring up the second segment I understand you've got somebody calls out there you're going to\nGo during the

what it does technically it and coils the meat strands and is it an coils that it allows spaces for the ... to penetrate into it\nAnd uh so then when you when you cook there is a lot more moisture and

the thing you need to realize about wild game of like deer elk steak there is no fat in them no there's no you cook a a nice ... by you know marbled little fat in there on the grill you know all that's what makes it taste good they're moist but with wild game you don't have very lean cuts of meat\nWhich makes it more important to use some type of the brine\nAnd then what it does here it says here on this while these dot com it makes the meat moisture by hide rating the sales of its muscle tissue before cooking and holds that moisture that's right\nAnd it says here um the ... they have

home advisor no here's Tom Chrysler\nCoast to coast and law enforcement shingles this is the money home improvement show on top Chrysler and today is a very exciting show for us because we're coming to you from Jamestown Rhode Island\n[noise] this is the site of the latest project for the forty a season of this old house in today is the final day of production we're right here and actually in the garage is a lot nicer than that sounds the surrounded by the cameras and the saw those to bring you the story of a very cool just completed by the spectacular team\nI'm not familiar with this area it's a very unique place with a lot of history Jamestown Rhode Island is a coastal town that says just across the Narragansett Bay from Newport which is home to many many famous mansions\nBut if it didn't happen to be named Vanderbilt or asked her do you may have decided to build a more modest cottage right here in Jamestown and\nMany of these houses date from the late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds when summer visitors built them to enjoy the ocean breeze isn't the Sandy beaches but today many of those dwellings remain on insulated\nAnd since they were originally bill just for the summer season there was really no need for insulation back then and that's what brings us to this old house which was rebuilt to increase energy efficiency but keep the old charm\nThat kick things off I'm joined by this old house any contractor Richard drifting we walk and Richard thanks so much sir Richard when we say that the goal was to make this home energy efficient we're talking like insanely energy efficient here because the plan was to make this a net zero house so those are not familiar with ... zeroes kind of explain that\nThere's a bunch of components to one is to make it insulated really well to make it incredibly tight and so we did that with our thirty walls in our forty ceilings and [noise] and we made it tight tight and then on top of it we\nWe did another thing called aero barrier to make sure that we\nWe controlled infiltration unbelievably I'll get back to the minute right so you got to make the place where the type then you've got to be able to make some electricity so we put\nEighteen solar panels on this brilliantly designed garage which just is behind the building away so nobody sees it it's the perfect dangle [noise] so it becomes this terrific collector for us and so we could make about five kilowatts of electricity so\nWe can make electricity were super tight we can make electricity in the last piece to have\nAnd if all this talk of home remodeling has you thinking about your next project\nYou can call in your home improvement question now to one eighty they money pit presented by home advisor dot com well this project involve both remodeling of a one hundred year old building\nAnd the building a brand new addition bringing those two together was the job or next guess Geoff swinger welcome just thank you now you do a lot of building the Narragansett area and then we have a lot of summer houses year that will probably never intended to be your own residences and and here we are putting heating systems in them and air conditioning\nAnd insulation and trying to make it all work in this case you had even a tougher job because you had to make this net zero so that had basically\nEssentially made all the energy that it needed now to do that you need to rely on a lot of systems with one of which was the insulation still talk to me about the installation that made it possible here\nYou know as you said this was a summer cottage are designed a\nYou know in the Nineteen twenties or so where you had some structural framing members that were only geared to support you know the roof load itself right now today's standards with the insulation and the energy codes we've got to make room for insulation or they might say that he's not even a\nSo we had to do a combination of insulated from the inside with super high a fish and stuff like quote sell a spray foam right then we also had to insulate on the exterior of the building\nSo we added to the outside just as much as we added to the inside because we didn't have all of a room on the inside right there on the advantage to to adding to the outside is that you create that thermal barrier\nAround the the framing members which are much more constructive and transfer heat last so\nSo that was a critical part of this project now to the inside the finish I I'd had a chance to walk through the house earlier just amazing carpentry in this job you guys did a really terrific uh work here with all of the detail and the trends in ceilings and stuff to talk about that\nWell uh I give credit to the architect John Powers who are really just thought about\nEvery space in the house and took advantage of his expertise and the design world and and really created a masterful a depiction of of water cottage built in you know cozy atmosphere would be in a\nYou know all we did was follow his lead in a and execute a but I I give credit to him he he took advantage of every single corner in the house\nAll the sounds of those are good partnership and unusual for you to have the architect is the home or you're killing his wife has the designer\nYeah well it was it was really a little bit intimidating to start with that because uh my you know held to a little bit of a higher standard has left up to it it really turned out to be a really mutual relationship you know we collaborated on a lot of things Don wasn't a so you know\nOur meals already you know right we were able to exchange ideas and um they were right down the road so it eliminated a third party in the middle so it really really did work out well and\nBut as you say communication really is key now the exterior this home had a lot of work done landscape you hit a landscape architect helping with that but ah you had to organize a part of the construction as well what was the challenge\nWhile the challenge was a it was a short\nI think helping with that but ah you had to organize a part of the construction as well what was the challenge\nWhile the challenge was a it was a short period of time where we had to make a lot of things happen and we had three different porches which uh you know cascaded down into the hearts gate\nAnd then we had a really extensive landscape plan you know it caught me by a little bit by surprise but when they started bringing the trees and the plants and\nI was amazed at how many plant things we ended up having and then they the landscape architect Tom Ryan did just a wonderful job it segment in different areas around the yard which are all\nMeaningful and well planned in a you know it it it came together\nWe can't wait to see it rollout chefs winter the builder on this project thanks so much for stopping by the money pit that was my pleasure\nYou can follow along with all the progress here in Jamestown

improvement shows coming to you today on location from Jamestown Rhode Island the site of the current project on this deep forty season\nOf America's most popular home improvement show this old house and one of the guys who's a part of the fabric of this old house for over twenty five years is general contractor Tommy soda and just keep getting younger don't\nThere are six years and maybe a van it's amazing I hear and I'm Down in the first few years [laughter] what you played hard to get I ... well maybe that's it I thought about that I turned it down because I work for my dad we would just do my dad he had didn't want any part of the details anyway but now we're too busy to\nExact on TV and stuff so I Want to talk with you first about the fact that a lot of the construction here was pre fabricated and I think when people think prefab or factory built they think well maybe it's not as good as what you could do my hand but that's not really the case here and ... you weren't specifically to things that you did hear that were just fascinating to me\nThe foundation first she said oh you can make everything in the house but you can't make the foundation\nNow you know you guys actually got a foundation three hundred miles away and brought it here they bring\nIn ... well free casts foundations insulated it's ... it has a concrete reinforced steel reinforced studying it insulated so there's no thermal break in that in that position and the studs up free drilled for the electrician to run his wires through and it's a fast\nEfficient way to put a foundation and\nThat's basically waterproof at the same time\nWhile in the building that we're in right now this is actually the garage that it probably the nicest garage out you've ever seen right but this was factory billed as well so\nThis is a pre cut building well you put it together everything's caught on a on a CNC so yeah so you know what's going to fit exactly right you know put the puzzle together and you've got a beautiful barn that looks like it was built onsite\nNow the challenge on this property was building at the net zero which means it basically has to be so tight so well insulated and uh so perfectly heated um that it it essentially makes all the energy needs to operate that involved a lot of different types of insulation or want to ask you about that because I I think it's unusual to see spray foam used to different types of Springfield open\nAnd close when it closed so and then you had sold ... million which are actually I Love that isolation I mean I think of it is it's basically rock writes funding to fight it molten rock radio\nAnd and and you it's a great installation if a sound that need for insulation and its water resistant well you know if it gets wet it's going to dry out\nNow you guys used a technique called warmer blanket on the exterior walls what does that mean well\nThat's the way you take the insulation the the stone will actually right now you can also use rigid film and you apply it to the exterior surface of the building so you framed the building in this case we had the old building we had to deal with the conventional walls right those are spray foam on the outside of the sheeting you have\nTo put a thermal barrier because you have to worry about the thermal bridging of the structure when it when it meets that different installations so in other words it could be some transfer of different temperature from the actual study ... and so you got to worry about condensation forming on the inside of the outside insulation\nIs that makes sense is that where does enter the sandwich right so in other words you're\nPutting something like a um it's it's ... like a house rats that you put on before you put your installation and it's like a range Greenville if any any condensation should occur in between that insulation it will run down and not damage that she\nWas actually has to be completely storm only separated ... yeah yeah it's almost like when you're building sounded the\nBuildings you put separate walls and never touch the same idea here which are firmly separating everything's in good shape and insulation exactly right yeah that's the trick now you also had to install the solar right which is on this building and you also the beautiful wood shingle roof here now which single roof is they're not done right and I've seen an awful lot of them and do you have to they write like\nSay rye fast if they're not you you have to ... you have to think of that ... a ... today is not like a witch jingle was say fifty two hundred years ago right the wood that you get from lumber is really farmed trees younger trees because all the ...\nHe's gone so now the wood will absorb\nMoisture and so on down the line so what you would do years ago you would have what is called skip sheeting right basically strapping their roof which spacing between it so the air could get underneath the roof shingles and dry and from underneath and from the son of a wood roof is like a wooden boat it has", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "20"}
