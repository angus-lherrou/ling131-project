is the uh is the\nUh financial institutions going even report they forgave the debt I think you're okay I really do the problem is uh do you say I've forgiven of this debt you say here's the amount I paid in insurance and I don't even know if you do that with uh the feds when filing an IRS a return\nIf you talk about the amount of money that you've paid in credit card debt or whether or not you have a negotiated a lesser payment for the bottom line is that yes that's considered income but it's considered income over the three years so it's what sixteen Seventeen hundred dollars a year\nIncome to the change much I don't know if you get audited you'll be tag for uh eight hundred bucks income tax so I don't know if I Would do it or not and the answer your question would have to go to my accountant which I'll be more than happy to give you the number of\nUh if you send me an email but that's a good question actually\nBecause uh there is that forgiveness and that is\nIncome

were both he and his mother how and now he just turned Seventeen\nHe says he doesn't want to go back with her he finally is you know having courage and he said he's not going back and it's\nOkay you know proud to convince them than what's your question so can he stay without\nSure that the court\nI mean what ... you know here's the point is she going to go into court and ask for custody of a Seventeen year old I mean that's what ... and windows how how many months ... days is he going to be turning Eighteen from this phone call\nWell he just turned ... air he just\nTurned okay so he just turned Seventeen believe me I'm a mom could go into court asked for custody and Seventeen year old son goes I you know what I don't want to live with\nMy mother it's over I wouldn't I wouldn't bother\nNow she could file for custody just make her make yours in his life miserable\nOh he's done that for all the here\nWell then he has to then would have been what happens is I she he well he can also here's a couple of other things you could do okay the number one\nIs uh that\nUh she filed against the father asking for sole custody and the court is going to say about what's this about will ask your ah we'll ask your grandson he could also argue to being emancipated minor\nAnd it's done and it's done a Seventeen I think the court will give it to him\nI have a job yeah okay I of course of course yeah you don't need a job to be an emancipated minor so you want to look into that but you know the bottom line is I don't think there's going to be a custody issue I really doubt\nA probably a so pencils on a street corner if it weren't for ah those clinics nicely said in Germany at one or two calls and say come on bill really and I will say do you have any pencils for sale [noise]\nAll right Tom Europe welcome [noise] hello [noise] okay I'm gonna get right to it [noise]\nOkay I worked for an employer for about three years I left that implement about a year and a half ago and during the three years I worked for them I worked a considerable amount of overtime or during the last six months I worked in an average of eighty hours\nPer week and it's a live wire ensue if you left a year and a half ago Tom why are you calling now\nWell that is part of my question I wanted to know a is there a time limit\nThere is a statue but you feel maybe within ah I I don't know if it's a year and I I don't have the statute in front of me uh but I think if you don't make the claim within certainly there\nOne year six months whatever it is if you are passed that time you're out of luck so the trick is for you to contact the state\nDepartment of industrial relation there's a whole section of a there's a whole section involved with wage enforcement and you can look on the website they'll have\nA state of California and then the the department industrial relations and then frequently asked questions or there'll be some somewhere there they don't talk about a statute okay\nYeah um can I can I ask you sure the question is if we assume because somebody told me it was three years okay and it could be if we assume\nThat um you know I'm within the time I'm One of the things about it is um during the last six months that I work was eighty hours a week um the the manager wife\nUh passed away that's all I stepped in and basically uh just just ran the show\nFor them or during during the\nTwelve did they know you were working eighty hours yeah All right okay doesn't it doesn't matter what for what reason you're working eighty hours\nWell that's the thing is that according to them basically a if you're a manager you get paid a salary\nThat's true that's true but you you reach a point where I ...\nI think eighty hours it and he was over as a a little bit over and over the top here and you were not if you are not an hourly employee\nWell that's just the thing they never actually made me the manager several\nTimes were you in our early and put it doesn't matter if you took over management jobs were you an hourly employee\nDoes actually commission and play um that the commission\nOkay so your way to the body\nOkay so you weren't commission but you're still an employee right it was just based on a commission um yeah I think you you get paid it's time for you to look at uh the website and if nothing else you talk to an employment discrimination attorney and see if anything's there because it could be pretty substantial\nSo you can go to the way we can go to the website and look for handling a handle on the law dot com\nAnd just look at attorneys who pointed
