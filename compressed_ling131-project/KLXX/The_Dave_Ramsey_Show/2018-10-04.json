care professional you're a what\nA direct care so I take care of people who are um developmentally disabled and work on behavioral stuff\nAnd you make twenty two thousand dollars a year ... okay [noise]\nSo uh\nBasically I have an opportunity to win you locate from where I Am in Montana back to Boston which is where I'm from\n... and the single job would be a double my income\nMhm [noise]\nBut in doing so I Would not be bringing my family with me at first I had the opportunity to stay free with my father and work\nMhm why would I Would have family there are with you\nUm what point do you can't afford to move them I mean were they don't even have a foundation to ...\nAnd all their stuff start an offer to I mean right now I'm dealing with like negative cash flow\n... does your wife work outside the home\n[noise] uh no shame a target for is\nAnd pull it across the country and be in Boston and get an apartment right\n[noise] um well and the long haul yes but short term I Would try a plane ticket\nWhy not load your wife up and go\n[noise] uh I wouldn't have the money to among apartment mhm okay\nSo uh where you're going to be making twice as much though so how quickly would you be moving them\nOr or she's pregnant with our ... show the thought process would be in the summer probably August after birth\nNo I'm not doing the\nI'm not leaving my pregnant wife and four kids halfway around the dead gum world and go live with your dad not a chance I'm older than her up and move and do as you can you can have your family help you a little bit I mean it won't cost much to get move maybe the employer would give the new employer will give you an advance to get your mood into your new apartment [noise]\n\nUm there's a possibility with the\nYou know you need a loaded up your family and get out of there [noise]\nBut you know not being with your pregnant wife while she's carrying what your fifth child you're in Boston and she's in Montana dude that is not okay [laughter] I mean you're not\nIn the military or not you're not required to be separated like that you're just making bad choices now you need you need a scribe together a few dollars and go deliver some pizzas or something and [noise] ah for a month in and pile up you know thousand Fifteen hundred bucks and get you a U Haul and get your button gear\nAnd enroll loan over to a Boston and take that job or move in with your dad for a month with the whole that dumb crew over there if you can something like that I mean you need to find a different way but this idea you're going to\nLay bringing your whole family and while your wife is ... no no\nNo that's not going to work out for you that's going to end the poorly aren't going to assure you that he thinks we're calling in men is one of those bands in Colorado Springs ban how are you\nYeah you do better than I deserve what's up\nThere I Am self employed I'm a real estate agent and um we've got the thousand dollars for your baby steps wide and art but they were were\nKind of a crossroads on how to how to go up to about going on with the next babysat I'm of the opinion which isn't in your plan\nThat you know because I'm self employed and money isn't always there I Need to have a you know two two months or so or income to fall back on in ... to be able to make the budget\nThat does your wife work but she does not she's a stay at home mother\nAnd so you're not making any money in the real estate business\nI mean I'm making a hundred thousand a hundred and ten thousand a year\nSomewhere in there they are not having the row months [noise]\nNot any zero monitor it during the winter in Colorado there's um a month or slower than others where you know making the making the budget that would be tight tighter than my ... I'm\nNot I don't I don't I never expand the baby step on emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly of all I'm going I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like it is you might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really\nYou really need to stop and think about what you just said but anyway if you're going to go to zero in December because nobody's buying a house in Colorado Springs in December you don't want to have zero money album\nThat's what's really happening you're making eight thousand dollars a month average\nSo I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month whatever so anyway set some aside but we're not going to call it an emergency fund and we're not going to add to the thousand dollar account we call it a hill in the valley account the hill and valleys the volatility of your income\nThe hill is when they come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to set a couple of ground over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts one is for emergencies and one is for you if you run out of money because you don't make any money in a month\nBut dude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run out of money\nI mean you can go make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if you told me he made forty thousand dollars in real estate business I can imagine you having some zero much but you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money\nA year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back in track your revenues and charge revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nAnd given in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are than okay set some money aside to cover that\nSo that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is and uh but no we're not changing the emergency fund we might have a hill and valley account if you truly have a volatile income\nMark's with us in Seattle hey mark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nYeah thanks Dave hey it's a great honor to talk with you I had a great impact on changed my life five years ago I'm getting like you are currently I I I got a ... question I'm In baby steps eggs are the only thing right now I'm paying off my arm do you get a net worth of a half million dollars uh [noise]\nWhat happened was this five years ago I I left to small company with a great a company culture when I hear you talk about your company that the company I was working for a very similar culture\nI was making an average salary or for what I did I went to a competitor I was much more you making um I was making a eighty thousand dollars a year\nWhat do you make now I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year and your questions what\nI make my question is is I really miss that small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise]\nUm I think it would be a really really interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost my passion for my work and um you know I should have to work every day I get great reviews um\nI'd probably go back but I Want some equity or I Want some indication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually worse in the marketplace\nThis idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less\nIs not necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going with\nSo maybe that particular company can't pay you but if you want you could probably find somebody with a decent culture\nAnd pay you what your worst\nThat you know statistically when it comes to life insurance in protecting your family that women are more likely to be uninsured or under insured than men this doesn't make any sense women make up half the workforce contributes mightily to family incomes and in many cases\nHair of their families twenty four hours a day lives as one of the most overlooked areas when it comes to financial planning maybe it's a relic of the past but a loss of income or the need to replace family care\nAnd so and it's very simple it's just because I Need to pick up the phone and talk to a human being that actually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off and I I don't my CFO does but my controller knows that kind of thing but but in you know that's what you should want you should be able to walk in and talked to a human and not be treated like a number\nAnd you know I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America it's beyond me they treat you like crap\nAnd they over charging for most of the services and this day in time there online offerings of their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated they're not that good\nThey're not good at anything so I just don't get it so that that's why we endorse\nCredit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank and I'm just a a huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and is what I did\nEverything I endorse on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation I kind of a thing I don't have a feeling of sentences\nYou're too good to do that I I'm not I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell you to get but you know ... you know in most of these cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York, Pennsylvania Hi Ted how are you\nI'm doing better than I deserve how're you doing\nJust the same how can I help\nI Want to thank you and your staff you're doing it it's a blessing you um how it'll be needing a lakeside saving operation about ten to Fifteen Years if I don't get hit by a bus\nAnd I want to know if I if I should continue funding NHL stay with my employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks a year or should I just put that extra money into a Roth IRA her four one K.\nWas it just a couple of hundred bucks a year the company I don't know who you can put you can oh they're matching a couple hundred bucks a year and more\n... show the the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you've got to have in ten years what is it\nMoney deliver ooh I got the so yeah fortunately if you can't live without\nYeah heard that you know out okay how I'd say it's a it's a slow or a slow progression then\nYeah it is they they estimate that you know Seventeen years out so okay I got to figure to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to retire early you know if I can\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're going to want is a ... you got to have the cash in your age essay or somewhere else in an investment to cover what is going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking health insurance is going to cover a large portion of this correct\nYeah that if I don't retire um and I'll be I'm I'm either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nYeah I think I'd be on cobra or or I wouldn't retire because this is a guessing this is a multi hundred thousand dollar event isn't it\nProbably half\nNow and so I'm thinking we're going to turn retirement around this a little bit um or and or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the cupboard was cover only last what two years or something\nUm I don't know you can keep that indefinitely so I think that's number one I Want to make sure you got health insurance to cover the vast majority of this I don't want to\nTime that poorly a but then how much have you got coming out of pocket a over ten years you could put five thousand dollars a year into that age essay or whatever your big the duck double is what's your ducked double\n[noise] um [noise] ... yeah ... or ... whatever the ... on the age of say a year\nOh now the age I say that health insurance I Know of fun I don't\nKnow the edge essays are health savings account that is attached to a health and a chess a health insurance policy that is a high dollar ... policy\nIt it depends uh depends on the policy I picked it either six to nine nine thousand\nBucks what I'm Talking about you can put up to that amount per year into that savings account\nThat would be six thousand yeah the other side really fun that yes and I don't touch it until I you know there\nYes here's why south when you're when you need the money out of pocket to cover the whatever comes out of pocket on on the liver surgery\nA and you keep your health insurance in place then you've got this big juicy health savings accounts sitting there in an odd use mutual funds in it and let it grow over the next ten years be as big as it can ... there's no downside of that whatever you don't\nFor the liver transplant or liver trans whatever the processors they're whatever you don't need you can pull out and just pay taxes on the no penalties\nAnd you can just not going to become sort of what you don't use you can use for retirement\nAverage sixty five so I I Would love that up knowing that you've got this coming down the road\nFor years and one of the most asked questions I get is day one are you going to do a live um in in our city where\nIt was a radio show and book tours in our growing

welcome to the Ramsey show\n... thanks for taking my call today sure what's up I'm On the health\nInsurance question for you and I'm hoping you could give me some insight on it\nSo there in about three years ago and they came from the foster care system so we don't get a lot of services but one thing we do get is health insurance until they're Eighteen and it's provided through our state Medicaid system\nAnd every year my husband and I kind of go back and forth on whether or not to keep it or to put them on his plan through his employer and we're getting close to that um [noise] time of year to make that decision\nOkay um what would his employer's plan cover that Medicaid is not covering\nWell they've both been healthy thankfully I guess are um you know the thing we always come back to as unknowns of any kind of health issues that they may have er\nUm any services because even though the Medicaid coverage is crummy you know in a lot of ways is a lot of doctors don't take it and it's a basically welfare insurance [noise] um it has covered their needs up to this point because those kids are healthy and they've had you know minimal minimal ...\nAfraid if they had some kind of a major event that he'll Medicaid would not do a good job of covering and that his insurance might\nActually it's more of the opposite I'm not worried about the major stuff because like we've had to go to the ER for you know my you know a scrape and a bump and they pick up the tab for everything it's more the ongoing care there is um you know it's very hard to find providers who take it there's a bit of a steak than we feel\nA little strange having that kind of coverage given our own financial position you know that our kids are on a\nUm [noise] there's a bit of a stigma that oh I don't feel they're having it so it's just it's just kind of a dilemma we face every year and\nI and you were you know in November we can make us I offered you a a you know free food stamps because you

job because he's been trying to get it because this job for ever because\nWhy would a conflict with his job he's only working twenty hours a week\nRight because they call 'em for this job\nTwenty hours a week or the whole week [noise]\nTwenty hours a week ... ... ... it's a TV station and he he just a good thing when they have a football game and the goal the fix for again\nNo one would you be on call for football there is no emergency football\n[laughter] but he's been trying to get into the TV show three years I got the part where he's working twenty\nAnd his momma is calling me you're single\nAfter his mom's a single lady out here when you're fifty what\nGot a fifty fifty years old and you're having to pay this kid's bills yeah I'm mad at him right now I don't want you to be two and a good loving mama's kind of way I'm not trying to disown him I just want to knock him out on his little head okay\nYou know and then you you better plan on paying it if I had no money doesn't get moving okay right so\nYou know ball and knock it out and then you know chalk it up to that and but dude I'm telling you a word will have some discussions\nIs he married his girlfriend okay I'll bet she works forty hours yeah yeah there you go [noise]\nAlright open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Katherine is with us from Portland Maine Hi Katherine how are you\nA thank you I hear it out my budget activity every dollar chat among baby step to gray protect my expenses for the month\nProject caught I'm going to be paying for gas and then sometimes something happens like last month when my car broke down and I had to had a tone and repaired and it costs to almost five hundred dollar [laughter]\nDoes and how often\nThat we know that one out of ... do you have your your baby step one with a thousand dollars right\nI Do now that would be an emergency that you would use that for\nOkay but that's what I was confused about because the way I handled it was I simply added a new line item to my budget\nFor that item and then we stand now that I pay toward that for that month so I get it wrong\nThat will be okay you cash flow did you just ... but if you can cash\nFlow in that month that's fine I didn't have to come out of the emergency funds so you are paying more than five hundred dollars extra on that each month he a\nGood answer you reduced it by five hundred for one month 'cause you got kicked in the kneecap with this thing but usually you're not going to have that month than a month out now there's some things if a if there's a recurring unexpected event it no longer is unexpected\nFor anti and you know you don't have anything budgeted for car repairs well that would not work because most cars are going to need some repairing over a period of six months you know they're going to\nHave anything budgeted for car repairs\nYeah I probably would put something in there for that because the ... your budget needs to reflect the real world and the real world is you're going to spend something on the car in a given six month period of time it might be tires that might be maintenance you might be oil change it might be a five hundred dollar toe you know\nBut you're going to spend something on a car in unless you're driving really nice brand new cars you're going to spend something on the car during that time so your budget should reflect reality in that regard\nSo probably gonna have a little bit of a done it to be a lot fifty or a hundred bucks or something and let that build up\nAs a sinking fund they call and then the every dollar software or in them on below but I don't care where you build it up but somewhere you build it up and you uh have the money in cash then for your car repair as it comes up and that's an example of something that is recovering so it's no longer unexpected emergencies should\nBe unexpected things things that are are often enough that we can expect them aren't emergencies anymore\nBut you did good yeah you did fine just to cash flow through that emergency slow down your debt snowball for that month and then you pick back up next month hopefully you won't have another one of those and you can really build it up and go from there so good question and you're doing good keep after it\nFrancisco Hi Tom welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nDid here ... we're doing a great thing I've been an avid fan for three days now\nThank you [laughter] I'm On earth laid to we lived together a long time you and I [laughter]\n[noise] so the question for you so my wife and I\nWe had about three hundred hay and and there's been dead and another hundred and Fifteen and automobile line of credit that type of thing so it's about four Fifteen Toby and you know we make a pretty good income she'd had about one twenty annually\nI met one eighty three hundred come on that question for you it I wasn't going back to school and get my masters the ... only twenty five okay\nTo feel like they wouldn't be a very real are why on it but over the last three days are starting to think who may be maybe I shouldn't [laughter] they're trying to get your take on that\nA masters in what [noise]\nOh it would be in software engineering ... crime\nAnd it would increase your income by more than twenty five K\n[laughter] it would probably be hard to say I'm there wouldn't be a winning case and you raise because of the category of jump into ...\nOkay he would be doing that you can get back into it would make it back in touch over a year then from that point so that's really nice return I think you can put that in the budget and the reason you can put it in the budget is you make so stinking much money\nNow you live in in a very expensive area granted it's crazy and can I ask you want to live in a really rough near ... yeah but you guys are really you're really standing\nHoney ...\nAnd so I mean how quick can we pay off four hundred well we can pay off four hundred and two years if we do it in two hundred a year that may be living on a hundred I'm not sure you can do that after taxes in your area so you probably got a three year and get out of debt plan\nYour daddy like know vacations you don't need to see the inside of a restaurant and don't you dare tell me about buying anything else you bought enough crap for a while you need that you need to live like people that make a hundred people that make three hundred and\nGet this ... million dollars\nAnd in the process of doing that can you we've twenty grand a friend in the budget [noise] sure\nThis is\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business\nYou have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip\nRecruiter dot com slash Dave to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new it finds them for you it's powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes identifies people with the right skills education and experience for your job\nOr am I going to go to a community college for two years and then go and those credits all transfer and then go to a regular school I mean for your school for two years to finish up or that kind of a thing\nCommunity college has a lot less expensive and you get your basics out of the way for the first two years for a four year degree if you want to show the second thing once you've determined what you want to do and how you're going to do it then the second thing you do is\nCollege cost\nIs the number one cause of student loan debt\nAnd what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a huge pickup truck\nBoth our transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of you know the mall [noise]\nAnd and so if you if you don't have any money and you're saving up you can't afford a Bentley you can't afford to go to a super expensive college and there's nothing wrong with that by the way I didn't go to a super expensive college so you go to an end state school\nWas there in Florida you go to University of Florida Gainesville or you go to University of central Florida right there in Orlando a wonderful ... one of the wonderful both of them in state tuition not that expensive and uh that's thing one year college selection\nAs at the least expensive college that will help you get the degree that you need to get is what you need to aim at with rare exceptions and you're not going out of state and you're not going super expensive private the second thing is then you start looking for scholarships and you make scholarship hunting your full time job or\nSchool job that kind of a thing and you start applying for and filling out the scholarship forms and riding the essays and\nI was in scholarships and you'll probably get turned down for nine hundred and fifty of them but if you get fifty one thousand dollar scholarship she just wants school free ...\nThat'd be pretty cool not a bad part time job the third thing is planning on working a lot while you are in school don't borrow money so that you don't have to work work\nAnd get good jobs jobs that pay a lot dog walking cutting grass jobs people don't want to do what they pay a lot to do I'm not talking about minimum wage crap and if you're gonna live on campus go ahead and be an R. A. B. a residential advisor or written that's not what they call it what is in RA\nHow it is it is a resident about okay so there you know the the babysitter in the dorm okay and uh you get free dorm for doing that and sometimes free tuition for doing that and sometimes free tuition free dorm and pay for doing that she'll be in our a if you're going to live on campus\nOr work in the cafeteria get free food do you live on campus if you can get a job working for the university the tuition might be completely free\nAnd that might be different to something to look at it so that's the kind of stuff you look at but figure out where you're going what steps are to get their figure out the cheapest way to get their figure out scholarships or somebody pays you to get there and then plant on working your butt off and those things will get you through school completely debt free in this day and time and it can be done\nAlex is with us in Baltimore hey Alex welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Mr Ramsey
