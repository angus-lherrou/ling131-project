the end of the electric funding\nIs that thousands of dollars that works together and ... that I have to pay taxes on the electric funding for true\nThat is true definitely given us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that they forgave our cache of what's your household income\n[noise] um [noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand here\nOkay let's say let's say you're at ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight okay so it's still a good deal but your yeah your I have about two hundred dollars per thousand for that is for a given that hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but if in the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so\nYeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have and in addition to that now if you had a large returning coming because you're over withholding\nWell then in

numbers I don't tell a four year old that you're worth ten million dollars because they will go to kindergarten and tell it\nOkay and they're not emotionally capable of handling that information our children in our case did not know\nOur wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did unveil it and they were in their early twenties\nIt was shocking to them because they were raised like regular people but\nI had a lot of wealth in the background\nAnd um so I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't make need to make assumptions about\nBut then as we presented it to them it was presented as a responsibility\nNot I will do we hit the lottery has asked for me in my house we sort of more\nMeaning that you don't know anything you're just

month but it is probably going to be a you know Fifteen hundred isn't it\nYeah kept that the Eighteen 'cause one will be a new born you know going out to babies okay yeah I'm All right uh ... and what do you do for a living I'm In sales or my wife works for the state what do you sell a pest control and termites or something like that mhm\nAnd that your company has a branch in the city\nOh yeah ... throughout the state okay All right\nUm well here's the thing that you age which\nYou know here's a million I think I Would want to decide where idle Leo's based on some formula other than where the babysitter live\nYes\nThank you for joining us America we're glad you're you're open phones a AAA eight to five uh five two to five Dion is on Facebook what is a home equity line of credit is it worth having or should I avoid it\nWell a line of credit is an approved alone\nThat you take out only when you would want to\nKnow where you could get pre approved and have a lien against your house for a certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit\n[noise] um and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically\nA show or is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that we tried to get the other way we went through to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one one when she could reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of that because when you don't have any payment you know what you have\nMoney the bar or a slave to the lenders so now we don't recommend the home equity lines of credit and bar Paul is on\nFacebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the car worn out to the point is going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it\nIn other words a hundred thousand miles dodged neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that and the yawn at that point\nI mean do they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay it's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well built I mean again a Honda Lexus or Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac\nUm the larger body for products forge building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck for truck with a hundred thousand\nUh it's got easily another hundred in it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we kind of depends on your budget and how nice of car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty\nOr know got got about fifty something on it and um so it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day and um so you know you just you're looking at that your situation and to what is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't know how can I just I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how are you\nHey de la ... what's up I'm Seventeen years old and I cook a mere I've got about three thousand dollars and I mean the count out donating should I invest in China than you're going to college but yeah I mean the college with a pilot program and St Louis and the olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... service that type of a charity and I keep them at the community colleges is either and you're right I Know of course\nYeah yeah I Will be true if you get some search someone certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that okay so that's what you want to do you won't be a programmer or you want to be an hour or whatever mhm okay uh and the community college is paid for\nAs long as you keep an eye plus um\nYou can invest it a ... here's\nThe thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment a mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to ten and a nine point nine finish college and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money\nTo finish your schooling and that's much much you Dustin is a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know maybe I'll talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account at\nThis stage uh with this amount of money in your situation\nBecause again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree in your field of study whether it's a two year where the certifications and the ... tech field\nOr or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools and your belt for you to be able to go live your dream without any that and that three thousand dollar spent on that is more important than than the mutual fund so if you put it in a mutual fund\nAnd you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise]\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nYou too sir what's up in your world\nI don't my wife and I are currently on baby step forward if they can prepare for retirement and we're using the access our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension take nine percent of our gross take home pay our dilemma is when we say an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from ... to show ration so when we saved the thicker than we're able to save a lot for a mortgage celebration is it okay to do that or him recommended saving their twenty four\nPercent now the the mandatory amount that you're putting in a ... or you vested in that is that a ... choosing an investment for that or as a pension\nGet the answer no options yeah I just mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nCorrect guy I probably would split the difference because I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nTrue it's a horribly runs state and now we're ... those guys [laughter] ah yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we count as before then that means we need to put it in ten percent\nRight you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere to be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit our show and just round numbers was put in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only are celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it was a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so I'm\nYou know to do it\nThat that's what that's what I Would do it on backing off a little bit\nAppreciate you joining us this is that I ...

the last day\nWell technically it was the last day of my ... uh it it came to a Wednesday which Blake and I have actually alternative hunts Monday Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday was going to be all day for me and then life there's going to be all day for him and I had already hunted the morning and we it's got a little bit in the afternoon and then we're going to my evening hunt and we're in a set\nAnd we're down to the last twenty minutes of light and quite frankly I I really think it was going to happen we're sitting here we'd only seen literally two elk\nA spike in a nice six by six and that had been on the third day and you know we're sitting there Blake was telling me were down in a set Jerry been trying to call and for just sitting there and I'm thinking well\nAnd I even made a comment Blake's today you're the one more interview I'm going to come on you you know told about you know there's about Fifteen minutes all I loved and tell us you know what's about what's going on and I'm looking at him like he's crazy you know and I look at him and\nSo we're kind of playing back and forth and he's like a new it and I said All right I'll do it and so I even made the comment in ... and you guys will see when it comes out on video said\nYou know National Geographic gonna get hold them because we got some great beauty shots of these mountains in the cloud [laughter] mysteries and the birds and\nAnd what not but are just not a lot of game and it's ... like you said you go out there and Jerry's doing his best trying to get these but there's other hunters I mean we had another guy he was calling earlier in the week and he had one coming in and we thought and then we hear the gunshot and it sounded like he was a couple of hours away so\nHe made a call went in for another guy that wasn't making calls but you know twenty minutes to go I Do my interview not ten seconds after I said that Blake's like you know it only takes ten seconds to change the hunt\nAnd I'm thinking yeah right whatever so I'm sitting there and Jerry is actually left about ten minutes ago behind us he was sitting there call and well he came the way we walked in there is a big overlook where you can see this big past year and he actually ran up there and took it upon himself to you know to try to call something in\nTen minutes late life now and also we hear crash and I'm thinking I'm looking straight ahead going Blake some come and like some common\nAnd no it was Jerry coming from our left from down a hill to get over your head over here you come in and now I'm thinking for one yeah right and then all of a sudden he's got this look on his face like\nIt's happening so I look at Blake\nAnd now I'm thinking for one yeah right and then all of a sudden he's got this look on his face like\nIt's happening so I look at black boy looks to me and we're running\nOr run and we'd go up this hill\nThat's when you realize how to shape you really are when you're up in the mountains you're having to run up this hill we get up there I Can't see the elk\nI get down get my six down I'm looking looking Blake's on the hook right behind me you know trying to film everything he gets up and he's looking at the ... going to take them\nAnd I've got Jerry over there saying take him and I don't see it on the ground going [laughter] you know it's been raining I'm looking Jerry's calling trying to stop 'em well then I kind of catch a glimpse of 'em but I Can't get and shooting range because there's ... way\nSo I look at Jerry he's got this friend it looked like hey you need shoot you know like like I've got 'em on can go ahead take the shot and um you got guys I I I don't have them you know Jerry keeps calling all of a sudden he says okay now now on something and now what\nYou know when he tells me you know we crawl so here comes the belly girl I mean it's it's something out of a book I mean it it's almost too good to be true so I'm crawling I'm calling I'm calling I finally get up get machines ticks I get set\nI'm trying to look for and look for I finally got them well now he's quarter and down and they think he's running away they're both yelling at\nThrow a cap at him you know I've got Blake saying take him I've got um and I see him quarter and down and then he's the one kind of parallel with us and he looks to be a long way\nSo I'm looking I'm a hundred from Missouri I'm not used to this you know this is my first ... I'm pretty confident in myself because I started in real well with the night rifle up to a hundred yards so I'm sitting there I don't have a ... year back there\nWere up there we're we're kind of you know Jerry stopping them he finally gets settled and about what I thought was in my range but I'm Still looking going man he is a long way away\nI'm asking my camera and Blake Blake gimme artist give me your niche and he won't say anything so that to me you know my heart's in my chest going\nThis is a long shot well finally he stops again and he's broadside I'm thinking okay stick your time and I'm figuring it'd be about two hundred yards now and I look at 'em and I put it on my rifle and I know I shoot low left to drop a little bit\nI take my time cock that tree or ... or the hammer get ready to snap it nothing [laughter] oh no [laughter] yeah [laughter] I had another choice words [laughter]\nSo I look at it and I I you know what it was it like I said the man upstairs must have had a plan for him because I didn't freak out I didn't panic\nWould the had the night rifle has to safety that will say exactly it has a quick one which I had done and then it has been on the hammer that had the firing pin that you have to push that\nSo I generally fought back hit the ... and Dan cheery my savior over there has been called on to this guy we have a ... down to our right he just doesn't know what's going on is getting closer but he's not moving right now I pulled back I put it right on top of his back right about the middle\nAnd let her go and booming I mean you know they always say

kind of kick and he didn't go the way he was facing extent jumped back and went back towards the the other way\nAnd I'm sitting there and I'm Still in shock that everything just happen just now in a matter of ten minutes and my camera guy says I think you hit them [laughter] the famous [laughter] you know so I'm Wondering I'm Wondering Well Jerry comes running over and\nYou know he's waiting and we kind of the the joy wasn't area because I wasn't sure we kind of were sitting there and you know we're going over what just happened and Jerry all of a sudden stops us and so you hear that you hear

in my garage where every the asphalt the driveway it looks like there's a gap is opening up not sure why am I you know I'm Wondering if I felt it out for fill that gap or something\nWhat happens is the driveway believe it or not starts to sort of shift away from the building the building doesn't really moving than sled as we move much in the in the garage to sell but the driveways will tend to shrink and pull away and you'll get a gap of Logan up so what you want to do there is\nThere is a a product called him back or ride which is if you ever see in the pool noodles at the kids play with in the polls in the summer like phone tubes of course yeah\nIt looks like a tiny poodle right it's about a one inch to one and a half inch diameter foam rod and you you buy the size of them or you want and you still get into that yeah right and you push it down so it's sort of just below the surface of the of the aspects of the driveway\nBy like you know maybe so it's just maybe half inch blow
