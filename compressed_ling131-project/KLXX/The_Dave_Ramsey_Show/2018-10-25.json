[noise]\n\n\nActually is in Los Angeles I actually welcome whatever I'm just show\nAnd thanks for taking my call sure what's up in your work\nSo um I haven't done I don't agree he recently came back from a deployment and said he wants\nA divorce and a bankruptcy so um we are fifty thousand dollars in debt and last year remain thirty five thousand are that breaks down to twenty five and car ten in student loan and Fifteen and credit card and I'm just not sure where to go [laughter]\n[noise] okay and um\nSo uh what do you make\nRight now I Am not working I recently moved back ah with family\nSo you're separated yeah OK and family is in Los Angeles yeah okay and I'm your children now\nSo I'm I'm guessing based on that separation that the divorce rate is going ahead or not\nSay it will be okay right\nWell whether you agree on filing for bankruptcy or not is irrelevant um he decides what he's going to do and you decide what you're going to do if\nYou're not married and even if you are married technically because you don't file bankruptcy as a married couple um in other words when I filed I could have filed insurance not filed accepted sheets on some of the papers or she got the file to [noise] but um and we had to follow him all the different corporations that will seize that we had at the time that was Thirty years ago\nUm so uh in this case he could file and you not file\nThat's possible whose whose name is this\nHas um [noise]\n... that has a lien against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt and keep the asset\nOkay so you could you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt double it's not going away you've got your student loan back that's done okay the corners then you cannot keep the car unless you keep the debt\nYou can ... from the debt okay you've found on me\nBut that's the only way you keep the car and so sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of the debt and in the ... the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they would lean on the car\nOkay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is or was a I'm\nA ... or in the event of a bankruptcy you resign for the whole debt and you keep the guard show which of the cars is yours the Fifteen of the ten\nFifteen okay and what does that car worse do you have an idea [noise] I'd say about ten okay All right\nAnd so you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan that you're going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card that you understand if he files and you don't you've got that and then they got the other car now in the event of a divorced what I Would demand is\nThat if he's going to keep a car that he refinancing and get your name off of it\nOr if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car the he's driving is it worth at least ... out on it\nAnd say about that okay\nSo you could just sell that car and break even but I'm a you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess is what it is and you already knew that okay so the scenarios are\nThat um you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll land into\nUm I'm In veterinary medicine and so I Would say about Thirteen an hour and working full time\nAre you a D. V. em [noise] no\nOh no I'm a ... year attack okay\nAll right and so I'm In that's in the Los Angeles area or are you going to be somewhere else okay All right so you're going to land on that and then you're going to clean up your student loan debt and the credit card debt and the card that if he walks on all of it\nOkay now if he chooses not to file and fight through it than the two of you got to work through this together and you're going to be what does he make\n[laughter] ah last year he made about ah twenty five\nOkay be coming out of the military\nNo scale and share in the military [laughter]\nYeah no I have no security clearance you understand that he understands that I'm sure you file bankruptcy or security clearance has gone [noise]\nSo I mean his chances of moving up in the military are are are harmed pretty dramatically if he finds a bankruptcy but he didn't make any money should be and and he just came home of a deployment and he's lost his mind and I was like oh my goodness\nYeah [laughter] I'm so sorry I didn't care\nAnd I just trying to start over and it's not going to be as easy for him as he wants it to be how old is he\nGoing to seven yeah okay well\nI I think you sit down with your pastor and if you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine\nWell um I I think you sit down with your pastor and if you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine um\nI I think if he files and you don't you've got a force him\nA to sell the car that is in his name and probably we're going to say oh yours too okay I'm In and get you get you a five thousand dollar loan for the difference and then you work your way out of the credit card debt the little bit of a car loan driving a beat her and the student loan debt is going to take you a little while with your income\nBut you can do that it doesn't mean you have to file just because he files mathematically or legally\nOkay this is just making sense to you here\nSo I'm Sorry your face and all this one of ... listen if you get in the middle of and you're going to the question you call me back I'll help you okay\nThank you\nThank you Chris is with us in Minneapolis Hi Chris how are you\nGoing to Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWith a question about life insurance or I'm not very uh ... uh I spoke with your guy the ... and ah [noise]\nYou know they had them kinda borderline whether or not to get a term life terms [laughter] I've got a wife to kids at home and I'm the premium it'd be pretty expensive uh [noise] if I Do get approved so I guess my question is to part [noise] into I still go for it even if it's you know\nThree four hundred dollar a month premium um three or four months for how much coverage\nFor a ten times my my pay million\nFor a million dollars okay ... what is your medical problem\nAh basically ... to\n... you know how to get you okay are you are you overweight\nYeah okra and had to give me too [laughter] yeah\nOkay yeah that they can help you more with the diabetes if you get the way down which also by the way up to the doctor already told you that you knew that right\nOh yeah I'm working on a good good for you so hard struggle um\nSo what I might do is make sure my family's ... left with nothing and my smaller policy\nUntil we can do those two things and let let's get the weight off and get the diabetes more under control at that point and see if we can get a better rate two years from now or something\n... and um you start to see the ... the actual economic value of taking care of yourself in those situations in addition to just oh I get to live longer hello you know so [laughter] you already knew these things right right um yeah\n[noise] uh but but I I mean what if you took half\nAnd at least you know she's are or how much you own your home [noise]\nUh two eighty what does she does she work outside the home now she works out she was going on now so if\nYou had like five hundred and that would pay off the house and put a couple of hundred in her pocket if something happened to you that's better than a half million it's

time ever or you can experience our Ramsey smart conference from the comfort of your home that's right you can now barges our most\nIs to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's anyone that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money it does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or is do they have a friend or a pastor that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak into their lives\nThat's a possibility the other possibility that probably will be more likely is for you not to say a word about their habits or their financial situation but every time you're around them tell your story\nMhm mom we were so scared mom we were freaked out mom we were fighting about money all the time we were so overwhelmed I couldn't breathe\nManchester is getting tight and you know what we did was we got on this budget and we cut up our credit cards and we're not there yet and put man I feel so much better and I'm On my way and no one can argue with you about your story and your feelings\nRight but don't Wagner finger at her and say no you need to do this to instead of just just keep talking about what's happened in your life what's what happened with you friends or do you what's your deal and eventually they're going to say something like well I Wish I could do that\nWill you know it'd be nice it'd be nice to get control when they got to do that Debbie Downer fryer party thing right the martyr thing I Know and people do that all the time and as soon as they do that that's your opening jump in and go I think you can really 'cause I felt the same way\nYeah I think you can win it wouldn't be so that if they would do you\nWant to know the ... you ought to jump to the front of the line who got slammed down is you start saying that and that conversation is she gonna shut you down you know they are all you got to do just talk about whatever you did for you are or not for her don't get about\nEnabling like with your alcoholics friend obviously you wouldn't go out and drink without him John Barr knowing what I what I\nHear your money to drink\nRight and my parents they're basically eating out ... times a day for all that time and my dad got ... tired and they only have one income that are living on two in college you know\nAnd and so when we met that they don't live in our in our state and so we go visit them and my dad he wants to take us out to the fancy dinner to show that he loved that and we love handles style latch but I just want to scream absolutely not\nNot participating in that I that I don't want to strain our relationship well it\nJust said that you know what we're learning in our story as we're learning that we can't do that and so it makes us very uncomfortable to do that with you so let's find another way to celebrate our time at home because we don't want to go out to eat it won't be fun for us\nBut don't go that you only take us on a trip to broke that stupid\nIf you go out with her laying on the that that's what you're thinking\nAnd I'm thinking you're right I agree with you but if you say that cost up so you got to direct it all back to you back to you back to you\nLike to talk about how you feel about this not about how you feel about them or their behaviors\nBut you're just back and talk about you used to feel the way and you turn it loose\nYou used to feel and now I feel good I used to be freaked out now I'm not in you know of course it only to be the truth by the way and you know tell the truth and you know but I used to I I felt that way too personally I mean I went broke Shannon however we've got killed each other I Know how it feels to fight\nAbout money and um we'll fight about money anymore and have it in years\nUh and so how do you how do you fix that what do you do and you're just share your story talk about your story and they will start chasing you eventually to get that and go if if they ever reach out to say well she'll go to the show you how you want me to show you what we're doing\nBut don't ever turn and go deep one step deeper and go because you're stupid\nBecause you're doing this wrong you go

the attribution where my my pay for it because it changed my life\nNot because you're so stupid you need it you see the difference and you just keep directing it back through you through your story that your only shot and just talk about what it's done for you not what it'll do for them and then pay for it by for for them to go through and I'm\nJust a mom someday when you're rich you can pay for the rest of the kids to go through or something if you want for right now under this is my guest cousin when it's done for me and you know might not work for you but it was worked for me you know and

family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't big difference if one of the parents died\nAnd that does happen their well being would be destroyed paying for the mortgage

I ran into\nOh I Know you're in one one of the things I just I just want to\nI kind of want to talk to them and throw away and\nI'm One of the things we've been looking into is be a Christian health share ministries and I think for a while you might have been even been endorsing one for a while I Can't remember but anyway we're we've got some other families and our class or your finger income\nJust paint a thousand dollars a month per year for health insurance that you and you know we can do a family on the health care mystery for your mind about ... I just\nI wanted to get your take can see something centrally in baby steps to where my wife and I talked about it were a little more comfortable you know when we have a fully funded emergency farms right now we're I don't know we're just trying to navigate that and I want to get your take\nOn the uh we do indoors\nIt's doing 'em and uh the the\nYou know I Would never suggest going into something like that that did not have a loan or even the possibility of going into something like that that did not have a long track record and these guys have thirty forty years of having never missed a single claim\nNow you have to read and you should read very carefully to what it covers and what it does not cover\nAnd know that and they've got a couple of plans you can buy the upgrade plan that covers different things and that kind of a thing family plan their singles plan all that they've got a normal you know an array of products so to speak to learn what's covered and what is not covered learn how it works\nUm because it is technically not insurance you're technically if someone else in the program chose not to share\nThen war would you be you know technically but they've never failed to make a claim show it's worked\nFor forty years you know I mean or whatever number of years but decades rise so uncomfortable with its credibility in that regard it is different than insurance and we get our brains get dolled into how health insurance works and this has got some nuances some differences to it so learn what those are\nNumber one number to know that I don't personally do it even though I Do believe in it number three in the only way I Do it as if they had a long long long track record which these guys do and it is a Christian\nHealthcare ministries and so a ... and the ... that their definition of that is is that if you use tobacco or ... or alcohol then you don't qualify\nAnd so they're already hard core in that regard um and so you need to you know be aware that that's there and that's a limiting factor as well and they ... you know they want you to affirm your face as part of the process you're Christian faith\nAs a part of the process and so that's what it's for an house laid out but all of that and once you know all those nuances and you know those differences and you can see them um we would not have endorsed that if we didn't think it had credibility\nRight and that ... and and I guess if I could ask one follow up question we were to go through that in baby steps to and all that kind of step one of the things that my life with a little concerned about\nOne of the ones we're looking to the as the long term track record and and we're okay we're all the requirements we're yeah we're we're evangelical Christians and all that out of step and we're normally pretty healthy and it seems like a good fit for our family\nBut like one of 'em you know you pay out of pocket kind of like when they say for Fifteen hundred bucks and stuff so if you're a baby here with you recommend it when they go that route to set aside that that grew out of dollars to insulate you against our\nOwn and you've got an already guideline or you've already got a thousand in baby steps on so you're close enough\nOf that and if you run up over just budget your other five hundred into your budget slow or you might have to slow down your debt snowball a little bit in baby step to cover some bills if you had an event right right right and it's just like carrying large deductible as you said in a nature or something I'm but I'm going to take that part of the risk gone for sure\nAnd I'm so forth but but yeah Christian healthcare ministries is the one that we endorse hey man thanks for the call April's weather's April's in New York City Hi April how are

on taxes are but I I really don't need the\nEntire emergency fund I currently have thirty thousand I'm a picky picky and fifty thousand and put into that I can rebuild my return my emergency founded about three months\nYou don't need it why would you rebuild it\n\nYes but I'm not a citizen here I'm also not a U.S citizen I'm I work here I'm an ex patriot and I just feel more comfortable because if I Need to leave the country I have about sixty days to get all my affairs in order and leave\nMhm\nOkay so you're just going to keep a little extra will show what out of there and that's why I feel what happens if that ... that event occurs a while you're down on cash because you funded this thing\n[noise]\nSo it's very unlikely um I just received a new role and at least for the next two years of probably very safe at my work life\nMhm okay\nWell the thing is is here here's what's bothering me he is the proper amount to have in your emergency on his thirty thousand dollars and the answer is no\nDon't drain it down because this is not an emergency you use emergency funds for emergencies period if the proper amount of having your emergency fund\nWhich means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later\nSo you decide what the proper amount in an emergency fund is when all the smoke clears but don't tell me you're using your emergency fund to fund this and then you're going to put it\nBack which tells me you don't agree you know you've got the and your mind the proper amounts thirty grand I think is what you're saying and so the answer is no don't put the money in retirement\nDon't use your emergency money to do that\nBut if you're willing to reassess your emergency phone and say I've got this thing over funded I'm going to back down in the twenty range than I might go ahead and do this deal a because we're not there but but if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies\nAnd don't monkey with it as merchants she found this is just foundational before you move on to investing of any kind so you got to decide your definition that is what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash one and it sounds like emotionally given the unusual situation that you're in you want to keep thirty grand around\nAnd so you should keep thirty grand around that's it don't mess with that but if not if you're going to permanently lower it then use some of that money to do this then hey I'm just fine with that a cage is with us in Salt Lake City Hi cage how are you\nHey Dave how's it going better than I deserve what's up [noise] hey thanks for taking my call today I'm I'm a college student\nI'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance um but the more that I go through school and the more that I listen to you it makes me want to I'm really make a living being a financial ... many years ago and still here today [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I wanted to get your advice on whether you think it still possible or somebody like me to run the type of fitness that maybe you're biased on [noise] the best business model to maximize success on the early going up starting\nTo well the um you know see based financial coaching where you pay someone pays you a fee just to sit down and do one on one coaching which we do some here and we ... we we have a program where we certify people that do that that come through our training to do that\nIs it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that\nUh because it's it's very much uh the Yemen Tori is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours in the day for enough money to equal a good living\nAnd I can be done but are coming straight out of school difficult to do I'm not saying that can't be done but I'm just saying it's not it's not ...\nOr your job your first or two years out it's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side\nAnd work with someone like one of our smart Mr prose as an example\nAnd those guys are in the business gals are in the business of selling investments and there's nothing there's ... there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact that it's almost paramount that you do coach people while you're selling them an investment so that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're showing some on a home near coaching them into this house is going to you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is is really out of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that you're in a sense your financial coaching them\nAnd so but you get paid a commission when they buy a house\nAnd so uh you know this idea that some people have that everybody gets paid a commission as a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd\nThere's plenty of people on strike commission with high levels of integrity that do the right thing so you might\nExplore that angle because truthfully you can make more doing that\nThen you can\nJust doing a book billing by the hour and I'm not saying making more as the whole answer but you know as a as a young guy coming straight out of school as a financial coach\nYou probably don't have to get a little bit of miles on your before people are going to trust you you know I could be I mean there's some people trust you and if you're really good you know you're no you're stuff than you'll you'll get business\nBut ah I'm just saying it's it's a tough road\nTo just do what we did back in the day and it's one of the reasons is not is one of the reasons we quit doing that as or exclusively what we did\nYou know we started doing events we start having a class we started\nDoing other stuff to go with it uh because it's difficult to make a scale up when there's only so many hours in the day you can bill out at an hourly rate open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Amy is on Facebook dot coms life day Ramsey\nThey do you put all of your rental properties into an El Al seat yes I Do\nAs a matter of fact I no longer own anything personally\nI don't have a single thing in my name my cars are internal Elsie my house is in a trust my all of my real estate is in El al ... um\nAnd it's kind of an extreme risk management thing but I actually I actually don't own anything I'm pretty poor personally [laughter] except that I Won all those companies\nThat don't all that stuff so that's okay I guess but I mean it's a yeah we put up to five million dollars worth of properties are single families into an El Al see and then we open another one\nAnd I we buy a building standalone building to building I'm sitting is worth about a sixteen Seventeen million and its its own tail Elsie\nAnd then I've got other buildings that are worth whatever their their own El Al said well we put up about five million a or a single standalone thing so they're different companies in that way you risk is bred around [noise] good risk management\nHow often do you look at your bank account and wonder where all your money went how often are you stressed about bills and afraid your paycheck will last the whole month you shouldn't have to live like that you shouldn't feel powerless over your money and you don't have to you can take control of your money\nThat you shouldn't feel powerless over your money and you don't have to you can

that sounded as I Would come out of it related to cars but I just haven't come up with anything and Kashmir and his parents helping you might they allow for that [laughter] okay\nWell that's very interesting so obviously you love cars is that right is that what I'm getting out of this can you tell me about that what specifically do you love about cars\n[noise] I don't I just I Love 'em I mean what can drive down but I also get\nI think that there are so unique in that way that they're um designed and built ... and ... together um I enjoy feeling different lines and I'm just kind of got

of the ... of our Ramsey solutions media productions and thrilled to be sitting in for Dave this hour triple eight eight to five five two to five Tripoli eight to five five two to five is the number to jump in and let's go to Cody who's on the line in Seattle, Washington Cody how can how\nCan a thank you for taking my call so I'm about five years and she my career field in IT in cyber security and um\nI currently make a hundred and five thousand a year I'm I've completed all of the baby stopped so I don't have a wife or a cat and\nA and then this past all yes I've been given an opportunity to take a job that is less stable either in a\nIn full time and it pays a approximately three hundred thousand a year a cyber attack there to control thing and uh I've I've been raised with you know try to keep a stable job um you know you feel on\nFive days a week and make sure you know you get your paycheck and um but I I think since I'm pretty young and I don't really have you know a ... support a family or anything I was just curious what your thoughts were on a either staying at my job or taken this position\nWell let's start with how excited are you forget the stability issue which I'll get to momentarily how excited are you about this opportunity\nIt it's pretty awesome on the field itself I I enjoy doing it um I don't consider going to job but like a chore or anything like that I I and I enjoy it so yeah a a opportunity to uh to take the other one is pretty exciting\nOkay that's great that's that's one question the other question is when you say stability you said you're going to make three hundred thousand dollars that's a massive that's over half\nCorrectly yeah so um I I they basically you work it out for like a twenty hour work week and I multiply that by the hour earlier it so IT consulting so uh you know I can have worked for three weeks and then I can be I have no work for you know months on end\nYeah but you're gonna make three hundred ... that's pretty clear correct\n[noise] well I mean if I get twenty or twenty hours a week\nOkay got it on the earth All right but is there some question as to whether or not that's going to be consistent is that a moderate goal or can a conservative goal or an aggressive goal the twenty hours a week\n... ... that's pretty moderate um 'cause I I've spoken with some of the other people that work in the position on 'em and they they say that's about average um yeah OK yet but they may have some months for they they get a paycheck and\nYeah but ... this is a no brainer because you're completely debt free you've already gone all the way through baby steps seven you have no wife and kids I mean you're in great shape to take this opportunity and and here's the other thing you've probably planned for it how ... what is your or three to six month emergency fund look like how big is\nThat that Fifteen thousand\nYeah I mean juice out a little bit\nHow long would it take you to get up to thirty or fifty\nYou know ...\nWith by her position\nYeah or just in this new position because you're such good because you're such good shape you you know just taking a new position you can stack up some money and take you know my point is is let's say you get into this new role which you really want to take and I'm telling you to take it\nBut let's say you're feeling that the first three months live on way less you already can anyway so the new job is actually going to allow you to maybe put six months away\nSo you've got no risk at all because you can jump back in the cyber security I think it's a no brainer I think you're over thinking it because it's not the forty hour week a buddy you did all the hard work to get to the point where he can take a job like this you don't have to work forty hours a week\n[noise] okay you got me yeah\nSo I idea to celebrate tonight my goodness don't overseeing this I mean half of half of the ... love to be we're ... at right now [laughter] I mean buddy this is the kind of smart risk you know because you put yourself in a great financial situation to be able to go after this is really hardly any risk at all\nUm man and and here's the deal you're saying that you all you have to do is get twenty hours a week\nAnd that would put your three hundred K. if you only do ten you're still going to be making about the same as not even a little bit more of course you'll be making more so again go go go oh that is fun stuff AAA eight to five five two to five is as a career seem out on the day Randy show I'm Ken Coleman city in for day to go to Rachel is on line and Madison, Wisconsin Rachel how can I help\nHow campaigns like hockey nature I'm I'm twenty four years old and right now and we're working in the legal industry I'm but I'm not a lawyer play a role and they're catching coordinators Carl basically I'm working with differing Marge how coordinate their program Dr Engel\nMandel ... however I don't want to work in lido administration I Want to work in a different industry ... thing my current job what gave me transferable skills how line should I stay and well let's lay down job how and if I only stay wind or to the year the protection\nYou know you almost like a job hopping at all how old are you at twenty\nOkay twenty four I forgot to write that down so here's the deal you're pretty much the average millennial who looks at a job we knew this from data that looks at a job is no more than about twelve months so first of all that's out there and it's not job hopping you left after six months you've been ah in the legal world and you now know very specific\nOut there and it's not job hopping suck you left after six months you've been ah in the legal world and you now know very specifically where you want to go so congratulations being twenty four and and knowing where you want to end up\nSo uh the first question you asked me are your skills\nThat you have manifested in learned in the legal industry transferable to the business industry and the answer is absolutely yes\nI Do a quick example here told me a two or three or four things that you do really well right now in your job if I interviewed your co workers and your leaders what would they told me that Rachel does very well right now go [noise]\nUm I Would say it's down their arms and conflict\nAnd then probably all her collaboration one and I think are all very big jogger could trigger out and let me tell you what program and then on the other side of the nation and probably between ... and then kind of match them together and figure out\nHow to get the borrower animal traction\nYeah uh everybody in America as well so that go on while that's extremely valuable who doesn't want somebody\nYou can do that [laughter] pick the industry\nI mean think about how valuable you are and again I Want to remind you something Rachel I told my obvious this almost on a daily basis here's where we sit right now in two thousand eighty seven million jobs available in the United states\nSeven million\nIt's historically there are more jobs available then there are people who are unemployed and you just told me you're really great at systems and processes and you're really good at collaborating with other team members\nThat's extremely valuable\nI Believe there are people listen to the show right now or go I Wish I could talk to Rachel I'd interviewer tomorrow\nSo you need to have terrific confidence there now you asked me a resume question here's the deal you put your experience out there you're you're twenty four years old so they take that into
