can I help yeah\nSo I'll Try and keep them straight to the line um I've been living in my car on and off for about two months I was homeless for two weeks since my car had broken down\nUm and I'm just wondering\nMoney has become one of my biggest track this and I'm just curious what advice do you have some ... in this situation again like five families are financially stable to support me but we struggle with money\nI'm currently working to grab Sean jobs a woman damages caught by ships on the other one I don't make a ton of tips has a survey but I'm just wondering I'm twenty three year old I'm at this point in life I don't really want to\nEver be in the situation because my physical health spiritual health mental health it's all going down since I lost my home to self I'm just wondering for some advice as far as what do you how to prevent it actually happening again\nYou know to your single yeah OK and when did you leave your parents from\nAlso have been living now I'm going to happen is a than a mile and\nPromote a year and a half but I moved to BC and once I got to be see I was in a car accident mhm\nBut my money that I had for a place I went to war or my vehicle by vehicle mhm and then it was great in the middle of summer\nAnd I wasn't able to secure work until shortly a pope may be on later I was living in a homeless shelter mhm and now recently the shelter I extend it might stay like it's been alive\nMhm but um where is home yeah I I parked by the ocean and I don't know where where do your parents live\nUh my mom lives about three hours away but she has a boyfriend going through cancer for me being there it's really\nA [noise] it's it's very tough tough\nThanks for being with us from our bureau there's the Dave Ramsey show so glad you're here [noise] you know it's interesting [noise] um and informative to all of us to stop and think about something hope\nCauses you to be able to move the needle\nCauses you to be able to move forward when you think the light at the end of the ... at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train your paralyzed your stop your overwhelm your frozen you get paralysis or the analysis that hopelessness when you think that the light and the tunnel is the way out of your trap then you run to the light\nBut if the train is coming at you and run to that obviously right\nAnd and what's the difference in those two events both light both a tunnel both situation one is you believe that if you run to the lot you're going to get out one of you believe you run that a lot you're going to get killed right I mean so that that's hope and hopelessness and all of a U.S me included face that or have faced that at times in our lives\nAnd it's amazing to me the power of our brain and our spirit that God gives us to\nDo things that are way beyond what we thought we could do once we believe that are possible\nThat's called hope\nAnd so when I show you what you you know you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you got thirty thousand dollars in debt you feel stock but gosh if we did that\nAt a thousand dollars a month you're going to be out of that and my ... and a thousand dollars a month out of a hundred thousand it's nothing that's twelve thousand dollars a year you're going to be out of debt and a little over two years\nAnd you suddenly go oh I see it ... it's the same situation you were in but now you can see it\nYou see what I'm Talking about and once you can see it that's called hope I can see my way out one of the things that steals your hope is when you have lost your perspective perspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things\n[noise] it's happened to me it's happened to you I\nRemember one time one of my daughters when she was in high school certain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was a very upset\nWhat the world is coming to an\nEnd her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in\nWhat the world is coming to an end and her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and comfort her [laughter] now why are we standing in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their\nWhole blush\nWell we've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been places she hasn't been and have experience was that she doesn't have right so in other words we've been to our twenty year class reunion we know she'll\nBe glad he didn't call [laughter] that's what we're giggling about standing and All right so we have perspective\nAnd so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it [noise]\n... then you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer [noise]\nAnd it it's going to grow some things in your future you know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you ... there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different than when you look out ten seconds [noise]\nAnd the amount of just talking to an end folks that have dealt with an homeless situation so it's one of the problem is the the desperation just to eat and not be cold\nCauses you to have ten second increments of thought instead of ten year increments of thought to I can stand back from that sitting here warm and with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more\nBut he can't see he couldn't see that they don't care that you wouldn't get in it it's like coke go go deliver pizzas go blow leaves go walk dogs go shovel something somewhere you know go do something do you know work all the time because you knew that money come from work is where it comes from and I can't get an of ours woven work someplace else\nWork more work all the time\nBut but because I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does\nMean out when we were going broke\nA tool babies in life the houses in foreclosure were that close to homeless ourselves\nSo how we get out of it or your mind off\nAnd well you know you can't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way out I went bankrupt but I didn't lose the house\nAnd if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that ... you know and and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter only thing is just perspective\nIs like I didn't grow up rich but had a friend that grew up rich\nAnd because he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out 'cause it it always worked out and I had the perspective that ain't gonna Oregon [laughter]\nThere's going to be awful and but because he thought everything was going to work out you know it worked out a lot\nBecause I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes that didn't work out you say you set yourself in these cracks in these rods\nWith this thing but when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work\nThrough it it's when you can't see the other side of it\nThat you don't want to work through it because you don't believe it's going to work that's called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same the only difference is you use your perspective as I'm challenging some of your another think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career\nSituation is exactly the same way different issue is your perspective\nThere's some challenges that might be right now that I think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you think you're stuck in this marriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're not stuck\n[noise] you're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film script you're going to turn the page and something else is going to happen better or worse tomorrow it is not going to stay the same you are not stuck\nSo look the other side of it look out there five years look out there three years look out their ten months and say what am I got to do what's got to be true that is not true right now for me to never be here again that's the question he was asking but he was having trouble emotionally buying it [noise]\nAnd I don't think I helped him I was kind of bothered me that's why I wanted to talk about a minute I'm not sure he heard me but\nIf I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you took my wallet away with with everything I had been through I had no identity\nNo I ... you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long because they don't believe that about me and my future and I know if I Do this this and this that I'll be out\nAnd I worked my way right out of it I don't I don't know how long it'll take but I Would get there\nI pushed my way through it and um\nAnd I haven't always been that way there's been times that I was so scared the so beat up in so hopeless that I couldn't breathe and I couldn't see\nWhat I'm Talking about here is that is his vision site\nThat gives you hope when you lose your site when you can't see the other side of it\n[noise] then then there's no you know that it's hard to take action\nIt it's hard to fix it and the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you've got to do a series of steps you got to take to become unstuck wherever it is you are stuck wherever it is I'm stuck\n[noise] I think that guy's going to be okay I really do I think he's going to be better off than he thinks he's going to be I think it's going to work out [noise]\nGreat book to read if you already called pizza tiger the guy that started um dominos pizza Monaghan came out of the army made some bad mistakes and ended up living in a homeless shelter\n[noise]\nAnd then he ends up owning dominos pizza\nSo it's going to be All right [noise]\nYeah it can be [noise]\nYou can choose for it to be All right\nIt's not magic and it's not positive thinking and it's not easy\nAnd and it's one of the reasons I read biographies of successful people is he lets me know that they went through crap and they made it [noise]\nAnd it and then if I'm going through crap I'm going to make it [noise]\nThat that's what I'm you know that's where you are it's where I have been and am sometimes\nIt's going to be okay\nCommon theme around here is teaching

I have never seen anything that indicates that carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive than the rest of North Carolina I mean now maybe you need to move\nTwenty miles from there instead of a hundred and ten miles from there to get something cheaper\nBut I'm the numbers are giving me just don't work I I just ah truthfully I think you haven't looked in the right places I think you're looking in certain neighborhoods or certain types of apartment complexes\nOr whatever I'm going to continue to shop and learn and I'm probably I mean I'm at you many of the dollar it out pan back a little bit and dial out just a little bit mileage was from where you are looking to get you you may be in the most expensive in the town I mean I can imagine that there is an area of carry this that expensive\nBut overall to carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive rents than Burlington no that's just I just don't believe that\nUm I can be wrong but I I don't I've never seen the indicates that the one in North Carolina is that much more expensive than the other end now you want to compare Manhattan to apple in Texas we can talk about this but\nThat's a different issue and that's not what you're proposing so I think you're um you're looking at different end of town of Kerry or you move a little bit further out of carry but not a hundred and ten miles out of Kerry\nAnd we'll see where we are at that point\nUm but I don't think you can\nUm what your your numbers just don't work hey thanks for the call Sharon is with us in West Palm Beach Florida Hi Sharon welcome to

time was offering it for you and so I was like oh we need to go to this class because I'm terrified and I don't know what to do and\nI'm so we did that in that was in two thousand twelve where she did that while we were engaged and so we got married August twenty twelve and so\nTo this day you know before we got married we had our budget ready to go on the spreadsheet ... from the nerd and uh [laughter] to this day we could tell you every penny we've spent since the day when I marry and so that's been that's been an interesting journey but definitely blessed that\nI Believe one month later ... things done yeah so what do you tell people were key to getting out of the Israel\n[noise] gosh it starts with communication or whether it's we're married are engaged readers by herself to me so much talked about it um and then it's sending the budget discipline on it\nThere's no problem changing the budget for it's just it's actually spending ever since and figure out where it goes in ... and just do it\nYeah we've gotten very good at\nBut it's just it's actually spending every sense and figure out where it goes and being ... just going to do it oh\nYeah we've gotten very good at 'em cash flowing things there's been a lot of an ap course over six years a lot of unexpected expenses and we always say that if it weren't for the budget than we wouldn't know where to get money from ...\nUm we've actually cash slowed three cars in the span of time um and then about two years ago we um\nWe we were having some trouble I'm getting pregnant which you never think that that's going to happen and that and you know fertility stuff isn't really a it's not like getting cancer it's not like a medical emergency or anything but\nIt's definitely a very stressful um and so we we were very glad to be able to have the\nFunds and know where to pull money from and we actually ended up doing two rounds of IDF which was very expensive um and so we're happy to finally be pregnant\nWe're not we're not going to call her Dave how are you good\nWe just you know going through the stress of that and I see I've seen plenty of friends go through that are wanting to adopt and not be able to because they don't have the money or they have to find rates for years and years and so we were just blessed to not not have\nTo put that on hold because of money\nSo that was definitely a blessing

used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the core worn out to the point is going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is\nThe more the miles would affect it in other words\nA hundred thousand miles dodge neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point\nI don't even know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay it's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example said no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a

Truck afford truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing about that uh it's got easily another hundred in it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing [noise]\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again the only kind of depends on your budget and how nice car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or now I've got to got about fifty something on it\nAnd um so it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day\nAnd um\nSo you know you just you're looking at your situation to what is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't know how can I just I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it it's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how are you\nHey they play ... ... what's up I'm Seventeen years ago and I cook a senior I've got about three thousand dollars and I couldn't count out donating should I end up in New Hampshire and then you're going to college the community college within a cause for entertainment and olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... service\nThe College of either and you know of course yeah yeah\nI Will be true if you get some search some certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that on crime so that's what you want to do you won't be a programmer or you want to be an hour or whatever\nMhm okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus\nUm you can invest it ah\nHere's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to pin a nine point nine\nFinish college and all your education was he wrote that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and is a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know may I talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account to stage\nA with this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree\nAnd your field of study whether it's a two year whether it's certifications in the tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream without any that\nAnd that three thousand dollar spin on that is more important than but then the mutual fund and so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route\n[noise] if you need to thanks for calling open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in

correct that the weight on sixty seven or uh okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nCorrect okay I probably would split the difference because I don't like\nThe pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly run state and now we're better than all those guys [laughter]\nSo uh but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we can all those are for then that means we need to put it in ten percent\nRight you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension and Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere to be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that so a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and just round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it you know it's a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so um\nUm [noise] you know go

it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team in his own to have you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nOne of the main things that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is

paid for and he came home last so early that same during one for that one but um we mortgage at this point when we're in a profit for mortgage that we have a construction law now\nAnd we are in the process of turning it into a regular market but I just have a bad feeling about it and I'm thinking about it\nAnd we and we can get another one without mortgage I just don't feel good about it\nOkay\nBut he he wants to come in and have done that if I get them you know 'cause I'm a property manager\nHe said it's up to you yeah buddy bought it without talking to you\nOh no no he bought it

for taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nWell my my wife and I have a Dell a about a hundred and forty thousand dollars and a two and a half years good for you\nBut we've only got about two hundred will pick up 'cause we have our mortgage oil free rental property but we are mortgages and and the two and a half years we've had uh\nThree rental properties that we have mortgages on and and the two and a half years we've had a fungal graduate high school he's in college we paying about half the tuition would have been taken out loans the other half and I and\nI stopped contributing to a four one K. and if I got a beginner baby step say but I just feel like I I'm not sure what to do next I I feel like I'm\nNot doing everything I could do from my family right now\nWhat's your household income\nBrought a hundred thousand\nOkay so can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school and stop the studio is\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on a these rental properties as we've been for the past couple of years\nOkay if you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into bed I Would rather pay get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is there a reason they plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess that is needed to hear it ah 'cause he's got two younger brothers\nThat are going to be going to college to here in the next two years old yeah\nWell ... maybe steps four or five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income and retirement five is kids college which human or cash flowing in this case\nAnd ah the Sixers payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth a but really um you know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to\nPay on your mortgage is yeah which is stupid\nIn an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I should just say for a lot of our consumer it that we should just save up a a but for three maybe four month of merge safe on it and then yeah\nAnd then and then ... then I stopped taking out student loans\nAnd clear them out and then do the same with the other two and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there is money above that then we started throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two but it sounds like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn the house is trying to get them and then and that was more of your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about about fifty sixty Seventy thousand a piece\nOkay a fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen\n... yeah yeah and for that one is the only ones only twenty five thousand or write them a check like a year from now and I was going to feel good and my son is still alive they take out a low\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental ... there was one in there somewhere to make that math work All right ah yeah still I'm just going to plink along on those minimums and take care of college without that first\nOnce we got college without that then we find money we throw it at the at the probably go knock out a little twenty five one out and then among next knocked my house out 'cause it's a pretty even with the other ones\nAnd then how about ... back in the four oh one K. or not\nDo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now now okay yeah well no as soon as you get your emergency fund right\nYeah emergency fund is maybe step three and then baby step forest Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack maybe steps four five six in order to actually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right\nIt's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then if there was money left we keep going down the list and the next thing on the list as mortgage\nSo the so there's still a prioritization even though it's simultaneously that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead but for ... for two and three I guess technically\nYou're skipping five or ... yeah yeah and you have any skip three to yeah [laughter] yeah\nSo yeah you're on our lawyers wouldn't know what you buy an order that's all we did you can do it's good plan man thanks for calling in a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nHi Mr ... the it's an honor to talk to you how can I Do wide open for you [laughter] okay um\nWe had our house currently on the market right now we listed it in July for two Fifteen [noise] um I Know there's not an ill in our area [noise] um we just lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [laughter] we've had only one showing\nWe've had hundreds of heads on line [noise] um what we're struggling with here that we paid one fifty for the house\nThe average stays on the market and my area as three hundred and sixty nine [laughter] good\nLord what is wrong with the area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania\nWe have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half million [noise] um and then ... and so that that occasion because it's on a lake\nWe're on water on a on a dream but I'm a military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYeah so you're not in out in Harrisburg proper them no no I'm In like northeast yesterday a New York border but so your biggest problem is you have a very\nLimited market yes the a dummy three sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in\nI mean and all that says is you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff right\nAnd you just have a limited market I don't know what to do your other than\nA is there anyone in the resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort\nIs or is there a a real her up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere the kind of specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the have stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our military that Jeff not not purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that\nResort area the higher end stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a ... I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these ... it's so rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise] we need to get it where we have an hour drive to work we can't can't do it anymore you know that's a great kid you know\nWe're on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like that we just say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices are promising a you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at\nThey're looking at it on line\nAll their workers they're not they're not clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through and they when they realize where it was they walked away there were not\nClient's location Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\nThat 'cause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor\nThe location Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised [noise]\nYeah 'cause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours here on for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the lot you know\nBut he found a buyer for us to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one\nI mean do I pick another well yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and it says gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe\nAt under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself after your realtor is the person that can do that\nThis that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel them down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area\nAnd that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you and not a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't work this area\nThey and they don't have a central Myers ones you need it it's a very unique\nSemi rural ... situation\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches are being recorded every\nDay and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy the I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were at the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and simply wasn't that way on one of\nThose ads [laughter] I was actually not that way for\nA while one of my best friend's actually said don't you lie to de France they holler out for it beginning so I mean I'm\nA ... what's your all's income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the force handy one\nWord it was really difficult to to give up something that you know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that but it also kind of oil down here they are getting older and we have you\nKnow what do we want to do with them as they get old ... and and what do we want to show the end and said we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart has you know we needed to see what was important\nAnd they're going to see that you know well and the other things are obviously in terms of time spent somewhere where there's the beach with a lake that kind of stuff\nWith the income you've got no debt even do anything you wanted to yeah I mean you can go to like in Europe if you want I mean it's you know you can do whatever you want to as as not even anywhere near as expensive as those houses are so it was right it's um you know you are your freed up to still have incredible\nA family member he's doing it doing recreational type stuff is what I'm trying to say you're interesting very interesting\nSo um so a big pile of it was that what was the rest of the debt\nSo our our whole debt is um\n[noise] by paying by virtue of paying those off who were able to pay off the home that we live and mhm\nWe we use the cash derived from that\nPlus cash flow and some savings\nTo pay for our home that we live and\nOkay so it was just three property ... yeah that's where I was all your real estate I mean that's all your debt whichever party is okay for the whole meal events worth what one point six wow you guys are amazing\nCongratulations well and obviously holding back\nThen and clearing that that's a big part of the equation there yeah 'cause that's secure and amazing spam slowly amazing so you're sitting there with a net worth Whelan access or two million dollars now easily I'm the I'm guessing it for one case but with this income you got to be loading that up so um\nHow you feel it feels great I mean I'm you know I'm I'm\nI'm kinda to the point of a second guessing even even having so much of our network tied up in a house ... um so\nBut it feels great you know it's it's a it's a first step and a journey yeah yeah\nWell I get give
