M. I. P. M. I. stands for private mortgage insurance\nWhich basically is insurance that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on un lose money on the foreclosure\nThose rules for it so it hasn't zero benefit to you under any circumstance it's only because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio you see what I'm saying\nOkay at ... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus a month per one hundred thousand borrowed [noise]\nSo you were in a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage he got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone if you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we push people towards twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference\nVersus ten percent and so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payments no more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down and you get ... on your first time that's not the end of the world and you can get rid of the PM I when you pay the loans down to eighty percent of value\nBy buying an appraisal that the mortgage from an appraiser that the mortgage company approves of and then they will drop the PM I later after you get it pay down\nThe fact that we're in fact in California where home prices are no fairly high compared to this country making ...\nAn hour doesn't make any difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just because you're in California they don't like okay you're on the on that doesn't count\nYou know we don't do that so you still gotta use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're at the higher the ... market you're in the more difficult this discussion because when you get all the way down to ... percent\nI'm not requiring twenty percent but you get you get J. D. how it's much to your advantage\nTo not have that state of mind\nThat I mean because you had are talking about three or four hundred thousand dollar loan I mean we're talking about some money per month to going out the window for insurance that's worth absolutely zero to you\nRight so that's what I'm trying to avoid here but it's not so if you buy and you don't put down twenty percent then keep counting on that mortgage keep working your baby steps four five six simultaneous get that mortgage pay down and get that loan reset\nWith an appraiser plant that's approved and then get that PM I drop so you're not doing the um African one years\nBecause it just sucks it's just a horrible you know it's just but it's part of the race and it's a it's a logical reason that they require it but it's just super expensive\nAnd it just as bad so you want to get out of it as soon as you can because then you get to the business are really paying on your mortgage and not ...\nExpensive and it just as bad so you want to get out of it as soon as you can because then you get to the business are really paying on your mortgage and not just wasted money but yeah I I you know we don't beat up on a first time homebuyer you don't baby step three B. for not putting down twenty percent\nUh the goal always is to become a hundred percent that free as fast as we can and not waste any money we don't have to waste that's what we that's the goal we all have well those of us that are in tune with being smart anyway\nNick is with us in Chattanooga Hi Nick welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave it's

I'm a little over a hundred\nThousand okay are you guys millionaires\nWe are not yet okay but you're on your way we are only ears and having five kids going to school how old are they what's age

life and your money Tony is with us in Quincy, Illinois I Tony how are you\nAfternoon there thanks for taking my call the pleasure to be speaking with you sir you too how can I help um yes we currently have a Nineteen year old I'm ... and the crime that my son's best friend living with us he makes about declares Eighteen hundred a month\nAnd it has a car payment to twenty to help on what should about eighty bucks and for gas about a hundred bucks\nWe budget for the month we're just trying to kind of figure out we got more than ... systems countries live with us real fast his his wallet was basically his bank account he has no bank account yet [noise]\nUm what I wanted to know is how do we go along and do the envelope system was budgeting has money and putting money away and try to help and figure out what to do with all his actress\nOkay well I think you teach them how to do a budget and that's where every dollar has a name before the months begins right yeah it sounds like it sounds like it's a fairly primitive easy budget\nYeah there's not much that there are and they don't like Thirteen hundred dollars only are\nKnow and let's get the car paid off and build up an emergency fund and skill that without um that'll make sense but but um you know we're teaching these basic things that you and I both know about apparently you been\nDoing the stuff that we talk about for a while and the hour we're going to be on a budget we're going to avoid that we're going to build up an emergency savings and begin long term investing\nOkay we're going to be generous with some of the money and uh so the whole thing that you get when you got someone that's living in a fairly primitive situation like this meeting no bank account you know he's a young young guy getting started is\nThat ah it's real easy for all that money to just disappear [noise]\nYeah and the egg thing you've got to get him doing is being intense\nEntertainment or how much are you going to spend on what's your take to keep your car running gas wise and your insurance and your car payment\nAnd then do you take this income and give every dollar a name right down the page I mean this is a one page budget you can do in about eight minutes you know yeah there's not there's not a lot to this deal is not like it's complicated\nOkay yeah we got some level or set up for like I'm I'm ... and the ... like a car like emergency fine as far as you go with your car stuff you have things we do have said in his corner about ten percent of his marine home we put in your savings Warren\nOkay well no I I Would I Would work the baby steps I mean not southern belles in dollars aside as my emergency fund and then after that I got his car paid off and then after that I have a fully funded emergency fond of three to six months of expenses in his case he be rich if he had no debt in five ... five grand and savings wouldn't it\nYeah it'd be really well off so\nOkay well then again I then I Would start is investing long term start talking about a Roth IRA and those kinds of things and he would start talking about maybe some additional savings so he can have its own blood\nOkay thank you very much they thank you for calling it appreciate you joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Vicky is with us in Wilmington North Carolina\nI think yeah Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I have a question about an inheritance [laughter] um my husband and I are small business owners and we have\nA significant amount of debt with the business end our personnel which is a lot to the business for ... years during the recession and find several years ago and that we have a twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance that we [noise] um [noise] my husband had hope that we could\nUse for the kids' college I have one daughter that's in her freshman year of college now and then another one that will be starting next fall and then two other teenagers and it may be safe and\nSo this business of making money it's struggling it makes many now but we still have a good bit of debt from time to make profit\nUm profit uh\n\nProbably\nWell I have to say probably doesn't make it up to that type of the past few years but I'm\nGoing to live in this mythology\n[laughter] um I don't know we every time he had said okay I Need to get jobs in there it's like that door closes and this has door stays open and um\nBusiness doors not open it's not making enough to support your family and so we need to sit down on this business and give it a deadline that in the next six months it's going to start supporting\nOur family after all these years and making enough to start getting rid of some of his death or we're going to close it\nAnd get a job because I don't think you're making any money\nUm am I wrong [noise] well\nI mean we pay ourselves and the business and I was bringing home I'm about a hundred thousand a year\nBringing oh you're you're taking a hundred thousand dollars out of business yep well that'd be called profit okay you can't live on a hundred thousand dollars\nWell we can do that we had a lot of debt and how much debt if you go with the business as the guy said\nAbout fifty two K. and we personally have about um Ninety six K\nWere you in the business doesn't have any debt you son personally for it OK so at all is damaging she never no it's all in dollars in debt and you have a hundred a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt and you make a hundred thousand dollars a year is that all you makes a hundred thousand or the that's what you're pulling out and then you make a profit to\nNow that's all we like that\nOther than that and you make a hundred thousand dollars a year is that all you makes a hundred thousand or the that's what you're pulling out and then you make a profit to\nNow that's all we make that's what I mean we are\nTaxable income when you do your taxes is right\nKay it has banned it looks like an account to check things out there that we're taking distribution of a profit and that does that change it right now that how much we're ... we're paying ourselves a ... a year ... you need to find out what the profit if you don't know that\nYou can you give me three different answers so you need to find out if you make if your business is making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you guys can't live on a hundred dollars a year you got other problems\n[laughter] right yeah\nAnd you can pay off that making a hundred thousand dollars a year and work your way through it and know the twenty nine thousand dollars does not need to go the kids' college fund it needs to go to clean up his dad gummed ... what made\nOkay but it don't ... the only way that makes sense is\nIf you have a system in a plan where you actually know if the businesses making a profit and if it is making a profit what the property is and it's all coming home to pay off these debts or if you want to pay off the fifty two thousand at the business and call that business that I don't care but we need to be reducing debt\nRight quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year younger people do that but you got aren't living on a plan the business is not on a plan and your personal lives on a plant I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I Know and we just got ... in the mail today and when it started to do that\nThat's a good start and and I'm going to send you a copy of the book entree leadership on the business side so uh because here's the thing you need to be going no no I'm not going to quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business\nYou know I'm not going to quit that but what we are saying then is is that when you did fine tune in give I think you're good at making money I don't think you're as good at managing it\nAnd so we need to fine tune our systems at the business the profit and loss statements the the budgets at the business and so we know exactly where every dollar at the business is going and exactly where it's coming from\nAnd then exactly what's coming home and what is taxable income and then lay out a game plan to pay off a hundred and forty two thousand dollars worth of in\nBetween these two different sets of debt and work your way through it you can do both and use the twin on thousand towards that go if you don't do that and you throw the twenty nine thousand that the goal and then you never pay off the debt it was kind of wasted wasn't it\nSo I'm not asking you to blindly throw it at the store today I just thought of that and I thought the debt and throwing a system at your business in the system in detail\nBudget at your home and all of that applied directly on this problem so the problem goes away and the twenty nine thousand as part of the solution to that\nBut the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the money at home and at work pulled on I'm going to give me a copy of the book entree leadership is is is that I've Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\n\n\nOkay things are getting ... out there I thought the Equifax breach was bad enough it exposes the

for taking my call day sure what's up [noise] well I'm Wondering\nIf I Need more life insurance that I have\nOkay [noise] how much do you have\nA have a two hundred and fifty thousand okay what's your household income [noise] sorry what's your household income [noise] a hundred and eighty what do you make [noise] hundred and fifty\nOkay and you have two hundred and fifty in life insurance and how much in your nest egg do you have in wealth um and investments\nA word debt free of the home and land mhm and that's worth about one point eight mhm [noise] and then I have [noise] about four hundred thousand and four ones and Ross\nOkay good and uh what do you owe on the land and home [noise]\nUh five hundred and twenty okay All right\nWell the income produced off of six hundred and fifty thousand dollars let's just use it that's the two fifty and the four hundred\nYou got those two numbers mhm if those two were invested in just rent round numbers just to make this easy if it was ten percent that'd be sixty five thousand dollars a year she doesn't get to keep the land in the house in that scenario does she\nKnow\nCamp for service and a half a million dollar debt with sixty five thousand our income and raise kids right Yes sir okay so you're under insured if your goal was for her to stay in that property upon your death\nNow if she liquidated input seven hundred thousand the equity of that buys a two hundred thousand dollar house has five hundred in her hand plus has two fifty plus has four hundred now she's got over a million dollar she's got paid for two hundred thousand dollar house\nAnd she can live on a hundred thousand dollars a year then are coming off of a million one that makes sense so if that your plan you're okay but if you wanted to stay on that property and continue to live there you don't have enough insurance do you see how I'm doing that\nYes there are there okay so what's the goal which one uh would you wanted to stay on the lambs I Want her to stay on the land Oprah she wants to stay on the land but I Would rather she would live close with us from family okay\nAnd then if you if you if you want the ability to do that we need 'em\nYou

Wichita, Kansas Hi Benjamin how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call they sure what's up\nWell I have a question for you I'm I'm now considered ensure a ball and my term life insurance will expire next year I'm In our FAU class there are some of us that are considered uninsured rubble\nSo our one of my questions is what should we do instead of term life insurance and in my case I already have accidental death insurance in place should I go ahead and canceled or keep it since I'm now can't get term insurance\nHow old are you [noise] forty three why are you not ...\nHistory of diabetes I'm no longer diabetic but I I just got 'em that diagnosis removed but I've had that in the past five years of my history\nOkay have you checked with Zander insurance and see what they can Roger\n[noise] we're in the process of having them do that kind of a double check\nOkay no dry out or something yeah because you know every day that goes by you're going to be more and more in trouble in your situation so that's great news is ... hopefully is a short lived a issue\nOkay because in other words I think I think you're gonna be able to get insurance on just don't know exactly when or what is going to cost that's the other thing you've got to look at it could be unreasonable but I'm diabetes is a real tough\nDiagnosis for life insurance really tough so um anyway\nThe answer to your question overall is if someone's uninsured well yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental\nThat would be your cause a except that you've had the diabetes issue um but otherwise I mean you you statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidental death as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kind of gimmick insurance is what it is a definitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay you know to the very last moment and if you're a term is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nNo I have not I didn't know about those\nSometimes they do ah sometimes it's very very expensive uh but again you might be worth it or if you've got a non medical renewal it may just jump way up like triple or something what you're paying now kind of thing um so would you have like a ten or twenty year term it's run out\nRight twenty or turn when we first got married yeah\nStar Trek was nominated for Academy Awards at the second

salary my my husband has traditionally been tricked position where they're going to be giving him a pay raise but with that pay raise they're saying that he also has that they're going to be transitioning him and his salary pay she usually works between five and twenty hours of overtime each week\n'cause I Want to make sure that when he they haven't given him in a form of awkward yet but when they do want it to make sure that how would you how would you recommend to calculate whether\nThat the salary rate is comparable with sample the hours that he was working before and the pay that he would get what overtime\nWhich sounds like it would be simple you've been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that and overtime correct correct and so what was his income last year including the overtime with about forty\nYes he's going to be moving into management because they shed\nNo but I mean further up later oh okay but let's say like I say they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary will we be dancing wouldn't we\nYeah okay 'cause that's like that's like getting paid a lot more and I'm working the same number of hours you know it's like it's almost like he picked up more hours but didn't have to work on usually what I'm saying but ... but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did in my favor and it's a band and he gets paid forty\nBut he's working the same number of hours where he's working when he's making forty eight then that's not a blessing\nYeah it's just making sense to you yeah that makes sense if it's even if it's forty eight to forty eight we still like the salary because of the upward potential\nOkay long term to long term good career movies moving into leadership into management and that's where he wants to head towards long term\nBut I'm ... you know\nYes but but again you just compare it to last year's income so the whole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand what's the salary do 'cause that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently Chris is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how're

as I can good or not it cooks right now I came up with the idea for an invention mhm\nAnd I don't know whether to keep you know steam rolling my debt plan and doing all that are just you know kind of jumped ship and say hey this is something that could you know be my future and potentially mhm [laughter] so\nI mean it kind of want a young lady of financial advice from you know what to do with the remaining dead I have and yeah my aspiration [laughter] because I'm In the process I've been saving to uh be a home loan shift about their so any advice you can give me I'd be greatly appreciated right\nWell I'm going to avoid buying a home until I got the debt cleared the only question is then how can we start working on the invention idea and make some money now 'cause we don't need to make a a bunch of money five years from now we need some money today\nOne of them twenty thousand dollars touch a show the invention you came up with as a physical product\nHe is or if they are older the odor either slash a mold a little small machine that um [noise]\nPeople getting on their home okay and you've made one\nUh I just made a very um rudimentary crowded type mhm the next the next phase I've got is like either be at the end of my rainy day fund or start come into my regular cash flow and like buying a computer and get my three D. modeling\nAnd get me a couple of silicon prototype so I can go you know take it to a you know take the next level or what I Want to do so again Dr\nJump off my my debt plan more do I have kids my invention [noise] okay um\nWell what you're talking about you could spend anywhere from twenty five dollars to a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it there's really no in between I mean you could just go anywhere you want to go with this there's a lot of money to be spent on something like this\nHundred and fifty thousand dollars on it there's really no in between I mean you can just go anywhere you want to go with this there's a lot of money to be spent on something like this and if you were a billionaire and you you know what you would do is you would build a couple of them and you get them out there and test them and make sure that they work and that there was a market for it before you went into production\n... because you don't go into production on prototypes that are on tested or from an R and D standpoint or you don't go into production on something that I've got no market for it not been able to sell it\nBecause you can let you make a hundred thousand of them and having them in your basement or if you had unlimited sums ever be able to sell\nYou know ... I'd like trying to ah continue to do with the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one and let's find somebody to put one in there and the property and a commercial applications\nAnd let's say let me give me just let's just make up a pretend example okay\nBe like your ideal thing you build one or two in your garage\nAnd you convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the ... the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works\nAnd if the deal works than I'm what I'm going to want you to his place in order for ten of them or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside to test it and then if they place that order they just place in the closet with you large enough to build the order\n... and it finds itself\nThat's called organically cash flowing something in other words you you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order with enough of a deposit to feel to manufacture your first order out\nI think I should dial down uh my rather than just an all my extra capital towards paying off my credit card debt and I didn't learn that\nI don't think you have time and much capital on this you've already you're already built one in the garage yeah build another one [noise] okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right\nIs cheaper than that but I I just see I'm a protective I Want it to be you know a good credit\nThat's another opponent ... there are no professions [laughter] very they're very purpose of a prototype despite all the crap that's broken [laughter] want to get it perfect you're going to put it out\nThere in the end the marketplace is going to kick it around and you're going to learn foreman function changes informants function changes in this which has to be on that side of this which has to be made out of this has been to that and you're only going to learn that if you beat up about a hundred of them but let's get two of them in somebody's restaurant\nIn there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later are two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got um you know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got to have the ... on and and then they give you enough money [noise]\nAnd they're a deposit for the initial order for you to do your manufacturing\nAnd basically you got almost nothing out of pocket [noise] except your brain power and you're sweating [noise]\nAnd that's how a lot of these things get off the ground\nWay a lot of people lose a lot of money on them is they go into mass production or something to prove a new marketplace where the actual prototype\nYou're talking to a guy who's lost some money that way the stupid stuff so [noise]\nDo easy man go easy this is the day Ramsey show\nYears and one of the most asked questions I get is day one are you going to do a lot of them in and our city\nYou teach people how to keep up with the Joneses so there were no sign you are have come up with that doing it infomercial regularly scheduled programing [laughter]\nThank you very nice well it is fun because they're not only in hold you accountable but you get to watch people you really get a front row seat to watch people change their lives\nYeah and those nine weeks you know we've had stories folks come up to us and and and and one of the older gentleman or a class with tears in his eyes just saying you know\nI've never stuck to anything in my life and and I'm doing this and it's working I'm seeing I'm going to follow this for a while just it blesses you and the same man oh it's more than the

out of that together the two things are these three things what do you tell them\nThat and I would say the budget if I get really set up for success for the rest nearly even at one point I think
