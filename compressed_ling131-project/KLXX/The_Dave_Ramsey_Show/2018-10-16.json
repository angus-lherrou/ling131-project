to ever obviously what ... what I refinance my house in order to buy a thirty thousand dollar car not in a million years\n[laughter] you know and it's basically the same equation were just saying it in different ways as we continue in our conversation here and sometimes if you just look at it through a different different stand over on the other side of it and look at it from the left rather than from the right you see oh my God that really is done you know and so it's not as\nIt's not as a you know it's not just Dave says sell the car it's do you really want to finance this car over Fifteen Years\nYou know what I Want to do that so and it's a car I Can't afford I Can't afford it because I didn't pay for it\nUm if you didn't pay for it when you can't afford it so yeah I'm Sorry dude I Know it's a sweet car car guy and I like nice cars but I'm too many times are nice cars have us instead of us have them Shannon is with us in Atlanta Hi Shannon how are you\nIndiana alright welcome to Nashville and all the way here to do a debt free screen Oh yes they love it how much of you to pay it off\nSo we paid off a hundred and forty two thousand five hundred dollars and twenty eight months\nGood for you and your range of income during that two and a half years we started out about Ninety thousand and ended it about a hundred and forty five thousand wow great what I'll do for a living\nOn a physical therapist and on the engineering assistant at a local electric utility company very cool well congratulations gosh so what kind of what was the one hundred and forty thousand dollars\nWell I'll answer this question because all of it was mine\nYeah unfortunately I'd Fifteen five and a vehicle and then a hundred and twenty seven thousand to get all that we may say wow\nHow long have you guys been married three years three years and so shortly after marriage the two of you look at this pile of debt and something happened tell me what how many are story\nBut we were just kind of do in a normal thing um we were actually started out on the the ten year forgiveness program and I actually heard you come across the radio um while I was driving around in my work track and uh just was always interested in finances but really never knew\nUm where to start or where to begin and we picked up on your program and within a few weeks I purchased a total moneymaker ever read the book I talk or and I said we got to get on this I said we're doing it all wrong and uh and we started it out\nAnd uh she just kind of followed my lead on it oh I Would just like that yeah it was it was I mean she's a follower and she\nWas really good I have some leadership [laughter]\nShe uses words she didn't read the book really at all um and then eventually of after I don't know about a year into the program she was starting to get mad at me because of the program and everything I said we just need to\nUm instead of yelling at me we need to go the financial peace and then you can hear it from the source right from days and then you can you take somebody does my back exactly\nYellow yell at the video guy yeah very cool okay so you got in there then and you saw it for yourself rather than just going oh the engineer knows the numbers you know because I kind of how it started right yes the engineer guy he's going to do the numbers I'm the\nMedical personnel let him do the numbers and then you get in there and you see it for yourself so what happened when you went to the class coordinator gave you a emotional ownership really in this thing\nHere I think it made it very tangible for me something that I could see and that the leaders of our class they were very open about their debt and how they had read it and that was something motivating for me\nFor me it felt like it was this constant uphill battle and I had this crazy burden because it was on line yeah it's a little bit of a guilt trip yeah lately and so that class honestly made me feel a little more support it and just give us the opportunity to truly jump in and know that actually getting out of debt was realistic\nWhen you first start Jim how did you do it this fast we are a lot of debt and twenty I ... it was a long\nYeah it was hard we started that fast the very beginning of January in two thousand and sixteen now and uh it was it it it was hard\nI mean two years and four months run and yeah and that's that is a long long time but it's a hundred and forty three thousand dollars and you killed at all if yes how old are you too I'm too well we're both ... and you're not even Thirty years old so some of these rockstar also millennials I talk about all the time [laughter]\nVery good good for you guys thinking well Tom cool\nHow does it feel now that you've climbed the mountain\nIs so

excited for us to keep travelling through the baby steps\nWoman you're making a hundred fifty thousand bucks a year and that even Thirty years old and\nIt's pretty good yeah that's awesome show or who are your biggest cheerleaders\nI think it was kind of each other and the very beginning we we didn't talk about it a whole lot um we kind of had some friends and families that were saying like what what are you doing and I think after we got\nRolling through the process and we were getting some traction pan of quite a bit of money ... are quite a bit of debt people started to come around now when you look at somebody go already paid over a hundred thousand dollars are going to shut them up yeah absolutely yeah yeah it's like you don't have to shut up it just says it\nThat's great very cool you guys very very well done which the key to getting out of debt\nFor us I think it was giving it together first of all but also being\nWilling to work very hard I work three jobs and worked every time I bet on and also never really strengthen the path I feel like once we decided to jump into the plan we did not stray from that in honestly whenever I Would buy something like if I spent too much on groceries I Would feel bad\nBecause that was money that would be knocking out my land Mm\nMhm yeah I gave you gave your boundaries on a process you know what about you oh I think the the the\nI\n... it was it was it was good I mean we we we weren't they weren't it was a key for him for you over the main thing that got you out of debt you know work extra ... or if the if you raise your income over fifty thousand dollars Courtney finished a residency program that is huge for her ... she got a big raising them\nYou know I Would I Would say call 'em and and be dispatch at the utility company and just uh the extra income any chance he could get extra overtime home do it you know it really helps the snowball just\nPlow through and go to the finish line\nYou know there's something about that because you're getting traction if he was working like that and you didn't know what if you're doing any good at it you you just be exhausted but it's weird how it's exhilarating 'cause you know you're winning ... you know you work your butt off when you're winning absolutely and it changes everything and now you can crank back down to a normal people hours now and not have to be so

Ramsey Dave Ramsey dot com or at ... dot com you can't buy blends in that room today I'm\nCalling is on a day when you retire start making money from your investments is that income considered earn income or capital gains also aren't capital gains tax much lower than earned income uh that is not considered earn income it is considered investment income\nAnd it depends on what the money's invested in as to whether there'll be capital tax capital gains rate or taxed on an ordinary income right if the investment is paying off on something that is less than a year old it will be an ordinary income if it's coming out of a traditional i._r._a. or it's never yet been taxed\nIt'll be on an ordinary income if it's coming out of a four O. one K. traditional not Ross\nWill be taxed at ordinary income as it comes out um all of the money will be a hundred percent not just the returns because none of it the growth has never been taxed nor the money you put in has never been to act on a traditional so you'll pay ordinary income on those\nIf you have investments simply invested in the piece of real estate you don't pay any taxes until your salad and then you pay taxes on capital gains portion you own investments like a a mutual fund\nOr a low turnover mutual fund you'll have no taxes on that are virtually no taxes on that until you sell it and then you would have capital gains if you've held it over a year so that helps you\nCan check your tax guy this is that I Ramsey show [noise]\nIt's time\nTo take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and

quick question for you so um my wife and I we we waited in house where we saw the one I'm with the money we paid off\nQuick question for you so um my wife and I we we waited in house or we saw uh the one I'm with the money we paid off a lot of our debt\nCredit card car I'm In a few other debt and the only that we have left is student loan debt mhm\nUh on and so we ... we between my wife and I we oh about a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars in student\nLoan debt [laughter] um so what is trying to figure out what we can do between the upgrade of the the new house and the ah the student loans that we have left how will we get paid off but we're just trying to just figure out how to do that [noise]\n[noise] uh spend less than you make and put it on the student loan I mean what are you thinking about and I don't understand\nWho basically we're just we're just trying to figure out like a little bit there's three of them between us I'm a teacher [laughter] um I Know that there are loan forgiveness programs but I'm just trying to figure out\nLoans programs don't work there ten years long you don't want to be in debt ten years what's your household income\nSo take home between my wife and I we um we make to do something about fifty seven thousand a year\nOkay and uh how much is your house payment\nAnd we haven't got an offer so we just moved um so the house payment will be around sixteen hundred a month\nOkay you're riding a fourth that's not bad at All right and you have no other that except the student loans\nCorrect okay and so if you put twenty thousand dollars a year on these is going to take you five years so I think I think you've got to look at ways to increase your income okay you got a lot of student loans for two teachers what are you going we're going to meet you where did you get your degrees\nOr so she has her masters I got my bachelor's was we we both work in a new northern Arizona university\nWow you must have put everything on there um\nYeah

interested I'm with now it's it's like five hundred dollars a month or something just for me ... river\nSo out of five hundred dollars or five hundred dollars a month or six thousand dollars a year you're talking about taking a pay cut of nine thousand dollars mhm you're going to trade six for non if you're doing it for health insurance four one K. benefit was worth very little\nAnd the other

I'm Dave Ramsey your host this show\nAbout numbers purple eight eight to five\nEight to five five two to five Brittany starts off as this hour in Atlanta Georgia Hi Brittany how're you doing today how are you hearing today better than I deserve what so\nFrom well I'm not quite thin and my husband and I only married and I'm suddenly when how they keep them motivated and she's actually the one who\nIntroduced me to you before I graduated he bought it too much on him but and I went and certainly in how I found I went to college in April and after I got married\nBut we struggle when they sang motivated and um I Try to identify it\nUndo every dollar advertising and written by that but then I thought what the every day more and more of an ... an out of every dollar\nA minute to struggle balance thing um I guess\nThey really married all her stuff and then continuing to try to stay on and by that and we've been ran told my negative ads are all my family and that is how I'm trying to learn how to continue my right hand and it and why couldn't you and to call that gift for granted in our marriage\nOkay it's going well\nThe thing is is Jesus said you're treasures where your heart is you know\nWhen you agree on your spending\nAnd you agree on your financial goals you really agreeing on your new lean your new marriages value system\nYou're agreeing on as a couple our fears our dreams our goals\nSo when we're not agreeing on a budget it means that we're really not agreeing about life because money flows to just about everything in our lives right from our generosity to our long term planning like you know stuff like retirement or wealth building\nA all the way to where we are going to eat Thanksgiving dinner your moms are my mom's\nYou know money flows into every one of these decisions and is affected by or affects every one of these decisions so by doing a budget together if forces you to combine your goals and in a new marriage that's essential\nUm when I first got married thirty five years ago they used to tell us the hardest year of marriage was the first year\nAnd that's the reason you're trying to combine everything he's used to doing whatever you want your he's doing whatever you want\nNow we're trying to combine everything the budget is a really good tool relational tool to force you to have those conversations\nCaitlin is on the line in Denver high tailing how are you [noise]\nPay game thank you for taking my call I think Kelly for taking\nTrue on my quest to make like ... my husband started his own paintings right well that just a few months ago and he's done a pretty big contracts but has a vulnerability to work and like it and come to go up there by [noise]\nAnd so we're trying to hire somebody but we're not having a hard time finding good and reliable employees and the industry that as it usually is rather than they hired for how can we get is hoping to branch certainly the one way that we can possibly find reliable and get people to\nBe a part of the small town like that\nSo\nYou don't know any painters that are good and a lot of people well we do know painters that are good I mean people\n... the guy that's the part is that there they haven't been reliable\nYou don't know any painters that are good and reliable people oh well we do know that they have their own businesses as well\nMhm [noise] so the only painters that you know that are good and reliable people already have their own businesses [noise]\nFor the most part yes because they worked we're trying like we we put 'em all that on Craig's list and like nobody's responding to it and so I just we just don't know where to look in order to get\nWell most of the turnout would rely on people run around with good reliable people yeah and most of the time do pushes run around with the ...\nSo usually when I'm looking for good reliable people I look around other good reliable people now that could be that you look in some of the other trades and you're going to Illinois attrition that's a good person or a trim carpenter that's a good person and you start asking them who do they know that's a great\nPainter but you could bring on to the job [noise]\nOf the problem I have a job as you're in a very very hot construction market in Denver and so everybody's got work even do\nYeah and your has your husband's got more working hand or maintenance so that that you've got a bit of a labor shortage ah when you've got a construction but I'm always in the city\nAnd that's what you're facing a little bit of but the way I have found like you know and there is ample in our world it wouldn't be a painter but in our world it might be someone that's in technology\nSomeone that is a great Rubio unreal developer as an example there's a shortage of technology and Web developers out there right now in most cities including Nashville in Nashville is actually a tech hub\nBut um you know there's a shortage so where do we find those well we you know we go on like you've done website you go on Craig's list but we get in technology groups and\nAssociations and but mainly great developers no other great developers great painter isn't or the great painters or somebody is not a developer who has other influence in the end of the knowledge of the tech industry that's a great person will no somebody's great developer and send them our way\nAnd of course you're going to pay them\nAnd pay them well and I'm a\nBut paying a dupe is doesn't make them anything except a well paid ... so you you want to pay people well but you that that's not the part of the only part of the equation as you've already discovered so the only way I don't know how to find them would be to find other people in other trades that are excellent and people in the\nPainting world that are excellent and try to move them onto your team once you get a couple of excellent people they will have a tendency to help you find the other excellent people uh sixty four percent of people to join our team last year were internal referrals someone already working here\nThat was a thoroughbred wanted new in thoroughbred that wouldn't want him to work here in another area that we have the advantage of being a little bit larger and having a vast array of jobs not just a single job available but but that's how I've always done it I've I've found thoroughbreds Roma thoroughbreds and donkeys run with donkeys\nAnd so you know you just got to find out find your thoroughbreds and and people out in the community the thoroughbred since I Do there is a steak dinner in it for you guys send you a good guy you sent him a steak dinner you send him nice seeing him and his wife through scripts or something because it's worth it\nTo get somebody in there and you know being being good that way and I'll tell you I'm going to send you a copy of a book that is one of my favorite hiring books that have written the last two years and it it it's from a friend pat Lynch you only it's called the ideal team player and the ideal team player is three things hungry\nHumble and smart hungry humble and smart\nAnd that's what you're looking for in any position in any organization and every trade and every organization has some people to qualify other high quality people every single one\nAnd if you can put them together in a trade that by and large is not that kind of people then you really a brand differentiated yourself from the other people in your marketplace so hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we will send that to you\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five that's triple eight eight to five five two to five or ... is with us in Wilmington, Delaware Hi Lucia how are you\nHi there thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nI'm new at for her and I ... and it's going to put my question actually that out of the four oh one K. profit sharing with my former employer\nI never get over like if a gas station ... role ever IRA and then I got a minute and allow yesterday basically there was a other section where the fees or over three thousand dollars and I further into it there ... fortune for friends\nAnd our for eight different fine and kind of confused with every three thousand dollars of my money how much money was in there\nThat actually it was only around Eighteen thousand dollar\nIn dollars of my money how much money was in there it wasn't that much actually with only around Eighteen thousand dollars [laughter] [noise]\nI'm not aware of a mutual fund that has a forfeiture fee\nSo I'm looking at um it's a ... with a different side of names and then it says forfeiture and that has a bunch of negative and it adds up to almost thirty one hundred dollars that's a yeah I thought I thought especially when it was only you know a small four one K. to begin with\nYou know really um did you roll it with a smart rest or pro\nI rolled it over into a previously on another area that I had already event\nSo you don't have an advisor I don't okay um\nI Am sorry I Do not know the answer your question our normal into the ... the only thing I can guess is is that\nYou bought a ... that your company or former company the mutual funds are high the mutual funds or some gun\nThat have got some kind of gotcha and they're obviously okay but I don't know what they are go ahead and get in touch with one of the more of us are pros and your area and just see if they will answer that question for you okay maybe they can tell you exactly what happened at least you'll have a mystery solved some day Ramsey too stupid to answer that question because I just don't know the answer\nThe others don't but I'm Sorry I Wish I did read Joel is with us in a Decatur, Alabama Hi Rachel how are you\nI'm great day how are you for taking my call\nSure what's up [noise] so\nMy employer is going through open enrollment or our health insurance benefit and I'm kind of on the fat and I'm hoping that maybe you could kind of helped me job\nUm they've introduced a new high deductible a program with an H essay which they will be contributing to and I'm trying to decide should I keep my traditional TPS plan or should I jump on board but it's high deductible plans\nTo how much is a premium on the ...\nThe premium will be eighty two per pay period they calculate to about Twenty one hundred a year\nAnd what about the other one\nThe other one will be around thirty four hundred a year okay\nThirty four hundred to Twenty one hundred she'll Thirteen hundred dollar spread yet and cry and how much is the doctor will only is\nIt OK so on the radio it will be four hundred per individual or the ... and for the high deductible it's Thirteen fifty per individual but there is a twenty seven hundred for the family you know\nAnd how how uh how old are your kids my kids are ten and Thirteen are there any um\nOngoing illnesses or something but [noise] oh well they're all really honored adoptable how often do well I'll say like right as of right now we just hit that adoptable at one of our family members emerging that hit in the year so I said\nOkay so here's the thing you just compare your Thirteen hundred savings versus the risk taking\nMore fairly healthy we don't usually run through the double the hot enough to blow a premium makes a lot of sense for us and that's how you look at\nIt\n\nAsked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance was not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial neat that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well stay at home parents\nWow yeah my hero yeah how do you do that what do you tell them what's the key to getting out of debt\nI think it's the budget you gotta start there um and I think now on this side of it you just have to believe that it's going to work and just keep plugging away at it um and small steps add up to a giant stuff at the end\nAnd I I Would add to that uh the giving them the ties in um was really scored a man where when we started I\nUsed to routinely saying click while we're driving in church like boy that's what we're given what we are tied into the church today you know we could do this or do that and I'm just slowly over time that's changed and I don't have this um you know deficit mentality any more aware and taking away it's we've learned how to live\nHave joy within our means and once you hit that point it's um\nIt just makes the road a lot easier to drive now so you had a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar mortgage approximately when you started this\nAnd um it didn't seem real that would ever get paid off somewhere along the line you looked up and said uh this is going\nStarted like you were writing down he wants to the climbing up
