I can cook it at the two of those are you actually do have to get up on the roof\nDon't believe it does I think you have to mix it up and put it in like a pump Springer okay\nAnd so you may have to get up there and just spray downloads to follow the instructions are website is wet and forget dot com\nYeah and it is a product that once you get in on the surface overtime and continue to work so it's not something they're going to have to reapply very often so it is worth it if you can get up there to you know carefully spat\nOkay with that also uh I I ... I had the same problem with the siding on the northern part of my house it gets a lot of that\nYup absolutely reciting for sidewalks improves and you know the nice thing about what and forget it as it doesn't damage your landscaping\nOK okay great great OK well life I greatly appreciate that vice thank you very much\nYou're welcome good luck with that project thanks so much for calling us at ... ...\nWhat were they were like one hundred square feet of floor and you can get styling any room of your home but using flying to create accent malls we've got tips on that project and pays for can't prevent it longer liquidators yet this\nTrendy new look is a really good we can home improvement project it gives you a big impact for relatively small expense and it can bring a very cool and very durable sort of artistic element to your decor\nNow you can use many different form materials for this project you can use hardwood bamboo or the would look tile elementary minor even laminate in all works well for that accent wall say in the bedroom like maples wind the bed or in the living room or a family room and look really good\nNow get pat on the type of flying planes can we can turn to them all using nail glue or even went flying tape\nAt flying acclimate in your home for a few days before you start your project and to get them lay out you know it ranged ... side by side on the floor first and balance out the color and look at the green pattern really sort of move around and be happy with the luck for you and to the wall\nNow here's a tip when you're ready to go you went and saw the first plane starting at the bottom left corner of the wall area and then work your way from sort of left to right and this this is a good way to make sure that you were getting a good mix of the patterns on the wall\nYou also want to have a half inch gap between the planks and ceiling and the floor which is a little bit of room for the Florida naturally expand and contract and you can easily cover that over by molding you'll have a beautiful new very trendy space and really just a one day project\nAnd that's today's camp presented by lumber liquidators with such new trends in hardwood flooring and so many options to choose from your shore to find what's right for you to get experts flying health at every local store\nLocations call one eight hundred hardwood or visit rumble liquidators dot com lumber liquidators hardwood floors for less\nMary in North Dakota need some help with the concrete floor but we do for him wake\nCounty laying concrete at eBay for okay at ... right and if Harry ... ... ... and at that pay for that at like ...\nDo you want to try to stabilize the deterioration of the concrete\nYeah at ... am kind of hair and I kept a bag of pour it out of that\nIs absolutely first of all in terms of the water problem is is a problem that happened after heavy rainfall yeah All right so you've got water that comes in after heavy rainfall I Want to make sure we try to slow this down so it doesn't happen again having some palms things of that nature is not going to stop this from happening again what stops the heavy rainfall from getting in\nHis outside looking at your gutters and you're grading making sure the down spouse or discharging away from the house\nThanks for your gutters are clean the cars were soil slopes away from the house we've got an extensive articles actually several of them on a Monday but dot com just search how to stop a leaking basement is the same advice and we talk about the proper drainage improvements so do that first and then in terms of the country itself you can use a patch in compound\nQuick ... has a patch in compound products you definitely want to use the patch in compound because it's designed to stick to the old concrete if you tried to put new concrete over it is not going to stick\nSo they're ready to use patching compounds are trial apply their latex formula so it's easy to clean up but that will seal the old concrete then once that dries then you can painted and what I Would look for is in the ... floor pain\nOr the Toxie paying so I like because there there are chemical to or when you buy the floor pain you get the paint and a gallon can that's about three quarters spilled and then a court of partner you mix them together store them up and then you apply the pain sometimes there is um an additive that goes in after the fact\nThat gives you some texture to the floor helps kind of hide the dirt but patching it first than having an epoxy paint will have that looking like new in no time\nOkay ... that it that way Karl lack\nQuick creature you I K. R. E. T. it's quick creek concrete patching compound good stuff Mary thanks so much for calling us at a date money pit\nThat Richard in Illinois on the line is getting some water through the foundation tells what's going on\nWhat it is it over time I've got a ranch house where they walk out basement and on the walk out when you come out there is a retaining wall but it was about eight foot tall where it meets the house it hasn't really separated from the house but\nThere is water they get in between and we came along and look around\nIt hasn't really separated from the house but\nThere is water they get in between and we can all end up on the ocean and then they shredded bottom on a heavy rain and then teach back into the basement so I'm trying to figure out the previous owner that had this houses put something in there like a call ... or some type that has got a hard time and\nIt's not falling down too much\nSo this is a gravity situation so let's give you a gravity solution let's have the drainage work with you and not against you and by the way\nYou can steal this so the cows come home and it's still going to find that on its way in which you have to do is stop the water from accumulating so on the opposite side of this retaining wall I'm guessing that there's some run off that goes towards the wall yes there is\nSo what you're going to want to do is is intercept that run off so we don't get as much water that collects in that area we're going to try to do is limit the amount of water that gets in an area that just direct rainfall with no runoff that means no gutter discharge\nNo a runoff from higher elevations so the way we do that is is first of all examine the situation and make sure there's no water dropping\nAt the high side of this work and work its way down if there is you've got to run a pipe underground to get it to a place where it's not going to interfere with ah with leakage into the basement secondly in terms of intercepting the run off what you could do is installed something called the curtain drained Richard\nIt's really it's a rather simple drain you might construct yourself you took a trench that's about twelve inches deep and twelve inches wide you put some stone in the trenches then you put a purported type on top of the stone surrounded with more stone\nPlay a piece of filter cloth across the top and cover with soil so it's all done it's invisible in the end of that dream that you just installed should exit the daylights somewhere so you figure out the best way to do that based on the configuration of your yard will that will do is they'll intercept the water that's coming down from higher elevations\nFor the phone and the trench come up and down the pipe and then run around the house as opposed to collecting and that particular corner\nIf we can keep the water from collecting in that area you will probably be just fine because it's rare that just direct rainfall accumulates enough water to actually leak in the house it's almost always the runoff from gutters and from drainage\nRight well and needless to say I'll probably do some uh get rid of landscaping this gets them a little green bushy along along that well as well so\nYeah and that's a good point 'cause sometimes you can make the problem worse by having landscaping that traps water suggest thing in terms of water control here not in terms of trying to steal that water out and I think you'll be in good shape\nAri thanks so much for calling that might impact now when they\nBreak down at your home you know that life can come to a screeching halt

Fifteen thirty is your liability alright then you've got your own medical or that the uninsured motorists pays that you have a comprehensive polish at that time for them out so I've already got it All right and so All right All right well it's\nOK firing up so you got Fifteen thousand dollars of medical insurance company will pay and ah they're they're willing to pay for it or the Fifteen thousand\nPound red for ... for ... you know that okay\nAll right they got it All right All right good not five Fifteen thousand dollars okay now I understand All right so what's your question\nIs whether or not wanting to Panama ...\nAround and they're not willing to pay any more than the Fifteen thousand is that correct\nNo they haven't offered that they're not allowed\nTo do our own right so what do you mean they're not allowing you you're not allowing you to do what\nThey had insurance like for the other\nYou know I understand the insurance companies they know they're not willing to pay you know what you're claiming that you do\nYour road I get it so what's your question insurance companies who says no we're not going to pay that amount of money we're going to give you this and they offer you any money yet at all they have not and there's been a year and a half ago yeah but you're but you're still treating correct\nYeah than another way I have to pay for treatment and they were either enjoy that I read that but um I\nI'm All right but there were any more than what they're not going to pay beyond the Fifteen thousand\n\nRight they have not paid that are offered that amount\nAll right then you then what you end up is you end up suing your own insurance\nCompany under the uninsured motors policy\nWhile I was going to the person that\nI Know but what good is that do\nWell I don't have insurance\nRight in the rye for it differently so that it where do you think you're going to get money from my how much money do you think you're going to pay you uninsured no license\nI don't know but my question to ask that one I had found out and I was going to let that when I met with the U.S like the curriculum and said they handle that so I planned on file and at night to have information\nOh God what why you don't need any of that you have if you're already in touch with the insurance company the insurance company is already accept the fact you're not ... is that correct yeah\nRight so now you're only talking now you're only talking or the damages and your insurance company doesn't want to pay Fifteen thousand bucks okay so you're turning around and sue them now you can sue the other driver ah\nAre insurance company doesn't want to pay Fifteen thousand bucks okay\nSo you're turning around and sue them now you can sue the other driver or\nWho will of course not answer or you'll get a judgment and ah then when you don't collect your judgment venue to your own insurance company three years down the road to just go to your own insurance company and say here at this point it's forget the other driver your insurance company will go after\nThe other driver under aged ordination claws\n[laughter] what I found out it filed\nFor a no matter at this point yeah I Know I Know ... almost never us or ah one's filed and by the way for people that don't are ones you have to file there's more than five hundred dollars for the damages both sides have to file aid and with the DMV and who cares\nA war with the state of California I don't even know what agency ... that doesn't matter so let's get away from me I saw one 'cause that changes nothing\nRight what you have is you have a driver who was uninsured you have fun and shared motorists that will not pay for the damages your policy you're saying no we're not going to pay you that much and they haven't made an offer in a year and a half\nRight now you sue them than\nIt used to them where you show them that are and what did I say what I what I just say what did you hear me say [noise]\n[laughter] that's correct that's it uh-huh\nOh okay excellent thanks for listening you're a wonderful human being that was the only time insurance companies say no\nWe're not getting that much [noise] I Want five pounds no I'll give you a thousand [noise] but but what do I do is to them [noise] so it's\nBelieved me insurance companies fight all the time fight on the uninsured motorists

I think they know is selling\nSo how do we how do you know so and then\nOnce I got to pick it up at one point after I got well and they have to do it\nBut they may have been ... yeah it may have been stolen how about you just didn't put the sticker on\n[noise] no I I put a thick on on my car\nOkay so ah so when you got a ticket for not having your sticker on the license plate or they ticketed you for not having your sticker on your license plate even though you put it on you say\nYeah I bought it because they felt like I wasn't aware\nOf what it was so and I don't understand the sticker was stolen from whom by whom\nThey stole it from the license plate\nOh why oh why you weigh one took the sticker off your license plate or I don't even play yeah okay got it and that was confusing\nAs hell think our cleaning that one up for me oh God limit the time will make those time okay and the court just didn't believe it because you didn't put a police report\nRight yeah okay I think it's something that wasn't right and now what what's your question\nAlso also and different to their response was that they took a picture of the Lakers play on a ... ... ... they said that while she would have taken not afraid of credit\nBack alright when you're so what's your question like question as she either pole and forget about yeah I yeah I mean what how much is a ticket I don't get like a little couple of dollars\nAre going to be a lot more than ... here you go to court I Would just pay it but\n... you may have an argument and you go in front of a judge Ito your honor here's what happened\nA B C and D and uh they said we should have filed a police report who helped ... police report over a stolen sticker on a license plate because once I put the sticker on the license plate like every other human being in the world who pays attention anymore\nBecause I think my first check it every day\nYeah exactly I think it and I think pain is a decent decent defence ah sure tell her to a judge 'cause the worse it happens you have to pay for the ticket anyway\nOr\nI mean that's the worst of it so it it's worth half a day in court and then you get to see traffic court and you get to see these other people come up with the most insane defenses you've ever seen\nAnd the and the fun one where ah the people come up and they say guilty with an explanation\nAs if the judge chairs you're they're guilty or not so whenever you see someone guilty with an explanation depending on the judge or if the judge allows a person to explain just to get it off his or her chest the ... the

actually it was a young the rest of the show\nAnd a good I just want to know if I were the\nCase against that basically my cousin which I Do not have a contract with\nA is the one that\nYou know a God of the deal and the contractors between young on a respirator and my cousins company and I developed a software and so we did receive a licensing fees every year\nOkay uh for the software and uh probably four or five years I was receiving my payments and then a\nYear last year somewhere around October it's when we get them and I didn't get my payment and eye contact like us and I said hey you know what's going on in this big long story short basically what I found out where he went to his friend and they were trying to rewrite the software copy Michael basically\nA CBS a new version of this offer and then they cut me out of the deal yeah how much money we're getting a year\nOr a thirty grand with the leasing and my cousin gave me twelve and he'd keep\nUh actually I got eleven like eleven gun eight hundred different so how did it work that he got more money than you how did they did in the\nVolcano but there is no good reason for him to get more money than you you were just in in ...\nBecause of that now now in those four years I charge you know I was the one that what they always contact for the summer I Would go into the\nCrying okay so here's the so the bottom line you get to see who your cousin and your customers defense is going to be hot gee we don't have any signed contracts your argument is going to be yeah but then why do we don't have a signed contract why did you pay me a over four years but what if\nWhat if I don't want to seem like and what if I did I I spoke with the DEA is in the restaurant next plane than situation unfortunately they're caught in the middle but I told him I owned the copyright that software\nOkay so you're right and right now you're you're infringing on those cocktail\nActually not because there was a contract or that they have and it's not CBS did screw you it's your cousin that's growing you and someone has a written contract and you're saying there was a written contract between your cousin and CBS correct yes and yet\nBut in that contractor nowhere there is no car there's nothing that states I'm releasing my copyright\nYou have like ... but the point is that you're allowing him to use it sounded question releasing the copyright it's a question if we we have a deal you can go ahead and use it a verbal deal you go ahead and use it so what do you want to do if you can't sue the cubs and what what would you like\n[noise] I Want what I Want to stop using the software\nI I don't know if you can start you can stop it and now you can make a motion to have CBS and then there's a lawsuit about interference with a contract that they may have\nBut I tell you you go in to see a CBS you've gotta you've gotta world of hurt and what are you gonna do you're ... you're going to send them at the cease and desist saying you can't use the software anymore because uh I'm being ripped off and they're going to say we're not ripping you off you talk to your cousin\nBut I don't want us to my cousin well that's too bad yeah OK\nYeah basically basically it's\nLike why don't you want to sue your cousin who's growing you name it you\nCan get it because it's going to cause more family problems I Believe you know [noise]\nI don't know okay you're you're an idiot across several different levels I was going to cause a family problems if someone's stealing or stealing from me and I want to go after the wrong word
