is ah my parents die with student loan debt and I and my siblings responsible for that\nIf a ... who is the student loan debt on and did you sign for it\nAh my mother and my mother's I actually don't know how much it is\nOkay so she borrowed money to go to school and she signed for it you didn't sign for it you weren't the student\nOkay is that what you're saying is that what you said\n\nOkay if that's the case you are not liable for it\nNow when a ... when she dies if she has that the debt will be paid by the sale of the items that she owns before airs receive anything\nShow when you die what you own is sold to pay off your debts and if there's anything left was asked distributed to the air's\n\nBut you are not let let's say she dies penniless and she has three hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt the student loan debt people getting nothing\nNo one will pay them no one is liable to pay them\nBut if she has a three hundred thousand dollar paid for house it would be sold and we would pay off the student loan debt before you guys got anything in that example if there was a three hundred thousand learned that three hundred thousand dollar house they would you would get nothing they would get paid\nOkay\nShe's also a refinance our parents um I'm trying to get into the chat for houses and I'm On top of the student loan debt\nYou know sort of ... I Hope you're basically saying she's doing stupid on parade\nYeah my father is um kind of given up trying to teach him and he can get kind of keeping their finances are separated from what I

think you know movies there's a longer video version of this episode cause even more facts you may not know available on screen crush dot com mhm mhm mhm Mm\nLoses the Dave Ramsey show\nWhy you're here Joanna is with us in Los Angeles are Joanne welcome to the day room to show how can I help [noise]\nTried everything to taking my call Cher which I find\nSo we're currently on baby steps one on we've been on a plan for a month and I'm David ... to ... so we're in the process of getting a life insurance um it was important too I uh\nI mean but I missed them or that his dad took out and say I have a full term policy on him when he was younger and he wants to eventually take that over and make\nPayments um I don't know what that is um but we have four kids I'm not exactly sure what the best thing to do if I'm not the beneficiary to that it or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took the shot when your husband was a trial\nYeah oh my God this is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd it's close to half a million dollars\nWow that should be canceled okay because her whole\nLife insurance policy ... billion dollars is a very expensive\nRight and yeah and like my main concern is you know we found out the beneficiary and I don't I mean he's a great guy so I'm not worried about you know that it's\nOut on my own to her as a guy doesn't matter at a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there was a he revealed and like going on you know a wild one\nBut it's strange how long have you been married for a long you been married five years five years they've not address this issue but strength the strength you're really I mean they should you should address the issue that\nShould not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just\nDetermine blazed but you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and on your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and say dad [noise] uh I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now\nI Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that that are like I don't mind paying something I Know not only that but you have like I said\nWell it's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yep\n'cause you need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nSaying how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm a question uh regarding up part of my retirement savings said comes as a thing called a ... from my company [laughter] and that overall is a bad guy eight percent of my total as sad or\n... or ...\n... well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be ... percent of my code will have had you know and\nAnd my question is whether the cat has a lump\nSum yes or ... okay\nYes here's why okay if you die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all gonna die [laughter] okay when you die or\nThat money's gone 'cause it's a ... and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefits the money's gone it's gone\nAnd if you live I or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we got an account for you over here two hundred Ninety five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you could think that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal right\nYes I Do [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint in survivor annuity but some are\nStill it still love you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you out of the same concept to block so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die\nMakes this a bad deal and\nSo you always take pension lumps on are almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good roast our mutual fund so it sounds like your net worth ... million\nUh yeah it's a close to too close to ... and that it's probably about four oh well they're total total man where the assets house and so forth\nNo ... well ... congratulations [laughter] how old are you I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit [noise]\nUm probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from ... my um my family and my ...\nUm probably somewhere in a hurry to court hunger dreams from my uh my family and my wife's family where are you a millionaire or that was before that happened\nA a millionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents were eligible young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\n[noise] ah ... patterns or because of the amount you know your heritage is ... maybe ... percent ... percent\nSince I was home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool ... I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now it's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell that twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below your means when they got a modest lifestyle which we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was you people do stupid things I've done a stupid thing which I think if you can limit\nStupid thing to do all along the way that's good I like that\nBecause every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do stupid things begin you can minimize those ... along the way\nAnd we live a modest lifestyle with below your means um yeah Lloyd\nSo do you think there'll be done to not twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nIs probably a probably even higher if they stay minimize do stupid you know maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and the ... all the math on that works to your benefit a at a Wal alive if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand ahead\nA thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me interview you for a minute\nIt's always good for people here how to be a real millionaire\nI Love this millionaire subject is so intriguing\nYou're going to be hearing more ... than a promise\nFrom us and this is the day Ramsey

breach of some a A N D O\nOr ah NDA right [noise]\nThat's absolutely correct It's not I mean it's\nOne of those another one of those terms I don't necessarily correct people what they say it but now it's not really accurate when talking about me because my superiors asked me directly and specifically if I wanted to be the public spokesperson for the command staff United States require special section so yeah I'm actually sanctions or do what I Do\nAnd and why did they choose this time um to sanction you coming forward and\nTelling us about well what I've been highly highly highly classified state secrets why now\nYeah great question and the short answer is it's through a process of many many data points we have determined that it's far more\nDangerous can use secrecy or than secrecy protects and so at the moment we think the dangers of continued secrecy are far greater than the rationales for protecting the information are keeping it out of public sphere\n[noise] how does the [noise] um I I Love\nThis term that um that Richard Owen uses breakaway civilization and these are the people were old ... that have benefited from\nA back engineered alien technology or technology directly directly given to them by extraterrestrials how does the breakaway civilization feel about you coming forward and and he is I I get the sense that there there is this\nMaybe this battle going on backstage uh between various um intelligence groups and military intelligence groups and so forth a about disclosure I mean is that accurate to say that that that not everybody is on the same page on this\nThat's absolutely correct there's definitely a conflict of opinion in interest and the different uh areas so the military I mean which is really not even you again this sort of one\nYou know when you're talking about the military organization to participate but even if you just lump the military organizations that participate and then you lump a banking and corporate business\nInterests together and you lump a state actors are people who politically represent different countries and any other interests that may fall under that umbrella yet everyone's got a slightly different opinion at the moment and we believe\nBy the numbers we have a majority of people who just understand that disclosure is necessary\nTo preserve civilization and life on earth you you can't preserve civilization if you push chaos too far if you push environmental destruction too far to push economic destruction too far\nOr there's just all kinds of things that you can't preserve life in civilization if you go too far and to be\nHonest a lot of the big players on the stage or making large quantities of money and what some people need to understand is those people are finally understanding they don't want to break the machine to fix it because they're making a ton of money off of that machine\nAnd if they even as a breakaway civilization if they broke the civilization down here you know the the surface dwell civilization if you want to call it that uh it would still cost them a tremendous amount of money and so those civilizations aren't separate to the break away civilization and the\nSurface stroller civilization are not entities that can be separated for another hazard like buying them build accord that if you broke it or would damage I\nEither one or both of severely so I think we've made a pretty good case to get those people to understand that it's inevitable that we have to do this to preserve civilization life on earth and even preservation of the breakaway save civilization and the higher ups of the\nTechnological a covert military space program as we understand that needs disclosure to survive everyone needs to survive\nThat's somewhat comforting that day [laughter] and they'd Brinkley civilization they don't need to slaughter the cow just yet when they shouldn't slaughter the cow just yet where we the ... the rest of us ... I guess\nYeah the ... we we we that's often the kinder gentler term people call a people down here the surface dweller\nFirst ah and you know because of the people who are sort of\nContained onto the surface they can't really go anywhere else um and yeah we we think it's simply not a good idea or for everybody or for anybody\nTo do that to just wipe out you know the surface drawing civilization and\nA slew of some other breakaway civilization they need each other they're intertwined with each other we think the case can be made to bring the surface roller civilization up into the higher or parts of the advanced technology civilization and bring it all together before just burned itself to the ground\nSo we should just disregard the Georgia Stones for now I guess [laughter] [noise] well it's\nA it's a guideline that the children just ...\nPounds or guidelines predictions so you know their guidelines for different potential uh futures by people who have an idea of what they think is right or wrong but not necessarily what is absolutely the right or wrong especially when talking about the numbers of people that we should have\nA living on planet earth we don't want to overpopulate the planet that is a great way to destroy what we have here but we also want to get everybody on the on the picture because we have ... personnel shortfalls within the space program and we have\nPersonnel shortfalls within the civilian parts of that program and so we really think that we need everybody involved in this process so that we can uh get\nThe positions in jobs that we need them in that we simply don't have\nEnough resources there just keep drawing from sort of this top cream of the top of smart educated\nAccomplish people you've got to start opening the doors a bit at some point to the rest of the civilization just because we need to feel more chairs than we have bodies for and we just kind of have to start letting people a volunteer and take open recruitment at some point\nBecause we're just we just need more people than what we can continue to do this way the way that we've been doing it which is through these covert programs\nAngelina Jolie in Charlotte they're on were strongly considered for the Park Service Berlin\nDaniel Craig lost two front teeth while filming a fight scene and had to fly his dentist in from London to replace them fund some of solace is the first bond film that has a direct sequel\nThe film used two hundred thousand rounds of life bullets McCarty turn down the offer to write a new James Bond song from the film the recommended singer songwriter Amy Winehouse for ... the number of first for the bond series first bond film to be released an IMAX first bond film to into Academy Awards first bond film to earn a billion dollars\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm Chuck secrets in\nTwo days after eleven people were shot dead during this habit service inside of Pittsburgh synagogue the suspect was in court\nBlank faced and all business the heavy set Bowers entered the judge's questions with a simple Yes sir outside the courtroom us attorney Scott Brady\nOur investigation of these hate crimes continues\nPowers lawmakers next court appearance November first in the meantime judged a flight risk feel remained jailed without bond ...

Scott's going to start off this hour in New York Hi Scott welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave thank you for taking my call butter read all the utilities are what's up well\nRecently got married a couple of years ago and we're looking to I'm trying to figure out whether or not to pay down my house or my wife now\nAh and we also have a some equity that would get to me when I purchased my home I'm actually a kind of paying my father back or just a home from my father um the interest rate that I'm getting a mortgage [noise]\nUh so we're we I'm I've been on the program for about two years ah everything's paid off and we I worked for the government at my wife's a teacher\nAnd uh about ten to Fifteen Percent of our income into our a shirt myself um I actually am a I went to the government version of a financial case university [noise]\nUm so where he talked about the ts eight oh I have my job my wife has a form of three day I'm funny thing is is I'm actually one of the ... coordinator for oh\nFor for that so you're working on it would be so four or five and six you got your return but going you're dead for a you have your emergency phone inflation you have a house that you live in and you have a I guess or rental house as a second house but one of you used to live in is that correct\nCorrect and as the other house rented\nIt's her her brother is living there um he's living there by himself he's paying us a openly after the mortgage and the uh\nAssociation fees and the taxes are paid we're actually losing about a hundred and thirty six dollars a month on the house and why are you are subsidizing her brother\nWhile it's not that we're subsidizing him I'm\nOpenly I Would just rather ... at least this was the mindset was that I Would rather have him there and uh we get some tax benefit from the house so I assume\nThat the hundred and thirty six dollars amongst that we're losing our actually getting back at the end of the year to at least break even or maybe still make some money on on the only\nThing I can stay home ... even I'm All right so you you got this is that her house or your house but it's person says her brother living there\nCorrect okay if you didn't own a house she wouldn't go buy that house and call tax benefits and subsidizing brother a good plan\nMarisa is with us in Lafayette, Louisiana ... how are you\nAre you better than I deserve how can I help\nThat question I had anything I graduated a year early and I stayed here when my parents made because of the scholarship opportunity I Do not know how to cook for myself while they're in the nursing school because nursing school effects eight tie oriented program\nMhm okay a\nShower you know I'm Sorry ... show you how old I think you told me that I'm showing now and you stayed there because of the scholarship it fair to nursing school\nCar it's a it's been a state I graduated here and my parents knew because the job opportunity\nOkay so the scholarship is partial Yes sir how much of a scholarship to to get\nAt twenty thousand every four years that it wasn't a large life\nTwenty over four years and it's a four year program I take it out there and what does it cost\nIt costs a dollar a yearly\nOkay ah which you have five ... factor we need eight Yes sir plus you need to eat yeah there's that detail right where are you living with friends family what\nI'm living with frankly I bought a house out in the country because it's cheaper\nYou and some friends were roommates effect okay and so you have rent\nAnd electricity or shear and you have food and you need to get out and you need eight thousand dollars a year\nIsn't there okay so when\nWe add all of that up what does your rent and other stuff cost you a month\nIt cost me about nine hundred without looking out my dad and I I work minimum wage and I do things like clean up you know how they've and things like that trying to make a little bit of extra money\nMhm okay All right so let's let's kind of had that up then I get about twelve thousand dollars a year for that and I need a thousand dollars a year for ... for tuition and some other you probably shouldn't books some stuff too but we're pretty close their show twenty thousand dollars a year is what you need to earn\nIt fair and minimum wage doesn't do that sounds like you need a new job\nAnd I have an opportunity to start a whole failing family name brand clothing and and now I don't have the money to put up right now\nNo they don't need to get into that you have a job\nYou need a job you need to show you can make more you can make a Fifteen twenty dollars an hour babysitting and managing\nYou can make\nGood money cleaning houses Fifteen dollars an hour ten dollars an hour cleaning houses a walking dogs uh other stuff so I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage\nAnd by the way you make enough to work your way through with the numbers that you and I are discussing here I'm In um you are going to be working all the time though\nAnd if you but if you can get a situation like that the semi self employed where you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever [noise] um and you\nUh\nCan control your time and you can make more money you can control when you work and how much you work now you are going to struggle because you're going to work and study and go to class and that's all you're going to do what you\nThe other thing I Would do is I Would apply for a bunch of scholarships the third thing I Would do is investigate some of the hospital companies that are out there\nParticularly in your immediate area talk to the nursing school and see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school how much of the nursing they would pick up for you\nOkay kind of an indentured servants type program if you've ever heard of those\n... and I married a hospital that actually planning on working at ... ... they will forget all life can't lend it out like that and in fact body\nWell let's see if we can get a job over there now and let them just pay for it now\nOkay rather than have to pay you back for student loans 'cause I'm trying to keep you out of student loans with a math were you in are doing here\nSo I Want you to apply for a hundred more scholarships you'll get turned down for most of them but if you get another five thousand it really helps the situation a lot I Want you to think about doing different things for work that make you a lot more money and you can control the time\nAnd I want you to investigate with this hospital or what they will do and talk to the nursing school about ... anything they can do to help you as well that you're working your way through but\nYou you sound like you are to me just talking to you you're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old that sounds to me like you're a rock star banking and so I don't think you need to play beer pong his real\nHigh [laughter]\nI I think you don't mind working and and grinding and hustling grind to get your way through this and not come out of this with you know forty fifty ten thousand twenty thousand dollars a student loan that you don't need to it\nBut you're going to have to make some very distinct and very careful choices to do this and the good news is you're living expenses are very reasonable and your tuition is very reasonable and the third piece of good news is you've chosen a fabulous career in terms of employment you will be able to get employed instantaneously\nUm I mean nursing is just there's always a shortage\nSo you're going to do very very well but I Would go talk to that go talk to that hospital administrator at that local hospital just set up an appointment with them and just walk in there like you own the place there's a kind of think you can do that\nAnd uh just tell them that they need to pay for your school and then you'll promise to work there how's that work\nAnd how can you help me get through school because I don't want a bunch of student loan debt I'm trying to not be a statistic and you know get get him impressed with you and and let him help you be a hero in your story and a him or her that hospital administrator who by the white needs nurses so\nThey're going to be very intentioned\nA very very inclined towards helping someone in your position especially someone who walks in and ask for help and walks in and says what can I Do to earn some help and so on and um you know get get some people on your side\nHelping you accomplish this um this task that's in front of you but you're on your way\nYou're doing really good congratulations very proud to talk to you call me back if you need help as you're fighting through this\nGreg is with us in Milwaukee Hi Greg how are you\nDave thank you for taking my call how are you today\nBetter than I deserve

I. above four one K. actually has a pension I'm as well and right now we are\nPaying above and beyond our mortgage I'm On our house by about ten to twenty percent and and putting that toward the house with the amount of investments that we have diversified compared to what we're putting into our houses is that the right formula\nWe tell folks but Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement once you're dead free except the house and have your emergency fund and above Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement and your debt free except your emergency fund then I Will put everything above that towards the house until the house is paid off\nSo took your income sounds point one five\nMake sure the total of all the Roth IRAs four one\nK. close to reaching you're doing is essentially that enough right isn't that much greater than that back some of the contributions down a little bit to throw the balance of our service not up to that as you get it up to that because the balance of the house\nLynn we suggest you plus a mutual funds with his categories gross broken income aggressive growth\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide\nFor their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are in your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well as stay at home parents it's pretty expensive\nAnd ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house of them will pay cash for 'cause my income is going to go up and goes back and uh yeah I'm ... I'm not gonna camp anymore fifty five it was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game\nBut that but you you you know you got past that stage now your back is that okay yeah cool thanks for dropping by saying\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia hey Claire how are you\nI'm good how are you know good how can I help\n[noise] um I have a question for you so we've\nBeen calling your data for a little less than a year now and I feel like we are on I had on retirement but we're behind on college savings for two kids\nShow how old are your kids and they are twelve and ten okay and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement I'm a little over a million though your head congratulations ... so what's your household income\nIf not only show that way but yeah we\nWe are I mean when you have more than a million dollars you're a millionaire yeah okay yeah you're right [laughter] [laughter] yeah so ... what is your household income\nA little over two hundred okay\nSo why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get plenty of money for college when you've got eight years before college\nWell we're paying for private school right now as well\nWhat are you paying for private school how much cash how much twenty thousand a year per kid or total total okay you make two fifty but we're looking at you like it you don't have like two hundred I mean one eighty okay\nAnd if you can cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's ... that cash flow can be turned towards cash flow in college too if they choose a college it's reasonably expensive\nYeah OK okay that's a good point I yes nine\nSo I I you know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement you don't need it\nYou're in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the world\nBut I don't think your house to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for kids to school today we're going to offset some of that was cash flow in some college but some college we want to invest and set aside\nAnd put Fifteen Percent ahead side so we're talking about thirty thousand dollars that's fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in return I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say something to college you say ten grand a year\nPer kid another twenty grand you can do that a front for from now until they go to school don't have plenty of money\nPer kid another twenty grand you can do that\nA front for from now until I go to school they'll have plenty of money\nI mean you just Jack up to five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control inside that five twenty nine get or the one that's more of us are pros and they'll help you do that click ... de Ramsey dot com for a list of them in your area the people we recommend them sit down when you help people that five twenty nine together\nAnd pop ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut return it back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you're not working our plan at this stage\nBecause you put Fifteen Percent into retirement until college and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and you're a baby steps seven to increase return rugby on Fifteen Percent\nAnd Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand thirty ground so that that's what I'm doing the math here I think you can do it\nI think you just got to sit down and not have this vague worry about it\nAnd instead of having an actual game plan will lay out and go this is important there's more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing so that we can do this and that's ten grand a year per kid for college to kids that's twenty grand if that's where I mean you've got is where you are so\nGood questions thanks for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Donald's on Twitter at Dave Ramsey\nAt Dave Ramsey I guess what you're saying that we're just buying a home and fall when the baby steps after baby step three your debt free you have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses and you have your down payment above that\nDo not move into homes broken ...

are are just not on the same age anymore um and uh\nHis shit or something I just I don't want to go on let\n... have you been seeing a marriage counselor\nOr that they now we're going to\nHave you gone yeah OK please do that for you even if he won't go okay I think\nIt will give you good I'm emotional information twenty two years is a long time and you need to\nHave somebody walk with you who's not in the fog if you go through this and or give you some and maybe maybe give you some information to give him a little bit of a wake up call as well but back to your original question\nI have a friend of mine that teaches divorce recovery recovery after a divorce and um I remember many years ago hearing her say divorced turns a marriage into a business transaction [noise]\nAnd so it it comes as a real quickly the emotions are carved dolphins set over to one side and the actual technical legal financial details are on the other side and it becomes a very transactional kind of thing at that point does that make sense\nHe had ...\nAnd so er here here's a couple of things to look at your student loans or your student loans that are going to go with you unless you know you may or may not get alimony child support or something else but your student loans are going to go with you [noise] um and you're gonna have to pay them so what is your personal income [noise]\nAh it without okay\nAll right and so what you start doing is if this is a a direction that you you know after seeing a counselor and doing everything he can to save a twenty two year investment uh in with all the help you can get a you start preparing for living on your own for fifty thousand bucks a year\nAnd you'd you'd look at your student loans how much to learn that if you got\nA letter Kim I'm Sorry it down and oh my lord okay [noise]\nWell how would let them know that this was going on hardship for all until you get past ah what else whatever else is going on here okay now do you own\nA home yeah what's it worth a two hundred thousand or so down it a high tech savvy Abby\nOkay so no equity either to amount to anything or is your car paid for\nYet as his car paid for now okay is your name on that loan yeah good okay\nAre there any credit cards that have both of your names on them\nAnd they're the one that I care to let him ... I'm Sorry\nAre you refused to let him yet it all better than that glass enclosed that account today\nJust completely closed the credit card\nIf he has the number he can use it if he's one of the users on the car [noise] period and if things go sideways emotionally inside your house I have run into situations in Thirty years of doing this where somebody takes in Mexico drip and puts it on the guard\nAnd you don't want to pay for five thousand dollar cruise for somebody else you know and it'll end up on this card so close the account to that just completely shut it down to zero balance yes good close it okay ... does your checking account have both names on it\nYeah\nOkay sure your money separated by march is there any other debt or dead instrument that's open that as both of your names on it\n[noise] yeah yeah okay\nI don't accept her mortgage probably as both\nOpen that as both of your names on it [noise]\nYeah yeah okay I wouldn't accept her mortgage probably as both are names on it okay so here's what happens you can't afford to keep the south you can't stay there\nYeah um so the house that needs to either be refinanced to get your name off of the mortgage or sold\nYou cannot stay on the mortgage and give him the house that would be dumb [noise]\nAnd people often do that in a divorce they often do that but just\nYou know the negotiation is the cars and his name he keeps his car your cars and your name you keep your car you're checking accounts are already separated there's no other debt you get your student loan debt [noise] um it does he have any big savings or investments or to you and for one case [noise]\nI'm not big now how much am I have I have a ten thousand mhm or one K. and I'm not sure what he had um but I'm thinking about five or six thousand not much at all okay as far as well as his income it's around Ninety thousand\nOkay in most states your attorney would have to advise you but in most states you would be do some alimony after twenty two years\nAnd that will going with your fifty thousand is how you will reset your life and stay out of debt and start working your way through these student loans that are outrageous and are going to take some time to work through\n'em but you're going to be working extra job you're going to be doing everything else taking any any money you can squeeze out of your budget and you are not going to Mexico you got a mess on your hands\n[laughter] okay no I'm not\nSo um unless it's to escape no just kidding [laughter] ah but the ... so you know you're going to be on beans and rice rice and beans are going to get the cheapest department you can get you going to stay debt free and address these student loans as soon as you can get stabilize ...\nAfter the separation which will lead to a divorce unless it leads to you all getting back together\nOkay but you pro care for separation the same way financially you would prepare for a divorce and that puts you in a position of strength\nTo negotiate in the divorce financially I'm ... and that's something that you'll have to do and your attorney and you get representation and you'll be ready to pay them pile up money for deposits and for paying them don't pay extra on the student loans until you get the other side of this and I just put them on ... and pay nothing right now\nBut let's get the other side of the house but my hope is is that you guys you can see a counselor who can give you some words to say some tools to get by by wakeup call maybe the two of you sit down with a coach or counselor and walk you through turning the corner on all of this before you get so far around the corner we can't get you back\nAnd may be you can save this thing I that would be best for everybody involved\nI'm assuming the issues that you have that are causing you such concern or a draft\nAnd I'm sure that I'm sounded like a pretty long list but um ... see a counselor for your sake call your pastor say who can I sit down with that can walk me through\n'em in the right questions to ask myself the right questions to ask him um 'cause he may think you're kidding oh he may think you're bluffing\nAnd when you actually move out it may it may wake him up and he may be willing to work on that list at that point I don't know\nBut those kinds of things are best guided by a really good marriage counselor that's really experienced in wise and a godly council a will help you in that situation I sure hope you guys can turn that around that would be my\nWhy isn't a godly council a will help you in that situation and I sure hope you guys can turn that around that would be my hope for you\nIt'd be better for all of you are financially as well as everything else so good question thank you for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight

than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um so I recently discovered you I got frequently is about three years ago um started doing if you think we are we ended up going out to get out of debt I'm from New York teaching\nA my father died about five years ago on a motorcycle act and and um there were a bunch of life insurance policies that went through our personal financial adviser has been advising my mother ever since then um and the question that I have is he put her in and in New Jersey about um\nFive years ago whenever my dad died a three hundred thousand dollars in the annuity um and then the other end up on the ... and they've been growing a little bit here and there are but the question is the annuity rift recently we've had a five year mark and a heater advising her to pull the money out and started that fan\nWhich I think is a good idea however the question is is that\nShe should have should she had that money impacted initially at the beginning of the uh time you know and put up putting putting in ... she brings home about thirty five hundred dollars a month and retirement and Social Security but she doesn't need the the drawing the humidity at all you know and he knew that at the beginning of the time\nYou know well yeah you're right I that makes me question other things that are going on that I don't know what they are from you I'm ... I Am I and I am I personally would have put all of it and the good investments at the time um you know it is the home paid off\nAlmost paid off one hundred percent car the paid off she has the road that you wrote\nGood good okay and how much is in investments total there's three hundred plus I'm\nYeah we're looking at probably about four hundred and twenty four hundred and fifty thousand a total with all the investments if you're at the house another fifty to six feet under the under their\nHow old is she\nUh she has six she just turned sixty okay ... cool too and she didn't great out because you're not like an an old\nShe thinks she just turned sixty okay All right cool when she didn't write out because you know like an old on her way out\nRight now [laughter] good I'm feeling better fifty seven they're usually that\nSo um [laughter] uh I'm not on my way out today either a anyway or at least ... knowledge anyway so yeah I I'm probably going to question all of that I mean it's um it's not it's not like you\nPut her in Hawaii policy which will be like a deal breaker or something silly like that I mean that just the annuity is is you know got a lot more fees to it a lot more commission to it and if it was a variable annuity and the money was in good mutual funds are probably performed okay\nUh they're okay um but it's not my favorite thing to do but it's not to the point that I like question his entire competency I just really want to know if it wasn't right for her then if it's not right for her now why wasn't right for her then that's a good question in your mind Mr advisor\nAnd um I think you've got the right to ask that question and talk it through with them and if you can't get a comfort level or if he blows up on you and starts having an attitude and that's when you know it's time to move any to anyway\nSo you do that with any financial people are people that are advising you on technical matters when they start\nGetting like ... like you have to owe them an explanation instead of vice versa it's time to move on insurance lady gets an attitude is Tom move on the rise in your state plant or\nIs too smart to sit down and explain something to you then it's time to move on and so you know you just you gotta get folk in your corner that have the heart of a teacher so if he if he can walk you through what his thinking was easy to get comfortable
