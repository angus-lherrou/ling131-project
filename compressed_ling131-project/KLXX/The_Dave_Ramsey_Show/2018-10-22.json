Open phones AAA eight to five five two to five AAA eight to five five two to five\nIs starting this hour\nTwo five that's AAA eight to five five to two size\nBrian is starting this hour off from Indianapolis, Indiana Hey Ryan welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's that I have a daughter she's ten years old in the fifth grade and she doesn't know Kagan school but she was focused attention but surely where she really I got a ... year olds aren't really good with people\nSo I'm not start a business for her and her mother right selling a channel that she may\nBut I also want to do it but it per se that\nYour your phone is breaking up can you speak directly into it you're cutting in and I can hear me better now Yes sir\nOkay so my ... year old she's great\nI got ... we heard we heard I got up to that point I started breaking up to I went I didn't make any ... she's making can that she's making county exactly okay\nI Want a percentage of the truck coach I'll show you a lot of parts of charity fell by quite shy as a not for profit company or shy about the regular El Al ...\nNone of the above I showed up as a sole proprietorship you're over complicating a candle business with a ten year old\nOkay to shut up as a sole proprietorship you're probably not even gonna make any money if you make a little bit it'll be fine pay some taxes on it and if you want to fund a Roth IRA for her or something the point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business to the point is not the business\nThe point is and what the kid is learning\nThey're learning work they're learning interface with customers and how to treat people ah they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality\nThey're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit the capitalism is not evil ... these are the lessons are what is important\nI understand the accurate or if she make some money that's just a bonus\nRight but what ... what are you what you've identified as you've identified the way this kid is wired\nAnd a lot of us that are entrepreneurial are a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much you'll pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know since I'm sure\nYou know but I ... if you start maybe if it starts in like a hundred thousand dollars a year or something you may want to do it and obviously but if you if you're making under a hundred grand where the profit\n\nWhen they're getting ready to have a kid go off to college and we saw\nAnd understand\nWhat college costs because\nIt is one of the most bizarre things to learn the\nThe distance between the less expensive schools and the most expensive schools I mean we're talking eight thousand eighty thousand a year\nSpread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of college is the same costs it's just not and it's the number one mistake people make when they don't have a lot of money in a kid is going off to school it draws people in the student loan debt 'cause they simply go to school we can afford\nAnd as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars in student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education\nThat puts a curriculum and the high schools and in the colleges across America we are now and forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stuff of staying out of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nAnd what happens from time to time is the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come a long shot in the community of business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've got about four million students go through one of the coolest things that's happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby that's how that happens the college university says we're going to take care of these ...\nSo she had vice provost of enrollment Kyle why to go man thank you for doing that is\nWell it's a it's a pleasure to visit with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming can be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical applicable\nBeings for students to be able to apply that college search and uh and and be a real fatty consumer of higher education\nYeah cause you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lowest resident tuition at any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the ... so like you were cheaper than my University of Tennessee you're you're cheaper than the University of dot dot dot\nThat's correct wow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was\nBehind this I immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nThat so that our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys we're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we are talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we are talking about that in her spare we're talking about a curiosity independence of boldness\nAnd the pursuit that adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and books for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people will exemplify the spirit of the underdog\nYou know it's not a cowboy isn't\nWhat you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys\nI mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're mascot right\nNational decorate your football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right as as as good I play on words but you you guys got though that you got to the table first will this way to go man I Love it it's a great motto\nOr does it says so much in unjust are so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and\nYou gotta sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have\n... as a coming up soon the the high school curriculum because\nThe cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool guile thank you man\nWe're happy to have a happy to be a partner we uh we are we are state that is very practical were state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunities to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the rains the education product\nIt's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're you know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in their ... we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that I'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboy\nGoing in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that I'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college\nTo sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line\nI've talked to a lot of Provo is around the country a mile and chancellor and vice chancellor of the ... Tennessee and it's a constant thing the ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state that you have to be\nSmart you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition Doctorow renting institution\nWe are near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south we can be a solution that provide students and incredible opportunity for education\nAnd we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping\nA student be successful not just students success and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nI meant so how many students on your campus\nWe have we had a little over or twelve thousand twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that are called himself cowboys you\nKnow that's a good size school that's not too big and not too small and so that's that's just right those are ... deal to us right very cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again brother thank you for coming on with us\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and ah we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nAnd I love it I Love the motto and I think the world does need more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but\nA bottom line is lesser mascot and so now it's ah that's very cool stuff I Love it\nAnd what a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high school now if you're a business or university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the states\nSome states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know but uh um you know maybe you just want to do it to be to the hospital used to go to\nUm I went over spoke to at them in the building where I used to go to high school the other day it's now a middle school so I Know the forty\nReally bright and shiny little eighth graders looking at me\nThat's the hardest speaking you'll ever have all this time um but no as Anthony O'Neill's got tough job you all but a pretty cool it's pretty cool to go back over there and you know if it wasn't by the way that the school has our curriculum furnish it to them on the sponsor on that one [noise] but see that's how you doing just that easy one\nAh the world needs more cowboys I like it

that I had to get your vote you didn't answer me and asked me how I was I I I ended up getting surgery because of it\nOh wow so you're rollerblading is along the boardwalk is like a guard were all ...\nAll over the concrete however what was known their share of Vietnam War was a police swat in it and this is around on the G twenty was happening so they were I guess testing their weapon don't know\nI mean this is a conspiracy show so I have no proof however um that good skater it felt like I was hit with a with a six by a six piece of wood and I was\nAnd I was not flat rate and ended up wow surgery on my neck because of it and I still have nerve damage to this day\nSo did you hear anything before you before you went down\nNothing nothing it was just so quick and then what I you know I was paid for calling for someone I looked up and they were on there was no one around and the police you know the bill of God that was going\nTo chew blackout for second or two I did yes and it was only when it comes to your lasting pardon me right didn't want to come to your assistance\nThough no late there for about Fifteen minutes got up and walked my bike back home and then went to the dog

about the G tore and the weapons that they had they had apparently on hand [noise] you know there was the sound weapon but I knew I could just tell that they had other things also\nRight that sound can and because of the directors that were involved with the G twenty and I don't mean that people on the street I mean you know the powers that be sort of so to speak\nNow with was there anyone else around me because that type of no one weapon these are just sort of non lethal weapons supposedly although I'm sure you don't look that way I mean I went in there they're somewhat indiscriminate one would think at this point so if there were other people around you would think they would have been knocked over as well but there was no one around at the time\nThere was no one or it was early in the morning very early in the morning [noise] um and I also wanted to ask you how do you become traps all of the nation that you get into your head\nI mean that's the irony the Irish myself but I just you know I listen to your show at the end of the night I have to be pressed I Can't imagine how you do it through the years [noise]\nWell I think I've made this point a number of times I don't consider even though it's called the conspiracy show [noise]\nAh I don't consider myself to be a conspiracy theorist I I I certainly think ... are a number of conspiracies have a great deal of validity ... others not so much\nBut the key for me has always been to compartmentalize don't live at I I talk about for a living but I don't live at I mean I'm interested in it but it doesn't consume\nMy waking hours I have you know a lot of other things that sort of keep me busy throughout the day throughout the week so that's the key I I have a I had a colleague I'm In this town who who not only talked about it but he lived at\n'em and he you know you walk the walk and he talked to talk\nAnd and if if he would we worked at the same radio station if he were to someone said corner me that sounds unkind but if we were to meet at the coffee or in any and he would start to talk\nThere was no getting away from him ... you basically kicked off twenty minutes of your work day because he

Mellon have\nStories thing I could probably fill in a book but um you know you just kind of think it's normal I've had stuff happened since I was in my twenties\nSo [noise] you know this particular story and in Hyde Park area when I used to live there I guess my son who was forehead seeing things and you know kind of shy kid and he kind of various head and like you know we'd be watching TV and kind of various hadn't I'd say what what's going on and kept looking in the dining room\nAnd I'd say ah you know what's going on you know and he says well I see ... which is interesting and I think we'll tell them to go away you know and that's fine well the next day of course daylight ten\nYears after I think my husband and I have stories from before that but this particular one expected for you to talk about people in the dining room and he'd say states statesmen from there they spend and they're in the dining room\nSo I hate to tell them to go away I couldn't see them and so he said no he was afraid hide behind me\nSo I say go waste basement and then he tied behind me and he said mom mom they're not listening to you when I got a knife and he's he's hitting the other one\nAnd I just thought well he's just maybe over and imagine eating some imagining something or the kids I'd let them see Star Trek show or something I don't know\nI questioned them and they said no no he doesn't see any scary shows when we're alone with them or whatever but [noise] other things that happened in the house and I'd had experiences myself and I didn't really much want to even stay in that house anymore so I'm telling you there was\nOne particular story and I think it was after that point and I wanted to move out of the house and my husband had passed away from cancer not too long before a few months before\nAnd I was so tired after you know taking care of him and and he had issues where he was seeing things before he died and he was very ... not on any drugs or anything like that but he was seeing people in his room and he would describe who they were and what they were doing and\nAnd that was it was\nFreaky and it was freaky for him because he would be afraid and I'd say well you know we're gonna have to start putting something on the wall thing and the name of Jesus you know or whatever and I'm not particularly a religious person but very spiritual\nAnyways um [noise] he did pass and uh I had been thinking about moving up to the cream on area [noise]\nAnd I guess I'm resting or it's the evening I'd gone to bed and I'm resting there and [noise] you know you're thinking about what you're going to do the next day and laying there very comfortably\nAnd all of a sudden something jobs and I mean shoves one leg into the other I mean my niece bang\nAnd I thought okay I'm going to be one of those nights because I'd had issues before we get a little push or something right oh I laid on my side and I thought I'm just going to ignore that and uh that I get a shot ran the shoulder pushing me and I think that\nIt's not your imagination I mean you know when you're getting pushed and when the leg goes bank to the other like do you think well that I just jerk or something like that right around almost going to sleep but I was it so I'm laying there on my side thinking I'm going to ignore this [noise]\nAnd I'm laying there on my pillow when I realized the pillow next to me and which I'm not touching\nGoing right up on it and we're all here my nose\nAnd I just sat up got the lights on and I didn't sleep all night and I never slept in that room until we moved after that so that's one story but I had a million I mean I've had things\nFly off the shelves for no reason and whatever and I moved up north to a really lovely old home and I thought well I'll have a kind of blessed are cleared or whatever I didn't want any issues with\nCertain energies and uh\nAnd what you said yours we'd grass or um what'd you know I just\nHad to lay down little old lady that he used to do clearing an energy work and she was an ordained minister and whatever and to help [noise]\nWell I was moving into this new house so I didn't really have an issue with a new house but I wanted to make sure it wasn't going to be like the old house so right and as I say I can tell you stories about things\nAppearing out of nowhere also um but that's another story [noise] um so this particular has the beautiful old house hundred and forty years old\nAnd my grandmother had passed this is just one particular story in this house I never felt anything on toward in this home I Love this home\nAnd one particular item doing research because I'm I'm I work in real estate anyways uh doing some research to see what my grandmother's house might be worth my piled up only MLS listings on the

ago\nBut we have a twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance that we um [noise] my husband had to hope that we could use for the kids' college I have one daughter that's in her freshman year of college now and another one that will be starting next fall and then two other teenagers and a baby so I'm\nSo this business of making money\nIt's struggling that it makes many now but we still have um a good bit of debt from how much\nOf a profit\nUm profit uh\nGosh probably ah well I have to say probably it doesn't make enough to support us over the past few years but um\nHow long are you going to live in this mythology\n[laughter] um I don't know we every time he has said okay I Need to go find a job some there it's like that door closes and the business door stays open and um\nBusiness doors not open it's not making enough to support your family\nAnd so we need to sit down on this business and give it a deadline than in the next six months it's going to start supporting our family after all these years and making it up to start getting rid of some of his death or we're going to close it and get a job because I don't think you're making any money\nUm am I wrong [noise] well\nI mean we pay ourselves from the business and I was bringing home I'm about a hundred thousand a year\nBringing oh you're you're taking a hundred thousand dollars out of business yep well that'd be called profit okay you can't live on a hundred thousand dollars\nWell we can we have a lot of how much does have you gone\nWith the business as a guy fit about fifty two K. and we personally have about um Ninety six K\nWere you in the business doesn't have any debt you son personally for it OK so at all as she got a million dollars in debt and you have a hundred and you have a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt and you make a hundred thousand dollars a year is that oh you makes a hundred thousand or the that's what you're pulling out and then you make a profit to\nNo that's all we make that's what I mean\nWe are happening all income when you do your taxes is a right to pay\nIt has been but we're meet with an accountant to adjust some things there so that we're taking the distribution instead all profit and\nOr does that change it right but that's how much we're ... we're paying ourselves from the business for a year\nShe don't know but\nYou get back you give me three different answers so you need to find out if you make if your business is making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you guys can't live on five dollars a year you got other problems\n[laughter] right yeah\nAnd you can pay off that making a hundred thousand dollars a year and work your way through it and know the twenty nine thousand dollars does not need to go the kids' college fund it needs to go to clean up his dad gummed ... what made okay but I don't ... the only way that makes sense is\nIf you have a system in a plan where you actually know if the business is making a profit and if it is making a profit what the property is and it's all coming home to pay off these debts or if you want to pay off the fifty two thousand at the business and call that business that I don't care but we need to be reducing debt\nRight quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year younger people do that but you guys aren't living on a plan that business is not on a plan on your personal lives on a plant I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I ... and we just got ... in the mail today that it can do that that's a good start ... and\nI'm going to send you a copy of the book entree leadership on the business side so uh because here's the thing you need to be going on I quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business\nYou know I'm not going to quit that but what we are saying then is is that we can get fined tune in give I think you're good at making money I don't think you're as good at managing it\nAnd so we need to fine tune our systems at the business the profit and loss statements that the budget set the business and so we know exactly where every dollar at the business is going and exactly where it's coming from\nAnd then exactly what's coming home and one is taxable income and then lay out a game plan to pay off a hundred and forty two thousand dollars worth of between these two different sets of death and work your way through it you can do both and use the twenty nine thousand towards that go\nIf you don't do that and you throw the twenty nine thousand that the goal and then you never pay off the debt it was kind of wasted wasn't it so I'm not asking you to blindly throw it at the ... they're still at that and I thought the ... and throwing a system at your business in the system in detail budget\nAt your home and all of that applied directly on this problem so the problem goes away and the twenty nine thousand is part of the solution to that but\nThe biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the money at home and at work pulled on I'm going to give me a copy of the book entree leadership and this is that I ... [noise]\n\n\n\n\nOkay things are getting ... out there I thought the Equifax breach was bad enough it exposes the personal financial info of half\nOf all Americans now we have breaches affecting almost every US citizen and the data stolen is more personal and equally dangerous one company had over two hundred and thirty million consumer files act\nI'm a put a thermometer up there and let me hold her in\nThe whole thing and get me to the top a man to go more goals driven in that way that we build it out for a vote on the refrigerator right when we went on the refrigerator so that everybody can see that we're in debt is kind of like you know when you're an alcoholic you go to Alcoholics Anonymous now this was it it was like hey we're the ... were in debt\nI Am not I was our way of being honest and I end up front in and letting people see kind of be a part of our journey if they enter a home\nSo that people look at you look curiously or like you were crazy or did you get more cheerleaders\nNo it was a little bit of both I mean our family is very supportive but for me the crazy part was that it was weird I I kind of took it took my blinders often realize that a lot of people are OK with with being in debt and banking on that and I'm like\nWhy you know like when we got to the store and get it in the beginning but people kept saying oh no just just go by that you know you know you can paid off soon\nNo you know where that's not how I Wonder also front page and you know obviously with with our little guy here and in our next one coming up her little girl oh it

two hundred and fifty thousand okay what's your household income [noise] sorry what's your household income a hundred and eighty what do you make a hundred and fifty okay\nAnd your two hundred and fifty in life insurance and how much in your nest egg do you have in wealth um and investments\nA more debt free of the home and land mhm and that's worth about one point eight mhm and then I have about four hundred thousand and the poor ones that are oh\nOkay good and housing dollars let's just use it that's the two fifty and the four hundred you got those two numbers mhm if those two were invested in just rent round numbers just to make this easier but it was ten percent that'd be sixty five thousand dollars a year she doesn't get to keep the land in the house in that scenario\nDoes she know\nCamp for service I half a million dollar debt was sixty five thousand our income and raise kids right okay so you're under insured if your goal was for her to stay in that property upon your debt\nNow if she liquidated input seven hundred thousand the equity of that buys a two hundred thousand dollar house has five hundred in her hand plus has two fifty plus has four hundred now she's got over a million dollar she's got paid for two hundred thousand dollar house\nAnd she can live on a hundred thousand dollars a year then are coming off of a million one that makes sense so if that your plan you're okay but if you want her to stay on that property and continue to live there\nYou don't have enough insurance do you see how I'm doing that\nYes there are there okay so what's the goal which one\nUh would you want her to stay on the land I Want her to stay on the way over she wants to stay on the land but I Would rather she would move closer to family\nThen if if you if you want the ability to do that we need um [noise]\nYou know you need about a million five in insurance should use five hundred to pay off the property she'd have a million dollars from change that way to live off

you're\nHeading into the break I was talking with Sharon in Sarasota, Florida\nAnd I'm sixty eight years or Twenty years ago they bought a universal life policy which is a type of cash value policy a portion of your premium folks when you're having universal policy goes to pay the insurance costs\nAnd the insurance is cost goes up every single year because it's based on annual renewable term rates and so more and more is going to insurance cost us the policy gets older less and less is going to the investment\nTo the point that they they cross the line a few years ago and contacted sharing and her husband and said oh now the premium that you're paying one hundred percent of it won't cover the insurance costs so now if you want to keep the insurance not only is zero going to investments\nBut now even more has to be paid to keep the insurance active and that's how far we got in the discussion is what I just said all correct Sharon yeah\nOkay and what is going to face amount of this policy eighty thousand eighty thousand dollars and how much money do you all asked\nHow much money do we have from\nYou how much you and your ... your ...\nWhen we did have retirement account they pay total eighty four thousand ...\nUm\nWe have a ten thousand dollar emergency find we our debt free or how to pay for good health kind of like\nSo you don't have to how much is cash value is in the ...\nRight now okay so and\nYou have a pension plans as well\nYeah\nOkay and so you're living on the Social Security and eighty thousand dollars worth of for my\nHusband still work he um had thirty six thousand and income mhm and he brings in Twenty one thousand in Social Security okay and that at all I I don't what\nGot you in the face amount of this policy yourself is eighty thousand dollar\nCar we did look into turning\nThe white and they sent me on it for me to\nAl ... and they're going to make you stop anyway they're going to pull the plug on yeah oh yeah okay and at that point you catch it out and whatever cash value isn't there a\nBan and [laughter] I have met would like to get it out now\nYou know one way to get it out no way to get out now as close a policy down right which are good at which means that you would you know if he passes away you'd have the four oh one K. money paid for house and be living on Social Security right yeah but you probably can make it 'cause I gotta feeling you guys are frugal people\nOh yeah and so you probably could make it on that but it's not going to be a dream come true\nUm [noise]\nSo they have given you notice that at I'm sixty two are I'm sure I Seventy three or whatever Seventy years old they are going to shut the policy down regardless\nYeah well I Know I guess if we can see paying enough that it would be over two hundred a month\nI think we could keep it going okay or or we we could lower than that benefit and and keep it going they felt that we could do that which is what I wanted to go he went on to catch it out I'm doing nothing\nYeah there there's not a great answer OK I asked him and hauling a little bit I'm trying to think through it [noise] um\nUh my tendency is at eight hundred bucks a year right now to keep it for a while mhm okay I'm Seventy seven dollars a month even if you use the cash value you can have the cash value is beginning to pay the premium\n... and ... you know it's going to do is going to use up some of that a thousand dollars I'm probably going to do that\nAnd let the eight thousand dollars pay the premiums starting today and I'm probably going to leave it in place a couple of years when it starts being two hundred a month instead of Seventy seven a month at that point I'm probably going to join his tribe and say let's catch it out mhm and close it down\nBut I don't think it's going to make sense to keep this long for a long long time for probably don't keep a couple more years houses health\nBut then how is his health how race I'm the first time I went to the state cancer free for five years and that scientists and cancer free for two years good though I mean it goes in and get a pet and every every six months or so to make sure it's not coming back or they say aggressive\nGood good I'm Glad to hear that ... ... ... ... I'm gonna I'm gonna let the a cash value pay the premiums for the next two years and keep it open uh-huh okay if a ... and I'm going to check on his health at that time\nIt let's say that he's got another episode with cancer going at that time then you pay the premium no matter what it costs okay\nAnd you keep it open if he if he's being if the cancers come back at any stage right keep you keep the thing open at that point but if he's doing really really good and everything's clean and two years from now you haven't seen a spot nothing's no problems anywhere\nI'm I'm probably drop and at that point\nOkay so that makes sense to\nMe it wouldn't it wouldn't be insured so\nYou know but I'm not you but but you're also not paying you know three thousand two thousand dollars a year which is what is going to be at that point yeah which is starting to be ridiculous with that kinda money you could throw money into investments and start having some money\nAnd um but but at this stage I I'm I'm hesitant to cancel it it's\nIt's obviously a bad policy so I'll be in a bad thing but it's your only option you're stuck with that now that makes it hard to discuss it hard to think about but I'm going to hold it two years like the cash value pay yet at the end of that time if he's healthy uh and still cancer free I'm dropping it\nA health issue at that time so good question thank you for calling in and I'm Sorry you had this problem\nFolks you hear me yell and scream about cash value life insurance whole life life insurance universal lot verbal life is rip off\nYou just experienced it you just experienced the back and what happens\nIf you buy one of those pieces of crap policy\nAnd you're sixty eight years old this is what happens because the money they put into that stupid but policy will be three hundred grand right now in mutual funds if they put it into that and a good investment instead of getting ripped off by this insurance company\nAnd if she was sitting there with three hundred grand plus the other four one K. they'd have about four hundred thousand bucks plus their house is paid for she wouldn't even call me\n[noise] but instead guess who's fat sassy instead of her the insurance company [noise]\nSo when your whole life agent says I don't really agree with Dave Ramsey because your whole life I just tried to rip\nYou off that's why your whole life agency in that and there's only two kinds of whole life agents ignorant and crooked\nBecause if you understand these numbers and that story right there and then you still sell this stuff\nThat makes you crooked you ought to be ashamed of yourself and if you don't understand these numbers and you're still selling that stuff that makes you ignorant and you shouldn't be selling this stuff and by the way folks in case you didn't know you'll get screwed ... way more often by an enthusiast enthusiastic ignoramus than you will by a con artist\nSo most people out there selling this crap are enthusiastic ignoramus as they're not actual con artist smoke all Charlie sold me there's always an enthusiastic ignoramus\nThat's all uncle Charlie we just nail him right there\n'cause he's probably not a crook if he'd actually sat down and looked and realize that sharing your if your friend if shares brand sold her that\nHe's not afraid of my friends like that you don't need enemies [noise]\nYou know good at three hundred grand and mutual funds easy for them what they dumped into this\nBrought a\nWhole life life insurance the payday lender or the middle class\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nHey folks

oh we got to poke fun a little ... and basically now my friends or anything like that if they don't they don't say anything now\nI guess not yeah you're sitting there with a paid for house or shut up yeah that's pretty cool interesting very neat\nWell well done guys very well done what do you tell me the key to getting out of that is\nBeing spent went there and stay on track\nYeah even when you do any screw up I mean I don't want to be the most is all my idea but when I Want something there I like stuff so I always like the most expensive thing\nAnd then you don't want to put the biggest fuss
