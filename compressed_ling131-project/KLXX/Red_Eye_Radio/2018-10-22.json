million dollars\nIt was the highest grossing film of Nineteen Ninety three and one of the highest grossing films of all time groceries over three hundred and fifty million dollars in the U.S and more than nine hundred million dollars worldwide as a child director Steven Spielberg visited the Franklin Institute and the Academy of natural sciences in Philadelphia which solidified his passion for dinosaurs\nSilver wasn't the only one after the rights to dress your partner James Cameron Tim Burton Richard Donner and Joe Dante all did for the rights [noise]\nWith backing from universal studios Steven Spielberg acquired the rights to my Craig's book before the novel was published from one point five million dollars universal also paid Michael Crichton five hundred thousand dollars to write the screenplay\nAfter twenty five months of pre production still need to get on August twenty fourth Nineteen Ninety two however three weeks into shooting a massive hurricane passed directly over the island crew made the most of the shot several of the storm scenes for the film and the hurricane drastic park is one hundred and twenty seven minutes long but dinosaurs are only in the film for Fifteen minutes\nSteven Spielberg was originally going to use the type of stop motion animation for the dinosaurs and we'll be supervised by so typical Spielberg was unhappy with establishing realism but Dennis Mirren in Ireland convinced Gilbert that they could create photo realistic dinosaurs using CGI still sit that saw the footage and said the Spielberg I think I'm an extinct\nSpielberg love that line and threw it in the movie where out of a job search Munich stink\nSilks if it was far from extinct he created an antibiotic for the T rex and raptor scenes and silver credited him in the

by radio eight six six Ninety a red eye he is Eric Harley and ah I'm Gary McNamara so\nThe the weather was the the big thing really uh here we got into rancho rain every thing as as you know around where I live and\nIf you've ever flown into Texas in ... in Dallas or into Texas and you see all the lakes are all manmade and the number one reason is for flood control number two reasons for water and the number three reason\nFor recreation but my leg that was up sixteen feet three years ago in the horrible floods which really closed down the lake for year is almost twelve feet over yeah right now I mean it's it's closed\nBy like that that I live on his clothes completely again so we had just master brains I'm somebody told me we have been like twenty six inches of rain since the beginning of September here in Texas\nThat the some some close to that um and it's it is unbelievable the the the amount of rain we we ended up getting a break over the weekend this past weekend but uh it's not even starting to dry out for the most part I mean there's just no real drying potential here and this is going to be one of those\nFalls that apparently we're going to have what are the normal\nAh situation or going forward in the fall and winter we really went from summer ... to a Texas winter ... period up but I mean she was the last week\nYou should look for in a it was in the forties or the high I cranked up my fire plays started I mean you know and I was like you know I don't really feel bad about it on Wednesday I was like OK I'm ready for the rain to be done now I was done resting I was I was becoming restless\nOr to go outside so I was like yeah I'm ready for the rain to be done but ah we kept getting rain and\nYou know the temperatures moderated you know how bad the weather was ... I never picked up a golf club once you know am I going to me I don't want on us now warns oh my goodness had not even swung a golf and I got a big argument coming up yeah the independent Bob\n... by the way anyway sort of an independent Bob just called me a few times just ranting I think he knew was um vacation he just ranting and raving ... Elizabeth Warren thing just sending them into outer space yeah\nHe's just like this is just well they they\nThey believe that's a good thing to do\nThat they believe that this is a good tactic you and I just kind of just in general if you just look at the tactics right now the left as using\nI mean politically we're not talking about the moms in restaurants\nWe're not talking about you know the the the rank and file of the protesters talking about the people holding office yeah\nTheir political\nTactics I mean there are many this is their mainstream political tactic and they believe stuff like this is going to work\nAnd and that's and you and I made sure that before he went on vacation when we were talking about cabinet or not understand this is the mainstream now yeah as the Democrat leadership in this country because we'll always get calls from people saying well\nThis isn't the average Democrat it's the average Democrat now representing you sure in Congress and in the Senate right\nThis is the standard and we'll get to Elizabeth Warren too and uh the the three big problems\nThat she by the way the way they were down just to three well one one of the things I I Love was uh I I never believed in white privilege until Elizabeth Warren\nA white person makes the claim yes she's Native American you all white privilege that's white privilege ... rice or cultural appropriation yeah right\nAnd and again they believe they're on the right track\nI Know it just it's just unbelievable so we'll get to that to the polls everything else got a great show up for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there's a low pressure systems and in the Pacific there's a low pressure area both of those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nAnd if you get up into the higher reaches of the southern Sierra isn't southern Rockies you could pick up some snow fall as a result of that pretty sick at the end of last week the winter weather forecast from the climate Prediction Center was issued a couple of regional highlights it will be warmer in the west no change in the chances for snow\nIn the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer\nThe great lake region is expected to be drier\nKnow parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter there's a Seventy five percent chance of an El Nino developing which means wetter conditions are possible across the country for winter there so look at your national forecast from red eye radio meteorologist John trout\nBut they had the meeting that first weekend they had that meeting will just get up and walk out\nThis is this is the ... this is a mainstream Democrats today\nThis this is not the protesters\nAnd we've talked about how the protesters that lead the party\nThey lead the party they lead the call for the party but how many groups how many different causes and different protest groups are there this is why they have no direction because they're in every direction and it's it's it's\nCrazy and then then I guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren than does DNA matter\nQuite right does this does is destroying transgender isn't mhm if DNA matters because remember the the the next thing is as as we all know uh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing the ... just starting to embrace writer remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter]\nBefore this one of the leading liberal icons [noise]\nYou know socialist icons social justice warrior ... who broke a ton of social justice warrior rules and regulations ... number one you're saying the DNA matters does it does so DNA matters across the board then and then it matters for ah your your sexuality it matters for your gender huh\nThat writers for your race huh right is is that the\nIs that the whole point or or does it not in okay what's the determining factor of what you are then what is the what is the [laughter] where does the decimal point go what is the what is the fraction that indicates that you are a particular ethnicity just great stuff\nAnd if I were doing a debate with her on stage I Would say a former President Obama said race is just a social construct yes do you agree\nAnd people forget about that because again what you know it\nInstruct yes do you agree\n[laughter]\nAnd people forget about that because again what you know it that when a President Obama mhm just before he left office I Believe that was the was at the Atlantic her New Yorker I forgot what I think it was ... he did a a an interview with\nAnd they asked him you know why do you say that you're black and when you know you're mixed right next mixed race and he said because I've come to know I've I've come to realize that race is a social construct ... it's what you think you are ... so\nIs that it now is that done now\nHas a lot moved on because when when you look at it there were so many rules of the social justice warrior that Elizabeth Warren broke and they were completely quiet mhm totally silent mhm\nEverything from cultural appropriation so the fact that ... race apparently is no longer a social construct it has something to do with DNA that's\nWhy are you using science miss the Warren [laughter]\nRemember when Ben Shapiro brought up the science on a on the doctor drew show he was threatened with violence\nSo you can't bring up science that's wrong\nIt but see this is this is the madness of the left because there are so many different directions how do you know which one is the\n... here's here's the thing when Trump says something the majority of what Trump says that they criticize in fact check this off the cuff mhm right\nIt's it's an opinion or just the thought that he just boom roller it's out right and and and the insanity of the left which is I'm going to call them the whole my beer party from now on\nCars whatever Trump does that hold my beer I think that I Will watch what I'm going to say it's actually premeditated and thought out yes naturally planet\nThat they were trying they're trying to prove them wrong on something that she didn't give a half a second to he didn't give one one hundred and twenty fours of a second [laughter]\nMy\nMy favorite was the [laughter] water over one hundred and twenty four yeah maybe seal and it was a huge ad I with a gun [laughter]\nRoughing it in a swimming pool or it's you know that that's it it really is the that's the madness because they believe that something\nThat's going to win\nFor them look in her state in terms of you know her Senate seat yeah she's pretty safe like Dick Durbin he can get away with saying and are doing a lot of crazy things as safe as long as he wants that seat but at least for the time being you want to enter the arena and twenty twenty\nFor the big house well by the way not present the White House I mean yeah but [laughter]\nAlthough although Hillary was a contender for both um [laughter]\n\nWe ... do you have to get up on that stage and you have to bring that out look again you know those are those blue states where they're safe they can they can do the crazier things they can do to protest or type attitude but do that up on stage you know we talked about this\nWas a few months ago when we were talking about what the the the pool of contenders in the primary season and twenty twenty will look like right\nThere each going to have the top each other on how much they hate Trump\nThat will be gold number one you've got to show your anger and you've got to show how much you so the person who hates Trump more\nWhile Democrats might get the nomination because that's the goal number one for them so but in order to do that they have to get up on that debate stage during that primary season and that's what they have to do they have to do the crazier and crazier and crazier because no longer can you have\nA debate no longer can you have a real discussion ... what are they going to say well the economy is suffering Mm as long as it holds between now and twenty twenty no\nAh jobs we need more jobs ... we haven't ... finding enough people right now I'm so is the what are you going to do well you have it has to be about the hatred for Trump's so you're going to have to display you know the one who hates them most is gonna win always equate\nOr where it's going that we thought the only way that they could go if they were going to go more or less which is we're offering you everything for free\nYes yeah and I mean that's ... ... and that we are the other day we ... we yeah we do we we do have a fascist mindset and we do is to control a lot a lot of things we do believe in the intimidation\nAh the tactics out there we don't believe in the constitution of the United states would I by the way it's become clear and we brought this up a few years ago and we were amazed\nAt the very little response that we got from Democrats on this front where we said look they don't really believe in the constitution we now know that they don't they don't believe in the Senate they don't believe in the cars that by the way that gain ground overhear vacation then now the Senate has to go to the electoral college the electoral college just to go to\nThe Senate has to go and what they what they may not realize it but that's when you get into not carrying that belief get you to the point of\nNot caring about individual rights because that's why the Senate exists that's why the electoral college or you know it exists because we're not a direct democracy were republic\nOr constitutional Republican or a public why to protect individual rights that the Democrats and the ACLU used to care about right but now as we know they don't write and so you know that's where you've got to we really don't believe in America\nAnd so in order to get you to vote for us we'll give you as much free stuff as possible to me that's actually what the Democrats round I Know and\nI I you're you're spot on and\nBut the problem there is what\nJake Tapper and Chris Cuomo asking tough questions from a Casio Cortez and kill him\nYou know separate interviews okay well how do you pay for it how do you pay for it but but but beyond that forget about the media asking wasn't so tough but they did ask the question if you're Hillary and you get back in and twenty twenty\nThe it used to be the boiling the frogs slowly right okay we'll give you a little more free stuff and then we'll a little more free stuff you've got to go full on because you have Gillum and Florida promising the world will Casio Cortez promising the world Bernie's been promising the world\nCan all Harris now over the last couple of days yeah you know saying okay let's give everybody right now let's let's give people six thousand dollars a year that's the starting bright right let's just give cash to people and and so uh so we're to the the the the free cash free health care and free college\nSand and they know they can't pay for it and the American voter knows they can't pay for it but how how do you do it if you're Hillary and you try and put up a plan of a little more free stuff no you've got to go full on like the rest of 'em did\nSomebody will get to the point where we talked about before the twenty sixteen election just offer every American a hundred thousand dollars [laughter] exactly or one ticket to the mega millions

and that's what that's what it comes down to it also how the left is behaving in reaction to how the left as having an end type of threat that that poses if you think of the what happened during the cabin a confirmation process\nYou know so that's that's what it comes down to what's the greater motivator on each side and will seat and a couple of weeks for video road logging here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there is a low pressure system and in the Pacific there is a low pressure area both of those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nAnd if you get up into the higher reaches of the southern Sierra is an southern Rockies you could pick up some snow fall as a result of that pretty sick at the end of last week the winter weather forecast from the climate Prediction Center was issued couple regional highlights it will be warmer in the west know changing the chances for snow\nIn the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer\nThe great lake region is expected to be drier\nKnow parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter there was a Seventy five percent chance of an El Nino developing which means wetter conditions are possible across the country for winter bears or look at your national forecast from red eye radio a meteorologist John trout\nYou know but I Would have been ... and again you can't make the case he was trying to make the case that it was the same and I'm like no it was unprecedented what happened right are you you're going to get Justice Thomas you know that goes back you know twenty five\nOr ... that goes back twenty five years ago and and uh you know he those hearings were held and then but then but then he was he was you know confirmed and I believe some Democrats even cross the line and voted for him yes they did I Believe that yes they did well I Believe that was a Democrat Senate at the time ...\nYeah uh so yeah so you know they they ... but this was on President\nNothing nothing we've ever seen\nA ... in our lifetime or in modern times\nHas has been like this so to even question that to me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity it means\nA lack of knowledge ah on on history and that's why we brought up and said that didn't have to sort of minor and that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe that sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn the with the cell tower\nRight to cell tower case of the cell tower that they agreed with ... they you know that ah they use the in their writings they used\nUm the prior judgment or by opinion written by ... majority opinion written by Scalia\nIs ... exactly that was the press and the right to use but in many of their many of their answers and many of their their decisions we believe they legislate\nWhich is not their role which is why we were against their nomination but it was based on traditionally what they would do not by what we want each and every day mhm mhm ... what the job of the judges and that's the difference and that's something that we brought up with the whole Kavanaugh hearings\nThat we should look ... you know conservatism Republican stop have to stop arguing the same premise that Democrats are arguing right Republicans keep arguing most conservative versus liberal justice no it's not ...\nI'm not voting for a conservative judge I'm voting for a construction is an originalist I'm voting for a judge irrespective of what they wish the government to be each and every day understand that their role is not to make law either left or right\nThere their job under the constitution is to interpret what the law says\nYou know it's interesting to see that as we got to the uh the closer to the the\nUltimate vote on on a Kavanaugh you know I made the point that\nEven the liberal justices\nRespect the process in my opinion\nBased on experience and I think one thing you can look at\nOne judgment you can look at from SCOTUS was recess appointments which was ... yeah against Obama against Obama yeah because if you look at that that really was something that was very clear\nOn what the process yes\nAnd so respecting not only in the process of how you know the confirmation process of of of how that's done but also again the process at the highest court\nProcess of how you know the confirmation process of of of how that's done but also again the process at the highest court\nI Do believe and you know you can say what you will about the opinions written by a Ginsburg or or whether they're dissenting or majority opinion you can we can tear those apart and say well they're wrong about this or the wrong about that or we disagree with this or that\nBut in terms of the process I think ah by and large\nDisplay consistently respect for the actual process and I can point to that one example but there are others a recess appointments was that unanimous decision where\n... you can't do that\nAnd and and that is that is the difference when the left no longer respects the process\nWhen you don't respect to process what is left\nBecause what is left is shouting people out of restaurants do away with the Senate do away with this do away with the president said do away with the electoral college do away with parts of the constitution that's what's left\nTo the point there is no process and we'll shout you down just to get our way which means we'll get control of your life you better button it up north Dakota where California and will tell you what the law is will tell you who's going to be president will tell you how it's

'cause I I Know the state department but I started thinking that\nThat\nIn the Obama administration\nDid they really think if this is true\nAnd if it's true what we think is going on why we've heard nothing about\nThe the uh uh\nFive ... application being declassified because Trump sent it to the inspector general\nAnd nobody's ever discussed the reason why he sent it to the inspector general and there could only be one reason because he wanted the inspector general to look at the possible corruption and law breaking\nAnd what we discovered that the evidence existed that Hillary lied about it remember when Jim Jordan brought it out what was the response of the media that day and\nThis was a great week one of Hillary as best we up this was a great week for Hillary and ... the\nThe hearing show she didn't break any law well because we're looking for a law breaking exactly well off and that was it\nYou know you had Shepard Smith on Fox News well she's not going to jail as you I mean there's no\nThis wasn't about what that is is that that whole false premise idea ...\nThey did because you know a liberal like a ...

six months ago at\nYour father was part of the plot that led to the ... at the fascination of a president that's not a small claim you know like your father was once a Democrat\n[laughter] he helped killed Kennedy\nAnd you know and today there will be a really yeah you right now and and I had a much wider place they were in a small place over a bigger place now the campaign is claiming Trump's twenty twenty campaign boasting a hundred thousand people plus interested in attending\nOkay so Washington Examiner a late Sunday evening posted ... supporters\nAre lining up for blocks one day before the big Trump cruise rally in Houston so they were lining up a as early Sunday to get him [laughter] at this rally I don't know I don't know if that that's been a\nYou know I just wonder how they extrapolate it out to so many of these races where if they're using the public polls out there there are so few of them\nSo few and far between how they use those ... if you're going to the internal polling polling which I'm sure as being done by the campaigns right and you you would have the better you know a better guess at that right yeah it it gets here\nIt is a a a dentist mid term advantage narrows\nAmong registered voters yeah my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances of a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the GOP the seven point gap is narrowing from a twelve point kept the Democrats had in September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters we gotta talk about likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day this we've been talking about this it has changed since the Kavanaugh confirmations\nLeading up to and since I don't know to what extent I Can't tell you it's motivated the left or the right more we do know there's no doubt the right is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nI I watch it on the Mike called before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because my was not driven to call based on what we had said and therefore\nRussian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because\nMike was not driven to call based on what we had said and therefore he you know became passionate about giving his point of view across my called with that passion about the Russian\nCollusion investigation and his anger and his feeling that this could possibly changed the election you know and and move it to the Republicans before we started talking about I think that's important because I don't find many people like Mike mhm\nI don't think honestly\nNow we covered everything when it comes to the whole Russian collusion from day one and we've asked every question known to man kind of we do think that we have looked at more or as investigators in partisans\nAnd we believe that hey that with everything going on and with the Pfizer warranted and and everything there that we are going to find out that probably the Democrats were up to a lot more hijackings than the Republicans ever dreamed of actually doing it as we know already\nThe only evidence of clothing with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly would be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to give me the money to uh Perkins gave it to fusion GPS and gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who said he got his information his\nSalacious on verified information or against Donald Trump from people close to the Kremlin right so the only people that colluded in any way with the Russians were the Democrats from the information that we have\nAt this particular point but I don't think right now that's driving anybody to go to the polls\nNo it really isn't\nIt could it is it an underlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives are based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who who really brought to light so many things in this thing if you really followed it but\nIt could be there again is that underlying motivator\nThat's I don't think that's the big push right now I don't think that's the big emotion nothing right now um I Do think there's something to the the the fact that they've been alleging all of this sense you know a after the election and since certainly he's become president\nThey never showed anything for it and and it's really been the media circus and it's really based on nothing I think that's a motivator but it's not what I don't think it's the here and now\nI don't I don't\nSee it I look I I think that there are some people that have looked over the last couple of years and what the Democrats have done and they have included a ... in its in its contacts the whole Russian collusion thinking how unfair they believe it is and maybe that's partly what's driving them to the polls but the difference that we've seen over the last month\nIn the energy level or what do they call it the excitement level of Republican voters to come out which\nWould make the difference\nIn keeping the house and increasing the number and the Senate none of that has to do with Russian collusion\nOr the mall or investigation at all or\nAnd see I don't know what a a a Muller report does the if the ... if the report from last week is true that says the that Mueller would would uh issue the core of his report after the midterm right after the midterm\nI I don't know what that does politically because first of all how can it be an actor report without including the fact that of how all this information was uh\nBecause first of all how can it be inaccurate report without including the fact that of how all this information was obtained and what you just spelled out not us that direct line that we know\nThat no one has disputed between the DNC and the Hillary campaign and ultimately Christopher Steele\nYou can't you can't debate you and you can't you can't let out a report I don't have to do it's it's incomplete um what I Know the report right now it's not going to even talk about that in in that that sold point it's like a ... but it's not even going to talk about the possibility of Trump living with the Russians\nI just because where where it would be the evidence if there's not going to be in the movement on the indictment if it is just to report a chrysalis over at CNN\nA former Washington Post I write that you know where he said you know I think it's ... it's ultimately going to be just a just a report he's been saying that for a while it's it's ultimately just got to be a report it's really not going to be any more indictments unless maybe there's a you know lying to investigators
