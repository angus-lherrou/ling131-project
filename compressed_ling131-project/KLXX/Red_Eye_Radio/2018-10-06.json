the report from the hill a earlier in the day Thursday Afternoon into Thursday evening was that they would review it on Thursday\nOr but at the reports came out that they you know it was the senators had it\nAnd I assume we're reviewing it and taking that time to review it or at least the G O P might have been a as late as a Wednesday evening so that could pour over into Thursday [noise] now

each\nYou know I was watching a Sarah Huckabee Sanders part of the press conference on Wednesday you know and they were wanting her to basically say the president was wrong for mocking you know Dr Ford but then one of the last question actually I think it was the last question from a female reporter well\nWhy is it that the president came out and spoke against the abuse in the Catholic Church and those those who were claiming that they were abused were men but yet he won't defend any women\nI'm paraphrasing but I'm pretty damn close\nThat was the question and she said Sarah Huckabee Sanders answers or wait a minute\nHe's the one who actually ordered the supplemental background check he's been more than accommodating in this entire process so his comments at the rally\nOr were factual based but he believes that there's nothing to back up the claims [noise]\nYou know why because there's nothing to back up the claims the left it once again is created their own little fantasy

number one goal a so there's a where we are cloture vote on a friday the Senate all members of the Senate will be able to see it but yeah ... statement\nYou and I were looking for an update to the story a just a little while ago and we did that during this past break and a Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying that all senators will have an opportunity to review the report\n... over the next couple of right as we do that and you know because the the cloture vote could happen you know late friday so they could take all day Thursday and all day friday a and I suspected that well while he may not allow multiple copies to be made again there's only one single copy\n'em that he could easily say well OK over the next couple of days we'll we'll take our time with it and it won't be the the one hour restriction\nA you know maybe a each of them can go into that room are either as a group or individually and they can you know take their time with it\nUm and and they likely will do that but I'm I'm guessing they will do that either in one large group or or smaller groups even\nA in order to to see everything\nUh we'd seen the story of late yesterday that the top FBI a lawyer a James Baker offers explosive testimony on a normal handling of the Russia probe into the Trump campaign uh and that's a Fox News headlines from uh yesterday was going through additional\nBut certainly you don't ah you you've got to be careful I guess which way you go keep in mind in the house things may be working for Democrats according to the polls maybe right now but in the Senate\nThere's a lot of close races and there's no one\nYou know talking about a blue wave in the Senate so you have to assume that McConnell still going to be in place or in the new year but the point being a Democrat doesn't want to go out and blatantly violate that rule\nAh because they know internally that's going to create a lot of problems for them going forward\nI'm not saying they won't do it but but uh there's a huge disincentive for them to to to do that but you probably could see them saying look ... and it it's going to be this it's already this run the liberal media\nOr NBC News on on Wednesday well there are dozens of people dozens of people I think they said over forty people that have said that that have ah have information at potentially they could be witnesses that's one of the words they use to potentially and their story\nOr that that could help substantiate all these claims and blah blah blah\nThat's not how this works they don't get to control that but the but nonetheless that will be the narrative and you'll probably see a couple of senators or during the day on Thursday or friday more likely on friday as they try and hold up an elevator doors open\nThey're going to try and and block they're saying this was not enough that the we need a greater background check they did an interview enough people uh they didn't talk to Ford or\nKavanaugh there's new allegations that are coming out yeah uh that are uncorroborated too so we need to investigate them since there is no cooperation\nKavanaugh there's new allegations that are coming out yeah uh that are uncorroborated too so we need to investigate them since there is no cooperation we need to find the ... I mean it's going to go down to the ... but I I I Do believe that\nBecause the ah Republicans most likely want to abide by the rule that Democrats\nWill do everything they can to claim\nFor example is Adam Schiff has done all along and Adam Schiff ... not on this but Adam ship since we will be talking about uh the whole a Russian collusion investigation coming up in the bombshell or out of a of a DC uh yesterday about the James Baker ... uh uh apparently telling the house\nOr the house ah ah I don't know which panel it was\nBut uh in in test closed door testimony yesterday telling them\nHe talked to the Democrat the Democratic national committee's lawyers right before they got the warrant right and and and James Baker top FBI official or at that time which without question shows that politics played a part any talk to them about\nWhat was going on me talk to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion investigation that was going on which is absolutely\nThe wrong thing to do right\nNow you cannot nobody can defend that in an investigation so it's getting to where you and I ask questions over a year and a half ago is this where this is going and we ... you know the thing is every question that we asked\nAbout where this where what might have happened here in what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question on has come true\nThere is this all come out in a in a series of reports you know if you look at it it ... or well at least it's it's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we can say right um that\nWell first of all one of the first questions the big question really was there a potentially is there are we looking at possibly a gross\nAbuse of power\nUnder the previous administration that that uh a person or persons\nKnowingly used false information to which is the Giuliani pointed out you know there's a there you have it there's your your your perjury um but they they in soliciting for\nThat Pfizer court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up following the top of the hour might point out Adam Schiff is though Adam Schiff has claimed for the longest time that there is collusion their ... and since we can't see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and out of the feeling the Democrats or do the same thing here claim\nThat there is evidence yeah I Know in this because the Republicans won't release it so that they won't release or do they know the Republicans won't release of because Republicans you know uh it it\nUh in the in the Senate want to keep a this\nRuling affect that hey we can't be black but not every\nBackground check we do have every job of of every judge we're not going to do that\nAnd so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may force the Republicans to release it here\nIn the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I could finish the show here in the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours the rest of the show\nGo home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM [laughter] so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in a ...

National Public radio poll that shows that uh the Democratic enthusiasm edge for the election has evaporated it was a ten points just a but in July right and now it's down to two which is in the margin of error which means it's a dead heat yeah yeah\nI I think it's interesting because I've been questioning the methodology a and I mean just not that I doubt the methodology I'd just have some questions about the methodology and what's going on with the way the but the FiveThirtyEight dot com is putting together they're basically a composition type poll based on all the polls\nAh in all the districts\nAre for the house seats it's interesting to look at it but I'm not so sure that I buy that well as of right now it's roughly Seventy five percent chance that the Democrats take the house\nUm that may be the case I'm just asking about I have\nActual questions about the methodology and how they're applying it to this big scale I'm very smart people at five thirty eight dot com\nOr so but I Do wonder about again the polls they're using I'm a registered voters versus likely voters a demographics and everything else so you know all that is important when you're trying to put together\nOr something those numbers or we don't make predictions but certainly you look at the polls and we want to look at those ... I think especially after from Thursday last Thursday on uh the Kavanaugh hearings couple of things I wanted a\nBriefly touched on coming up on the bottom of the hour Saudi Arabia has increase or crude production why ... a distant from Bloomberg Trump Mm yeah saying you better do it you want military stuff you'd better do it more on the way for on attracts here's your forecast\nAn unusually persistent weather pattern is going to bring some snow to the higher elevations of the Rockies\nRain snow into the great lakes basin possible and into the northern plains\nSevere thunderstorms possible over parts of the country today in New York will see Seventy eight degrees with some sunshine today Detroit under thirty percent chance of showers high Seventy three Chicago near sixty eight chance of thunderstorms both today and tomorrow\nSo that vote would happen I'm assuming if and don't know the headcount there on the cloture vote will tell them you know ... what the headcount is for the vote and I I doubt they're going to want to delay a much longer after that cloture vote if they get fifty or more\nWe go to Chris in battle creek Michigan Chris welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show\n[laughter] how are you good to [noise]\nAh\nWell I'm curious about and it's just something that went through my head is what do you uh what do you guys think about the idea that the whole reason\nThey held everything they do have been doing and they laid the groundwork for in the hearings by claiming that he gets kind of partition and ... them is that they didn't think they were actually going to be able to stop the confirmation haven't all\nBeen doing a play on the ground work once he looked at it and there's a score from this point for or a claim each targets in and and demand that either choose\nFor eight but they haven't been with any of it but they don't they can do it no it's not a person can reach ...\n... that's ... that's pretty good lawyers pretty long but nowhere [laughter] [noise] oh that's good lawyers you know I Know it's a job [laughter] so yeah [laughter]\nWell we wish you the way the world cup was just it was the best way to do away with Ross who should change the way that we're supposed to do that and we all about what we don't get the ... ... [noise]\nUh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme\nThere's been some cases were even said some of the judges mhm should ... cells I Can't remember Pacific won a write off the top of my head but I Know that we talked about that and in the past and I never I cannot tell the judge on a case yeah you know\nBefore they were sitting down to it got to the court after they were seated on the high court that happened or they\nArgue the case or something then but again that's up to ... because\nIt is or or their for their argument in case it deals with a ... or you know what the ... wife works for the company and writes for the guy at that point you have to recuse yourself\nBut to say as we've been we've we've heard for ... well they can't he can't win anything that involves a Denver that's because he's been ... and he got three at the end that's not going to hold any more\nThan ... you remember when they talk about ah you know his nomination this was back during the Gorsuch nomination process or the talk was why the president should nominate his sister you know and it was like okay with that [laughter] she would have to recuse herself\nFrom every case of [laughter] well that company\nIs indirectly working with my brother's company and that and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that the well she's part of his family but the\nThe\nThe process and you and I were having this discussion during the break\nThere is a great deal of respect by everyone that seated on the court right now for the process\nNot that they make a decision that we should always agree with in fact a a while I can think of three that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter] but we can talk about that\nBut the procedure on procedural issues\nAll of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court\nHave a great deal of respect for those procedures and how you move forward with the case or it is not\nIt is not driven like the social media world of today at the Supreme Court in terms of procedure now the hearings often how these interesting comments that come out of ... an questions that come out of them and then the media takes them and runs with them often out of context\nAh they did that with Scalia or but you know there's but but still in terms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect why each of those that are ...\nBut I I think can make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the federal judges to begin with is not the social media world that I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that it's not the social media world that we live in for example most people don't know\nThat a former Justice Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great great friends were great I'm One needs to make that their ... their their family their families used to\nVacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find two polar opposites so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we have and said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to ask the judges privately what they believe about the process at Kavanaugh is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that\nThis is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate in two thousand nine controlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the the content of the three oh two cigarettes\nIs likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if this uh if some content came out just imagine that we never heard Dr Ford's name but the ... came out what they would do is look at that and go okay well is there anybody backing it up\nBecause the claim would be in the three oh to accept that they found that they couldn't find any anyone with first hand knowledge of the event or the claims\nThan they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well\nThey know the Senate knew back then that you take something like that a simple claim that cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but here's here's the point that nobody's talked about\nWith all the federal judge ships out their forget about the Supreme Court just a federal judge ships out there that background checks are done\nHow many thousands of claims that are uncorroborated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands\nOf allegations are made that are on cooperated I ordered to defeat somebody\nAnd never get known to the public eye only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rule ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the Senate complete protocol we don't do this\nBut I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority that is a more construction as well or journalists core and then\nLearning of this this rule now it puts it on and the prospect she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI to vet as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official thrilled to report and you wouldn't hear about it\nWhen it would've never it would have you know that's the ... when you think about that that's the whole point\nNobody would've ever known that this existed right her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... ... we're not would not have been able to collaborate and then at that point\nIt dies just like probably the thousands of other allegation yes and you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices over the decades and that's that's it\nBecause you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now it makes sense as to why\nFeinstein for her politically white work to her end and and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to lead to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it\nNow you know why Lindsey Graham was so enraged yep eight six six Ninety right I\nWas really my camera and they're recording the radio

investigation over the last uh a couple of years\nA this it's been a you know a reporter that there was an explosive testimony uh yesterday by a you know a high FBI law enforcement official a former official well the hilltop Tom John Solomon\nOr has released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out a\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney from Perkins Kuwait the Democratic National Committee is private law firms\nJust we we like to do this because we can do within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats that ... you know they accused or the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original or a charge what we found out since that time was\nWhat I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign gave money to their law firm ... law firm ... who then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the Kremlin\nWhich was unverified still to this day unverified in order to uh\nDestroy the reputation of Donald Trump\nDuring the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it to destroy the legitimacy\nOf his election after he was elected a lot of that information and that dossier promote we know it was the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign and so now we know that right before that the FBI\nLead counsel met\nWith the law firm Perkins Cooley\nThat really when you look at it they're the ones that started you know the the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign and we've got to the law firm they were with the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS I mean they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers right and I would\nCounsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it and lead agents were there to question the the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others in that law firm\nThat would be you could just easily I guess\nA compartmentalize that is part of an investigative process [noise]\nWhy would why would the counsel for the FBI do as they say well well as he says to talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election but it was lawyers meeting with lawyers right why why\nNot an agent's asking some questions of the attorneys\nNo it was attorneys and attorneys made it\nSo former general counsel James Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee he's private law firm that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay research firm fusion GPS\nWho then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy to compile the dusty a oven cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow or colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed or by both testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect that dossier was connected to the ... main law for him and and it was the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the ... court in October twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer\nTo hide that Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed a Jim Baker was interviewed\nMakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to divulge the testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the Perkins could we law firm\nAnd the FBI we bought the state of the ... I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four yeah and you\nCan do a couple of season though you could do probably more seasons then law and order a couple of seasons of it because\nWe've always broken down and since we've been on for such a long time I do believe that you know you could include us in the group that was first in asking so many of the important questions on this and when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians\nTo hack and or change because of change then to hack\nAnd or to change the outcome of the election and in reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones\nWho colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump\nOn verified\nInformation still today yes [noise]\nAnd oh by the way if it's an verified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's false after I've ever over after over two years right so\nAnd and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that\nIt was destroyed the legitimacy of a lead shit presidential election in the United states and they tried to do it by taking that information\nThat information and and ... well faking it as intelligence instead of opposition research to the Pfizer court to spy on the Trump campaign exactly the accusations they and they still make it against Trump\nYes they still make the say he's treasonous for Russian collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party and all those things that I just brought up right now\nAll the way to the whole Pfizer court and you everybody knows it's true\nI don't know of anybody decide or or that as\nIt tried to even debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others at circuit news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out\nUm and what was going on the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together in the last two years here's the\nProblem with\nHaving something go on for so long [noise]\nWhere it is active because it is still active Mueller and his team are still working which means it's still relevant\nEven

you can easily apply that to what's going on today that if a claim 'cause the FBI is not doing a criminal investigation\nI hate the fact that we have to keep saying it but I feel it's necessary so if

is from the hill and John Solomon congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign mhm\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney from ...\nThe Democratic National Committee private law firm that's the from used by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign to secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the dos ca\nOf uncorroborated man whenever we talk about the left it's always on cooperating cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed\nA bite testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation\nIn government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon\nOr the other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between Perkins ... law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground about the FBI's use of news media\nIn twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump\nThe interview was one of the most productive we've had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said\nAnother said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI about FBI media contacts citing ongoing investigation\nBy the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nA new how much the FBI and Justice Department has withheld from the public\nTheir collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the DNC fusion GPS and steel\nThat we're trying to defeat Trump and so that is you know breaking news because what you have there you have you have the first person from\nThe last administration the Obama administration that worked in the FBI you have them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon test to find the tie in we were ... there's no reason\nIf you're investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the DNC his lawyers private lawyers just before you got the secured Warren right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said\nThey talked to they talked to ... to the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why\nWhy would that be I Would that be\nSo that's huge breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure in the upcoming days\nOr they just want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to an air record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices this from Bloomberg now\nOver ... largest producer is currently pumped in about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that's just shy of the record set\nIn November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrels he said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nAre the key insights this is from blue bird their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again to pressure from Trump\nThat we talked about this 'cause we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil in the war yep we beat started we'd be there every other country and somebody called up and they said well banal ... prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors in a ... there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy\nBecause there are other factors in all ... there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you produce your own oil here and we've become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here\nWell and and you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you had the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably good\nAt some levels well that comes from an expansion as you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have a you don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations\nOnly the regulations were holding us back that we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nThat I get I give credit here to President Trump or he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia ... excuse me\nWe're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we ... we're we're there for you all the time mhm er and whoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince an OPEC member Saudi Arabia OPEC member I deal pact member [laughter]\nA very good you know back in the field that member right Saudi Arabia or to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we talked about when he does extremely good things we talked about the fact that no other there was no other Democrat courses in or the Democrats there's no other Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quickly because we talked about the new NAFTA agreement and um the whatever wealth stops it could be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we had said look we said this a long time ago we said one of the reasons that we're concerned [laughter] and ... babies\nAre one of the original chair of the original terrible [laughter] you know one of one of the reasons that we can certainly said look\nEventually when this agreement comes out it's not really going to be different\nThan the agreement that that we have now ... or ...\nWho's a leading economists for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing yet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like\nA lot like the old NAFTA mhm\nMexico's only significant concession was on automobiles and parts rules requiring more production in North America highway higher wages for workers\nPotential terrorists if its exports to the U.S exceed two point six million vehicle that even though there's a cap because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance\nThey talked to ... of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower price models now assembled by Volkswagen miles to in a few other manufacturers in Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry\nBut they're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariffs and it will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAs we've said and they said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from sending expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments are they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with\nSouth Korea ... that we set these limits but\nCurrent shipments are they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with\nSouth Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed right and as we settle along a we there's been a lot of us\nYou know industry that has suffered because of this and you wonder if you wind up basically but the same deal or things that you claim are great things that can't be enforced or as we say the auto things that hurt the economy and will hurt lower income people will then was it all worthwhile", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red
