looks like a you know it's it's headed right right towards and the developments if\nYou want to know the developments over the last couple of hours the uh ten pm a National Hurricane center\nA update shows it now at a what a hundred and twenty five miles an hour the winds right and expected to be right now over a hundred and thirty which would make it at least a category for hurricane that with a hit the uh panhandle Gulf\nCoast right they're they're talking about uh the storm surge being a a a a really strong storm surge in and talking about how the the potential uh for a life threatening conditions is really great with this storm\nA everyone in this area needs to heed the warnings and and listen to officials and and those directives given by officials are in the coming hours if you haven't already because\nAh you see the pictures and videos of the people in that area are getting ready evacuating a boarding up windows and everything else this is a major storm already\nAnd has the potential to be ah in in most believe it will be a historic storm\nA in terms of the damage and the size of the storm\nOr it will ah then move inland with a ton of rainfall we were talking during the pre show meeting\nAs it moves through uh the uh the the panhandle of Florida and then goes into north north easterly direction toward the Carolinas that's going to be dumping a lot of rain the Carolinas they're saying it will move faster than Florence so it won't present the same problems\nBut the problem is with the areas affected by Florence that are already saturated the ground is already saturated then of course any rain at all is going to cause problems\nAnd they will be getting rain in those areas in the coming days are but a more immediately we're looking at a at a the panhandle of Florida and Panama City essentially a being the the target right now for hurricane Michael\nAnd when you see wins over a hundred and thirty miles an hour if it's a a category for they say would be the biggest a hurricane ever to hit the uh uh panhandle I'm a ... when I when I Lived in a ... of our Florida when I Lived in the Fort Walton Beach Pensacola area back in the eighties\nIt's like you arrive ... one of the reasons we would have trouble ever worked right in any administration\nIs because we have a we would have a problem promoting something that we didn't believe in right and there are there are people that and and again I have nothing against people who do that that's your job your job is to\n... what the administration wants you repeat what the administration wants to the world when you are you in a you know UN ambassador the problem with the human eyes we've been talk show hosts too long we just\nWe could we probably couldn't do that or we will get frustrated that are doing that even if the president was even if we thought the president was Ninety percent right we want to get our ten percent in well you can't do that when you're\nA UN ambassador you have to be the national security\nAdvisor to be to be in that position I mean not only that that he that he talks to the public but he's an advisor as opposed to\nSomeone who is mimicking or or ... and and vote and said the same thing you know because when when they asked him well you know a fight or a [laughter] heads on John Hope [laughter] John Button was asked\nThat he's ... he's always as he said well look when when you were ...\nWhen when you were ah you know when you were whatever a of a ...\nFive years ago you said this and now you're saying this and he said well this is what the president which do I was a private citizen back then the president believes that everything has changed at this point that I Do it but look\nI give the president advice the president and I disagree right I get invited vice what he does a lot of it is I I'm the national security advisor advisor they find that if I was a ... white I tell him want to I I can tell them this is what I think you should do right he doesn't necessarily have to follow it and then when he says let's go and do it well then I tell you what the the plan is\nThe the the president and I sit there and I'm just want to pull my hair out saying\nWhy are we going through this because everybody knows that already well\n... what do they\nIn a nation where they can't name the three branches of government well no you know I think the reporters do it because they want to they they're trying to find\nAnything to show that there is discord within the administration\n[noise] yes yes it is ... and they attempted to do that with Nikki Haley as you mentioned earlier than I I think to your point the earlier point you may as well on the list of a possible abilities and and the possible people who might take her her spot I probably wouldn't have seen a Nikki Haley\nAh in that position as strong as she has been when she was governor I probably wouldn't have been able to say wow she's going to go to the un and she's really going

to make I made a fair point you made a great point and ah but you really don't know what you're going to get until you see somebody sitting in front of the un it's almost like a presidential spokesperson for I was making the analogy of you is almost like an NFL quarterback you're wrapped in NFL quarterback\nYou have no idea how they're going to perform you'd have no idea right and all the time they get on the field unions like oh they stink I really really good and we I'd mentioned Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nThat that you know most presidential spokes people I don't like what if you would have told me when that and I probably made the comment I don't remember specifically making it\nBut when she came aboard I probably went [noise]\nNo I just don't think she has it right away it was I wrong\nYou know and and and she has been very she doesn't even flinch anymore\nOr ... if you look at the nature of the ridiculous questions thrown at her every single day now it's just it's more like a game\nAnd that's the way she plays it but at first it was not a game and and it it's not an easy job it's not a job that anybody would want but she's been very good at it and you're right with few exceptions like a John Bolton you know you pretty much know what you're going to get the John Bolton but\nOtherwise ah there are a lot of people on that list and and and we'll see but clearly again going in I think they know what they're in for a not only internationally and what we're dealing with at the un but of course\nA what the president expects\nA drivers for cobra electronics you should be aware that there are parts of ice Seventy five and also I tend there in the Florida Panhandle\nPretty good chance of of multiple tornadoes associated with this and and you know anyone in this entire area of the Big Bend and the panhandle\nUh are are going to basically relate to a cake which happened to be in Nineteen eighty five [noise]\nUm but this is going to blow Kate out all the water\nTom in terms of the the the danger coming ashore because I think a lot of people may be ... by looking at you know the I coming ashore but I mean the where the danger and the potentially\nLife threatening situation start what is that timeline worries that window and and what should we expect during that time line\nOkay when it comes to the timeline or what you should expect 'em by tomorrow morning it still should be offshore and it will be properly ... bill a category three but darn close to a category for it I wouldn't be shocked if in the next and vice re ... in in a in one hour from now\nI may be upgraded but by Wednesday evening it should be on shore and so that would be in line with Tallahassee it would be coming across Tallahassee by Thursday evening it shouldn't be entering the Carolina\nAnd cutting right across the middle of the Carolinas and so the eastern side of it will be the onshore winds and the rain and the storms so Charlotte and end up the coast\nAnd then they don't need any more uh destruction or anything now wins are going to be around forty five miles an hour or when it gets to the Caroline\nBut on Wednesday\nToday or we're gonna have wins in Tallahassee tonight\nOf at least eighty miles an hour and a and a probably sustained winds up to forty or fifty miles an hour going through Tallahassee um we're looking at wins that are going to be up to a hundred miles an hour [noise] or when we get to\nA coming on shore and the storm surges the other really bad situation [noise]\nAh from pretty much I don't want to include Panama City Panama City six to nine foot storm surge\nAnd that's in part because their shoreline faces a little more to the southwest and so uh when it comes in if it comes in to the east the winds are going to be backing so it will reduce that effect but you get past that to saint Joe which is on the peninsula they're swinging around toward Appalachia cola\nOr we're looking at a storm surge that will run all the way around through the entire big band that doesn't include cedar key um of nine to Thirteen feet\nYeah nine to Thirteen feet um obviously once your past three feet cars float\n... yeah and and then so we're talking about a ... again in terms of that immediate threat really the greatest threat right now in those areas along the shoreline we're talking storm surge correct\nI the storm surges is clearly from the you know there's a storm surge warning in effect from Panama City past crystal river and and so as an example um we're looking at Panama City tonight they'll start seeing wins moving their way up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd all the way through an average of fifty miles an hour through Wednesday night they're going to have gosh Wednesday night or as this storm has come ashore of a hundred miles an hour and a storm surge of eight to twelve feet\nOr excuse me rain I'm Sorry of eight to twelve inches a foot of rain and so it\nInland and even on the coast flash flooding is going to be a common event and that range got to go somewhere and and once you start to inundate the water starts to rise under a storm surge um then from there then you start dealing with the rain on top of that\nAnd so we saw that in New Bern a newborn uh on friday night before the storm came in and the Carolinas the winds were coming out of the southeast and blowing up the Neuse River\nNew Bern is at the end of the Neuse River and they had a water rise of ten point two feet and and we had the um we had a a lieutenant I'm dropping his name but the lieutenant of the police department there the following day talking about the\nUh friday night rescues which were over three hundred and fifty boat rescues um that night while\nWhile I'm a ... again ah the you know I this this should go without saying but but certainly we want to repeat it as often as possible the people that are are in the path of this storm need heat all of the directors and warnings given by local officials do not hesitate\nA that this is this is going to be a life threatening storm it is already a life threatening storm and it is right now you have time to get out of the way the storm a Tom ... in terms of ah the the rainfall you mentioned\nThat we're going to see in some places maybe to twelve inches of rain um the flooding\nNecessarily be like it was because of Florence because the storm is moving faster is that correct\nYeah to some degree that's correct but still I expect many areas to pick up anywhere from eight to twelve inches as we move inland through Tallahassee and then from there when we move across the border into Georgia we're still going to be looking at five inches of rain or more in many areas so I can\nPull up some maps and break that out\nUm next time we taught bitterly that the fact of the matter is that it only takes you know it doesn't take a lot of water\nIf the ground saturated for run off to start flash flooding right and we all know the usual places where flash flooding takes place ... well the difference here is that this storm like the Carolinas along the coast are going to cause flooding in the places that are not the usual places and\nYeah All right and ... and when when you're expected to onshore\nI expect onshore between three and four o'clock okay uh this afternoon fair alright\nAlright meteorologist Tom hale you're going to be with us throughout the morning thank you Tom tom and they got a standing covered for us as he mentioned with Hurricane Florence a and also uh last year with a Hurricane Irma in in Florida so uh we are we just want to

yesterday evening we just got an update from the national Hurricane Center and from what we can see with these sustained winds of no a hundred and thirty miles an hour it's up to a category\nFor in fact the national Hurricane Center is saying it is now a hurricane category for a hundred and thirty miles an hour\nThey ah it again you you would look at the strength of this storm and and the history of the storm over the weekend a the productions being anywhere from a one two one two and then late in the weekend a more uh closer to a two and and pretty much everybody was calling that by Monday morning a change and they were saying that\nTwo and then late in the weekend a more uh closer to a two and and pretty much everybody was calling that by Monday morning a change and they were saying that it has the potential of being a three and now it is up to officially a category ... hurricane her a hurricane Michael\nAh it is a set to come ashore uh sometime in the afternoon three or four pm there near Panama City\nAh Florida and officials again you just heard a a one mayor and other officials had been basically saying the same thing throughout the day\nUh yesterday they were saying uh you should be aware that a first responders are going to be limited and being able to get to you and in in many cases especially while the storm is at its strongest in that area will not be able to get to you so you may not have power you may be in a situation\nOr that or you will not be able to again\nI get to any kind of a ... a assistance or four hours\nAnd so ah did his best to get out of the way of the storm as soon as possible uh get inland go somewhere where you will be safe and where you are with others especially if you have an underlying medical condition or anything else that might to warrant\nA that kind of a of a need so uh we'll see here and a little while we're going to talk with meteorology if a John's crowd or get caught up on this latest update from the national Hurricane Center\nAre meteorologist Tom hale was with us about a half hour ago and we were talking about this in fact he predicted that it would become officially a category for hurricane but Michael or will be officially the strongest hurricane to ever hit\nAnd ... he was up by a by three at the end of August the Fox news poll nine twenty nine to ten to has Donnelly up by two well within the margin of error three point to a five percent\nOr and now they have there are three of a different candidates are in this race including the libertarian\nYeah so uh but right now it's forty three forty one or a ... you know Donnelly with the lead but uh again excuse me yes Donnelly with the the lead the Democrat\nIn there but then again that really you look at that that is another a dead heat that exist out there and then we go to Missouri\nAnd uh the uh latest Fox News poll nine twenty nine to tend to and that is a dead tide of that is before the actual vote took place\nAnd before colon speech and everything else so that's the kind of thing that we're looking for the polls coming out ah maybe here in the next couple of days or early next week and as we get closer to see the effect that that that has had there there are a ton of these races that are\nA statistical tie with even in the statistical tie Democrats maybe up a point or two and a and so this is something that I'm sure as being very carefully watched and again when you go into and we're not pollsters you know we're not pollsters we can read them but I mean the methodology\nOf of each and every poll has different nuances and it\nIt all depends on you know what the sample is do they interview more Democrats than actually are in a you know that normally vote in a particular race or not or did they over sample Republicans\nFight and and so you look at it but overall when you look at at the the generalized polls are a ton of the Senate races that are extremely close and\nSo a lot of eyes are watching to see okay what's the excitement level going to be the voter excitement level out of the cabin on hearing which I Do believe will have an impact sure yeah and so there's are we are right now looking at some of the the the Senate races on\nA you you look into the race with Rick Scott it's interesting dynamic and and and frankly hurricane\nMichael [noise] uh and how it's handled will be part of that discussion and campaigning\nOn both sides uh uh you know for the next few weeks um it it may seem like an unfortunate situation to many but that's that's how politics runs in the ... the United states and it may it can make or break a candidate depending on how it's handled and while you know a senator or isn't going to have\nA control if he were to become a senator or over what's going on in that state necessarily\nUm ... like a governor ... during an emergency situation\nHow he handles it will be closely watched over the next few days because it's going to be it's going to be a very politically sensitive situation I'm sure a many from his camp will tell you well we're not focused on that right now nor should they be\nBut people outside that a camp are focused on that and we'll\nAlert the reality is that if\nFlorence was handled properly by\nThe Trump Administration Democrats would be using ... yes and and it ends up being that is used in political races yes and and as you and I talked about from the very beginning and I watched a lot more of the of of Florence are coming in than I have so far of of this particular race\nBut when you watch the weather channel you came across with the great opinion of the federal\nWe're handling that yes it'll be interesting to see at the same thing happens you know here because it will be used yes no doubt eight six six Ninety

even know what's going on we don't know the answer to that stuff that out I mean it was it was ... it was really really interesting but\nI guess the point and think about this now because Hillary now coming to board\nAs we said with with everything that went on the insanity from the mainstream of the Democratic party now that the mainstream the Democratic party\nThinks it's okay to say due process doesn't matter that Hillary can jump aboard and say a civility now it's gone too we take over when not to be civil will get any civility when we get our way right right we're not we're not we're not going to be civil and and think about what it's about now you're not civil because you believe in what\nDue process and\nA presumption of innocence ...\nThat you look at any case a political case a civil case or a criminal case and you judge it by what\nThe evidence that exist\nBecause you believe that because that's where it's all coalescing now it's ... it's it's getting right to that point now that you believe that\nYou may never be treated civil again we will find you wherever you are you've heard that call already wind or wherever you are well stock you wherever you are at your restaurant at your home nothing is off limits why because you believe in due process\nAnd you believe that's going to change people that believe and due process under the law that people that believe in the constitution of people that believe in\nFairness are going to be intimidated because you attempt to get in their face you actually believe that you're a bunch of idiots in you believe that's going to change the opposition this it's going to do the exact opposite\nBut even if you're a bunch of idiots in you believe that's going to change the opposition best it's going to do the exact opposite your stupid people for thinking that yes\nYou are and by the way please keep it up and thank you Hillary who by the way her version of due process is to\nGive money to hire lawyers ... so they can hire fusion GPS so they can hire Christopher Steele should go get salacious and unverified information on her opposition her opponents in twenty sixteen and then have her friends and the Justice Department use it\nTo get a warrant on somebody in her opponent's campaign that's due process for Hillary Clinton by the way how did that work out for her\nIt did there was always a twenty percent chance of who's going to do\nThat to me that's that's really the thing that's come out of all this ... is the defense now of instability for those ... to to attack and go after those people the Web or where they are in their personal lives because they believe in due process under the law and that thoughts but in my head since last week thinking\nThey think there's going to be effective yeah who whose mind that I think they're gonna change they're not going to change the people watching the TV who see\nSomebody eating dinner and you get in their face and you really don't want to leave him alone let let let them eat their you know the average independent who you're trying to convince them to know that's\nThat's a that's ridiculous Hillary calling for instability well we're only going to be civil if we get our way right [laughter] yeah [laughter] John McCain you hear this yeah\nNo kidding yeah we're we're only civil when we did and that was the whole point with John McCain when they were talking about that we need more people like John McCain you're not seeing that about Joe mansion or you know\nOh oh what you mean as you meet you need more Republicans to act as Democrats on policy\nOh we told you the whole ... thing and it goes back because that's where it really got to its peak was that right John McCain's a funeral where the left was talking about civility and that's what we need and bipartisanship\nIs that what you've seen the last three weeks that right now there now you have there last presidential candidate calling for incivility on the only way

phenomena\nYou think you know movies for this installment of film trivia here's some things you may not have known about the incredible hulk films six\nYears after the cancellation of the TV series in Nineteen eighty two three TV movies aired on NBC with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno refreshing their roles as David Banner and the incredible hulk returns aired in Nineteen eighty [noise] the whole teamed up with or to fight a criminal organization in Nineteen eighty nine [noise] the trial of the incredible hulk David\nBanner meeting that Murdoch a daredevil and the to battle the king pin the last incredible hulk TV movie was the death of the incredible hulk\nTrue to its name it ended with the whole falling from an airplane and reverting back to David Banner just before he dies there was an additional movie plan titled revenge of the incredible hulk but the project was cancelled due to the poor ratings are the last film\nDevelopment\nFor a theatrical feature film began in Nineteen Ninety hope wouldn't return to the silver screen until two thousand three leading up to the two thousand three films screen plays were written by nine different screenwriters and had the whole fighting such pose as a school of sharks\nA group of conduct to transform into insect men hyper man beat her aunt and the village as the leader and observing them\nIn twenty Thirteen marvel announced that mark ... places that were Norton for the Avengers rough on the signed on for six marvel films\n[noise]\n\nIt's running radio I'm hearing McNamara along with the air Carly eight six six Ninety a red eye coming up following\nThe bottom of the hour meteorologist Tom hale will join us on the latest on hurricane Michael which has been upgraded to over night and in fact in the last National Hurricane center advisory about an hour and a half ago to hurricane for\nYeah and we'll get another one a little over a Ninety minutes from now and and see where that goes but certainly\nAgain or not much is changing in terms of the fact that this is a a life threatening storm or a major hurricane on its way\nTo Florida so uh we'll we'll talk to Tom here in just a few minutes and follow the story of course throughout the morning this morning and as well or the rest of the week as a Michael continues its path or through the south east and then back out over the Atlantic\nDid you see we're a ... or some you Senator Tom cotton said that he believes Schumer's people leaked before word letter really yeah use on went on to she would show yeah instead I Believe the Schumer political operation was behind this from the very beginning Mm\n[noise] well I mean if because that would it wouldn't be a totally unexpected ride it doesn't seem out of the realm of possibilities because if you were Feinstein you you don't take it the chairman Grassley you take a to sugar party writer right and and have him deal with it right for video robot here's your forecast\nData from air force reserve and know a hurricane hunter aircraft indicate that the maximum sustained wins\nHave increased to near one hundred thirty miles an hour with higher just possible as Michael becomes a category for hurricane\nMichael extremely dangerous life threatening storm surge hurricane force winds\nAnd heavy rainfall expected as well as the potential for tornadoes to spawn from the result of this system will get nine to Thirteen feet of water inundation along the coastline\nAnd as much as twelve inches of rainfall from the system for areas just inland from where we expect Michael to make landfall and the big band that panhandle area\nAh there's been very few October storms to begin with I'm this storm is in October storm math he was an October storm and there was a a failure but a failure was a major all these are major storms but a failure was offshore and so it didn't have\nThat kind of a an effect on Florida and so right now if you're listening or if you have family and friends along that area you need to understand that that on Wednesday evening one hundred mile an hour gusts are going to comment and that's after it's come onshore [noise]\nUm tomorrow evening because we're expecting a still a landfall sometime around three to four o'clock and that means that it'll speed up a little bit before it comes to shore yeah buyouts gone gone to the north of twelve so\n... and of course ah you know it's been pointed out time and time again not just the wins in the in the destruction of property and and present danger humans but but really the flooding in the storm surge here the water that comes along with a storm like this\nAh being a potentially life threatening in fact that his life threatening and is often deadly um and and that\nIs something to be aware of it is not just the strength of the storm in terms of wins but also the water that it's going to deliver a both and storm surge and rainfall\nWell yeah you know remember the the ... in in past it used to be lightning lightning was like the number one whether killer and you know white lightning isn't the number one whether killer ... because we convinced everybody to go out and the lightning in a riot [laughter]\nOkay yeah indoors it's lightning right you know we've done a really lousy job at convincing people to use commonsense when they're on the road and they're driving and and we had over thirty people in the Carolinas drowned because\nThey decided they were going to be tougher and they knew what they were doing better than the people who are telling them to stay off the road right now and and and and so yeah a a storm surge is usually felt along the coast and let's say maybe five to ten miles inland\nWherever there is a waterway that that water from the Gulf of Mexico can move its way in [noise] and so whether you're an Appalachian cola or you are in Panama City or you're swinging around uh uh toward the coastline just south of Perry in the big band\nThat you're looking at a storm surge that's going to be easily nine feet ...\nCould be less right can be up to nine feet or even Thirteen actually the weather service has got a plotted at nine to Thirteen feet in that area\nIt for those of us who have never witnessed that first and I just described the dynamics of a storm surge especially one with the potential of a nine to twelve feet or more as you mention\nThat because you know we've seen in a recent video from the ... in Indonesia and we know so we can see that kind of force in terms of a storm surge I mean one of the dynamics of that what I describe that to us what takes place during the storm\nBecause I'm ... and here I'm looking here like it at Panama City beach for example that's you know you're right there I mean there is no\nTakes place during a storm yeah because I'm looking here I'm looking here like it at Panama City beach for example that's you know are you right there I mean there's no there's no barrier it's not one of the bays it's right there what is what is the fact how far I mean that goes in a pretty long way doesn't it\nOh yeah yeah when you go into the west bank or the East Bay um all the way up through um what they called dear point lake which is is is really an extension the northern extension of the north bay a or the grand lagoon\nThis entire area from the from the lower ... which is which is basically where the beach is uh the the bridge that goes over to the over to the beach and I'm an inland all of that water rises\nUniformly pretty much and it's kind of like turning the water on it's not like what you're seeing a smelling like Saddam it's turning the water on\nAnd watching your bathtub Phil and except in this particular case as the storm gets closer in the last uh\nHour and a half to two hours or so the bath tub spill and so\nIn the Carolinas the the I I don't know if it was the record but it started close to it ... North Carolina\nUh picked up a storm surge a that was at least ten feet [noise]\nUm there may have been a higher storm surge a further around the point I'm said that sticks out there of the Carolinas [noise] um but this water just keeps rising and and as it starts to rise three feet six feet and so forth\nYou need to be able to get to a place that's higher than the storm surge that's a really simple as it gets [noise]\nAnd this water is moving and and so the water has motion it can erode stuff um and when I say it's moving it it's it's normal current and it's moving because it's also got winds blowing it at a good speed and and so you've got a certain amount of ah\nIt's not going to be moving as fast as the wind because the surface tension the water's going to slow that body down\nBut it's still moving so I the the place that I recall and I I drove through this area a couple of times [noise] um because\nIt's just a beautiful ride in your ... your ... you know if you've done this if Germany for each point the Appalachian coal a cute little town especially when you're coming across the bridge and they're looking at Appalachian ... down to the south and East Bay on the other side [noise]\nUm then you notice is you're looking off along the water all these nice homes but they're on stilts and they're they're all stilted easily at about ten feet [noise] um well Thirteen feet would still inundate those homes wow\nYeah that's that's that you know that that puts it in perspective or anyone who's gone to a beach and seen these houses in fact we stayed in one uh in in in Texas and the and the guy was scenario all summer and we've done that many times but if you've ever been to these are areas and you've seen these houses on these skills\nUh you're right those the typically there are about ten feet high but add\nAnother three feet to that potentially and that means even on still you're going to see destruction and flooding of those homes and that\nIs very very powerful and and sobering frankly\nWell you've heard the terms high profile vehicles right okay well this is a house that's a high profile house and once you get past the stilts now you've got three feet of water going into a more solid structure and so that's going to be a lot easier to topple and destroy yeah sure\nThe center of gravity yes I Am that situation which becomes a very destructive very easily on ... and so again or the timeline here we're looking for the ice to come ashore sometime in the afternoon\nYes and and and right now it depends if it if it goes the speed that it's going right now and makes a nice even turn and doesn't increase speed when it makes the turn a little bit to the north northeast uh it wouldn't get there 'til six thirty eastern time\nUm but if it picks up some speed or even a couple of miles per hour goes from twelve to fourteen and so forth\nAnd we could anticipate the same coming in a little bit earlier than that about four o'clock and that's kind of what everybody's betting\nOn right now they're getting rain right now ... has just had the light and rain and in fact all of this is very light rain and tropical rain starts off his little find drops and then increases from there [noise] um there's\nA couple of thunderstorms that are running anywhere from Appalachian coal up the Pensacola Beach so this is the eye opener hey notice it's raining idiot real it's coming your way\nRight how far inland can we can we expect those hurricane force winds anything from Seventy five miles an hour and above a two to sustain a how far inland and and how long do you expect that to be the case\nBy let's assume that it it comes ashore and we'll just simply call it where it is right now for ... forty five miles inland ... is what you would be looking at her and forty five miles inland would make those winds go to Panama City at least and possibly a little further out\nAnd it would take those wins back over to probably not to Perry but at least to St Mark's ... National Wildlife refuge area\nWhich is to the chest south or just slightly south east to Tallahassee but now remember this this right now the location is a hundred and eighty miles to the south south west to Panama City or a hundred and Seventy miles okay southwest of Appalachia cola\nHurt a tropical storm force winds thirty nine miles an hour and more are extending out right now as we speak a hundred and Seventy five miles from\nAll right so so they're starting to feel the beginning of those thirty nine mile an hour winds at the extremities Appalachia cola and and possibly you know in the ... and an hour or two by morning for sure when the sun comes up\nThere'll be feeling the thirty nine miles forty mile an hour winds aren't even then it may still be possible for you to get inland\nReroute this Tom hale a Tom we'll talk to you at the bottom of the next hour in the following me our as well to get caught up thank you Tom for your time and we'll talk to you in just a bit

McNamara hurricane Michael has increased its strengths now is a four string right now but poetry and four categories more storms which means wins or\nOver one hundred and thirty miles an hour\nThis storm has weakened and I'm Still strengthening I mean this is the real deal is not a drill a this is going to\nAnd you do not want to be on the immediate coastline and building\nA that's a storm chaser Mike these in Panama City and that report their uh to uh west won a Westwood One the news\nYou know you watch the storm and and and look at how the storm is strengthen over well just over the last twenty four hours really um but from the weekend where ah some were predicting a category somewhere between a category one possibly a two and then by Monday morning\nUh it uh with uh with that report early Monday started to change and they were saying possibly a three now officially a category for hurricane Michael is as you mentioned Gary and everything that comes with it I mean if you look at the the the wins\nA that will be a danger to two people and take out power lines no doubt but the storm surge anywhere between nine and twelve feet or higher\nOr the water from this storm not just from the storm surge but the rainfall that will come\nIt is going to be dangerous it is going to be life threatening and there is again no other way to say it but get out of the way of this storm if you're in this area\nAh do everything you can get out of the way of this storm as it continues to move inland it will dumped more rain\nAnd we also have to keep in mind that it will spawn tornadoes coming up here to about thirty minutes we'll get back with meteorologist Tom hale\nWho's been without a been with us through uh the morning and uh and and also did some outstanding coverage on red eye radio for\nHurricane Florence and Hurricane Irma as well uh so we want to get back with him and find out the latest and and again go over some of the the threats the very real threats of the storm and the timeline as well uh most expecting the eye of hurricane Michael to hit\nThe coastline act come ashore somewhere between three and six PM on a Wednesday afternoon\nImportant to understand that the hurricane is strengthening overnight now a category for maximum sustained winds of one hundred and thirty miles an hour still moving north hasn't made the move to the uh the east yet at the twelve miles an hour but ah all it seems like it there's a it it there's\nA almost unanimous ah right ah from the meteorologists out there that the and the national Hurricane Center and it's been a consistent Cohn says this thing we've been talking about this for the last five days ... the tone has remained\nTo review it because there's only ... whether it was done for this reason or not there's only one thing that can really come of it\nAnd that is an investigation\nBy the inspector general to look over it and write a report\nOn it you would think somebody would ask the president Mr President what did the administration see in the unprotected material to give it to the inspector general who's only job is to go after corruption illegal wrongdoing and possible crimes\nBecause politically the effect of it is what it is what we said I mean 'cause I could see the scenario although we haven't been told is that you know what he's talking about it or speculating about it except us\nWe speculate on CNN spends tons of time speculating on oh what's the definition of a mob\nExactly well this is something real because we know the role of the inspector general's office ring no we also know a Michael Horowitz in and and what he would do historically he's going to write that report but effectively politically\nIt takes it out of the White House it's not Trump coming in and you know having a a a press conference saying ah we or Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying uh we found wrongdoing by these people\nKnow also\nOn the on on a much deeper ... deep state level\nWhat is it that the

for a long time the stuff that was handed over to ... Horowitz has access to the FBI\nAll day long anything he wants something the White House would really have to beat down the doors to get and I know that's ridiculous oversight committees haven't been able to get I Know that's ridiculous too but what you can get it simply by walking in and accessing it\nThat's different\nAnd that means a thorough report if that's what's going on and I suspect that is\nMe thinks things are too quiet way too quiet on both sides and I don't know why that is eight six someone's going to correct me and my grandmother and eight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers\nConducting thorough pre trip inspections allows you to catch any problems before heading out on the road post trip inspections give the shop time to react to any problems that were identified during your next pre or post trip inspection be sure to pay close attention to your vehicle service and parking breaks check for air leaks\nJeff ... worn outlined names and make sure that compressors operate improperly\nThe eagles service and parking breaks check rarely leaks\nJeff ... worn outlined names and make sure that compressor is operating properly all break components must be in place and functioning correctly\nPA truck service understands the importance of these inspections if you find any issues during your own pre or post trip inspection stopped by a location near you have your vehicle looked at by one of our expert technicians\nThis maintenance tip is the surface of the aid truck service road squad if you break down we show up called eight hundred nine two four shot\nA book with ... radio toll free at ASU expects me to be with us [noise]\nMister show live anywhere at any time on demand to catch up on Eric and Gary's topics of the day that it right on the radio show dot com and click on demand that's red eye radio show dot com\nI Try and then we know you've got plenty to manage on their own and we make in ... in how they find Jane we've gotten mama Morton parking more rain caffeine more clean salaries and Mad Men\nCan ... can service on and on them rather than twenty four seven you want and we got a pilot flying J and get them I found that out to check out our time with their salaries and a lot more\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you read the book and want to get it published page publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets they handle all aspects of the publishing process for you\nPrinting ... publicity copyright an editing got eight hundred times or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author sufficient get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author certainly should get again eight hundred buys zero one thirty six eighty nine\nBay for driving right now and you'd like to read the informative and entertaining content found and the currents September October issue of rotating magazine or if you'd like to listen that's right I said listen\nAs a voice easier on the years in mind reads the stories to you well listen up for starters the print edition preferred by Ninety percent of votes your drivers is now available for free as an F.

storm surge um that will get up to the station right\nAnd they're also optimistic that the generators or continue the ... power generator or work in the station as fortified sufficient enough to

right um but I I think our prayers need to be with all the people who are up and down that coastline that are there because they realize that\nEven though the majority of people of evacuating it out

swarm in there the governor of Florida has called out I think that's fourteen hundred a National Guards are guardsmen or guards folks a hand or the same is true 'em\nUp and down the up and down the coast three states of of basically um declared a you know a disaster urgency\nRight let let me let me just ask this big because you did or you had predicted a before the last ah advisory that showed it went to a category of for you predicted that it would go up a couple of of uh of of more miles per hour from a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty and you hit it right\nYou expected to get any stronger or do seed weakening as it gets closer to shore\nAh no I don't see a weakening is gets closer to shore in this particular case um the the water hasn't been touched so we're looking at eighty five degree average water temperature\nUm the other thing that's going on is that unlike a lot of these storms where we've got a cold front that might come in from the continental United States bringing in a little bit drier air\nThere is a cold front out there but it's it's moving through the Dallas area right now it's it's nowhere near\nThis and so [noise] uh in in terms of what we know in the United states and and then the Midwest and so forth we call it the warm sector that's the area ahead of the cold front\nMhm that warm sector is a couple of hundred miles long and they're in the heart of that warm sector they have all the fuel all the moisture and and the heat and heat in the water that's necessary so it won't it won't die down\nOr whatever it gains it will carry to shore and

Ronald just Palmdale we're joined us live a Tom or take a walk it there's a forum central or update here from the national Hurricane Center what's the first thing that they\nAre for me it goes down for Easter sustained wind speed to order do forty miles an hour while while that's not good\nIt is down increased and maximum sustained wind speed two hundred and forty miles an hour wow wow that's not good us you know that's the sustained wind speeds or in the center of the storm to a hundred and forty miles an hour now ... this this cat for category\nGoes up to a hundred and fifty seven miles now hundred and fifty six miles an hour after a hundred and fifty seven I I don't expect it to get to that point right okay but at this point all bets are off\nI'm ... and it's now it's now increase speed by one mile an hour now that's kind of significant I said it was wobbling and I\nAnd as has started to pick up speed and as it gets closer upper air wins will start to turn it off in a north northeast direction and it will speed up and we'll see that in the next advisory but probably what caught my attention even more than that was what the Tallahassee weather service National Weather service has just posted on their website to okay\nIt says unprecedented event unfolding\nFrom the national weather service office in Tallahassee we search the history database for a category ... storm and landfall in the panhandle of the Big Bend area and the map and they show this map but it's got just a giant white circle around that his blank is never happened before\nAnd so then they put their advice this is your all words you know screaming and text Las T chance to get to a safe place\nAnd get there in time\nAnd the storm will bring deadly surge and to the Florida Panhandle and the Big Bend coast and this is not comparable to anything you've ever seen before and so if you've been told to evacuate\nLeave don't say don't risk the life of your family\nRight right I ah Tom does this increase the possibility of the storm surge when you increase since we've been on the air it's gone from a hundred and twenty five miles an hour to a hundred and forty does that increase the storm surge the height of it\nYes it does and there was a small pressure fall and the pressure fall also has an effect on the ... you know the there's less pressure on the surface of the of the ocean\nHillary Clinton Cory Booker Maxine Waters and I don't know anyone on the left who's saying we cannot call from the for this and that we must stop this in fact\nAnd that would be I I don't care who who it is a Chuck Schumer or anyone else they're not stepping up and saying we need to end this I notice is enough enough is enough and ...\nThat and that that's why I wanted to bring it up here because ah as you mentioned Hillary Clinton she piled on again yesterday in a CNN interview here's part of that\nYou cannot several with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nThat's going to let it can start a dance\nSo we're not going to be civil until we get our way\nIn fact the instability right now if you look at the uh the level of it it is about them not getting their way they're not winning and and we said this I don't know it was a couple of months ago and we said All right imagine that that there's not a blue wave imagined that the Republicans maintain power in the house and the Senate\nNow the polls are you know all over the place and we're not making productions were just saying for

heard by their\nFormer candidate for president of the United states is we will not the civil\nOr and look the I I I a\nCompliment her for being honest [laughter] well well look I can I read it disagree or around it [laughter]\n\nEven on that All right you got me on that you know I I guess\nMy point is they really think this is going to work and they really believe that you they if you're a Democrat you really believe\nThat by intimidating and in in a a mob rule\nBecause you won't do it individually well did it you won't he won't do it individually in a place where there aren't TV cameras right you're not going to confront anybody you only do it when you got a group of people behind you and you find a singular source there when you get when you have when you've got the crowd power over someone\nWhich again is cowardice in in in in my book\nAnd when we saw you know the whole Ted Cruz thing and CNN was talking about the whole mob things well it's not ... it's not as if they were discussing what what the definition of mob is and but the fact is we know what they're we know what they're trying to do when they're being much more clear about what they're trying to do\nMy point is they think they're gonna win over the American people are that they think they're going to intimidate conservatives or Republicans on this I'm Sorry a failed policy is just not it's not gonna

anything like this unless somebody might have gone through hurricane Camille well ...\nAnd you mentioned bill when you mentioned you know the nearby air force bases and military personnel and you know

but it doesn't matter because in this case\nThis is what we're guessing it it give us fifty percent of the time and if we're wrong by fifty percent then forget it\nIs right exactly and and and that's again you look at to what you mentioned earlier it bears repeating here in in a well built structure a well built on new construction up to code and beyond\nThis these high winds can rip a ... roof off and will do so in a half a second\nYeah and and that debris goes flying again you know into ... in his neighborhood and he goes in and do your neighbors structure\nAnd we're we're talking about danger from several different elements of this storm and in this segment we haven't even talked about the uh any given possibility and the potential at any moment for a a tornado\nOr out of it but this is just one big tornado rhyming winds up to a hundred and forty miles an hour we just got a big torn\nRight right well let me ask you this because you know since we've been on the air it ... it was a hundred and twenty five and now it's on for a hundred and forty as it gets closer to the shoreline and I asked you this after each and every a new update\n... is there a possibility that it could even get stronger\nYes yes yes because we're we're talking about a hundred and forty miles offshore and I can say this first hand or three or four weeks ago I went down to Pensacola and I spent a couple hours floating in the eighty five degree water ... okay and so\nThis water is just prime the atmosphere the air is moist and humid and it's a rich deep moisture that stretches well up into the mid level of the steering currents\nAnd the latest meteorologist discussion that we read and breakdown shows that the serious layer above the storm has become more centric and has become more organized into the flow\nOf the jet stream that's carrying it away now if you've got a vacuum cleaner and it goes into a container that you can't evacuate the area plug the blowout ... than that vacuum cleaner eventually stops working but in this case the what we're saying here is\nThe outflow of warm air evacuating out of the top of this storm what we would call a thunder\nHere is the outflow of warm air evacuating out of the top of this storm what we would call a thunderstorm anvil okay is well organized and\nAttach to the jet stream flow at mid levels and so it's a vacuum waiting all this warm moist air which creates an increase in the flow at the bottom of the storm ...\nAs we wrap up this segment and we thank you throughout their show you've been with us and we expect to be able to talk to you or tomorrow and go over and maybe we will be looking at a you know the again all the conditions in London and what to expect\nFurther but uh give us a rundown on the timeline for Michael uh when I hit the shore all the way you know going into back into the Atlantic what what should we expect to in the coming hours and days\nOkay a first Michael is going to be coming ashore it'll be just offshore and about eight o'clock in the morning [noise]\nAh I Can't tell the exact distance because of the predicted speed is going to change and it'll increase heading into shore [noise] but let's say against the shore and about three o'clock or two o'clock in the afternoon from there twenty four hours later\nA Michael is going to be passing underneath ... or between Valdosta and making\nA and Georgia or from their um by the time we make it to tomorrow night it will be crossing the Georgia Carolina line and it will be moving its way in between savannah and Austin\nOr Augusta I'm Sorry and or at and and so it'll be basically following I Ninety five\nAnd it will be just or maybe twenty five or thirty miles inland divine Ninety five probably crossover Florence and Fayetteville as it heads up the coast\nI expected to get off the coast somewhere in the Carolinas or the edge of Virginia and then stay off coast by the time we find that friday night it's going to be offshore\nAnd it will probably be offshore of um of Boston ...\nAll right All right oh in the ... and the next three days it's going to be moving and increasing its forward speed as it moves along as it gets caught up in that jet flow that I described that's a vacuum awaiting the heat and making it possible to be a giant heat engine right now right\nA a wealth of information very valuable and get enough to actually live in saving information from meteorologist Tom\nHale and we will talk to you or tonight as we start the Thursday morning program and all our thoughts and prayers are with those folks there and and those first responders and officials there in those states and areas that will be affected by hurricane Michael thank you Tom and we'll talk to you on the next show thank you\nLook
