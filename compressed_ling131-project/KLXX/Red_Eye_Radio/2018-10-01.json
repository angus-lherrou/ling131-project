yesterday well he might have perjured himself\nAnd what the amount of drinking in high school really\nThat's that's what you've got no okay so where are you going to measure\nThe amount of drinking in high school yet so we'll we'll get to that here a little bit a couple of things that we didn't get a lot of chance to talk about the economic things last week and and so with the the announcement the day that that a new United States Canada and Mexico\nTrade deal has been done and we're stadium that because no longer is it North American it's United States Canada and Mexico ... name has been changed [laughter]\nA of a couple of economic indicators are you know the month of July was was horrible I mean it was the highest and five months for trade a deficits soybeans killed us or not being able to solve soybeans\nA Europe isn't going to be able to make up the majority of the story being lost it we have had and civilian aircraft\nGot hit a real big in in in July or last week economic indicators coming out that the you know because of the tariffs\nAre that were put into place just about a little ... about a week and a half ago that it was starting to hurt a manufacturing not only in China but the indicators in the United states you could see them going down as well you and I talked about this many times you can screen that you want to get\nThe trade imbalance down\nBut the reality is the only thing that matters\nIs economic growth that's a strong thing that the president has had right now you know that there are people in the White House like Larry Kudlow might not be Wilbur Ross might not be Peter Navarro but you know\nThe ... and they're telling him you cannot have\nThese kinds of massive tariffs with Europe the United states Mexico and China it's going to kill your economic growth if you wish to be president in twenty twenty you got to reverse course got you got to come up\nWith a ... a deal if you wish to isolate China politically you probably can survive that\nBut you cannot isolate the United states from Europe Canada and Mexico you can't do that and so uh the the fact that this deal was done so quickly at the last second\nThe administration knowing that look Congress has not going to approve just a free trade deal and you're going to go in there and say okay fine NAFTA's gone and nothing replaces is\nGoing into the going into the midterms and then uh wanting to have economic growth\nIn two thousand Nineteen and twenty twenty and you've just said ... gone massive tariffs on China won't deal with Europe\nYou've got advisors to the president saying you can't do this did you hear a Christian or was that when they say that was the one that that got everybody to come down\n... ... ... was the one right read that to them really well\nI mean the reality is is that again uh you you head into the mid term you don't have something done you're not going to get anything done uh on the Mexico deal so you're left with nothing or you get this when and claim you know you can at least claim that you're selling more dairy to Canada\nIf you can if you can call it a win which if you're selling more it's\nLess well look we so we ... we said this already that they're you know to try to to try to regulate and international\nAn international economy but the reality is you can stop it\nBut we can I Can't stop ... you can isolate yourself but you can't stop it it's impossible but when you have\nAs we talked about in Mexico\nWhere day if you look at the trade going back in ... in fact a back and forth across the border and it's a tough thing to figure out because as we said before remember forty percent of what comes in from Mexico\nAnd what a good comes in from Mexico forty percent of that good was made in the United states and the average product has crossed the border three or four times what was it four times they say it was four times and we were selling Mexico to begin with\nCapita that's their population for every dollar they ... they you know they send to us we sent them three dollars for a smaller country\nThey've a third of the ... you know close to a third of the population of the United states Canada as like what one eighth of the population the United states and we were\nUh selling them like for every dollar they set us you know for every dollar you know we bought isn't you know per capita that's per person in the United states of Canadian products per capita they were buying roughly eight to nine to ten dollars over the last couple of years\nIs what we were selling them there were smaller country you're not going to equalize the trade deficit it's impossible\nOh there's no way you'll ever get there oh\nI don't care how much more dairy you're going to sell them they'll never consume as much as the United states\nWon't even be close no so uh again we'll see what comes out of this and it probably we you know start leaking out hopefully in the ... next couple of weeks especially since now goes before Congress and we'll update on what's in there for ... here's your forecast\nWe're going to pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles where the chance of showers today\nWe'll continue to see the chance of rain along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida\nYou'll note we've already seen some snow and the higher elevations of the mountain regions of some of the northern tier states\nIdaho Montana and north and South Dakota so if you're traveling in and out of a I Ninety four in the region I twenty nine or Fifteen keep in mind this is the time of year\nThat snow can come at a moment's notice but most of what we're seeing today falling from Seattle all the way over to Detroit is going to be in the form of rain clear today in the northeast and Midwest\nTo be able to change the landscape\nBy screaming by shouting at\nYou\nAnd they will be thanks to Jeff Flake they they believe they can win they in fact one of those shouting at him and that elevator\nWas all over social media on friday this is why we go direct going direct means getting in your face which means expect more of that where ever you are if you're a lawmaker\nOh I'm Sorry if you're a Republican lawmaker they don't she they don't care about flakes hatred for the president\nThey don't care about his disdain for see I don't know if he was looking to come by his situation now he knew he wasn't going to win in November So he decided not to run\nThen he of course has been going off on the president on a number of things\nHolding up procedures and and and essentially are a number of items hostage\nSo he can get his way he was ... going to the left repeatedly\nBut see Mr flake they don't care about you or your disdain for Trump\nYou could be in agreement for that just staying with them they don't care\n'cause you're still the bad guy\nSo he goes in and he of course decides he's going to hold up to vote\nI'll I'll support it in committee\nBut I'm not going to support it on the broad vote\nThere you have the essentially the door open for others to say okay we support that as well so now you have the background check\nNot in this is not an investigation\nNo one does not know it it has a background check with a series of interviews\nIt is they've done several all ready they're gonna do another one and the scope is limited and see the liberals got on onto the president for limiting the scope well this is only about ... the accusations but it does include the Ramirez accusations not just the Ford accusations right\nSo now you have again\nIndeed and now it's going to in by the way we could have done this\nJuly thirtieth with a Ford accusations and you got what the FBI going bad and doing interviews they will not make a decision they will just hand their report to the White House the White House will send it to the Senate\nThat's how the all of this has got to work so you delayed it by\nA week or if you're the Democrats you realize this thing is going to go nowhere new start screaming perjury\nWell the house isn't going to bring up perjury charges perjury for what\nExactly what\nSpecifically and where's the proof that he lied about it\nShe the problem with the the Ford allegations\nIs that you cannot they they it's in it's impossible to prove or disprove based on what has been present well\nThey initially jumped on the fact that there were a a of friends of a Ford who said he lied when he said he lied about his drinking\nHow just how is that\nI you know he\nTalked about the fact that he drank and\nMhm and in high school he writes very still like spear right\nYou know it and you're because you would have to get\nDown and he said he never order in every city ... he never he said he never blacked out\nNow but he said he fell asleep after drinking ... which you might have you know but but how do you\n[laughter] why do you get much perjury or you you don't know if he blacked out or not so how do you get 'em on perjury for that but I don't I don't understand well\nYou know what's interesting here is if we're going to go off on that then then what about every person who wants to run for president because\nI don't know I remember a bronco bomb on the and and uh\nHim smoking pot and the story of him ... and I paid Arnold is but they're just sending the perjury of it oh no no no I Know it's like but the point is the perjury is what goes back to we want to label him as a bad guy he's a liar he's a blackout fall down drunk right\nAnd this was and then you got to push back of course on Sunday from a Lindsey Graham and and others are where it was you know look this guy's not a stumbling drunk but\nThat essentially goes back to label ... labeling him Kavanaugh as such\nFrom high school\nOr gosh ah I thought we set that standard with Bill Clinton with with ah with Rocco Palmer and others\nOh it only matters as\nIf he's if he leans right if he's a threat to the left then we're going to shout well we never they never heard of a guy drinking beer in high school really\nI I what I also love was how they move the goalpost where first on friday a and part of Saturday\nIt was he's two part is because of his reaction attacking the Democrat asked the that they that he was that it that he was too partisan right and and can't cannot serve he doesn't have he he doesn't have it takes because he's too ... well the part that turned into cars than the\nThe uh uh the report came out about ... Britain's Ginsburg back in twenty ah sixteen where she\nShe calls Trump fake her ... she's getting involved in politics you shouldn't be getting involved in politics and this is a direct accusation at you by individuals mhm he didn't take on and say the entire Democratic Party he said you well I mean ... written in in one story\nOr because there was no promise a that he could\nHe could or he could rule without bias or something to that extent and I thought are you kidding me\nYou've got Sotomayor on tape on record saying it is the job of judges and justices to legislate from the bench\nThe whole thing is this is it because if it were another let's say Elena Kagan that the president nominated now there would still be objections\nThey must be up to something that would probably review objection [laughter] if Trump he must be up to something I mean he could have nominated Merrick Garland\nOh no no no no no no we look further into Merrick Garland and he's the wrong choice\nI mean it it it would have been something some kind of objection\nBut for the media is that there's no promise that Kavanaugh would leave his biased aside\nRight and I was your what first of all that they still don't get it right but then they dropped that mhm they dropped that and became his temperament it\nBecame his anger it wasn't that it was directed that because once again is burg thing came out of ... women Ginsburg has been political all the time and then they had to drop that when they went to the next thing they moved the goalposts again which is his temperament and you know Feinstein has gone to the you know as petition\nOr the or the or the ADA too uh to change their um\n[noise] uh uh their ranking up him as a from well qualified and because of his temperament because of his scream or because of his anger mhm\nThat's where they've gone I mean and so it's just they just keep moving the goalposts blood that goes all because of the goalpost\nBecause Grassley and flake let it happen\nThey allow them to move the goalpost and here we are and it will be two weeks\nEssentially passed when it should have happened the vote\nSo that's on them\nI ... but did they have the numbers last week well they wouldn't have without flake\nYou're talking about friday as part of why they they have the number they didn't have the numbers and had no choice well apparently\nThis is where it that changed according to reports\nThis flight was able to convince the others a handful of others to get on board and support the background check\nBy the rise to the idea I mean the ab the American bar association or she's gone to them and said you know he doesn't have the temperament to serve because he got angry excuse me somebody you isn't it isn't that just beautiful\n... they they sit there and they accuse you\nThey do not not her\nBut they said without any cooperating evidence your and attempted rapist and you're a rapist oh yeah because of the you know because of the ah ah you know

Bob will be interviewed all all of agreed to fully cooperate they will answer questions asked and then I'll walk but it would give the same answers they've already given under oath and under penalty of felony perjury if their answers differ from what they previously said\nThis was something I I was talking to a family member when this was announced on friday and I said here's where it's different because you can compare forge testimony to her what she told the Washington Post\nThe Washington Post things could\nChange drastically\nBy the time she testifies and some things did change [noise]\nNow what's different is of course the Washington Post doesn't have prosecutorial power doesn't matter there's no bearing there there was no nothing that was said and this is not a criminal investigation so she wouldn't be charged with with lying to investigators here with the FBI bought\nIt is official record after she testified so the standard is the testimony given on Thursday mhm she hasn't been interviewed yet not Ramirez has not testified under oath she has been interviewed according to reports on Sunday\nSo at some point Dr Ford is going to be interviewed and our first story changes after sworn testimony then that opens the door to perjury\nAnd the report will go to the White House and then on to the Senate committee wants to the White House reviews or that report which will come later this week\nWhite House and then on to the Senate committee wants the White House reviews or that report which will come later this week and mark judge said he would fully cooperate right\nAh in in this investigation even though he did write another letter over the weekend ... uh to the Senate Judiciary committee the FBI will for a second time along with Maryland authorities as well as every prosecutors looked at this evidence admit that there is no felony federal jurisdiction here mhm\nOr after the Democratic party attempted to have cabinet arrested on Saturday [laughter] merely officials reiterated their findings by their standards are worst charges possible would carry a with them a one year statute of limitations ... additional prosecutors run record setting the evidence is insufficient\nTo merit a basis for even a search warrant\nMuch less than arrest which said that already before that you couldn't even get a ... a grand jury would even indict\nWith all the law enforcement bodies are well\nWhat all of the law enforcement bodies continue to point out as a lack of time and place and while the accuser was a hundred percent sure that something happened the accused and three witnesses or a hundred percent sure they were not witnesses to any event resembling the description right\nThe FBI or will also highly greater amounts of evidence against Dr Ford or if you're applying\nFor miss remembering her one hundred percent clear account of the mysterious Safeway second door if it only had one her complete inability to figure out how she got to work from the incident and the continued repudiation by her best friend that such a gathering occurred with her president is likely to tip the iceberg\nA therapy notes will likely be required to be turned over\n... why they were not turned over to the Senate Judiciary committee is inexplicable especially since she used that as cooperation number first telling them as a mysterious incident right that's really interesting riots doctor for its own family not one was capable of coming to work support ah why weren't they\nDo you see the ... I cannot see the Republicans delaying it any further\nI don't know that they'll have the votes um if it comes back early\nAh I'm I'm I suspect that are that\nYou will have further scrutiny you know and and it could be a Jeff Flake or anybody else but you're this comes down to the votes\nOf those people who were\nOn the fence well if they if they interviewer mirrors and anybody she wants them to interview\nAnd anybody who's come forward that will likely to\nFind a way that that part of it will likely that claim will likely take the longest\nThat likely is more involved because of the fact that it was not a part of public record Dr forge testimony is a matter of record and there's only so far I think with Dr Ford's case\nThere's only so far you can go\nAnd it would basically be the parameters would be everything that was outlined in the tougher on it but\nI mean politically ... and you know and they get her you know they do an interview with her and everybody else surrounding it which means they've expanded the investigation beyond just won some so the Democrats can't make that point\nNo they'll try to but no there's not going to be they didn't have a point to begin with but when they wheeled what's allowed when someone likes like did what he did\nWell will the Republicans at that point move on and by the way did you see the story to it got a little bit of publicity that ah the ah the weekend poll that came out of the poll that friday or Saturday and showed Holly up two points\nOn I'm I'm On tester no no no I'm In I'm In Missouri\nOh yeah well it and and we wondered about a Claire McCaskill McKay if that if that was\nThat there was going to be a last minute yes vote although\nPolitically I think it would be too little too late\nOr it could be potentially we'll see I think what happens um you know later this week but I think the hesitation\nBy those senators who backed this\n... you know the further investigation the FBI background check than I I think politically they can be damaged even if he's confirmed\nYou did the damage anyway you allow the circus to go on created more of a circus as a result of it\nAnd we know flake is not up for reelection which is why I think it it became more convenient\nThe the other the other senators likely jumped on board or you know and and by the way they uh they did so potentially at their own peril politically but flake had to be the guy because he's not up for reelection\nHe had to be the one that went forward and requested this and the president you know comes in and says okay fine by the way for what ah two weeks that are part of two weeks Democrats have been screaming at the ...\nBest occasion the story from the hill the headline White House defense FBI invest [laughter]\n\nThey got their investigation now they're screaming about [laughter] let's go to Robert in Johnstown New York Robert welcome you're on Rene Radio Welcome to the show Hi Robert\nHow are you guys doing real good thanks for calling\nI got a point but uh you asked how far this go after the interview everybody I think they should do is kinda got to see if there was any inappropriate behavior when he came to God because uh [noise] anyway\nI was ... we ... we understand your we understand your point [laughter]\nSet I mean really such a how those two women a camera in it and then all of a U.S senator in that building that's what I Want to know [noise]\nWell I it's again it was it was pretty crazy with if you if you ah were following\nThe procedures on friday morning with the committee and then you have the Democrats walking out and then they were of course outside doing their own press conference and everything else so\nYou had a ton of chaos fight I'm with you but that's it's not I guess as secure as you would think even for senators it's not as secure as most people would think it is in that situation\nAll this sort of all of the Senate is it with that particular shot at it\n[laughter] I Know that was the target yeah right right but\nThat would be that right up but that would be the target yeah I mean that would be the target that they would be looking sure\nI understand it does seem like you're you're the question in your mind is seems set up huh [laughter] I Would have to think that that that that ... that flight set it up right [laughter] right well I just did this or they they could in front of me and they made a good point and so I Do agree with them yeah and and that's where\nI was a cameraman right what yeah\nWhat are you know Lindsey Graham of all people spending a whole ...\nIt's it's it's likely was getting to it's inevitable point\nAnd and also Lindsey Graham is probably the perfect person in that case because he has crossed the aisle so many times I think a lot of people in that regard likely didn't see it coming\nAnd also didn't see it working the way it did and building momentum and while ultimately it didn't work [noise] uh in in in moving the process forward thanks to Jeff Flake it did it did I think build even more momentum for Republicans in general\nWill see that translates in November\nAt election time but ah five weeks from tomorrow by the way\nWe're also but I but I Do think that Lindsey Graham actually what what do you know the what he said I I think he I this is what he believes that oh no no I I think ... I think it was old school understands the Senate's roll into advice and consent\nAnd and as you said that's why he brought up sort of my ... I'm sure that he had problems with Kagan and sort of my yard and the things that they believed ... but that isn't the job to job isn't the job is to say\nAs a senator was never supposed to be the job of senators to say do you agree with me at every point\nA no alright well then I'm going to defame your character as a justice right\nRight and that was that was never the role to begin with it's are you confident the president gets to pick who he wants on the Supreme Court said no I don't think it was pre determined I didn't mean to imply that it was pre determined that that Lindsey Graham\nWho he wants on the Supreme Court yeah no I don't think it was pre determined I didn't mean to imply that it was pre determined that that Lindsey Graham\nIt just happens that he was yeah a pick to do that uh it just so happens that he did do it and he really was the perfect person to do that in that setting eight six six Ninety ...\nJoined the conversation using the shell row tell a hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three night radio and shoveled cello making your hardworking journeys more manageable\nAnd dance ski we have hundreds of flatbed specialized million mile drivers\nBlight because if you like driving for a local trucking company with national power than we have a long term home for you to ask you as a family of sixty locally runs lap band and specialized companies in communities all across the u._s._a. and care\nWhere you can put down your roots you on short haul or long haul [noise] want to drive our late model truck or your own try do you like to drive zone over as a team\nAbout the challenge of specialized loads and the ... family of companies is your million miles\nDavis along with consisted miles great pay and talk to your benefits sounds like what you're looking for and go to Dr ... dot com and learn more about our family trucking companies find out flat in specialized opportunity\nTo be fit your needs at ... dot com that's dry V.

was going to happen and then by the end of the day they were pulling out of the agreement and he was willing to fight it\nUh this all stems from him saying basically that he was going to take the

that statement especially if it's on true\nAnd that was the whole point is is that did he actually have the funding was it was a secured had been promised to him or any evidence that that he had access to funding to take a private [noise]\nThat started this whole thing into okay and then of course the or some other things that he has done on social media that question his ability to run the

it were true might have been able to make good on something like that or and do well if they drove stock up because he would have to buy out all of that existing stock\nThen it came out on friday which was interesting actually late\nThursday and friday morning the investigation showed that because he came up with this price of four hundred and twenty dollars per share\nAnd according to investigators he actually used for twenty four reason that everybody suspected on the Internet he was trying to impress his girlfriend according to investigators with the four twenty price and of

going to continue to attack him a even after he's confirmed as as a Supreme Court justice\nWhich are the ... and I have another question\nOr they they they made but it's not going to go anywhere and no one would let her know once you once it's done I mean I I think the focus elsewhere because once you get on the Supreme Court this whole thing about threatening to impeach him that's not going to happen\nNo no that's not at the back of the Israeli there's nothing that's going to happen Rob the the the uh the lip service will continue Mario no doubt\nRight but I but I ... I think they'll move on to other things where they can have more control\nI say what you mean yeah the the lip service that's where the attack the packets is the lip service and I think that they'll continue to attack and that\nThat but that that's the norm they call that Tuesday right do do do attack him when there is a Supreme Court decision that I don't like that where you want to go on to your going to get in on something you know it's funny because Mario or a Gary and I were talking during the break\nAbout the the question by a George Stephanopoulos asking one democratic lawmaker over the weekend or do you think judge Kavanaugh should recused himself from any case involving if he ceded any case involving a democratic lawmakers and the lawmaker comes back and says well you know so I think that would be the\nSeparate that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles where the chance of showers today will continue to see the chance of rain along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida\nYou'll note we've already seen some snow in the higher elevations of the mountain regions of some of the northern tier states\nIdaho Montana and north and South Dakota so if you're traveling in and out of a I Ninety four in the region I twenty nine or Fifteen keep in mind this is the time of year that snow can come at a moment's notice but most of what we're seeing today falling from Seattle all the way over to Detroit\nYou know they they they leak or name the people that were supposed to protect her and that's that has to drive somebody like Lindsey Graham just out of his mind as it as it did he feels he has been completely betrayed our point is you're just learning that now\nWhen I was like Jeff Flake you know I I'm I'm guessing he thought at some point he was going to make friends with a lot of people on the left remember he was doing the whole to buy a thing when he announced he wasn't gonna run you know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be\nTo buy a thing when he announced he wasn't gonna run you know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be uh the politics has gotten so ugly but\nOn friday he was being cold out and even after he decided to go to the White House basically a nasty administration request demand really [noise] but he was not going to vote on the floor the wood in committee but not on the floor for the confirmation\nThen as soon as that came out there were others basically on the left coming out and calling him out still\nDid because they if they believe in this coup by approach it has never about working with the other side or coming together the two sides coming together it's Republicans coming over to the left they don't hail Joe mansion\nTo somebody who is bipartisan\nWhile technically he is but he's not getting them he's not\nGetting any points with his own party now he doesn't get any praised for no no McCain did all the media doesn't praise them no\nMcCain did I mean after and McCain was Hitler after he ran for president for and then went away and was no longer a threat\nYou know and then and then after his passing\nHe was praised by the law but it's always someone on the right who goes left it's not the other way around\nLet's go to Peter in New York City Peter you're on red eye Radio Welcome to the show\nThan I Do very good [noise] [noise] I say for money\nAnd brought in ... I started to find out a little more about this stock to school college so\nHeard have that oh you mean expand the investigation on her show and we all upset\nAbout earth fishes so hey this is just buddies just as bad as just shoot it Vegas they didn't say nothing about it it's a well it's not you know nothing about her\nWell you know here's I guess this'll be my my point on an Ford we just found out who she was of course you're going to know more about cabinet and you're going to know about forward but it's a it's it's coming out mhm [noise]\nMhm [noise]\nWell there's a number of things that that I think as a as a part of the investigation if they're doing it the way that I Believe they would be doing it I remember it's a background check so the I guess the the the players that have been named in this so far [noise]\nMight not be what the FBI limits themselves too and and discussing it with Ford according to her attorneys as of late Sunday she it's still not yet been interview well my question is\nYou're going to start with Kavanaugh likely because it's a background check on him you start with Kavanaugh but then you're going to go into all these claims you're going to try and find separately separate from the testimony\nYou're likely going to go and and interview maybe even family members somebody who could\nBack it up because what you're trying to do the idea is to see if there's anything at all at the White House or the Senate committee should question in his background and you have to substantiate those claims so there could be a number of people here that we're not even thinking of\nThat could be interviewed during this process\nAnd that might not be good news for Dr Ford or her attorney\nScholar the guy I mean apparently are going to interview the guy from Yale who said no he he drank more ... right it's like I don't know where that goes well how can you\nApparently are going to interview the guy from Yale who said no he\nHe drank more ... right it's like I don't know where that goes well how can you quantify it and how can you prove it and that's that's the ... and plus it has nothing to do with this it's got nothing to do with the original case so it's it's it's a basically this this old classmate from Yale claiming that he perjured himself right\nSo we'll see where that goes how do you perjure yourself in the amount that you drank did you did it 'cause I didn't want to fly it right now there was there was no ... and there's no proof\n[noise]\nHe hasn't been asked about that specific incident right\nSo it's there it's it's not perjury unless you get to that point to ask him about a specific incident mhm and you of evidence that he lied but the the consumption of alcohol and what's amount you talk\nAnd your judgment other compared to somebody else's judgment thirty five years ago that would be an interesting perjury case\nRight [laughter] so I don't well because then you would need a somebody in the house to start that that case against him and that's now that's not going to have it [noise]\nAnd they'll they'll see that they will interview this\nPerson like they'll interview everyone and they'll determine whether or not anything was\nBy that person to claim can be corroborated not just with Dr Ford claims but what any other person related to the situation claims they're going to look to have those claims backed up by somebody else\nMarty in Saint Augustine Florida Marty welcome you're on radio Hi Marty\nYes I'm a first time caller era and thanks very safe in Daytona Beach but uh [noise]\nI I ... I was a Trump volunteer for an entire year out for a\nCampaign and uh I've watched every rally including the one that thrown in a way West Virginia and the stalls people outside and you got people in fact I Am convinced say you're going to see some Democrats flipped a specially the one in a [noise]\nA West Virginia and even possibly a North Dakota as well and that even includes Donnelly a senator Donnelly out of Indiana [noise] I think that's where it's going to come from a a because the pressure is so great for reelection\nAnd running some great cat were running great candidates this year are

don't know I mean if they didn't if I I don't think it's about getting Democrats I think it's about keeping the Republicans\nAh I didn't think earlier might have been they might have been able to get last week maybe some of the reports that were out you know again Tylenol had the report their source report that ended up not being right ... ah that ah you know that they had a they had the votes that's my question if they had the votes why did they call for this\nRight\nAnd well and here's my ... because right after um flake came out others jumped on board saying\nYes they want the investigation too so it tells me that they went back into neutral territory there was word that came out a belief from donnelley's camp early on that he may not be in support on friday\nThat he may not support the nomination\nI think it comes down to those four who were in that meeting\nA mansion Murkowski Collins and flick\nThink those were the ones are those are the ones to watch I wouldn't\nA mansion Murkowski Collins and flick [noise]\nI think those were the ones are those are the ones to watch I wouldn't count on Heidi Heitkamp\nOr ... in this case and I think I could have said said the

was it was there was no competition to me she said she was just totally full orbit\nOr work on education [noise] um she didn't come off as being too broad a for one thing [noise] I think\nMyself and this was a theory that I'll be briefing you and you guys talk or you can talk about it but I'm sick and she was a set off from the get go\nI mean even I think it all was just happened to be the one I said she was on the\nOn the road getting ready to run with federal were with a ... which which out or a nominee\nA guy that um [noise] it's just that she goes to march ... when she used to shoot believe a hundred per se but it was traveling All right then and there I mean\nWell I mean I I I Will tell you this I mean when when they say that she's credible as I said the reason she is incredible is because she only remembers one thing\nYou're credible because there's a consistency to your testimony that's why when anybody and I would love to do in a never happened but I Would love to interview one of these Democrats who say she was credible how\nForget about the fact that her own witnesses she has no there is no forensic evidence and know witness even the ones that she names that backs her story but the fact is what she says herself\nIf you just came in and say well look how couldn't remember this so clearly but you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this her testimony alone irrespective of the other ... evidence or lack of evidence her testimony itself was not credible mhm\nI mean that's the that's what a centrally was at play here\nWhether or not she was to be bullied because remember what they were calling for first she needs to be heard she needs to be heard she needs to be your well then she was heard well that's not enough wait a minute what if you believe her testimony to be credible [noise]\nLemons even try ended a ... point and there are there any way with it yeah it's a great point they're just ignoring the question\nAre we now are the he did say Lindsey Graham did say they're going to do an investigation on a biggest was yelling he called for an investigation and we call them or one yes yup\nLet us go to Lee in Chapel Hill North Carolina Lee welcome you're on Radio Welcome highly\nCare good show and you're listening to thanks I or so\nLeft in the stroller they call a Ford last week says she could remember\nWhere it happened\nWhat he or she said she couldn't remember what year it off or if I Love steak right\nNow she got there how she got ... got ...\nOr ... ... ... ... she had one last away\nWho cannot afford the yeah you're you're ... your doctor you and we'll have to weigh locate your lawyer\nWould have to you would have to ask the Democrats that question I Can't answer for the Democrats are as I as I said very easily\nThat's why she's not ... that that's why that alone she's not a credible witness unless there were people to bakar up when they say she was credible on like based on what and this is a legal statement is is it a personal statement against her right I don't know what she went through\nBut when you say I'm a hundred percent somebody did it where\nI don't know when I don't know how did you get there I don't know how did you get home I don't know\nAll you know as he did it but any information surrounding it and then the witnesses that you give give contradicting testimony that you have\nNot credible right\nThe ... and that's why I said\nEighteen testimony that you gave\nIts not credible right\nThe ... and that's why I said I don't uh somebody's asked the Democrats that specific question but again as you see for example George Stephanopoulos lesser question when they don't answer it just moves on it's like okay give me an answer\nYou want it look something that bothers me more than even even the the the which we call the fake news is the lack of guts of journalists to say I'm not leaving this question until you answer it\nBecause it's important that there's an expectation yep\nRemember who ... who who was it who asked to Obama the follow up question where was that was that ah that was here in uh in there was ... wasn't\nOh oh yeah yeah yeah well there's a lot of separate and says okay or one where you had a local reporter here ah from W F a a TV in Dallas but no the one you're referring to was Chris Wallace and then they came back and said well we weren't told there would be fall of ...\nThat is that if you asked a question didn't make sense to be a follow up question right that that there's actually an and this is something that has to stop this where there's this kind of bizarre oh world respect\nThat we have for politicians when I'm a journalist and I asked you a question if you don't answer it I'm going to ask the question again and then I'm going to come down right to it and say you're not answering my question\nWell I don't feel it's important oh so you won't answer my question I Want you on record that you don't have the guts to answer my question I'd phrase it that way which of course is not permitted because there is some kind of bizarre real world respect\nThat a journalist is supposed to give a politician who won't answer\nA question on an issue but as the reason that you brought them on the air with you ... don't waste my time if you're going to be come on the show had the guts to answer my question but if you're gonna be gutless go away\nI feel like I'm Talking to somebody right now and yelling at them but it is well you're yelling at all of them and and\nYou know that's but that's that they get away with it drives me up all you know because people like well Stephanopoulos and everybody else allow them to get away with\n\nThe the person especially a public servant was being interviewed does not dictate the questions\nNope no I don't know what would they do when they don't answer the question they do when when when they don't answer the question they are dictating the question\nSome well and that's just they need to it it's very clear to us but it's just stayed it we're going to help this person to build a narrative here so let's talk to them\nLet's help them build their own narrative yeah we'll forget journalism right oh\nI'm Sorry then my question\nIsn't the one I should be asking\nAll my focus should be elsewhere you're saying well okay and and the easy\nThing to do is the challenge her own owes answer as soon as she gave that non answer I would've said okay so you're saying the Democrats did\nLike\nYour your\nYour non answer their tells me that you're basically admitting the Democrats did lakes is\nYou can respond to that statement if you'd like to\n[laughter] [noise] but this is why people\nTrue or false [noise] [laughter]

C. bar investigation for allegedly not informing heard that the Senate Judiciary committee staffers were willing to travel to California to interview or well why wouldn't say\nI mean who were working for your pro bono are you\nYou're not working in the best interests of your client if you're not giving them the options that is the charge of cotton is making there which is huge because that shows why\nThat's why wouldn't your lawyers be working for the best interest of you because they're working for the best interest of someone else yeah well how much you're paying them as a client I'm not paying them oh\nSo are they actually working for you and that's where you and I talked about this Friday and cotton is making the allegation that you know they'll be facing the Washington DC bar investigation for not informing her were you asked a question why didn't they inform her if she didn't know\nWhy did and will those questions they asked by the as the uh [noise]\nWell I mean you would you you're looking to through the FBI looking to vet the process all over again right\nBecause\nIt is a serious allegation it's\nJust as much to prove her wrong as it is to prove him wrong or liar\nIt is just as much about finding out well in fact the entire purpose is finding out the true\nIt is not necessarily to find out which one is lying because one of them as lying [noise]\nIt's about finding out the truth which means it's equally as much about the person making the allegation as it is the accused [noise]\nAnd the other point is we're Feinstein and the Democrats and the media we're always trying to make the point will Feinstein did or Bessie ... one wouldn't know she didn't and as we subtle long if you listen to the show we said look there is a process\nAnd I'm Glad that Tom Cotton pointed out the process and and it and they said they do this hundreds of times you an and Dickerson he doesn't know who will not the sensitive because no justice sensitive on other issues but things that are highly secretive that we don't want people to know about\nBecause we are doing you know in in different investigations and so this has actually done where she should have\nWhen she got the letter\nShe ... the protocol is Hugo tug rationally\nYou're the ranking minority member you go to Grassley you talked about it\nAnd you say okay what group well probably what we are ... you would have said was look we can let's contact her back\nAnd tell her we can do an FBI investigation if she wishes to this to go forward we can do an FBI investigation and we can keep her name out of it for a certain period of time but we can definitely do the FBI investigation we can actually interview people on this and keep your name out of it\nAnd then we get to a certain point we might not be able to but as to the point of the investigation absolutely we can did Feinstein tell her that\nAre Feinstein's goal was to hold this as long as possible to spring it at the last possible second yep\nKnowing that they're only play here was political in nature not actual procedural other than delaying the process itself they were calling for the FBI investigation\nBut the Democrats didn't really want an FBI\nThe process itself they were calling for the FBI investigation\nBut the Democrats didn't really want an FBI investigation\nHow'd they wanted the investigation Feinstein would have made that happen right away\n\nWhich tells me one thing a couple of things they didn't buy into her story\nNumber one because if they if they felt it was fully credible and could be proven and backed up by an FBI investigation than Feinstein would have acted July thirtieth\nAnd you know something I I I agree with the Democrats they they do you shouldn't do an expanded they should do and expanded uh uh you know a background check and they should uh talked to forward and say ... or ... your lawyers are with you by the way why didn't you tell her that they were willing to come and see her yeah\nSo there's anybody paying you besides her let's let's let's expand this\nI Wonder if the Democrats really wish to be expanded [laughter]\nOkay we're done it's a week okay we're going to vote no anyway so it was [laughter] well because\nWhat they need is a new\nUnobtainable\nCoal so in this case or like you said Ramirez she needs to be hurt she needs to test\nI I Believe that will be the next thing she needs to tell her story they're gonna realize this one's going nowhere so you need to go to the next allegation that's not cooperated and here from her and you just go down the line and you see how far you can extend this now the balls and procedurally the balls and McConnell's court yes\nBut the vote is not\nKnow where the votes fall is not\nCan you stand to lose a jet flick yes if you have man I Can't who's still on the fence Donnelly is a no no if you have mentioned you can lose if you've got mansion you can lose if you've got high camp and if you've got Collins and if you've got a tester\nYou won't obsessed or he said no so if if that goes forward how many I guess the question is how many can you afford\nSo you can you can lose if you've got if mansions on you can lose like in one more\n\nBecause you've got fifty one mhm and so imagine would make fifty two you could lose than to still have fifty and have the vice president break develop right\n\nThat if they think they've got that then McConnell's not going to hold it up at all if they've got to a lot they had you know they would have done this over the weekend I I I have the feeling that they will I have a feeling\nThat if the FBI investigation comes in and you know even if it\nTalks to ... and said look nobody can cooperate her story either a a ... on this in fact we sort of get the same thing with the the witnesses there are I think at that point they will have the vote and then what do you ever hear about this together doesn't die forever it probably dies forever\nSomebody said they'll keep bringing it up now they won't they [noise]\nAt your end up getting nowhere run produce anything for it yet it it has it won't affect his decisions they can't write so they you know if it once you see it on the Supreme

would need you know and and so you could impeach not remove from the Supreme Court but that's wasting time and energy for the Democrats would know they're never going to get a you know to the the the\nNot removed from the Supreme Court but that's wasting time and energy for the Democrats no they're never going to get a you know to the the the sixty two on the on the lack of evidence that you have an any of these cases right now right because you're not going to learn anything new about this about the alleged events\nAnd we're likely to learn nothing new about the alleged events from the
