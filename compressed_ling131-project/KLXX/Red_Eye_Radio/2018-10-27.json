they say\nWe really don't make predictions what we will tell you is the issues and the events that we believe will affect the outcome of the election yeah uh I've always said for me it's very hard\nTo figure out what people are going to do on election day for me just give me and everything the pollsters may ... you know believe in some of the pollsters do get a get a dump a pretty good especially in a presidential election but they've missed major elections as they did for example in Ninety four where they weren't even\nClose over the summer on a national poll the Democrats had ten point lead over the Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nIf you're not familiar with the term nor Easter it's what a good

... where's your your taxes are higher\nAnd and and with a lower rate right so when when you see that and you see the number of of a ... and and remember ... ... ... the the the people that will be at that age\nUh aren't we're not talking the super rich were I heartland about what his view in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class\nRight and they're getting hit and they don't like it and\nTheir only recourse right now there's still a supporter of Trump or what's their records to send the message\nMy Republican congressman [noise] and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning I don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to than paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and\nEven though won't change everybody's vote it has the potential of changing [noise]\nFive percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing\nI'm just the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan and this is ...\nIs there coming on bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes [noise] some of them are coming out now I'm going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes not we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax credit we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually admitting where they're going to raise taxes which could hurt them we've also talked about the care of it [noise]\nRight and they were in the Republican Party that's one I'm yesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears along expected declined is here now the economy overall [noise]\nMay not be an end and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election [noise]\nBut it will change those small business people that are being affected [noise] a caterpillar a worse at the caterpillar story and then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are telling us write the steel in an automobile the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't a China thing [noise]\nRight it's the United states and Europe and and and Mexico that they're still in effect mhm and it's killing them it's raising their price as we said when the president came out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] All right\nAnd and ah the his you know and the only success that that he claimed\nThe the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's an unbelievable but he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost of buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing [noise] what was the story last week about Ford grumbling\nGoing to be losing a billion dollars and they believe the terrorists are going to ... that are hurting them remember every supplier at every small business that deals with Ford in the United states knows that that's coming [noise]\nOr or or feeling it already and every dealership and every dealership remember there's still terrorists really been affects that we're from China which has increased the cost from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were up ... percent by the time we got\nTo June of this year so you look at that you look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in price because of steel costs and now because of terror of cost and because of the new NAFTA [noise]\nAh and then the farmers as we had mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about like your your talk or if you're talking about a\nManufacturing people would manufacturing jobs that have technical skills\nTon of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump\nCountry and you're talking about farmers are stream Lee upset because it's not only their current profits\nBut it's the fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our personal meaning you said I Wonder if that's\nWhy he went to you know even though it was wishy washy ethanol plan I Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because right the internal polls are saying you're getting killed with the farmers right now yeah there was\nA couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt it it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa it's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry\nThe farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry are you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers\nAre and and you know in this region in this area in the state and\nIn terms of of ah of reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about\nOr they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a port trade with with Canada or any nation that they're selling to those farmers\nIf they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff or a chair of the that went into place\nOr or any of that if they have to make arrangements a lot of time around the time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this is why the farmers\nCame out a couple of weeks ago and said look thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar a handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nRight it's still not making up for what our losses All right and we're ... we're we're\n... or out of the loop and the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in right took us deck I think one of the ... was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do right\nUncertainty as a killer this is what we saw after the recession\nThe problem with bailing out all the banks are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government or during the recession or in two thousand eight to ... end of two thousand eight and into a two thousand nine\nThey there were three apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a possible high risk\nBut they didn't want to run on those banks so they put money in all of the coffers well they haven't made all the banks look\nRisky and that's the problem you create you muddy the waters\nWell when you talk about trade trade deals between nations that are set up\nUm you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up a bridge and believing you can rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that is going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty [noise] anywhere in that then your former customers are going to stick with someone else a another nation in this case ... and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nAnd our discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this election we talked a lot yesterday about how the Republicans in so many ways\nWere set up in a way that you don't see a political party in a midterm election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are in a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now for the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is\nThe old you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very were wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking a you know the their particular economy\nAnd what's gonna happen to their livelihoods so we think it's very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting this election both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the republic\nStick a I think uh analysis of of\nThe issues affecting this mid term right eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nWanting to do for your goals eight six six on widow radio

sous would review all across\nAmerica eight six six Ninety run ideas are calling I'm Jeremy ... thank you for being here this morning [noise] uh we uh we appreciate it as we're less than two weeks out from the the the mid\nElection I think this is going to be a\nA mother fascinating time in in our history to see where this goes as I said you know you and I talked about this many many times before we don't make predictions we we look at history of for example the midterms and then we look at the issues that we believe are driving it\nBecause I think it's very very hard you know you can look and you you can look at the the the polls overall and you can give some credibility to it and we find the credibility of polls actually after an election anyone I've done that before we you know we have gotten calls we don't get as many\nBecause we have spent his time especially after presidential elections looking at the polls that actually got it right\nAnd you know we but we you know talked about the the the polls even for you know because we were getting the calls after Trump's victories and they said the polls were completely off they weren't because the polls measured the popular vote not the electoral votes right and on the popular vote you had two or three that were dead on\nAs to you know Hillary winning by what roughly two points I think it was ... and and so you know there are some polls that are that are dead on so people that say the polls are always wrong that is have wrong statement to make\nAnd a lot of them the sampling that they use a you know distort the way that America feels but some polls actually get it right it's just the fact that we don't know which of the polls get it right before an election\nWe have to wait until after so we can look at the issues that are are are that are affecting at a you know another thing is and and I don't think it's going to have that much of an impact at all on this election it may\nIf if it goes on for another two years and right and this is this is where uh I I call it a\nA Trump exhaustion\nAnd I've I've just clean that weren't just popped into my head right now and and it goes back to last week when I was on vacation and I go back 'cause I've often talked about there's roughly five women that I Know\nThat ... that I abused as examples these are all women that are in executive positions either own their companies are in management up or you know a high management and the companies that the rent or own their own companies are or are in sales\nAnd I started talking about them during the whole meat to a thing about you know how they how they felt about it and I use them as examples of women that I Know that how they looked at the whole cabinet situation\nWhere you know they defended cabin on they didn't believe that the woman was always right they of course believed in due process and a presumption of innocence and they believe in the rights that are you know under the constitution and they are conservative and\nHe's satisfied I Believe his base for the most part [noise]\nHe's satisfied I Believe his base for the most part [noise]\nUh and and I think that the base has as his base has expanded because of the whole cabinet thing what's your base isn't going anywhere from space isn't going anywhere\nThey're staying with him and and the people surrounding his base are going to stay with him\nThat had stolen it those people who are okay there's some good things and bad things where am I going where you know what am I think and then boom\nAnd and so I just thought to bring up what the the the one loyal Trump supporter told me who will vote for him again and vote probably straight ticket Republican I'm I I guess you know I'm not sure but probably would vote straight ticket Republican who is just finally ... that was the limit the horse based was the limit it was because\nYou had the when you had the when it was a slam dunk win and then you made it less civil went right why why are you doing that why do you feel you need to do that when it doesn't help expand your base [noise]\nAnd so there you go but uh when it's your calls in comments coming up your your life you

the likely voter category right now for this particular mid term they're certainly not\nSo there may be something they're on social media ah that's one thing but the the problem with it is again for people that you know we're looking at at certain issues and concerns\nUh they've got to know that uh you know and and they're undecided there in the center got to know that they can you know that they can safely you know cast that vote\nAnd that's what you're trying to do it you know you don't want to you don't want to jump into something where again it's [noise]\nIt's unnecessary it's it's not a

I mean we've seen it he's a liar\nUm he's a he's ... and and by the way these lawyers that have lined up against Trump you know he can go after them as a group and include having that ... in that and and there's a there's there's nothing wrong with that or he can go after them and\nBe I I mean that that's something that's an effective tactic that you know does work\nBecause it's true he doesn't have to make anything up I mean he he doesn't have to call anybody names you call Evan Eddie a liar well that's just that's just true or that the guy brought a nothing lawsuit against you it was baseless then you've got again\nYou've got something that if you go you go there you go to the baseless lawsuit you go to the um uh you go to a a a cabin on and you say these are the people that are against me right and to me I I people say well what do you mean that's when that's a positive uh what came out of the news story that\nAnd then he lost a lawsuit against you or I Would say is it was a privilege lawsuit and he's been doing this and look what he tried to do to destroy Kavanaugh and at that point you get the political when\n[noise] right there is a social media when for young people is what you're looking for you're talking about again likely voter groups and those who are right now on the fence it if it's not a positive don't don't do it don't say it and there are plenty of positives that he can say you're wasting your time\nA you get the you know come out with Harris plan you know this is what they want to do or the or or work or or any of that you know there are promoting this but that's not going to work we're promoting this and look what's working you can demonstrate that your ideas are working\nAnd you can point out we're there's aren't going to work and that's something that is extremely rare and politics even with ah other affect the presidents of the past\nYou know you can show already a track record of getting things done\nThat are helping the economy [noise] you know and and that's it and and and by the way I Do want to um [noise]\nClarify you know we criticized the former President Obama speaking in Nevada alone on yesterday's show or when you know because he said don't forget who started this and I think he's right we shouldn't Donald Trump started this good economy we shouldn't forget who started this all\nYour right with Mr Obama or so the the the whole thing is again if you you have those positives stay on them because what is the rally [noise] what is a rally\nA rally is a a ton of positives and is not this massive group\nOf euphoric people that are ready to take action [noise] you know\nThat's that's where ... if you think about it every day on social media should be that rally between now and November I mean it's not that you have to have positives you can go after Chuck Schumer writing buddy ...\nBecause I I think it's very important to understand that in the real political world I mean you'll have the purest out there saying I'm against the negative advertising this ridiculous right of course you have to point out on nothing that you've got you've got a point out the negatives of your uh you know of your candidate you have to point out the negatives that\nThe government can't give you all the Iran right that somebody is lying to you when they tell you that they can make it a beautiful like the frustration that our last caller abs all solve crime may not really I'd write well I'll tell you that that that it then that's why I started ... I started laughing because\nYou know that isn't going to happen you have to point out and and I believe the times you have to give blood is we've gotten London passionate about it during the cabin out here and said it's unacceptable to us and we'd been blunt that you're not an American\nIf you will if you don't believe in the mindset of due process even for cabinet or you know they were the Democrats are trying to we use a lot of that in every well it's it's not a quarter or it was a political court where people\nThat are owed under threat of perjury if they lied and it was not a criminal court it was not a civil court but it was a political cord that had much\nOf the same enforcement mechanisms that are criminal court has when you testify right and and so a a a a person's reputation is at stake it was a political court and yes\nAmericans expect fairness and they expect due process Democrats said we don't believe in due process we believe it's very important to bring up the fact\nThat they don't believe in the first amendment they don't believe in the second amendment they now don't believe in due process under the law they don't believe a presumption of innocence\nIf you're not on their side the American civil liberties union has just shocked away any pretense of carrying about Americans and our civil liberties and they just made it clear during the cabin out here is we don't care\nWe point out in a very passionate ways you can see I get passionate about this\nBecause I think is very important to point out that people say well you know it's it's offensive if you tell somebody that ought to pay for it because they believe there are a patriot well know there are some standards\nOf why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American I mean what makes you an American it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you reject the basic tenants of the constitution if you reject free speech if you reject freedom of religion if you if you reject\nThe second amendment if you reject a due process under the law if you weren't checked the electoral college if you reject the Senate\nAnd and you wish to change all of it then you don't believe in America I mean I don't know what else to say it right it's it's not and people said well it's a shocking thing that you're saying\nNo it's not they're the ones that are shocking by claiming we believe in America or just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well that's what America is\nYes [noise] that's that's it from you and\nWhat they're trying to say is a well it's like when they say no we believe in free speech or no you don't it's your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately of going to jail [noise]\nThat's free speech oh no no no see your free speech is bigger than your freedom of religion as bigoted [noise]\nAnd and so no we believe me we believe in negative you know this isn't about the fact that you know that you need to that you need not to point out in a very blunt manner [laughter]\nWhat the opposition is for and what they really stand for\nAnd the fact that you you know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them\nAnd you can proudly say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing is negative to this country ... because they don't believe in the basic tenants of this country and so yeah nobody said that you have to be nice to them all the time no no our point you know when you have\nThe when the ... move onto the next when well again I Want to win\nFor calling out a a war or a Schumer or any of them to me those those are positives when you're calling out what they're promoting\nAnd saying look what I've done look at look at what we've been able to do in such a short time and what we're doing right now with the economy and look what they want to do with it and then went back to and\nOther end by the way and sometimes the name calling the the slogan name calling or the nickname calling is very effective [laughter]\nLiar Lanny I now I made that went out with I don't know\nI don't want to get a ... was uh what was it I don't know when you when ... when you thought you said sure I forgot what it was just yeah I'd I bought a use somebody's got those listed somewhere on the nicknames ... no ... we've said this though well now it's for people in office it's running it's beautiful here to hold that it's not lying to any more [laughter]\nA\nBenefit as far as we know the president no longer believes that Mr Cruz's father had involved and they get out and he had a cat [laughter] as far as we know [laughter]\nBut but look I'm we said before I thought one of the greatest um in terms of theatrics but have a point to something solid was him sitting at that table with an empty seat and an end the name\nOf of a policy on one when I was in I live right on the other that was the best oh my gosh that's brilliant any I mean that's something that works really is a big word but\nThat's something that's ... it's effective\nThey're not showing up they're not here at the party I'm trying to work with them they don't want to work with me it was a brilliant political moment yes\nBecause it's real simple it's it's brilliant and its simplicity that you're showing your demonstrating that you've invited them and they're they're not showing up that's what that represented keep in mind the former presidents didn't invite members of his own party from Capitol Hill\nTo come in and that that's not from us\nThat's from Chris Matthews he didn't like working with Democrats he didn't like because he he believed he could do a lot of it on his own by the way that was also rich we didn't pointed out of the comments he was making you know it's not about one\nMan for really just a recess appointments really [laughter] it's not about one man Mr I don't need Congress to get things past Mr recess appointment yeah down nine nothing yeah in ...

uh the the excitable turn out that you know ... you know that that's what they talking about the excited voter out there on both sides like who's the motivated excited voter who wants to go out and vote\nNot just me and it's a positive excitement it can be an an angry excitement and if so if you look at the big picture out there or the Democrats that hey Trump now could they hate him any more\nThan they did the uh the\nDay before election day in twenty sixteen my answer would be yes because they did afterwards everything that went on for the you know the next year and a half [noise]\nDo they today is the is the anger is still there to motivate\nThe Democrats [noise]\nTo get out because remember there really is ... you know you want to I've talked about this this president is up I every president just unique and every Republican president we forget [noise]\nBecause people will say nobody has ever been attacked like Donald Trump before [noise]\nWe forget that Bush was called not see the only thing is the difference between a Bush and they Donald Trump is which never fought back [noise]\nIf you fight back then the rhetoric coming back and she was going to increase ... but the rhetoric was still there was just as bad as her room\nAnd then the rhetoric coming back and she was going to increase ... but the rhetoric was still there was just as bad as her ...

called Bush and the and Romney and all those you know yeah we call them Hitler but they really weren't but Trump is ... and they just move on and then there will be the next Republican president that gets in and whether they decide to fight back whenever that is\nWhether that's a what if what if a Republican actually named Hitler runs one day what will they call it in a\n[laughter] [noise] I\nI'm trying to think if there is is there a politician in American aimed at player\nI'm I'm guessing if that's your name you you might want to change it and most have but um but this is the he's a tactic and yes from the left that's the tactic and if you engage they're going to engage even further and we see that that that's\nBut I have not in a long time I don't know the last time I saw\nI'm trying to think of the last time I saw the Republicans\nBut I have not in a long time I don't know the last time I saw\nI'm trying to think of the last time I saw the Republicans\nSo United and I really can't you know again going back to Reagan I really wasn't studying politics as much ... ah back then I became a talk show host in eighty nine\nSo uh [noise] you know I I wasn't as observant or you know as to the unity of the Republican Party at a you know at that time I Know it was greatly United but over an issue I in my lifetime I just don't remember the Republican Party being as United\nWhen they were more fractured than I'd seen in a while and become this cohesive United group of people over Kavanaugh that to me that to me still is the biggest unknown\nAs to how much it will drive Republicans to the polls if it is what I think it is\nOr what I suspect it could be if it actually is that I think the Republicans could hold the house\nIf it's not they are on hold the ... right right\nYeah um and and again all the things that we've talked about the factors of you know what's going on in the Midwest and and what's going on with the you know terrorists if that's affecting enough voters in the mid west\nOr to to turn some of those districts ah or to just keep people at home I don't even know that it will you know change your vote from right to left or keep people home

[laughter]\nAnd then you you might have a more support for it but the problem is is that no one's asking them what they what they're trying to promote as much\nBut over Thirteen Years that this has been a huge issue huge issue is that's really what kick started this whole thing over and so it's been Thirteen Years and still the Democrats the Republicans have not or the media not been able to get the Democrats to admit this is the Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit\nThat they want open borders that's what\nThey want and if they don't want it [noise] then tell

to ask [noise]\nArgue for open borders right just bluntly asked that question and if the answer is well no then what level of enforcement [noise]\nBut thinking about Thirteen Years and you haven't been able to back a Democrat a major Democrat into the corner to make them either sweat or answer that question and then keep pounding them on that question as the opposition party over and over and

know I mean you could pretty much give all of that a way if you fulfilled every\nRequest there would've been much more ... and when I was younger me winning the lottery these days it'd be like what a hassle\n[laughter] well I thought about it would change my life too much I I thought about that kind of money\nBecause after taxes uh it's going to be somewhere around what five if you want the one time payout it's somewhere around the third or thirty five percent\nYou know of the overall prices at one point six billion so pair that down to about a ... you know somewhere around five hundred and fifty sixty or or six hundred million dollars\nThat's a ton of money you're richer than Mitt Romney already\nYou went to bed poorer than than a Joe Biden and you woke up richer\nBetty you went to bed poorer than than a Joe Biden and you woke up richer [laughter]\n\nYou know the story always goes there was one of the least rich guys and the Senate\nUm and and you woke up richer than a middle and end the whole thing is is that\nYou you ... what do you do [noise]\nI've always said like those really expensive cars really expensive sports cars you know if if I were you know the billionaire and I had that kind of money but still knowing myself where in the world would I drive that car I wouldn't be able to stop and park it anywhere\nYou know what I mean I mean where are you\nGoing to take that ... I wouldn't mind taking it out to any gossip just plays at Texas anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time\nWith six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank\nIt would it would not be a bit disturbed there's yeah there's nothing I'm\nI'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] died out to be clear it would it would be a huge hassle mhm I like my life\nI don't want to change mhm and I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your life I have\nA a a friend who uh a friend or family member who ah that were at one time was working for a\nMultibillion or um [noise] and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps\nFour hours a day mhm and my family member told me that this person was the exact same way [noise] only\nBecause there's not enough time of the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule is very busy knocked out a multi billionaire although well at least one listener thinks we are um but but the point was is there so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money\nUm but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth is more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes or you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else\nTo know I couldn't trust anyone else to do that that would be the thing because you know people ... what would you do and I said ... I\nDon't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money and salt is set up some kind of foundation ... you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kinda money you're not going to be able to keep your name private [noise] so this\n... it would be it would be hard demand that you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize but\nIf you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\nYeah exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money mhm 'cause I said you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of ... what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you've got to run the foundation so this jobs gone or I don't want to run my in laws\nThere are laws about receiving the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it\nYou claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members or their tax laws if you just write them a check and you've got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nWell my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if you're going to give it all away that's what I made it still going to be a full time job is going to be a huge hassle\nI point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if you're going to give it all away that's what I mean they're going to be a fulltime job is gonna be a huge hassle\nYeah and it's like oh this life I have is gone well I liked his life five right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah All right let's lay out of it\nBut to have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older and like my like when I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life\nWell yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life I I don't you I I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things that I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so\nUm [noise] I'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be\nGreatly excited about that mhm oh yeah 'cause I don't know I Would love to you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I miss this is one dumped off it goes through your mind but it's still a thought\nOh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion because every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't\nYou and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other low we that we've ever done really I mean it's not I'd never think that\nOutside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up on the little today\nA little shocked we work in an older warehouse for those that don't yes where you're I mean we really I mean it's almost like we come to work at a warehouse outweigh the end of the show we grab our lunch pills and go home to ... that's what the feeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nOn side of being a machinist and so the mentality store to the same for it so I but the the the thought and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and\nYou know a a just and financial decisions and everything else that become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business and personal life well you've one point six billion\nAll that goes away and I always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my way because I have on one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter] right but I got all these other things but I can think about it basically keep that the thinking adept at a distance well all those challenges and problems are taken away and all of a sudden I'm going\nTo get all this money death [laughter] I was a you know I talked to one time about this uh there was a a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed a game and he sold it ah I I I don't know I'll I'll have to look it up but anyway the guys sold his game\nOr the company that you know that surrounded the game\nFor two billion dollars [noise]\nAnd his take on that was a you know roughly\nLike one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a rent just a series of tweets and he was talking about I was at this party and it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires [noise]\nAnd I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know work you know for a living and had a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd it was ... I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird are pleased to be in because I'm you know I'm not from money I'm new money but I don't fit in\nIt's a weird are pleased to be in because I'm you know I'm not from money I'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's the ears of problem\nWith being famously wealth or like the the the person in my family member works for\nYou got to put up I mean your security are surrounding you all the time yeah that's the your famously wealthy\nSo you have security detail we talked about this with the president the president has ... security detail that is is parallel to you know the types of security detail for you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean\nAnd so you're going to have to be very careful because there are people there are threats against you all the\nTime one of the that story that I read that you read that you mentioned earlier talked about the guy who won the lottery and was actually what the uh kidnapped or some of his family was kidnapped or whatever I was right when the money yeah\nHigh end in Compton for over Thirty years you know the truckers America's most rent fracking is being\nNow every week and watch me and my clothes and yes it grows as we do need the only weekly news show creative just\nJoined us for all the breaking news affecting the trucking industry along with are awesome regularly Brooklyn [noise]\nWeekly news show creative just\nJoined us for all the breaking news affecting the trucking industry along with are awesome regularly profile\nIn front of the dot com is the one you're not going to want to have them be you traveled down the highway\nSo tune in every week and watch the trucker nice gentle mind going to the front of the dot com [noise]\nSuper ...\nAnytime anywhere online assume or talk to us at ... dot com\nHere's the latest from ABC News five day Schreiber officials arresting a South Florida man in connection with a string of a parrot explosives sent a high profile Democrats and their supporters this week ABC's mark ... is in Florida where the arrest took place\nCesar ... may have been arrested here outside an auto zone in South Florida but he will stand trial twelve hundred miles away in New York the case will be handled by U.S attorneys in the southern district of New York three of the fourteen devices were found in Manhattan\nBut before say our heads north he will make his first court appearance here in federal court in Miami that will take place on Monday afternoon\n...

I didn't even care about the Halloween costume right would go out and even when we got to be ten eleven twelve Thirteen we'd call we'd go out to uh we we we'd had Fifteen blocks I'd come home with grocery bags of candy and even at that age and all I cared about was the candy\nCostume could care less yeah socializing could care less ... get me the candy yeah\nRight so of course that's my that's that's my penance now we used to take a islands now is you know the high blood sugar I've got to stay away from candy penance were being evil as we would use pillow cases [laughter] and I'm not going to report it because they were bigger\nNo [laughter] if they were stronger yeah they could hold [laughter] that's right yeah I never ... I still do I don't have those on my bed I had a hello Ken filled with candy\nYeah and they're a little ... ... I still do I do not have pills something like that I had a hello can filled with candy\nIt's much much but if that if if I didn't have that blood sugar sensitivity and I'd be going out today I'd be going out yeah every Halloween [laughter] ended up a bag huge back I'd that pillows and that's a good idea yeah it's it's it's\nI remember one time when my son but it was right at the age where it was probably one of his last years so he was like twelve or Thirteen and he and his buddies or had a couple of them are we went out you know together and then I went with them and they we we came back and we went inside because they were it was warm is really warm\nAs it often is on Halloween Night and they wanted to go and get something to drink and said yeah yeah yeah and so they set their pillow case it was pillow cases down in the driveway we're about halfway through [noise]\nAnd we came out and they were gone I mean we weren't in there really sixty seconds at the most we went in to get a bottle of water and we came out and they were gone\nAnd the boys were just so disappointed so was my son and two buddies I said All right enough of the games they said what I went in I got king size pillow case [noise] and we didn't walk we drove us and we're taking a car we're going to hit every porch light that is on until you guys tell me\n[laughter] and all those other locations that night and it was one of the greatest nights ever uh that's why we had a very much like minds didn't wait yes well I I I was just you know of wondering now can you where\nIs it is it okay to where Trump mask because remember the bottom asks are out remembered that the the George W masks route during that time well Iran resident there is a lot of them I mean you're probably still seeing Nixon mask yeah but I mean I have not seen a Trump mess\nYou know with the one mask I I don't think I ever saw a Gerald Ford mask [noise] I don't think I ever saw one has ever Reagan mess you know there was ... there was harder you know because of the big ...\nRemember that [laughter] I don't think there was a general\nMath that's discrimination or why are we discriminating against secular a very mundane or a long time ago now I Do remember the next ... everybody remembers the Nixon ... oh yeah ... Johnson [laughter] ... you know I I bet not\nHave to go watch point break and wait a minute [laughter] we didn't we didn't mention Clinton because of course there was yeah there was a cleaning house yeah yeah\nSo I'm trying to think I think there was a I don't know if there was a Hillary mask of ... not that she was president but you know of course being first lady I have seen the Trump can a T shirts or it's a pumpkin with oh yeah yeah yeah\nRight right yeah which is actually that's a pretty funny which is pretty funny but then again would you where were you aware of that out or when people get ticked off or [noise] or people that sensitive at okay ... okay that I live out of the under the humor where somebody would actually get beat up for wearing that it'll be interesting to see if\nYou hear stories of that where people refuse to give candy to a kid dressed as Trump because by the way it could go either way right yeah I mean a baby dressed as Trump Baby Trump would be kind of funny to ... uh but also could be kind of you know making fun of the president but\nWe'll see if people refused candy we're we'll\nWait for the story week [laughter] it's read I read\nEngine report is brought to you by Detroit ...
