going round filling in for a Gary and Eric and uh you got some great calls up there let's go to Jake in Quantico, Virginia yeah you're on with mark\nHijack a mark hey how ya doing real well how would you do\nA good point I just wanted to make is that what you mentioned about all the good that a commander in chief was doing with I'm moving the embassy to Jerusalem are recognizing conservative values of a nation of laws with wanting to build the wall and all that despite of his personal shortcomings\nI think a lot of times we can see with the uh the recent\nInterview that he did when he was asked a lot of those hard questions along with the first lady\nThat we can overlook a lot of these things despite his personal shortcomings of infidelity and such like that he still is fighting or these conservative values appointees Supreme Court justice is like you were a note in about a or such a Kavanaugh\nWhat is something that uh you would think would be something that would be condemnation let's say a and twenty twenty the next election if something came out\nYou know fighting against someone like Hillary Clinton in the last election with a you know her her personal server and breaking that sort of a\nSecurity law in that regard being part of the deep state having someone or was something that you see might come up to be the next battle that he's going to fight and or in the upcoming election\nWell I'll tell you what's going to be the next battle and if you heard last night we may very well I Hope we don't and people were cheering me up last night and I tend to be an optimist than we might lose the house 'cause every race stands on its own and I know some reasons here in California that I never thought what happened like Dana Rohrabacher I mentioned his name and I know him\nAnd he's in trouble because they're spending millions of dollars so if the Democrats take back the house Jake you're going to see hearing you're going to see subpoenas you want to see the attempt to impeach President Trump and Kevin off\nAnd make these next two years worse than the hearings for judge Kavanaugh that's the biggest fear I have and we got to be very careful great call thanks so much Jake\nAnd now we go to your national forecast for cobra electronics\nWe've seen the past couple of nights some freezing rain in the area of western Oklahoma northern Texas north eastern New Mexico and south eastern Colorado but that will likely not be the case today because the moisture source providing that freezing rain has moved off to the east\nAnd warmer weather for South Texas will see heavy showers today those looks down through the architects region down into New Orleans areas hard hit by hurricane Michael not necessarily going to be associated with any rain from this front but\nCould see a pop up shower or to looking for rain for the mid Atlantic today all the way up into the northeast for New York city in Boston so that leaves a good portion of the country dry today the mid west\nHe I was for him when he was named them but I've been very disappointed in him and by the way just to your point about Hillary civility that even the very I was thinking about this when you were talking the secret service they treated horribly who who who give their life up for them\nOr she is and care what what you did the\n... and then you take a look at Joe Biden you know swimming naked in the pool and and and so on and so forth these people they they're beyond the word despicable or show where he puts it a deplorable a you know it it it it's you have to be totally\nBlind or just totally ignorant of the fact that you I mean just look at the facts\nAnd look up out of this country is falling in eight years we had we had a leader previous presidents so called president take this country down and I believe you set the racial relations and in our country back fifty years\nI I don't know the number of years uh Pete but I agree with you totally I mean saying if I had a son the Trayvon Martin whenever he looked like me are always assuming that you know that and what was the guy's name in the other state I can you know hands up don't shoot all of a sudden I got to be believed\nYeah Michael Michael and he sent it back and a lot of people who voted for him because he was black think hey we're going to show we're not race and so on and yet ... heat up the you're right it's worse now\n... animosity in this country is is worse since he was president and you know the ...\nAren't as an ... was a simple fact that if you look back and look at the history of it as the events happened as everything went down\nHe walked into as I recall that can be a convenience store you push the owner around the store or the Senate and the store knocked the attendant down walked out with a budget goodies and then went on down the middle of the street looking for trouble that guy was wired for sound\nSo in some minority it only minority leader says\nThe said it was the way the police officers similar look you are right on all counts or member Obama what was that I don't know how many days before the election said we're going to fundamentally change this country I I I have a friend on radio who said measure of you sent your wife when we get married I'm going to fundamentally change you\nKnow it's it's it's insane and this was the guy we ... and the president\nAnd at the end of the day as far as the Ferguson is so that\nIt didn't take very a lot for them to ... to ... to respond and I'm I'm Talking about a ... a Eric Holder and Jesse Jackson and al Charlotte and it didn't take a ... was it a matter of a day or two and they ran to Ferguson ... to ... to ... to stir up the eight and discontent\nAs usual and you know the the amazing part of it was as they grow that Michael Brown and gone into the the officers patrol car to retrieve the officers gun just showed him\nYou know you have a glass of water\nSo so exactly but but so where so where are we as a country now the racial racial division in this country is a credible and it needs to stop\nBut they kept talking and driving home all this crap as nothing more than a dance smokescreen to make us look at the next issue that pops up and whether we like it or not the mainstream lame stream media is running this country\nAnd Pete I Want to have there are those said ... ... it triggered a point that that I think is very good on your side the left just goes from crisis to crisis to crisis right and most of it is nothing writes the the collusion with the Russians and what what do we waste two years on this stuff\nOr you name it and it's a crisis right now I don't want to get into global warming that right now although uh it became climate change always from crisis to crisis in the world is falling apart\nBut as you said you've got to president now who's not letting him get away with this in fact my love what he said the minority community he said what do you have to lose about what's been going on in the last twenty thirty forty years\nAnd you know mark ... another thing I knew he was going to win that election and I'm going to tell you why and I hope people to listen to it or will agree\nWith this I maybe maybe I Am wrong I've been known to be wrong we all\nWe're all human but the thing about it was a he ... his debate ... including Hillary smoked every one of them they smoke them off the stage basically well and there was this guy is so basic political affiliations he'd had never dealt in politics at all\nWell thanks Pete I appreciate your call very much yeah that's what I said in my opening monologue kind of the people the respect the fact that finally you got somebody who didn't care about how he came across just said what are your thoughts\nOver the top sometimes I you know I Wish he didn't say some of the things on you know right some things on Twitter that he does and I wish he would I say that I Wish you wouldn't respond to a lot of people but he ... this guy you know you get the whole package\nAnd as part of the whole package I think he's done a great job I I just listen to it gave a partial list and far better than George W. Bush\nAnd in certain ways they compete to one of my heroes Ronald Reagan because he he's done so much he doesn't even get the credit for a lot of stuff he's done and as I said\nBut he says I care what he does you know ... I'm just thinking about a on a personal ... what kind of surge and do you want someone does a great job for you or someone I you know has a great disposition ideally you want both\nBut then the guy's been terrific in office and I think he's grown into it even better than I expected um and here's someone else who agrees but I go to disagree to Marcus in broad run Virginia you're on with mark\nOh yeah [noise] yeah I'm here thank you mark and um [noise] I agree with your last caller and President Trump did not need this mess\nHe did not needed at all\nHe was already a billionaire he was an elitist he could have sat out there and and not worried about anything he worried about the people of this country and their direction this country was going\nThey were going down a socialist path they were going down we are going down the wrong path\nAnd he pulled us out he grabbed dust and pulled us out\nAnd do left is going crazy right and he is right when he goes to the uh [noise] you know campaign thing [noise] what he is talking is absolute truth look\nI grew up in\nA democratic [noise] household I mean lifelong Democrats [noise] only time my mother switched was where she voted for Nixon back in the sixties\nBecause of the anarchy that's going on and now we've got and archaea again [noise] all I can [noise] you know\nSocialism good I got kids in college that agreed with socialism\nThat's where that money is\nIn college now is the ocean wisdom is good capitalism is bad and ah we have to change the system\n[noise] hey we're not a racist country we elected Donald Trump I go to a black church I'm a white man\nYou know and really the Bible teacher the ... the [noise] the preacher and his wife and most of the other you know or or Democrats well they're all Democrats okay\nWait us wrap it up I Want to break that go ahead\nOh I was just going to say I appreciate your call just because we got to go to the break but a ... you know I even love his style ... President Trump is pretty funny says you're going to get tired of winning so much I mean who would say that yeah he goes over the top uh as we said you know there's a Twitter his tweets I should say\nBought the would ever see some right he's a character\nBut he's growing into the job and I think he's doing a great job I Can't wait for\nHim to be re elected as a ... although I shouldn't say

but we'll get you and as soon as we can I Love to go to your calls here's someone in Toronto, Canada Dave you're on with mark\nParker it'll well sorry I said I'm doing well\nOkay Mark ... question\nCan you explain to me the difference between socialism like capitalism\nSure in terms of capitalism you have a free market system that's what it's called sometimes where businesses and and you know start a business that can closed down the business they can make as much money as they possibly can and government mostly stays out of it or have\nYou know you have a like anti trust acts like short companies don't get too big and under socialism the government controls much more the means of production\nAnd then they're making the decisions for the people and and not only making the decisions for the people they control the economy\nShould there making the decisions for the people and uh and not only making decisions for the people they control the economy to a great extent\nOkay do you think most of your listeners understand what capitalism a couple of the verses socialism\nThing because I I really don't think a lot of uh I don't think many Americans really know what socialism I mean what's what's got a got what socialism is I think they they think they are for them it's all isn't so it's communism it could be ... they have no idea in detail what it is\nSo for them it's a bad word uh-huh and how do you feel you get what a\nWell I live in Toronto and I'm I live in a socialist society and there's ... there's the older ...\nThroughout the suburbs of the United states the only difference here is that we are a social where it's a socialist society like you said the government's part of what goes on\nMore than ... would be the capitalist society\nBut in terms of Medicare in terms of how is it in terms of health care\nIt's a lot better than the system you're living in I don't know how it would survive what a big scale you up through their fifty million people I'm not saying I don't know how we would do with those numbers but the numbers we have here as it does it runs well\nSo I had a question for how unless I'm wrong I've heard from many many years that many people in Canada come to the United states for health care is adding correct that's not the case\nGoes it's that's accurate that is correct but that's because of the wave in time because remember you have so many people who are on a ... foot wave entirely different versus you\nIn America where you're just you're gay and then you get to the front of the light\nYeah well women ration care when yeah when you divide up stuff when the government gets involved you find in socialist society people I think an an MRI heard a I don't know not too many months ago you may wait many months for an MRI whereas here in the free enterprise capitalism you could go the same day and get an MRI I agree I agree I mean yes you\nI don't think mistakes that comes to this my uh my uh ... a a brother is a he has a a a bachelor's degree in political science from State University in Stony Brook and he's the team he's anti Trump will gain at least\nGo in the Senate and a ... ... to ... an idiot and in the house\nWow well I gotta tell ya I got my political science degree a bachelor's degree in Brooklyn College and when I said to the professor when they're one of us that it may not have been me said what is this political science degree worth and he said that in a token will get you on the subway or got that\nBut so I don't I don't know if you're just ... uh I I Love to take the optimistic view I don't know if we're going to pick up tendencies maybe he's right maybe the blue wave will materialize in Italy I hate these colors anyway and the red wave will materialize\nTendencies pick up in the house on no one's predicting that but who knows not many people although someone one of the callers I don't know if it is today it's and I said I think it was today this morning said them he predicted Trump with women on Facebook I've written in the morning of the election I I think I see her a Trump victory\nBut I I don't necessarily see tend pickups in the house of representatives uh

give you your chance\nBut don't try to read my motivation in my mind these people I don't blame them from trying to get away from terrible conditions but there are rules and there are procedures and it's not barbaric to say if you do that we we have certain laws and rules and procedures how we handle this go your intern\nExplain our federal judge a put a stop to it it is barbaric whether you want to say those are not\nThe way they handled it not necessarily doing it in the first place separating the show around here with that but if you want to go with the separation being oriented it's the way they they ... they say half bought handled it let's just say for instance the real quick I took my kid Chuck E. cheese recently\nI had a bracelets at one two three for example that my child at a price said one two three that way when I was able to leave they verify the bracelets without it will go on my way they could have done something similar\nBut they didn't do anything she got children that you know really what\nWe are as long as it was done and a half but way\nWay to first of all it's an unelected judges so you were trying to prove something by the judges if the judge yeah he knows what's best than what's best for the country and what's best for the rest of us he never got elected to anything but leaving that aside\nThe parents shouldn't be bringing these that's what I Do what you said you would do the same thing if you're a kid no I wouldn't bring my child up if I knew they could be separated from me and and once knowing that I just wouldn't do it in the first place\nThey're the ones that are clients and give us yeah\nIt is a understood me if if you were taking those routes\nThat route and your child was was ripped from you and and and taken from the border

I don't care\nThat is one way to ... you know we\nSee I'm I'm I'm a teacher I'm a teacher and I have I think I'm pretty good ... I don't care if he has a queen's English the king's English sorry\nI I don't care about that I care about what he does you're picking them saying very twenty six times you sound like all the leaders you're putting them down because you're so much more than ... here's my point no that doesn't prove resist Charles women 'cause he says very twenty five times it proves he has a problem maybe with the language he doesn't speak as well as you do\nWhen we go by car he\nDidn't say it gets the sick ... or a gas mileage it gets very good he\nSpeaks in those ways very an awesome and great to\nSee a pattern that will be huge power sharing it\nSo now you're putting down used car salesman they provide a valuable function I ...

Bush called for a some kind of a new immigration bill to clean up some of the mess that Ted Kennedy left back in the sixties\nWe simply hadn't had any ah any immigration reform to speak up\nFrom that time and uh uh the Congress drug they're feeding on on this thing\nUntil I actually after Brock Obama had already been elected but it hadn't been inaugurated in two thousand and eight\nAt the last minute in December\nOr the lame duck Congress passed and immigration reform act and uh as it went through committee and in the weeks prior they just kept piling more and more and more garbage into this thing and George Bush signed this thing it was either eight hundred twelve hundred pages I read the entire like [noise]\nAnd I read all the documentation that goes with dieting Feinstein had slipped into their section too overweight somewhere maybe uh three quarters of the way and the bill of the problem that ... that we have now they created so many of the problems that we have now\nAnd what it is is they can't just automatically send these kids back they can send their parents back up prior to the passage of this legislation a bear in mind I live in uh the the town where we train most of the border\nOf the total people okay the federal law enforcement training centers right here where I live so I take great after ... and all this stuff\nOh in in the past prior to that two thousand and eight bill almost everybody who came to the border and made any kind of claim\nOf asylum or anything like that the border patrol agent on the ground and his supervisor and in extreme cases the supervisor above that supervisor made the determination\nWhether or not that person got the state it was never prior to two thousand and eight issue of deportation from the federal courts or any court to become involved with\nSo George Bush signed this thing or as a lame duck leaving and you may remember book George W voice was very soft on immigration I don't think he specifically like this legislation [noise]\nWhat do you feel when it was better than than what they had prior to that that circle certainly accomplished many of his goals\nAre in Iraq are so many up this country tomorrow ... so that means sad uh\nThe regulatory environment that came out of that uh all of that bill created all of this stuff that we've had since two thousand and eight so for ten years we've been dealing with this I mean the only way it's probably going to get solved this for the courts to\nRecognize that not everything years for education\nOr if they're going to have to take the spirit of the law rather than their own individual feelings into a into effect this past year olds they regardless you may be able to do that now that we have some members on screen court but I'm not even sure about that it may take another piece of legislation\nTo solve this problem Marc\n... we'll call back ah Rob I don't know if we I I Will Rob maybe during the week so I did invite him and Bill
