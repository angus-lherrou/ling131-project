big difference in other words within it is but it's\nPrior to send the FBI it's a separate branch what are you talking about\nYou know you can give it to the Democrats then you give it to the Democrats them and they and they present it and the people get to see\nThe FBI were well what'd you forget about is the FBI is not investigating anything on the ground with them I wasn't a criminal matter it was a background check they in fact what the FBI would do with it would be put into the three oh two right which then the Democrats and the Republicans would both have [noise]\nThat's how that works right that's the only role of the FBI and its entire equation\nIs to give the Senate the information you're making it sound like the FBI would then do an investigation on it no it would end

Julie sweat Nick or their representatives sincerely Chuck Grassley that letter said yesterday\nSo it was like I said in the last caller brought up was she was going to turn him over to the FBI\nAnd our and our point was ... when I'm when I said no it's like because our point is it\nYeah there there is no investigation they wouldn't be in ... they simply\nTake it and give it to the Senate Judiciary committee kind of ended up in the report we wouldn't see that the the only one senator was set the only the centers would see it and there for a goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence mhm and she wants the people who said she wants to people to see it so then the people can decide\nGive it to grasp it directly outside of the three oh two because then\nThe other members of the committee including Dianne Feinstein would get it and immediately leak\nExactly\nOr\nGenerating we waited for [laughter] just released the entire route to the to the Washington Post and let them printed completely sure\n'cause they're not political [laughter]\nOkay that's a relief well when the Washington Post and the wall Street Journal\n[noise] no I mean from you know from the west point of view and and that was the the point well no the senators or political the FBI is not well neither is the Washington Post according to the liberals\nAre and that ... let me see that ah when was that sense here in front of you were okay 'cause that letter must have been late last night to Shannon Bream a pulse uh ten forty seven PM and then I'd seen the ... uh Mollie Hemingway the last paragraph

knew nothing about the alleged sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh\nA friend of Christine of Ford told FBI investigators said she felt pressured\nBy Dr Ford's allies to revisit her initial statement\nThat she knew nothing about an alleged sexual assault by the by a teenager Brett Kavanaugh which she later updated to say she believed to but couldn't cooperate Dr forwards accounting according to people with the ... with the uh the matter for a million with the matter\nLeland Kaiser who Dr Ford has said was president the gathering\nWhere she was allegedly assaulted in the Nineteen eighties told investigators that\nMonica McClain\nA retired federal and bureau in the investigation agent and a friend of Dr forge had urged her\nTo clarify her statement like I said who needs a soap opera right\nThe other people said the statement to the FBI offers a glimpse into how Dr Ford's allies\nAre and friends\nWorking behind the scenes to lobby old classmates to bolster their versions\nOf the alleged incident\nAs we're judge Kavanaugh's judge Kavanaugh's who Supreme Court nomination be debated in the Senate on friday has denied the allegation\nOf sexual misconduct so on Thursday they after sending\nA to the White House to report on its investigation and the alleged a allegations against or the allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nThe FBI sent the White House in the Senate an additional package of information that included a text messages from ms McLean to ms Kaiser according to a person for lawyer with the matter so apparently they've updated it\nAnd they kept it up they kept it up they kept it up\nI Can't imagine\nI cannot imagine I wouldn't be able to face my friends and family if I did something so despicable just shameful just shameful if you want to talk about getting a picket going out on the steps the SCOTUS\nAs long as you're not trespassing are breaking the law I encourage that I don't care what you believe\nI don't care what you're promoting are protesting for or against and I remember it\nWas about you know we've talked about it for probably about the seven years ago when um and and you know the person that I'm Talking about and and it was really you know somebody who I considered it a casual friend ... you know ... do the more professionally and and uh\nThey were in a conversation and it was a ... a black man who was a huge fan of my show now I sort of knew her politics were more of\nThe liberal bent but she went absolutely insane we know we haven't talked since that point and she completely rejected me as a friend because in a conversation a black man said he loved our show right\nThink about that and that was really my first taste of that type of insanity\nBecause that person you refer to as you described it before\nFrom zero to you know basically right or just just a small talk with you have good to see a a thanks for stopping by that kind of thing to all of a sudden over the top rage\nRight we could not believe that somebody of color\nWould be listening to and more so the fan of the ... right\nAnd you remember when it happened and I was like I'm sort of like laughing I was like well I I Can't that this was it was so bizarre and so insane but maybe that was the early warning system\nFor me at least right on the personal level on on a personal Los in first right on our understanding that that and and that's exactly what we're we're we're facing because the rage\nAnd bitterness I Believe is probably still there today in this person yeah I have the money is just I I Can't imagine that kind of mindset\nFriends that I still a love dearly that listen to our show and I've known them since grade school and we still connect on a few times a week on Facebook but we see each other on a regular basis and everything else we love each other we tease each other about the politics\nAnd there was no way that either of us none of us\nWould ever draw that line and say well you can't be my friend\nSee each other about the politics and there was no way that either of us none of us\nWould ever draw that line and say well you can't be my friend I Can't there's no way we can have the debate just like family\nBut not for the far left not for many but I'm not far let it wasn't even what I said it was a black man like yeah we talked and of course was livid about about eight six six Ninety

not be there because his daughter's getting wedding he will be there [noise] yeah I I think that was\nIt they jumped on that story a and it it I saw it on the hill a late in the day but I\nI thought to myself ... I'm ... I'm sure they're going to make this work while your daughter's in ... wedding is certainly paramount uh I'm certain there was there was no way the Danes was going to miss that\n\nIf right now the Republican Party um and I I really have to wonder about like you know if you look at at ah at lake in his comments about the report they seem\nYou know so um yeah uh\nThat's different though when you broadened it out to the rest of Texas\nNow certainly he's done better than a a lot of the people who jumped into different races or the former ah Dallas County sheriff Lupe Lupe Valdez uh and uh you know her running against ah the the current governor\nGreg Abbott um that's you know\nAgain he's he's very well and the lead but well when you broaden it out to the state right level you've got to go wild you got to realize that you you have to pretend you're in the middle\nWell then and that's a bit of Russia's trying to do is try and do you try to picture himself any not in the middle on anything no but he he realizes that he has to lie even to get demos he can't be truthful even with Democrats in Texas\nAnd hope to get elected and that's the realization I mean the Democrats used to be that way all the time they used to we need to move to the middle we need to move to the middle we gotta move to the middle we've got to move to the middle and and then over the last ten years or so no they were basically this is who we are I guess my point\nIs that when you think about\nTen years ago right now\nWhen you think of ten years ago mhm when Obama was running for president ... and ... wasn't it right about now right around this was in October remember he\nWhere your conviction ... ... when he was at the stadium the football stadium in in in Denver and they had like ... it looked like\nHe was a you know the the the entire stage it was shut up when these Ehlers mhm and everything else where he looked like like some Greek forum yes yes mhm and ... and people going crazy and and remembering his first term Evan Thomas from\nNewsweek at the time he's God like yeah he's he's a ... you'd always post partisan he's God like heath hovers over the rest of us he's the smartest person in the world to now ten years later\nOne of the leading\nSocialist candidates in the country mhm I\nRide on Obamacare widow NATO noodle but yeah when I don't know we don't need about ...\n... they don't have the Hollywood about that that's that's a great point because here's the thing is that is deadly in inside the state it doesn't work\nEr work has no problem taking money from outside the state from the liberals you know we've been pouring money into the state but well into his coffers in order to be Ted Cruz than an effort to be Ted Cruz\nUm you know so you know he wants the liberals basically the liberals to are you guys stay outside of Texas look we've got our liberal places in in Texas now there are plenty of the districts that are blue and counties that are blue including the county we broadcast\nFrom yeah but but here's the point is though the point is not who he would have gotten in addition if he would have got Obama ... but the fact is he knew\nHe could reject Obama publicly yet so but then the signs of an ongoing ideas into his core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing to do anymore\nNo no that's that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too is that it does nothing for them\nAnd it only irritates someone who might be in the middle and tied right\nI mean it's it only works against that middle which might get you over it actually is the only thing that in this case especially that's going to get you over the top for the win but he knows by essentially denouncing and saying you know turning down the Obama endorsement\nThat it does not hurt his base\nRight they don't care right we do a\nWhole because Obama's yesterday's news well listen I mean\nI'm lawyer Lanny Davis remember he was going to be the hero you know so he was the hero of the ... the point is is not that Lanny Davis is is a rock Obama but the point is is that there is a new hero for different reasons every day on the left and by the way that you're always going to be the demon tomorrow\nThat's the way it works\nBecause you could be someone who is a fellow victim of whatever right now\nBut tomorrow you're going to be the oppressor\nThis the person standing next to you will have a new reason to weigh a victim and will need a new oppressor and it's going to be you\nHere's here's but my my uh again I could be wrong but here's my here's my gut\nThat liberal Democrats the ones that would vote for you know or they don't work here in the state of Texas right look at I Can't believe it or use the word they look at Obama and say he was a poster right\nHe really said he was going to do all this stuff and he didn't do a damn thing right he just sat up there any like being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes that we believed in that he went from God to light to pose\nDoes it end but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes that we believed in that he went from God to light to pose or in ten years or by the beginning of his his inauguration to the end\nOf his term as president of the United states that is how the modern day liberal looks at him\nThey look at him and they just say wow\nOkay I'll do eat him anymore he's not to think about this now is all Obama is not the president like him because you and I talked about is that you know by the by the time we got to them at terms that Obama would be the leader we ... predicted it but I thought there was a great chance that Obama\nBecause there was nobody else and Feinstein you know or or or pillows she's getting old and you know Schumer is to New York and so it would still be Obama that would be the leader for a while of the Democratic party is nothing anymore\nNow ... going back to the the tragic night here in Dallas\nIn July or twenty sixteen when five police officers were killed by Michael Johnson and the hours that led up to that horrific night it was just a few a couple of hours before it started I was online uh I follow the local media on Facebook\nAnd one of the local TV stations was live Facebooking the protestors because it was a protest march\nAnd was peaceful up until that point of course but\nThey were talking the the leaders of the protest associated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protest the ones who were speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because there are broadcast the six PM broadcast news broadcasts was over so they went to like Facebook so I'm watching it\nThe thing I remember the most\nIs them saying what does Obama done for us remember this was ... twenty six ten months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen waters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us nothing\nAnd I thought to myself\nYou know there because that was one of those\nAh cracks in the foundation if you will of the left although it had started happening before that for me\nBecause you had young\nAnd the two that were speaking were African American\nWas Obama done for us what does Hillary done for us\nThe left or the Democrats the Democratic party thinking they're going to get the when\nYou don't get the win just because they may agree with you at the moment [noise]\nThe protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single cause no it's no secret irrational right and it and it it always will be that's why the party has no direct\nOut that's what you get with identity politics because there is no there's no ... there is there is no general issue or goal ... goals that they actually want because when you split everybody get when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party having a particular political goal this is probably the closest you'll get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh yes at the activists are are are going in multiple directions\nParty is led by them they're going to try and it was every direction and they have no

then but you can easily apply that to what's going on today that has a claim 'cause the FBI is not doing a criminal investigation\nI hate the fact that we have to keep saying it but I feel it's necessary so if you talk about how a background check is not\nFor those that were in the military that had certain clearance a you know all too well or going into the military uh and and maybe you

... is what it says uh the uh uh a congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met with the Democratic party lawyers\nTo talk about allegations of Donald Trump\nAnd Russia collusion just weeks\nBefore the twenty sixteen election and before just before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign will get to that coming up following the the bottom of the hour Haiti NPR poll out there\nYeah and that's interesting the net National Public radio poll ... that shows that uh the Democratic enthusiasm edge for the election has evaporated it was a ten points just a one in July right and now it's down to two which is in the margin of error which means it's a dead heat\nYeah yeah I I think it's interesting because I've been questioning the methodology\nA and I mean just not that I doubt the methodology I'd just have some questions about the methodology and what's going on with the way the but there were five thirty eight dot com is putting together they're basically a composition type poll based on all the polls\nAh in all the districts\nAre for the house seats it's interesting to look at it but I'm not so sure that I buy that well as of right now it's roughly Seventy five percent chance that the Democrats take the house\nUm that may be the case I'm just asking about I have\nActual questions about the methodology and how they're applying it to this big scale I'm very smart people at five thirty eight dot com\nOr so but I Do wonder about again the polls they're using I'm a registered voters versus likely voters a demographics and everything else so you know all that is important when you're trying to put together\nWhenever they say I just want to throw right out on on on over there are quote unquote good call me and they're not but right 'cause they're just you're using the term but he's destroyed that term rabbits like\nThe uh the the whole uh the Brian Regan does a comedian my favorite I think people know that if they listen for any amount of time does a bit about the no nonsense judge\nOr what does a nonsense judge you look [laughter] I mean if Brian does it a much better than I Do it and but that's the point I mean over the years we've heard well that's a no nonsense judge\nOn a total nonsense judge okay we're breaking for ice cream [laughter]\nYou know in other news uh this from the hill dot com this was breaking news yesterday afternoon and uh yesterday evening congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official distance from the hill and John Solomon congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign ...\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ...\nThe Democratic National Committee private law firm that's the from used by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign\nTo secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the dos ca of uncorroborated\nYes who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the ... of uncorroborated man whenever we talk about the left it's always uncooperative [laughter] cooperating raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow where colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed or by testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon or\nThe other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between ... law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground about the FBI's use of news media\nIn twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump\nThe interview was one of the most productive\nWe've had and it opens up many new investigative leads one source said\nAnother said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI about FBI media contacts citing ongoing investigation\nBy the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nA new how much the FBI and Justice Department had withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the DNC fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump\nAnd so that is you know breaking news because what you have there you have you have the first person from\nThe last administration the Obama administration that worked in the FBI you have them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon test to find the tie in we were ... there's no reason\nIf you're investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the ... lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured Warren right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said\nThey talked to they talk to ... to the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why why would that be I Would that be [noise]\nSo that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure in the upcoming days or they just want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to a near record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices this from Bloomberg now\nOver ... largest producer is currently pumping about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that's just shy of the record set\nIn November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrels he said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nAre the key insights distance from blue bird their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be\nCurrently over supplied he said are the key insights distance from Bloomberg their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be vowing again to pressure from Trump\nNow we talked about this because we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil in the war yep we beat started we'd be ... every other country and somebody called up and they said well the outcome prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors in a ... there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you produce your own oil here and we become a record producer of oil\nThat's money that stays here well and and you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you had the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably\nGood at some levels well that comes from an expansion of you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling\nAnd that oil export exploration and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have a feeling I have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations\nOnly the regulations were holding us back that we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and\nBut I get I give credit here to President Trump that where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia ... excuse me\nWe're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we ... we're we're there for you all the time mhm uh and whoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia OPEC member veal pact member [laughter]\nVery good you know back in the field that member right Saudi Arabia or to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we talked about when he does extremely good things we talked about the fact that no other there was no other Democrat courses nor the Democrats there's no other Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quickly because we talked about the new NAFTA agreement and um the whatever Rob stops it could be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we had said look we said this a long time ago we said one of the reasons that we're concerned\n[laughter] and ... babies are one of the original terribly terribly [laughter] you know one one of the reasons that we were concerned who said look\nEventually when this agreement comes out it's not really going to be different\nThan the agreement that that we have now ... or ... who is leading economists for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing\nYet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like a lot like the old NAFTA mhm Mexico's only significant concession was on automobiles in parts rules requiring more production in North America highway or higher wages for workers\nAnd potential terrorists if its exports to the U. S. exceed two point six million vehicle that even though there's a cap because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance they talk to just Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower price models now assembled by Volkswagen miles to in a few other manufacturers in Mexico\nApply for duty free entry but they're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariff will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we have said and they've said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from sending at expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments are they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with\nSouth Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed by it and it's subtle along a we there's been a lot of us\nYou know industry that has suffered because of this and you wonder if you wind up basically but the same deal or things that you claim are great things that can't be enforced or as we say the auto things that hurt the economy and will hurt lower income people well then\nWas it all worthwhile and the farmer saying just days ago that you know their their bail out but they got their government money they don't want that that they really did because that's not going to you know be the end all be all for them that's not really helping to the degree that sales\nWe're spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to ... dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need\nLearn how SDF can help we encourage you to educate yourself in tears honesty and Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help to that trucker spawn dot org let's band together for a better tomorrow [noise]\nSuper Joshua I'm Seventy K.

allegations made by\nTwo of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's accuser is according to an executive summary\nAre released a in fact it was early this morning it was released actually wasn't late last night according to this report\nRequest was torn investigation into the uh current credible allegations\nAgainst justice Kavanaugh reads the report released by Chuck Grassley the summary stage that the FBI investigators reached out this is from the Washington Examiner by the way the summary states that the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses\nWith potential first hand knowledge of the allegation\nSo there it is the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses with potential first hand knowledge of the allegations we've heard from\nA the ... lawyers that will know she had twenty people she wanted him to talk to ... all they cared about was anybody that potentially had first hand knowledge not hearsay right were you there right have you back up before we go any further investigation can you back up\nBy California professor or Christine Blasey Ford who testified in front of the committee that Kavanaugh had held her down put his hand over her mouth and tried to remove her clothes at a party in Maryland while the two were in high school in eighty two those witnesses include mark judge Leyland ties are PJ a Smith\nA Timothy God debt and Christopher Garrett the FBI investigators also spoke with\nA another attorney for one of the witnesses mark judge a close friend of Kavanaugh's\nWas allegedly in the room when Ford was assaulted and Ford said it was judge jumping on her and cabinet that allowed her to get away smart cloud adding Garret who would tend to Georgetown Prep with judging cabinet and their names appeared in the Nineteen eighty two

her to touch it and she shoved him away while the two were undergraduates at Yale University relating to her marriage this allegation investigators interviewed to of some to suppose that eyewitnesses and close college friend ... as\nA third suppose that I witnessed refused to speak to investigators participation in FBI background check interviews is voluntary the supplemental background investigation was ordered by uh the White House at the request a of the a committee\nOr forty six page report is what it was and uh as we now know none of those witnesses that supposedly had and they went through all the witnesses that that potentially had first hand knowledge mhm and\nNo cooperation to get yeah right [noise] and and that's again the [noise] when when you look at it [noise]\nThere was nothing was going to change here nothing was going to change this gets back to the one thing they wanted to do all along delayed delayed July was the outside hopeless having either Kavanaugh himself or the president withdraw the nomination [noise]\nAnd that wasn't going to happen I mean the the the the louder the less got the the greater or I guess the stronger\nOr the foot hold got by the president and of course the nominee himself\nThis was a tactic by the left to delayed this nothing more nothing less put this off and hope that you can ah appeal to either one party or the other other along the way uh whether it's Grassley or flake or anybody\nThat will help you delayed even for [noise] and that's over [noise] it is over [noise]\nI don't know what the vote looked like on Saturday Night or early Sunday Morning\nBut it's going to happen\nCenter games from South Dakota said and and called a cabinet and said he\nWill be there for the vote yet he will vote or no matter what it takes for him to get back from his daughter's wedding on Saturday right now the\nVote could be anywhere from Saturday afternoon through late Saturday evening who knows him to Sunday Morning and I don't know at this point that I saw it a ... or ... after they have the official cloture vote it will be a thirty our you know a clock ticking ... up for debate it could go less than thirty hours\nOr depending or if the Democrats you know want to extend it right right now it looks like thirty hours\nOr if there's a lot of live t._v. coverage of it out which may or may not be I I don't know but on a Saturday on a cable news channel\nAll of them will be covering it lived throughout the day if that is the case during that thirty hour period uh your usual suspects who may be hopeful for twenty twenty Kamala Harris I'm Elizabeth Warren may take some time to get up and debate this or that or may have\nUnverified or false information from the Russians close to the the the the the Kremlin to destroy Donald Trump's campaign and then use that in a Pfizer warrant\nBut also you had\nThe personal lawyer for the DNC\nGive to the general counsel at the FBI documents\nYeah\nThe ... who was contacted James Baker revealed the exchange to congressional investigators during a closed door\nDeposition Wednesday he said Perkins curry lawyer Michael suspend initiated contact with him and provided documents as well as computer storage devices on Russian hacking the sources said Baker described the contact as unusual and only the only time that happened\nPerkins going was a key player in the funding of the controversial anti Trump dossier which Republicans have long suspected helped fuel the FBI investigation the DNC and Clinton campaign\nUrge from fusion GPS in April of twenty sixteen through Perkins going to dig into Trump's background fusion and turn paid X. British spy Christopher Steele there compiled a dusty a\nA memos from which were shared with the FBI and the summer of twenty Seventy or twenty sixteen and we're used to get the Pfizer warned against the Trump campaign [noise]\nWhich is a sacred Warren ... suspense contact with Baker suggest another connection between the early stages of the FBI's Russia probe and those working with the DNC and

and documents were handed from this Perkins Kobe lawyer\nOr to the former FBI official the general counsel mhm [noise] just weeks before the election and a short time before they got the Pfizer warrant while\n[noise]\nAnd finally\nDemocratic congressman or they don't ... said he's not interested [noise]\nIn an endorsement excuse me state senators me [noise] but yeah [noise] while they're calling them congressman\nOh no no no no he's not a state senator is a is a congressman oh and the district then okay okay I don't know I'm thinking I don't want to consider\nA democratic ... better work said he's not interested in endorsement from President Brock Obama is the attempt to unseat Ted Cruz in the midterms in\nIraq was speaking after a town hall in local high school when addressed and he addressed the unsettling fact that Obama has endorsed eleven Texas Democrats not including himself I don't think we're interested he's setting the endorsement\nRight I'm so grateful for him for a service is going to go down as one of the greatest presidents\nAnd yet this election is on Texas\n[noise] so there you go [noise]\nWell it it's\nAgain you can take the money from the liberals outside of the state but you you cannot bring it in because here's what he knows a couple of things [laughter] [noise] ah\nMany people especially people in the middle and and on the right who are going to vote for him anyway but the the ones in the middle who\nJust might a would be many of them turned off by Obama but beyond that\nWhen you look at Obama and his effect on the left that doesn't hurt at all [noise]\nThat'll Rourke turns them down what does that tell you about Obama and his influence on the left\nAnd the fact that it doesn't matter you can publically say I don't want us endorsement right doesn't affect anybody you know ... years they don't get a lot of the DNI likes nana settled by mail thinking about ten years ago right now oh well I think about going back I don't know go back\nYou know the post just after the Clinton years she'll go back to uh the mid term of two thousand to write and imagine someone said that then\nYou know wasn't the deity that Obama was [noise]\nBut\nStill in a situation like that back then that would have been done behind closed doors right if somebody on the left was like yeah listen uh you know we're trying to just do this on our own ah [noise] you know you know maybe the the voters won't react positively to Bill Clinton being you know as a an endorsement on on the ticket [noise]\nNow you can just open we say yeah we're ... we're over Obama\nWe don't need it [noise]\nI mean really it's it is the major major he's yesterday's news desk but it's the major blue states where he gets applauded but\nThe question is does he really happening usefulness to the party itself if you think about the the like when he uh gave us a list of in endorsements remember who is back and when that came out mhm [noise]\nKind of like his bracket used to be [laughter] but it really kind of had the same political impact as actually I could say this his rocket used to get more news\nRight well on ESPN it did not know ... and a coach or I

where there was um\nThere was this area and it was clear in this area it was all liberals they were there was part of reality t._v. show but the the based on the things that people were saying and show it was clearly a liberal and I kinda thought thought of Martha's Vineyard because it kind of had that appeal looked like that right and I thought to myself\n[noise] there isn't a conservative

not there's been enough questions raised that he should drop out now [laughter] so if you just raise just drop the allegations yeah and and dirt with wind a weight loss drugs which later on and said he goes yeah I I Know what I said what do you think about it 'cause we've been through this already yeah McCarthy\n... or if you're not a communist right exactly that's exactly\nWhat the same thing that liberals were outraged about yeah now what they endorse exactly for on the tracks use your forecast\nUnusually persistent weather pattern is going to bring some snow to be higher elevation so the Rockies rain snow into the great lakes basin possible and into the northern plains\nSevere thunderstorms possible over parts of the country today in New York will see Seventy eight degrees with some sunshine today Detroit under thirty percent chance of showers five Seventy three Chicago near sixty eight chance of thunderstorms both today and tomorrow\nTo Monday eighty one degrees and there you have the chance for thunderstorms with a pretty good difference in temperature along that front Atlanta eighty six today Dallas eighty four with a chance in front of the storms Denver around fifty three degrees overnight low going into Monday thirty six\nBut I agree with you that and to process is worth preserving other liberals who feel that way I found very very few of them for example today seven hundred law professors signed a letter to ask me to sign that I refuse I wrote a dissent\nSaying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by a liberal president who had been accused in order to acted similarly\nI don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter thing all failed a shoe on the other foot test\nSenator book oh I like it no it's just dead wrong this is all about partisanship is the opposite\nWas happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting up candidate everybody would behaving the opposite way and so it is partisanship\nAnd I think the framers of our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like hey great yeah\nI ... and that's it I mean we we talk about the process you know it's\nIt's telling that we're at this point and still at this point in fact heightened your you'll likely see the chaos heightened today and tomorrow up until the main vote on so late Saturday or early Sunday Morning whenever it happens but we're at this point but\nBefore the actual vote and what is it that that matters it's only about the vote\nI mean this is further proof that this was only about the delay delay it as long as you can in hopes an outside hope I guess that Kavanaugh would pull his own confirmation and withdraw his own confirmation and or the president would do it\nUm that wasn't going to happen or the one wants to let got loud that wasn't going to happen but this president and and now we know very clearly that certainly isn't going to happen by the nominee himself but you\nLook at this entire process and it has been distorted greatly there is no guarantee here that the cabinet we will be confirmed with the actual legitimate process of all of this and place\nWell you know when you when you hear Dershowitz or talk about you know McCarthyism ... and and what happened at that time when\nYou know you someone who accuse you of being a communist and so you'd get enraged and they say well sorry you don't have the temperament the allegation itself meant you were blacklisted right the the the fact that you lost it and anything was used an a you know against you\nAre and I thought ... which you know really when he said he said so you are but a director forty years and now you're losing control because somebody's calling you a combination of the temperament for the job so you're on your blacklisted from the the ... you know from the industry\nAnd it's something that liberals used to have in their mind and I think the important thing is\nAnd it's obvious because you and I have been having this discussion a\nBack and forth because it is the left it is you know antifa\n... we call it the supposed to be anti fascist yet what are they promote what is their actual mindset it's authoritarianism and its fascism it's a you must live the life that\nThat that we that that we wish you to live and what you see here what you see here from\nThe Democrats the mindset that they're promoting everybody that you see Michael Moore and Amy Schumer and whatever whatever Hollywood people are down there screaming and yelling about you know a Brett Brett Kavanaugh and\nBelieve the accuser that the the the defendant\nHas no rights at all the defendant is automatically guilty that is the mindset of a fascist yes that's not the mindset of somebody\nWho believes in the American constitution in the spirit of America and the spirit of due process in the spirit of the bill of rights of\nThe United states it is the mindset of a fascist well and and what we call somebody when we say they have the mindset of the fascist we back it up with specifics not just oh he talks mean therefore he's a fascist know whatever's exact words and what does he actually wish to implement when we talked about President Trump\nAnd you know they started on that uh and now they've\nMoved on and this is a very very important thing for people to understand and I think that's what this is what maybe you're not in the Republican Party it started with Trump\nAnd enough people hated Trump where it's stuck for a while\nAnd then they decided to move on from Trump and they moved on to Kavanaugh and all of a sudden the realization as we said all along it was a bogus argument completely bogus and allies against Trump to begin with but then they moved to somebody else\nWho more people look at and say when all this is somebody who really really like this is somebody who we really would like in that position as much as we don't like Trump this was a great great great great pick\nAnd then you see the same tactics used against Trump that might have been okay for some people because they despise them so much somehow hit somebody they like and then they realize oh no\nOh my God they can come after me next thing go after anybody and that's what you learn with the fascists mindsets they'll pick out an attractive target to get people you know motivated behind them even people of you know well of goodwill\nAnd all of a sudden those people have good will wake up one day and say and sometimes they wake up in a society and it's too late it's not too late here in the United states and it's not too late in this instance\nAnd it looks like that because people have fought back\nAre you now have you know created this unity in the Republican Party but remember it only goes so far because people of good will buy into it at times yes because it fits their political narrative but it is the mind what you're seeing is the mindset of a fascist\nAnd the fascist in this case is not the Republicans it is the Democrats and it's not debatable well\nI mean it's very simple when you look at the group that says they're anti fascist and their name in fact this condensed down to those condensed from those two words\nThere the group that's willing to go out and hurt people use violence against people they disagree with\n[noise] punish people for thought\nThey're the ones who are acting on it they're the ones in California who create laws that if you don't talk the way we want you to talk we can send you to jail\nIn New York we can find your business to the extent that you will be out of this\nTell me that's not fascist you you don't create the ours\nThat somebody wishes you to create we will destroy your business you wear a hat you go to a restaurant and try and have a peaceful dinner we will come on to that private property and we will shout you out\nYou think like us you behave like gosh you reject the bill of rights and if you don't we will destroy your life [noise]\n\nRepublicans are finally coming around and you're not even realizing oh my God\nThat's what that party has become and it's not the fringe this is the important thing that this is not the fringe this is the mainstream status as the Senate Judiciary committee it's the mainstream power of the republic or some of the Democratic party and\nYou have a vaccine waters who doesn't get any grief from the left for saying this is what we need you to do this is what we want you to do go out and get in their face\nEvery chance you get and all of a sudden you've got pushed back yeah [noise] right\nBecause the average American will put up or for a while until all of a sudden it's like whoa okay\nThe lines been crossed and I believe many people believe now that this line has been crossed I Hope they do mhm let me put it this way I'm not going to make the prediction that they have yet it seems that they have but my hope is that the American people have had enough\nAnd then more people will start rejecting the the mindset of fascism that is being promoted by the mainstream of the Democratic party\nAs
