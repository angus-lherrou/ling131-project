cobra electronics here's your forecast\nIs a line of showers and thunderstorms today extending from Detroit down to Texas and we're going to see this line of showers continue to progress eastward slowly today as the front becomes more pronounced will see the showers extend into Dallas in central Texas\nWith some heavy thunderstorms likely for the architects today\nAnd the same band of showers will then move up through portions of Missouri southern Illinois central Indiana and northern Ohio to include Detroit and areas of northern New York Georgia and the Carolinas will be dry today but tomorrow will pick up shower some of the system\nThe Atlantic seaboard including the mid Atlantic and northeast will remain dry today but showers expected by tomorrow and into friday look for mountain snow in the southern and Northern Rockies California and the desert southwest will be dry\nSubject to the jurisdiction of the United states meant not only know legions to anybody else end up quote mhm and senator Jacob powered who introduced the language of the claws\nOn the floor of the Senate contended that it should be interpreted in the same way as a requirement of the Eighteen sixties six civil rights act which reported citizenship to all persons born in the United states and not subject to any foreign power\nOr the Supreme\nCourt has never decided otherwise now the problem is though\nAs a ... let\nMe see I've got the ... right here in the Eighteen Ninety eight ruling that that is being brought up by many people on the last two Ninety eight rolling in the wrong Kim arc case the Supreme Court held the children of non citizens when born on us territory are us citizens by birth however\nThe parents in question in the one case were illegal immigrants meaning that the court did that they may have had it in their opinion but they did not address actually the status of children born\nTo parents in the U.S illegally they made that claim but that was not a a\nCase where they actually made you know a decision on it it was an opinion in a case but not directly involved in that case right that makes it at that point being is that the parents were here legally right the parents were here and even though they said it did cover it\nRight that makes it at that point being is that the parents were here legally right the parents were here and even though they said it did cover it\nAs he writes here he goes what the Supreme Court has held this re novel that Johnny spent\nThe Supreme Court has never held otherwise some advocates for illegal immigrants point to the Eighteen Ninety a case of the United states versus ... art but that case merely helping a child born on us soil to parents who are lawful permanent legally dominance out residents was a citizen even though they said in it\nThey expanded it out that wasn't part of the law so they actually did not create legal precedent to that point right\nNow the only other problem that the the the president would have with it and and by the way I'm I'm from the and and I I Know you are to uh I'm from of course when you understood why they pass the fourteenth amendment to begin with\nYou know after reconstruction and you know it had to end the civil rights act of eight to sixty something right right where you knew what that everybody knew it had to deal with former slaves yes\nThat that's what that's what it was all about because of the parents are of of those children being born the children being born slaves\nThe the parents in that case were not subject to any foreign jurisdiction now that the problem is because uh I\nAs I said I don't believe will see it in our in my lifetime I'd I'd be you know that's really a dump statement because who knows how long I'm going to live [laughter] but if I Lived Thirty Years' war All right let's throw out a figure\nFor Thirty years or you know I\nI I still don't think we'll we'll we'll see it because I think one of the road blocks is look the president's right I agree with the president on this uh\nBut the problem is that Congress in Nineteen fifty two added to the immigration and naturalization act they added a portion that basically\nAgreed with the way that the fourteenth amendment was written they said we agree with this this is the what immigration should be this now they didn't they didn't specify and they didn't say\nA children of illegal immigrants become citizens all they said was we agree with that\nAnd so the courts probably will look at that saying we'll since at that time\nThey didn't say we disagree with how it's been interpreted and we disagree and the law should change and you know when it comes to illegal immigrants because they didn't make the change\nThat many judges in the federal system including the Supreme Court might just say well that's up to them too they they interpret it that way or we go back to Eighteen Ninety eight and even though the the courts it's not technically legal precedent to wasn't opinion are based there that the court might just refuse to hear it\nRight\nAnd send it back down to and it may never get to the point of talk of defining what jurisdiction mean a a bench surely we will get a bench Lee someday we will get to it but it took two hundred and over two hundred and Thirty years to get to the ... was it to hell or two thousand eight\nWas it two thousand eight\nHundred thousand five two thousand I forgot about roughly two hundred and Thirty years it it ... it it took ... to finally have the Supreme Court interpret the second amendment that it was an individual right\nSo a two thousand at\nA time flies so\nThe problem and that you you have you have to word it the exact same way I just don't don't see it but\nThose are the legal challenges that you face right now that the Eighteen Ninety eight\nDon't see it but\nThose are the legal challenges that you face right now that the Eighteen Ninety eight opinion that's now law\nWhich are again\nThis is where the fourteenth amendment was not written specifically to address it as a true construction as you would look at it and say doesn't say it applies to non citizens\nAnd in order to apply in order and and you would need to that's how I Would do to say construction is doesn't say it if you want to say it differently than say it differently\nBut it but it doesn't include it but will it ever get to that point where they even\nThe Supreme Court actually hears and the whole goal is to define\nWhat subject to the jurisdiction of the fourteenth amendment actually means will we ever get to that legal place is my question Ryan again I just I don't see it in the next Thirty years I'll Try that out for example\nBut it's a way to start the ball rolling\n... yeah ... I mean I I think ah it certainly brings up the the debate and we if if the president is you know going to take action near through executive order then you're going to see it and the courts the question is will the high court\nTake a case like this and and so when you look at the question yesterday where I chuckle when I heard it I said well it's really the wrong question [laughter] it's kind of president do this with executive order will of course he can if nobody\nChallenges can do it effectively as the question and and right now he's not going to be able to do anything effectively ... the only thing is is that it was a political reaction to\nThe the care of it\nAh to well illegal immigration in general um and and the president's not wrong\nOr whether he's doing it now or any other time\nAnd the approach maybe that's the point maybe the whole point is let's see if we can if if that's the cause they know full well going to be challenged\nAnd so at that point you you decide when you know you're going to announce this now\nWe understand to the ah the political leverage that that is is created quite possibly\nOr by just the announcement of between you know now and and uh well six days from now the mid term but beyond that it is also something that I think in the current political climate\nHas to be discussed because ultimately what does it do\nNow it it\nIt brings up the discussion but I think it gets us closer to and hopefully somebody on the right will\nPosition the Democrats to finally\nSay that they're for open borders mhm\nThat's you know that's part of the I guess that's the political side of it the effect of it the legal side of it will be interesting but it won't be quick\n... this isn't going to happen or\nIt the the executive order will come out and it will be immediate an injunction immediately will be playing and mediate\nBlock from the court\nAnd then they will go into the courts and it will sit there for however long it takes to get ... and I don't go to see if it ever get right\nAnd this is something that I I\nI again I doubt it would be fast tracked\nNo because because it's it's not like the travel ban right that affected people immediately right so\nJust not jailing was what like what what what you could make the the executive branch could make the case and the travel ban that there was a [noise]\nSo it was just not dealing with what what what what you could make the the executive branch could make the case and the travel ban that there was a an immediate threat\nThat we had people traveling from certain parts of the world that had been trained and that were coming here and that\nIt was reasonable to review that process that travel process from those parts of the world\nAnd and that was something that they could make the case for in this case it's not that kind of wild many conservatives might say look at it is a it's an immediate threat or has been a threat for a long long time the problem is well get technically it has been for you know a hundred and fifty plus years\nBut it is not something that is going to be fast track because it is it is not adding any kind of knew immediate threat we understand what's going on with the hospitals on the board\nI Know that growing up on the board I Know exactly what their burden with and but this is something that that likely is not going to be fast track\nEight six six Ninety read I\nProfessional drivers your favorites\nA hundred three nine o nine five to eight that's eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight professional drivers your favorite magazines are now on stands and ready for you to read cover to cover truckers connection offers great jobs entertainment industry news each month\nJob opportunities for owner operators is easy to spot with a hot right on the cover and the best career options for truck owners inside\nFind truckers connection and job opportunities free at ... traveled centers of America we'll post and other truck stops nationwide truckers connection and job opportunities for owner operators we're searching for greener grass just Scotty\n...

right I'm going to pretend that I'm going to leave best right luckily we ... we know the Democrats are going to take the house we know okay I'm going to make this proclamation well but what is she I think is the you know I mean what's\nWhat would be the the the\nGoal was saying that I mean what do you think that is going to do that when people are gonna go man we better get out and vote for a

under sixty Barbra Streisand was\nYou will be challenged to a dual\nSo that actually existed\nAnd and so yeah we don't deal with it but we understand we don't deal with that type of rhetoric on the

to use it because they don't have anything to argue they can't argue the substance of the issues we can there's no need for us to do that\nThey need to do it because\nThey're lost ... we're not last

politicians in power right now\nTo a point at individuals in our military and the CIA\nWas there anything on CNN where they were blaming the left\nNot was there anything on Fox where they were blaming the left for no\nNo it was just quiet the story came out of people moved ... you know people moved on and\nSaid okay yeah I brought back memories we talked about it brought back memories of nine eleven and then we moved on oh good looks like they caught the guy\nBut now the charges officially filed last week\nDuring all the the uh uh\nCoverage of a you know the um\nThe mail bomb scare ...\nWere they treated the same by the media\nFor those were not biased we're not biased you can be biased by including one story\nAnd making accusations against one party on one story that shouldn't be related to them at all\nAnd you ignore the other story mhm\n\n[noise] yeah I mean it it was not that it's as if okay yeah that happens fine I'm comes with the territory as Don Lemon right might say\nAnd that's it\n\nNow it's a given that high profile individuals politicians and presidents are going to be a target of a number of attempts\nWhy the secret services in place\nOr for presidents\nAnd it's why most people even if they're not\nServing the public there the even in the private sector or they're\nThey have a high level very high level of security\nBut the point is is that the\nThe media went all over\nWhen it works for when they believe it works for their side they stay on it for a long long time\nThey will it it it is the story but it doesn't work for them politically if it's the other way around\nIf the other side is targeted\nAnd\nWe can send that reminder to a bit of what happened is ... and the attempted assassination of multiple Republicans that's something uh Don limited CNN apparently needs to be reminded us\nNow yeah I saw that yesterday that did come up yeah\nAnd ... a a\nA choice not yet I've got the you know to that one right\nWell the interesting thing is as they talk about the fact that hateful and spiteful ... rhetoric in and bring it up is what causes these murders and then that's exactly what they proceed to do\nThat I was at the ah MSNBC is a a\nContributor Steve Schmidt ... said conservative radio host like rush and Mark LeVine had blood on their hands for mass shootings at other crimes perpetrated by crazy people he also with its judicial watch news fosters judicial watch Breitbart judicial watch\nWhere does your just traditional watch\nAll they do is to get the landlord nation to the people they're not ... if you look at what judicial watch is it's about getting information specifically documents right documented evidence or information\nTo the American people\nYeah that's right documented evidence or information\nTo the American people\nOh oh forget it [laughter]\nAnd we can't have that [laughter]\nSee because\nThe point would be from the left while you are you know your your part of the problem\nSo you get people motivated I have one of the world\nWould judicial watch could get someone motivated to do something violent\nAnd any of the others by the way I for mentioned in yet within that list but ... you can't put judicial watch up in terms of controversy\nThe only controversy there is the only debate there is between the people who want the truth and the people who don't\nIn terms of why they exist\nAnd their attempt in their mission statement\nHas anybody ever debated anything that they have been able to uncover any documents\nThat they have been ... been able to ah to essentially bring to light\n[noise] well I heard that uh you know mark Levin dissected the fourteenth amendment in the constitution today so certainly he has blood on his hands rise explaining the Constitution's ...\nHow dare he [laughter] well but here's the thing by the way some people do a mark works for the same company that we do yes but the people know that but yes um but so no one at a MSNBC or CNN or any of the others are response now\nOkay no just [noise] oh you would have to come out and and then accused them of of course being we're responsible for the attempted multiple assassination on that ball field\nOn that day were Steve ... was shot\nI ... if you say one side is responsible you have to say the other side to\nRead there's no way to ignore that you can try to ignore that but you just look stupid doing\nYeah but I what I just I Love and is the fact that as they denounced the fact that heated rhetoric causes people to commit murder [laughter] they just gave it up with the wild and in sane and crazy accusations\nYeah well what Michael Moore say rabbit I wrap it up\nSo here you go that's response will wrap it up\nThat's ridiculous I so that would mean also that Twitter and Facebook and social media adults will respond to have to go the right they don't have to go\nFree speech is the problem or\nAnything that that any of these individuals who are actually responsible for this anything that they participate in\nThis response\nRight well know anybody that they disagree with\nWell I mean I'm Talking about is if this person that if a left this is saying that your you know that that ah that that talk radio and\nOh by the way the way he can just she'll watch uh he's he's labeled a former Republican strategist but he has no conservative and he's

Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nHey I'm not sure if I tell you guys all discussion but uh but well I don't understand why some people are saying or playing the birthright executive\nOrder proposed by truck or the president is stupid because ... clarify law by on it\nThe egg reporter clarify law by on my understanding why can't a president clarify what the actual author and the guy was talking about Jacob our intention in order to enforce the fact that the fourteenth amendment does not extend to bail ends or people vote for an ... well\nThe the executive order does not necessarily a clarify the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment it may attempt to but then beyond that the court challenge ultimately if it got SCOTUS it would be the job is go to ...\nTo interpret that would be the job of his lawyer it wouldn't be as job of his lawyers to defend it but the executive order in a self\nUh is an executive order to change what the immigration\nA law is right now under birthright citizenship the explanation would be in the ... that his lawyers would give where he would try to make that point of clarify in the original author would be in the actual ...\nIt would yeah and the actual court case so that could have branches interpretation of it is not the the final say now now if they ... as Gary pointed out\nThe president could write the executive order and if there were no challenge\n[laughter] that's a fantasy but if there were no challenge [laughter] than it would it would stand and it would be the law the land well yeah 'cause that was the question gardener yesterday which I thought was a stupid question\nKind of president right an executive order to change the law and and what it hold on well yeah sure he could write an executive order for a ham sandwich I've met other if nobody challenges him yeah then yeah but it's good at ... there'll be an injunction\nAnd there'll be an injunction and the law will never take place I'd like to be a brilliant move by the president and or the attorneys or or the Justice Department\nMaybe some input her idea she here to say that\nYou know less attempt to get this and at at least\nFor the president I I think it's it's a it's part of his his fight whether you want to put it just purely political or not it is part of the campaign promise from two thousand sixteen on controlling the borders and I think it's worthwhile fight and then we're with him on that on the spirit of it and thank you for the call but ultimately\nIt is going to be about uh you know getting it to the Supreme Court to have that interpretation or ... or at least the citizenship clause\nOf the fourteenth amendment if it got that far I don't know that I I don't I don't I don't believe it ever will\nBut but still though when people say well he's just he's just campaigning\nHow are you and it it will not doing this is part of the campaign promise from Saddam's not exceed that's my my yeah that was where I was you know and exactly is the fact that well he's not campaigning\nThat I could see if you're upset saying he's just campaigning for example when you've got Democrats when you when you when you got to Claire McCaskill trying to paint herself as a Republican fried just who happens to be running as a Democrat yeah now that's something you should complain about because she's not telling you the truth right when you when you have now when you got many Democrats\nTrying to portray themselves as oh we're not part of those crazy Democrats on I don't know where we're very very moderate they've gone back to that that you should be upset about when you campaign but Trump as president\nThis is what he's always campaigned on and one of the reasons one of the major reasons he's he got elected was illegal immigration\nAnd immigration issues across the board so anything that he does well he's doing it just to ah just to the campaign before the midterms well on the caravan thing\nThe only way you could make that point is if he financed the caravan which I don't believe he did and I don't think so and therefore when this is happening he's doing what he believes he should do\nI ... the caravan which I don't believe he did I I don't think so and therefore when this was happening he's doing what he believes he should do\nMight help his campaign yeah but it's what he's always right on and it'd be consisted in his opinion why would anybody your buddy be upset about it or college strictly campaigning strictly campaigning is what the Democrats are doing trying to pretend they're Republicans\nExactly that's a campaign that you should be upset about\nBecause that would be an action and I the president clearly knows this is going to be an executive order like this is going to be immediately challenged and the courts he knows that\nSo he is setting it up for the fight but it is also part of the positioning just politically well that's okay because it is not something based on nothing if it's not something based on imagery\nIt's like when the Democrats have complained before the Republicans are only doing this vote here a as a campaign thing to get us all on record so we made abstain and remember that a couple yeah right so we may abstain and just not show up and may not vote at All right\nWhen I saw her recently I said hey how many cats you have now\nAnd she said well I have four dogs is at all but\nI said what nine cats ten thirty three\nThirty three cats yes\nExtra room on the house so the cats can walk in and out to none heated room but that's where the cats can stay in congregate together well thirty three\nThree cases of cat food a day [laughter]\nI I don't know it's it's bad name\nBut the study claims that human compulsion to seek out animal companionship is one of the primary factors affecting our climate by the way the two idiots overnight told you this was coming along time ago Jeff we told you this would be next\nResearchers at the University of Sydney in Australia claimed that those one hundred and sixty three million pets heavy detrimental impact on the environment from the food they consume to the waste that they produce\nIn the U.S there are more than one hundred and sixty three million dogs and cats that consume as a significant portion of their diet animal products and therefore potentially constitute a considerable dietary footprint\nThe study proclaims ... here the energy in animal derived product consumption of these pets in the United states is evaluated for the first time as are the environmental impacts from the animal products said to them including Finkel production\nThe problem isn't just United States now or the or just not the United states though the popularity of companion animals has grown worldwide Americans are the largest pet owners in the world and I don't mean that means we're the fattest pet owners or be on more pets probably both\nBut tradition of pet ownership in the United states has considerable cost as pet ownership increases in some developing countries especially China and trends continue and pet food toward higher content and quality of meat globally pet ownership compound the environmental impacts\nHuman dietary choices it continues there's only one solution no more pets\nReducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar help an emotional benefits would considerably reduced those impact the study concludes\nOne of the things we're talking about is the fact getting rid of your dog and getting a rabbit because the dog eats meat and the rabbit ones or the or that jazz okay those yes so so what do we do with the dog\nWas supposed to put the dog down\nOr just after this dog not get another one\nI never search for a cat\nHad rescued you let's be clear\nBy the fact is you're not the only person that sets that to me this week yeah I think we all know that ah [laughter]\nAnd a mango\nAs a black cat just ... Halloween Halloween you know the funny thing is I had I had a a bug few weeks ago and I had all the autumn stuff up already I had a a a smoke detector\nActually the smoke detector I thought it was a battery but smoke detector went defective in it you know beeps after about right I'm In a row yeah the toll is part of my house\nOf course so I you know so it's like fourteen feet up but I've got this incredible ladder wide base and everything else and so I was like you know Tim Allen very excited to bring that ladder out really tested capabilities for it so I get up there and realize okay this is in my I have a ... it's\nSort of an atrium it's my music studio ... where I got a little studio there piano all that stuff so but it's way up so I get up there take it off bring it down realize it's not the battery so I order a new one on Amazon ... takes a couple of days so do I take down a ladder not leave the ladder\nOr is there for a couple of days and I keep noticing that the cat black cats keeps walking under the ladder thought that if there's a lot so I figured that out and I'm like ... should I be worried about yeah that's a good luck thoughts I never had before yeah uh but uh there's only one solution no more pets reducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets\nThat offer similar helping emotional benefits would considerably reduced these impacts\nThe other choice researchers recommend is having your pets pets go vegetarian\nNope something that's not recommended by veterinarians are animal health and welfare experts who can see that having some type of meat based protein is best for your pets yes\nParticular those for whose ancestors were carnivorous\nYeah I Can't get my cat to eat a carrot\nAnd so uh are there you go the study of the researchers say isn't designed to dissuade animal lovers from taking the maximum number of pets possible yeah it it it yeah it is it's actually a point\nBut to encourage Americans to consume less meat so that's the point are and I see what they're saying keep your pets you go vegetarian\nI'm literally thawing to stakes right now I'm going to eat all of them today\nI might have to go by a third one just because this article is making me hungry for meat\n[noise]\nMy favorite one remember and this goes back ten years ago\nI think you and I were the only been working together for a short time uh-huh remember the guy that came out\nThat said that we need to get rid of all the cities in the United states right and we need to have said he's no bigger than twenty five thousand people ... and ... what was it was it over half of the people have to go\nYeah we don't want to go to I think it was more than half we're gonna have to take them somewhere what do you do with them I don't know it's like we have to [laughter] what do you do with and who decides who goes and and I think it was one\nOf the of the probably closing in at that time seven billion people we only have like one\nRight so what do you did with the way the [laughter] what's what's your plan I there is going to be the weirdest lottery you guys ever heard of but here's how it works [laughter] are you committing suicide first right\nHey that'd be a cool psi phi movie right it's the end of the planet\nWe're down to what ten years just some kind of doomsday whatever\nClimate suicide well it wouldn't be climate base because that would just be well then you'd have Hollywood would never make a movie where let's just say you know\nThe big chunks of ice just start falling out of the sky or that the water rises in Manhattan over a period of three hours and then freezes over the period of ten minutes that would just be a stupid movie\nOr it would be called the day after tomorrow\nUm [laughter] let's not make it about climate change this time I'm not whatever\nRight but if we could whittle it down to\nOne billion people and then it would be over the ... you could make this a series\nOver the period of years you know 'cause you got ten years or Fifteen Years to figure it out\nTo got to figure out how to deplete the population [laughter]\nI don't remember [laughter] remember Star Trek didn't remember how the the\nForces are the two societies on the one planet right war with each other and instead of going to war and they simply killed people on both sides okay we're going to kill a thousand people that are you kill a thousand um they like managed war and then there was\nThey simply killed people on both sides okay we're going to kill a thousand people that are you kill a thousand um they like managed war then there was the other one remember all the people that were like plastered up against the wall hadn't they stop member that one yeah\nI don't they were they open the window and they're\nLike all these faces on the wall like writing 'cause society had grown so much and I don't know how would they ever solve that\nProblem yeah I don't remember that one of the one of the most

that there had been a guilt trip yeah well no actually I feel good about it because again it also potentially could that mean to contribute to her ability to move to Canada\nI ... do you want Barbra

political group or or you know ideology\nAnd with a thought or or maybe even a mission statement of a certain group political group or or you know ideology than you're thinking okay yeah well maybe

yesterday was the the president in an interview stating that he might put an executive order in to stop\nThe birthright citizenship and immediately a discussion on the fourteenth amendment ensued uh we heard things like the president can't change the law with an executive order or Kenny change it was also put in the question form of course she cooked mhm\nIf nobody challenges that\nBut it was ... it would it be immediately challenge and we went and we spent [noise] a a significant amount of time on the show talking about it or you know the president may do it he may not do it\nYou know we we we may never see it but if he does you're not going to see a change of immediately be it will immediately be addressed\nA by opposition groups or will be a lawsuit will be filed the right injunction within a couple of hours after the president has has has done it and I don't think that we would see a change in our lifetime for armed attracts here's your forecast\nVery very line of showers and thunderstorms today extending from Detroit down to Texas and we're going to see this line of showers continue to progress eastward slowly today as the front becomes more pronounced will see the showers extend into Dallas in central Texas\nWith some heavy thunderstorms likely for the architects today\nAnd the same band of showers will then move up through portions of Missouri southern Illinois central Indiana and northern Ohio to include Detroit and areas of northern New York Georgia and the Carolinas will be dry today but tomorrow will pick up shower some of the system\nThe Atlantic seaboard including the mid Atlantic and northeast will remain dry today but showers expected by tomorrow and into friday look for mountain snow in the southern and Northern Rockies California and the desert southwest will be dry\nGo that that we go through and this one if ah if issued will immediately be challenged and\nThat will go through that process right in the courts the department of justice will go out to defend the president's a position or the attorney general's office will go out and and look to defend it and will first of all we have to see how it's written\nIn other words mean if it if ... if if it even happens and\nIf you know the president said he would do it well he actually follow through with that remember when it came to children being separated at the border it was the president that\nBacked off mhm he realized he couldn't win that battle on immigration ... backed off we talked about it when that happened\nSo ... will he really attempt to fight this or was it just rhetoric we will find out\n... and ...\nAnd again the language of the executive order will be will be everything\nUm but it will not that it will not go without a ... it will not go without um\nAn an immediate challenge in fact that's going to happen right now you'll have an injunction\nBook if he if he puts it out at nine AM there'll be an injunction by that afternoon my by a federal judge yes\nWe're starting to court and I don't believe here's here's the other thing to this it could take years just to get through the federal court system before it ever got to the Supreme Court mhm it if it went anywhere even if it went through the entire system because they're not going to fast track it it's not like\nThe emergency that the executive branch was saying you need to fast track this because it's about national security right now and terrorists coming in\nBecause it would have essentially a move like this effectively would would um be about future lives\nFuture children right\nIt would not be retroactive and then nature would not have any kind of grandfather ring or a powers or so at that point then you look at\nThe uh the\nInterpretation\nA of that of that plus the a ... of that part of the fourteenth amendment\nWhat I'm what I Would be interested to see is is if\nThe citizenship clause\nIn the executive order as the basis of it because\nIf that because the language the language will mean everything in the court battles obviously so even if it doesn't get to the Supreme Court there's gonna be a very\nA good discussion about it over the years yeah we should just ah just to the president because of a past attempts to put through an executive order mhm don't have the first draft of the first executive order be get rid of the fourteenth amendment [laughter] right\nOkay yeah no beat it eat these specific for the part that well in that\nBut you're going to have to I think you're going to also have to have a\nYeah no beat it eat these specific for the part that well in that but you're going to have to I I think you're going to also have to have a essentially\nAn interpretation of that citizenship clause\nOf the fourteenth amendment as a as the basis of it in the actual language of the executive order because if you do that what you're doing at that point is bringing up the discussion again that doesn't mean that the Supreme Court is even got to hear it\nBut it it if it's the basis of\nThen it gets straight to the point in the courts\nRegardless of how it goes in the courts\nAnd I think that would be bad would certainly be my advice is she right so you have to you have to tailor the executive order\nA in a particular way and then when you go to court ... you've got to be very specific I think that\nYou know 'cause you're not try to change the fourteenth amendment no what do you want your ... ... what you're trying to do is you're focusing in right on only mhm a birthright citizenship\nAnd whether that was contained you need to make the focus as narrow as possible to get to that particular point that you believe is a weak interpretation\nA of it ... and still is going to be a tough sell to get through ... right\nSo and I don't know if the you know again this is something that we\nDragged to the courts for years because I don't I don't believe there's any chance of it being fast tracked\nAnd and so this could sit in the course for years yeah the travel ban had an immediate threat right a attached to assess the basis I don't know if he wants I don't know if the president with with\nAll the other things that are going out an immigration that he can without question when and probably when sooner especially ... when it comes to legislation if they're able to keep the house right\nOr that he would ah that he would want to spend the time and energy on that she might I mean they might I don't I don't I don't you give support\n... remember when we had the influx of children coming across the border uh years ago a few years ago and you had people in the inner cities that were saying ah listen I mean Obama was president but they were outraged that we were spending so much public money\nOn on deporting those children and housing those children remember we are putting them in schools that was during the summer months we're putting them in schools and in other locations\nAnd so there were people that were outraged over that basically they're point was uh the government shouldn't be spending money on on on children who eventually will be sent back home\nIt should be spent on my children\nWho are American citizens\nAs they are the same support for the current president in terms of okay wait a minute let's have the discussion I on on I'm I'm ... alien parents giving birth to citizens and the U.S I'm I'm trying to think if I've seen a\nPoll on American citizens and what they what they think about that recently I'm sure we will and the next week\nUnless again it's just something he said in an interview\nA could have been something he blurted out and then the news cycle changes today and we never hear about it again and I looked at the question yesterday I was on the golf course when I saw it burst out laughing was couldn't couldn't truck right an executive order that becomes law no we can't and I burst out laughing I said well of course he can\nIf nobody challenges that nobody challenges an executive order but somebody's going to challenge it\nIf nobody challenges it nobody challenges an executive works but somebody's going to challenge it\nAnd it's like well that's not the point to the point is if you're going to discuss it let's talk about the original intent of the of the fourteenth amendment as we spend a lotta time doing ah earlier on the show\nSo what do you dress it up or a you know for Halloween today is a a a guy who's sleeping [laughter] wow we've got the same ... yeah [laughter]\nThat's embarrassing we're gonna have a lot of rain here in our area I don't know if we're going to have many adults careers at the door I don't think we are so very quickly there I was working at our affiliate W are OK\nMhm in Nineteen Ninety four ... doing a show or my producer tells me doing an afternoon show my producer tells me there is a ghost that's known to be in the studio and I say come on\nAnd says true was it was witnessed on air and I said and kidding around I said if there is a ghost in the studio make your presence known right now and when I did\nAll the power in the building went off for like five seconds and came back on five seconds later and we're just roaring laughing we thought somebody set us up you know the engineer didn't engineer concern what's going on everything we thought you want to know\nAnd the power company the utility had to come in there was some kind of power surge and the utility company guys I'm walking out if you're doing the show and utility company guys were there and I started talking to him and they said we were listening to your show what had happened [laughter] so there I Am four years later\nAt the McLaughlin house haunted house in Oregon City Oregon ... working for a a a freedom nine Seventy sister station ... ... and I'm doing my show there from the McLaughlin house haunted house I tell that story\nAnd when I get to the part of sane [laughter] if there is a ghost in here to make your presidents don't now not ... not kidding you the power went out ...\nFound out that a TV Guide because all the TV stations go to that house and Halloween to you know take pictures of this is supposedly real haunted house ripped over a wire and pulled it out\nGood tonight edits and it set off are brought its you know turned off our broadcast I mean we were just roaring laughing I mean yeah just everybody back to the station thought I was playing the game with them\nWithout you just you know turned off the Myers I'm right with no\nSo yeah there you go\nTwenty three years ago today the man that hired me into radio ah\nPassed away I was with him in the hospital when he passed away from cancer and in the moment that he passed the radio station they hired me out in the last radio station he actually worked at he came back and work there in his later years transmitter went off the air at the same in the same minute that he died\nAbout all of it is\nThere's you know the doctors
