weekend as I say the streets of effects on UPN had a great time talking with you the last couple of days and I look forward to the next day to day and Jerry ... is actually the Sunday night Monday morning\nI could easily get use to filling in for them especially because you've been so gracious to me and you're kind comments about my work\nAnd you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at the Marcus they'll show dot com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to\nAfter this we go next to be on October twenty ninth on another show but again check it out on my Web page there are number of topics I said I Would get to tonight so I Want to keep my word\nFirst I Want to talk to you about illegal immigration I've been talking about this for over ten years now on the air doesn't mean I didn't think of how this Twenty years ago and so on\nBut I've never wavered in my position the issue and you guys were bringing up the last few days so I thought I Would focus on first segment at least and see\nYour response the issue is really not that difficult if you'd knowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally have come here legally which is why\nI don't want to call them illegal immigrants let alone it illegal aliens one of the college last night said you know markets illegal aliens forget it so you have the term document an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere\nOr loss them because if you acknowledge their coming here illegally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal they're not allowed to be here and the story and in another caller said that white you know why is this going on is pretty simple so as an example if you own a home\nAnd someone tries to enter without your permission you would\nCall the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they wanted your home to go into your home but they just lack the proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walks into your say your bank\nAnd wants to take the money out of your account right\nThere would be asked to prove that it's their account if they said it was their account but I just tend to have the documents to prove it the bank would not permit them access it's not obvious which is why it is so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as this\nThat can have your house and bank account if only they could find the misplaced documents\nFor years now I've said the left as one of the argument over language\nSo I'll give you some examples undocumented in this case over legal livable wage and minimum wage right we've we've lived with yours for minimum wage here's the wage that the government by the way the term that people should be paid which is\nAnd intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution you take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses\nThat hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first CEO to jail for hiring an illegal immigrant and they'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants with a return home Romney actually had it right but he used the wrong language soft and then we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport\nWe keep losing the language war to the left but I Would say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take them back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession\nA lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be saying for the right reasons and for heaven's sake enough of the government's sending out the wrong message message with actions like ball legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know\nAre bilingual government documents a country is United bites language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and\nOur shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they

about one of the biggest glaring things is that you even do it yourself and I used to do it but I'll marry you say American would actually are us citizens in America\nYou know we think that it's just sitting here now they're thinking the whole world this whole side of the world and immigration means nothing to them that means this is just normal stuff we of St ... when we say Americans and they they say American save brainwashed us\nTo think\nThat we're saying citizens and they and they think they're brainwashed us to think that\nEverybody uses American but when you look at your passport\nIf you have won it says US citizen that's what we are\nAnd that's a huge difference we have to be so deliberate with what we say are words have got to be delivered and that's that's gotta be uh the main thing that we have to do even on the air because\nThe radicals or taking those words that choice that's what I say about\nWell I appreciate your call but I'm not going to give up that word to them I just refuse to do it\nI eat when I hear that word America or Americans and it'd be you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind I'm not going to let them use or that and just because they think Americans you know north Americans whatever they want to use it for not going to let them get away with that oh and you know some of the songs right\nAmerica the beautiful but that that's not there's I'm not conceding that to them there's not a chance I'm going to do that and I don't want to concede the language them at all that's why it's important and legal immigrants illegal aliens I Know people kept me on that\nUm but I don't I don't see anything to him and and if you do that and then you're kind of given up a little bit now\nWe're Americans we passed for United States citizens great I get it but there's something special about this country called America when the United states of America America usa whenever you want to\nCall it and so appreciate your call that's my take on it and now you're national forecast for cobra electrons\nAn area of low pressure will be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that'll provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit so you can look for showers throughout the day and then in the region and facts Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rained free but today a few more spots of showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nAnd again for Texas but the good news there is showers will be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas\nWe're going to get about another inch of rain today\nUs but there are a lot of countries where are we going to have a endeavors actually there were\nActually the Russians are helping us more with these satellites right now than we may be helping them financially but that's not her point your point is it is a good one which is we are in charge of the countries\nUm for their illegals coming here I I kind of like that idea yeah even though oh no no to intimidate me on the air\nForce them to monitor their own people\nAnd as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us their porn right a lot of especially Mexico right for us send us send us the poor and is not our problem right [laughter] you're ...\nAnd ... and then you can also add on to the health care bill um for the health care bill and public school it will go on forever but basically it will stop at the origins stops them you know let him up [noise]\nUh yeah there's nothing like the right in the center and that's the point with right now it's been the wrong incentive you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get to have free hospital care right and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and this is terrific or you you you know I I Would come here to that's why you sit\nThere in charge interest and we can make money some interest then you know what\nYeah you should have given this idea that President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for the wall\nYou know any better than I Do only about\n... [laughter] I don't know [laughter]\nThat's a great call things Steve appreciate it very much actually I I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be\nA way up there in the department of education but I'm the person I send to then I think eventually he was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's the head of communications for I think the department of health or and so yeah it does happen and you know some people but you know what\nA ... it's tough and and that's one of the news stories that the I think they were heading someone else's leaving the administration it's tough to work there\nEspecially if you're conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want it it's tough it's tough in a lot of you pointed out yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot to become prison the United states you could say well to New York trip this power\nI think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his\nFamily right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing I mentioned this last couple of days if they get in power not only hearings and subpoenas but you know they're going to go after his tax because they're they're sure they're going to find something there that though oh probably with the Russians I guess right he\nMade some kind of the all the Russians but even if they don't what business is it um there's what his tax returns are it's just not their business I Know certain presidents have done I\nI don't think they should it's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's none of your business Democrats\nOr Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know what I don't I pay what I'm supposed to pay and do my share but it's not anybody else's business\nBy the way after the Kavanaugh hearings and all this other stuff if they go after taxes why to good people exactly why do people want to serve ... especially people with assets why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider Democrats loves serving in government of course for them\nThey believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you how to live your life\nYeah they're the party that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those that hey I Can't wait to get home in the case of Republicans and conservatives\nI think they're much more likely to say I want to go back to my family into my life because they don't believe in this whole part and that's what illegals don't know\nWhat makes America special one of the big things he's limited government that government stays out of your lives and don't you find it ironic to say the least\nThat a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government and what they do when they get here they vote for exactly the same thing they left it's really bad\nSo you because it it takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews\nAnd you know they say who's the vice president United States they can't name that that's not so important what's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country exceptional that we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives\nSo I teach my students I get and I don't try to indoctrinate them I ... I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights you're going to have energy but on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out\nOf my life as much as possible that's why some people question is why I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military I Can't have a tank in my backyard or grenades or is let alone nuclear weapons\nSo there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that shows this debate in perspective with the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think well mostly people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people have a real tendency to be bad and they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were out of the strongest tribe and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they did this because we can I don't I don't trust humanity\nI I don't trust that and there was something special about this country\nWhere we didn't want to trust government and I didn't get into this so much last night's caller mentioned that we have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant so there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of and the rest is left to the people\nAnd they're right how do you pass a law you guys know this house has to pass the Senate has to concur and then the president has to agree if he doesn't agree he vetoes it and then the house and Senate could override it and then the Supreme Court could say you passed a law that's unconstitutional\nThey really were afraid of big government so that's another big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand what makes this country so special but most you guys do and even if you're on the less I Want you to explain to me while I'm wrong about illegal immigration\nGimme call at eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine\nI'm Mark ... filling in on right on the radio\n[noise] he's over ... million euros tone read on the radio or\n[noise]\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accident free miles been registered to joined the million mile club on line that red eye radio show dot com red eye radio and our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nAnd Manhattan for eighty years and Detroit Diesel has been the legendary driving force inside many of the best known trucks on the road through our latest destroy technology Tony ... and ... earned the reputation of\nBeing the solution dedicated enough time to move bottom line\nWe're committed to continuing on legacy for another eight years and when you demand it all the mandatory years of innovation dedication and recognition [noise]\nThe tough tested Bowers lead is on the road the top tested truck we'll be traveling the country at truck shows truck stops and national retailers across the U.S stay tuned to read I radio for up to date information and be sure to follow red eye radio and top tested on Facebook Instagram and Twitter for information on tour stop of events and promotion\nIf you see this truck take a picture posted on Instagram and be injured too when great prices at hashtags\nAttack this truck keep listening for us for the next stop near you and\nI'm here with a unit oil truck tires engineer to talk about the universe oil LD ten Dr ...\nYes the long lasting L.

Griffin tone\nIn the latest movie and TV news on screen crushed dot com\nAnd health markets a national organization helping folks find the right Medicare coverage the news reports keeps saying that the rates might be going down\nThe cost of many Medicare plans are decreasing this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate health markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plan plans I can eliminate you're out of pocket cost plans with zero dollar premium and eat and plans that hey you back\nMike what the enrollment deadline coming soon what should people keep in mind\nWith so many new options it can be confusing you can get objective how to find a plan and they cost less and cover more with lower co pay more choices like dental and vision and prescription drug coverage and the freedom to see the doctor is huge you don't miss out on savings you deserve our health markets Medicare assistance is free\nThanks my hey folks your Medicare is just too important to put off so called health markets today and find out how much you could be saving [noise]\nColleen Henry seven three zero Thirteen Seventy two that's eight hundred seven three zero Thirteen Seventy two eight hundred seven three zero Thirteen Seventy two [noise]\nUm [noise]\nIt's our need to do all that that Democrats would really like to add to their progressive crown and I have to say\nThat I Am very concerned about the race when governor and senator and Florida and the rates the senator in Texas and I really haven't heard very much about it but um\nI get the feeling that it's not going to well in Florida I don't know about Texas but I don't know if you have any insight to what's going on there I Know that I'm a several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida\nAfter that terrible hurricane last year and the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because they can vote or an ... in Florida I don't know what insight you have you heard about those two states and I had relatives who live in Florida\nAnd I really can't have with them because they're they just do not want to talk about politics [noise]\nYeah and that's another topic I uh have down for tonight I don't know if\nWe'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side if you still get to keep them but I Do have inside in Texas I I think ... gonna win and I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers seem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that's their fools goals like he was for Republicans have been so vain or for the longest time although we finally won at\nFlorida is more problematic you're correct I ended the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that uh we could be were behind and the governor's race the senatorial races is also if he so that will depend on who turns out you're absolutely right and\nHow many are illegal votes they can get from people outside of the country and the Democrat side\nBut you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house than I Am about the Senate\nI think we're good friends individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm concerned about the have to I don't know what the ... congressional um situation is and I'm In you know Florida or Texas but um\nI don't understand you know I also don't understand why\nThe when the when you look at the\nPoliticians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrats who live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states and you don't they understand that they're going to have a ten percent tax\nIf the governor's race as one by the Democrats in Florida\nAnd he wants to do a lot of radical things and he got\nAs that gentleman a couple of callers ago that you know the states are they can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer\nHealth care they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state\nAnd I don't understand why Democrats don't you don't understand their for their own their own them being down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians\nIncluding Democrats to invest and and you know be trying to appeal to them [noise]\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't fall in with that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying tonight is it's very hard to explain the conservative Republican positions especially\nWhen the Democrats is much more emotional and hope and change 'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are on the surface if you don't explored the oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah\nOr or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about an attorney at the same job\nThat would make sense for a business to if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women\nSo a lot of leftist than liberal positions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is why do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know that I think the overwhelming majority of American people did not want to go through impeachment again I was wrong I was bored with Bill Clinton and what happened ... he won reelection\nUm people there and people basically don't want to go through that and that's when the Democrats by the way overplayed their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives\nLooked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did a gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leads leaving aside they treated him some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and\nSo they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when Dukakis by the way even announced that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time so let me know what you think\nAt uh eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else so that you want to talk about but right now is your national forecast or Z deal roads law\nAn area of low pressure will be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that will provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit so you can look for showers throughout the day and then in the region and facts Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rained free but today a few more spots are showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nAnd again for Texas but the good news there is showers won't be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas\nWe're going to get about another inch of rain today\nAnd then a drying pattern begins with some spotty showers as we look at the week ahead for the region that we could pick up some moisture on Monday into the desert southwest for the four corners region southern states are predicted\nBut then they figure out how to take advantage of your gun laws\nThat that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah Wright speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville or Jeremiah getting runners mark\nYes sir hey I'm your on your mark how're you doing well\nGreat I'm well I'm\nI recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant um well I wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married\nUh got married and then\nShe ... she left she's gone\nAnd it's the fast track to green card now the way they have you ever heard of the way the act\nAnd I'm just not just touching up from what the previous previous speaker was talking about um you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here illegally have a have a\nYou know get pregnant and then just totally disregard everything\nAnd then live off of the government um you can't get deported you can um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever ... I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this is this is a few people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant\nAnd then they want to just stay here and and uh it it it's an amazing thing\nI'll I'll be going my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience or my mother to live with it you know with a lawyer fees everything\nI guess you don't you you don't see your child then\nNo\nNo um they do restraining orders I'm under the way the actors it's the women against violence\nI'm ... I'm\nSo if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are here it's the fast track to green card um and\nAnd and you know um I ...

be one the president of Americans for tax reform and you can reach them an eight six six Ninety red eye and if you have any tax questions and we'll leave that in\nA but I wanted to ask you what did you think of the tax cut passed by Congress and the president\nIt was a really helpful for ...\nOr one of the things that happened was during the Reagan years we reduced marginal tax rates for people individuals top rate was Seventy percent\n... percent during World War two a Kennedy took it from Nineteen Seventy Reagan took it for seven eight to twenty eight unfortunately Bush and Clinton and Obama\nRaised it back up towards uh uh over forty percent and uh so at the individual level we began to take the rates down a little bit but business taxes is where the United states was way out of line with the rest of the world or the rest of the world started experimenting with lower\nBusiness taxes will lower corporate income taxes when we took our individual rights down and did very well I can look like a lot of Eastern European countries after they left the Soviet Union their individual rights like Fifteen Percent Hungary it's business tax nine percent\nWe were very ... we had the highest business taxes in the world and then we sat around going how come we can't compete you know with China and Germany and stuff like that and I are all into our lose business taxes twelve and a half percent\nA week what thirty thirty five plus an average of ... percent by state and local governments so really thirty north on average and uh the Republicans took that down to Twenty one\nAnd it made us more competitive on the tax credit than most of the country's law the average European ... about twenty five but ten points better than what we used to be you know we were at thirty five they were twenty five and they would beat us\nAmerican tax reform that punished you if you brought laid back that states could leftovers change there's maybe three trillion dollars to the left over Shays I'm partly because largely because our tax policy said we will hurt you if you want to bring the money to act and if you don't bring it back that's okay\nAh show three trillion stock overseas because of our tax policy and we said you know we're not doing that anymore\nIf you earn money in states we tax it but if your money in print French people take some of that but you want to bring up the whole the America good they'll ... they'll probably no penalty for bringing like back to it how 'bout that ad that\nWe've seen a tremendous again half a trillion dollars buys it and come back last six months and an apple they said look we have two hundred and Ninety billion dollars of earnings overseas they ... billion right back\nAnd said you know what because it's no longer had allies to boot buddy from London to New York or Texas um\nWe've read all back now it's all coming back but right now where they live in London back because it doesn't matter in terms of our access to capital whether it's in London or in Arkansas uh whereas before it ...\nShow the money might as well are ready to be back but\nWe've seen a half to try and come back a little bit late and we'll see more as a as we move forward\nAdded that guy's overseas you know German and French people and Brazilians making decisions are shelling that money to the United states rises overseas it's really irritated their pets because we're much more competitive\nThan we used to be and that's been a big help\n[noise] yeah I Know I can see why is it just seems so obvious all these things seem so obvious to me I have a couple of more questions and we're going to get some of the callers questions for you also but right now we're going to take our in our national forecast for um the tracks\nAn area of low pressure and we'll be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that'll provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours Detroit so you can look for\nShowers throughout the day and then in the region and in fact Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rain free but today a few more spots of showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nAnd again for Texas but the good news there is showers will be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas\nWe're going to get about another inch of rain today\nAnd then a drying pattern begins with some spotty showers as we look at the week ahead for the region that we could pick up some moisture on Monday into the desert southwest for the four corners region\nSouthern states are predicted to have a wetter than average winter there's a lecture national forecast for him right on the radio a meteorologist John trout\nThe paper ours right he said there'd be a revolution it\nI Know there were I think if someone had to write you know check my little one ten twenty whatever there would be you'd have a new Tea Party right or any of these days with\nVery yeah it make it clear pack yeah\nLet's go I promised a color to mark in Albuquerque New Mexico you're on with mark and with Grover Norquist\n[noise] think appreciate it I'll tell you what you just took the words right out of my mouth and here's what I've always\nThought flat tax and it's ... percent uh across\nThe board it don't matter whether you're right\nA Warren Buffett or whether you're the guy work down there with Donald seven percent you'll eliminate every deep Doug seem that there is\nAs far as they are with the tech fuel eliminate all federal tax is\nWhether it's in the field tax that we pay or whether Social Security income tax you name but if it's a federal tax it no longer exists you will limit the sixteenth a bad day\nAnd that in order to raise taxes if you're going to do it as Congress that means you have to have a super majority of both the house in the Senate to foot the bill on the president's desk for him to sign up for it be\nFor it to become a\nBallot or election of\nOn every two years if that's what they're going to do and it requires a super majority of all register voters in order for the taxes to the ratings and I I think you know\nRegister voters\nIn order for the taxes to be re and I think you know and as you just mentioned uh it does it come out of your pay check you write the check every month or every quarter and believe me\nOnce people realize how much they're paying out in taxis they would they would there would be a revolution in this country like you would not believe 'cause I was self employed and I had to write that check every quarter\nI couldn't believe how much I was helping the payout Jackson's\nInteresting groove or what do you think of it to his idea\nI think he's right and a number of the ideas you put out there are in state constitutions or in California in Nevada or\nIf you if the government wants to raise taxes steak but once raise taxes it's a two thirds voted one section because taxes are about as permanent as constitutional amendments which usually take two thirds or to impose on people and if you say it takes two thirds to raise taxes it really slows the\nTax and spend down doesn't stop it completely but it really slow it down it has to be a really good idea it has to have broad support a to an act and it I think a flat tax with a super majority to raise taxes\nUh would dramatically change our policy curious\nWhat do you think about some people propose the sales tax consumption tax so what's your response to that\nWell in Europe they have a value added tax which is a sales tax at every step\nOf production if you're going to have a twenty percent sales tax is on the opinion countries do you really have to you can't just collect it at the supermarket 'cause everybody would buy their stuff than than down the street from the supermarket out the back of a truck a\nSo they put that twenty percent at every level of production the farmer pays that the guy who\nTrucks goods into town pays at a twenty percent on his value added to way to get a twenty percent tax but he had little amounts\nAnd there's no one place where he can appoint a\nThe difference between the United states and Europe is Europe and has a sales tax of a national sales tax of value added tax which gets every level of a production or\nIt's why they have higher taxes than we do that stupid income taxes and high income taxes but you can only get so much money out of an income tax people will quit working they'll\nWork around that hide money [noise] um when you add to that the difference between the United States Europe\nIs that we don't have that and they do we don't have a sales tax they do some people say no no no we want to\nSweat whether the income tax and have a national sales tax tax in stat Bronx kind of what they promised Europeans and the Japanese and the Asians and the and the Africans when they put that send overseas or\nIt will be in addition to it will not be instead of and if we could\nAnd I'm for bringing that income tax down towards Sarah I'm what you want to do is we just spend it not just turn it into a different tax what who cares if you got rid of the income tax and took the exact same amount of money out of ...\nHow would that change anything it's the same amount of money out of your pocket or it it makes you feel better somebody else's writing the check but everything you buy from your house cheer car cheer cheer food dear close would cost more than the taxes would be hidden than that\nBut everything you buy from your house cheer car cheer cheer for dear close would cost more that that the taxes would be hidden in that so um [noise] I think going to a single rate tax\nIncome tax or and reducing spending his route to go to that if you got taxes down enough\nThat you could shift from a ten percent income tax too you know a Fifteen Percent sales tax it's\nGot it's got to be ... water or at yeah I I wouldn't mind that but you got to get the government to half its presence size before you could\nRisk that you really have kept protections how do we know we're not going to end up with an income tax and the sales tax true many countries have had been hit with that\nAnd there's no incentive and the porno politicians because they get their money campaign contributions right is part of this hey you know give me a this donation someone on a lower your taxes this they don't want to think solved eventually right that would reduce their campaign contributions to the enemy of my park\nHaving taxes that I'm a complicated allows politicians to raise money or to protect people bit by bit where everyone's you're paying a one percent in the same percentage less ... less opportunities to make money for politicians\nAnd lawyers and accountants maybe my final question for you will maybe I've got two more what about the mid term how do you know what do you know if if the Democrats ... take the house what do you think about what's gonna happen it's tax situation [noise]\nIf the Democrats take the house there'll be no tax cuts for the next two years or they will do push-ups protects increases that
