I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me\nWho was a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm\nAnd move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well I Know\nNot the point that it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already in the restaurant\nThe argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well I Know that's\nNot the point that it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already in the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do and this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can't get their message across\nAnd if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get that out they could they could gain more seats\nInstead of losing seats and this was back then not rise early now we're talking about getting a message across to people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced we've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you are not part of that group\nThe the Republicans but more importantly the president\nRight now or they're capable together of getting real things done and they need to get our message out there\nThere is this and and we continue to have to fight this all the time were where we get people to call when you guys think that you can convince everybody or we don't know\n... that's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that look people [laughter] people evolve\nEvery day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population that people learn every day and\nA teacher's politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that are called the show and I said you know I used to think this way and then I started all you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you're you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realize I changed my mind completely ... people change their mind you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday\nUndecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing in your face and never being satisfied with what you have always trying to grow it\nAnd we believe if you promote\nFree markets\nConservative economics conservative principles and you explain it in a simple way\nA nation that largely remains and we're not talking to you who is listening to the show you have shot us out you've sought out shows like this you've sought out information like this so we're not\nReferring to you you're already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time and you are able to introduce them\nTo different ideas there is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference in almost probably ... I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there and that is the goal the goal is to win\nGoal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate he used a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that and that's what I Love when people run if you guys don't understand the frustration out there\nYou're kidding me you're not if you liked it just would you like to sit in this chair for the last almost Thirty years and so I don't know it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here yet but that's what it is being a conservative radio talk show hosts for the last Thirty years yeah\nIt's really a calm [laughter] it's always a very high scenario it's like doing constant yoga all the time meditation oh it's like sitting on a beach so like that just sitting there and say I I got friends in St Thomas sitting there\n... oh it's like sitting on a beach\nSo like that just sitting there and say I I got friends in St Thomas sending their Virgin Islands St Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is\nDay after day here as pure as and and so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that and start every day at the other side that you disagree with then you believe is unfair and in some cases evil\nNo that's not our goal look go after them on the issues going after them with with ah you know with everything you've got on the issues\nAnd spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric because it doesn't need to be looked at the point is is that\nYou feel like there's this limited window and that the the the windows closed and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that\nBecause we've been doing good so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean mess of doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person can be communicating ... that you can set the messages are\nOf time to automatically go out while you're sleeping you can you can communicate right now around the clock get the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins\nAnd you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already what\nFrustrates me is understanding that the left uses the heated heated rhetoric that they that they use they do that out of desperation ... they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand\nThat on you know the other side on on the the side that I'm most closely relate to that it gets frustrating because they're always just so angry and they were spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack back\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell mhm we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need that that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we had the substance to back up our ideas that they work\nWell well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party there former leader was in Nevada and the other night and we've gone over the years from that speech at the DNC in two thousand six or two thousand four\nOr to him becoming president and two thousand eight on hope and change to just the other night and Nevada begging who vote 'em all out almost big was it because it became if you think about it it's not even a political tactic what would you\nWhat I Would have expected to hear from you know the great or greater\nBrock Obama this big speech\nBuilt on principles and it was basically if you guys don't get out and votes they're going to land a job well okay thanks kept a novel\nBill on principles and it was basically if you guys don't get out and votes they're going to win adapt well okay thanks kept an obvious we already know that\nDon't boo vote\nI'm okay can you can you\nCan ... and ... and as we said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issues that's the difference look at you know we talked about how we don't like ... political ideology on either side but I Do understand\nThat because of political ideology on on the left is based purely on personality in on the right it's not I still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I dollar free we worship a candidate and it still always has bothered me but the fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas\nThat are that are specific and work and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it but as you said you saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging the other day for what you saw was the

Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline had that the powder that was sent along with all the words harm you know a along with the suspicious\nWas harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not past that and\nYou don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now\nPeople are going by their trust of National Review\nYou know based on the headline which which National Review to me is extremely credible ... at the time but I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm that's what I told you as an earth they're saying the bomb was harmless but this is in our ... not on the air\nAnd then realized\nOh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence and Associated Press separates the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb now again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were\nActive bombs that could have gone off and could have gone up and would have gone off a ... you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever\nOr were they set to go off and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point you would look at it and the questions that you would ask is an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm or\nThey were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent for a political statement would be the next question that you would ask right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we\nAre when we talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThey're saying the divisiveness must stop\nBut yet they create the maximum divisive this by blaming somebody throwing incident where they don't add the fact\nThey don't know\nWe have no idea that the motivation behind the the the little person or persons\nNobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against the advice of this and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on the left doing that it's like [laughter] we're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nRight well anyway specially without knowing all the facts here\n\nKnow the trying to put a puzzle together with without all these\nEspecially without knowing all the facts here you know the trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces\nThat we've got to it in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do\nSometimes you don't know the motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective work\nAnd I know sources of said they believe it's the same you know right people are ... percent or group of people based on which area which again that the number of the number of of\nAh devices that you send out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI I wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm [noise] yeah\nIf you look at the nature of or how this was sent a the the packaging the if you look at the um the the one packaging for the the device that was sent to\nCNN or at the multiple stamps it went through us PS bomb each of these by the way\nDepending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know she doesn't open his own male are usually people at that level don't open you know anything themselves all of that assorted and there's a great deal of security um but\nBut of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service actually as their own sorting that they do show the male doesn't doesn't it's not delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time\nAnd place but but the point being is that\nThey have a a great deal of resources that the secret service has a great deal of resources into and and finding out you know and and putting together the puzzle\nThere's a there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days that they know it may be where\nThe facility or facilities were at these were sent from oh and I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now what did these rely bonds or not they know right they haven't said\nThat we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go winds and could have been triggered by a ... a phone or whatever I that would be the next question why not\nWell because in in in ... ... is there a reason that I'm I'm I'm not throwing out a conspiracy ... I'm saying there is there an investigating reason why you wouldn't do it well and if they\nWere armed or or or if they were at that at that point those were those devices were ready to go off\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city\nAh right there in the building to CNN building or the those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock sometime that but they were allowed to go back in the building I'm ... and so does that tell us anything about\nThe threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices will find out in the coming days\nYou know because if they were\nArmed and they were ready to go often and you suspect that there might be more\nWould you allow people to go back in that building\nYou know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have as ex presidents do\nA secret service detail\nAnd they're always going to have that a great level of security ah but if it's if you're talking about you know the media you have to assume right that's\nA great level of security ah but if it's if you're talking about you know the media you have to assume right that the if the threat is real ... that were at that device word dangerous or we're\nReady to go off that there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system somewhere um but\nI don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on here we just know that you've got\nI did the you've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets were who they were sent to and and that's about it\nWe ... we we've seen the pictures on\nOn uh on line and in the media as to what the packaging was at least with the CNN device\nWhere the the the FBI and the and uh everyone that's involved in the uh of course the investigation here they're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was [noise] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are\nThey have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at\nSitting in a studio can't tell you what they're really looking at\nIt looks suspicious which we already know\nThat's all we know about this entire situation\nSuspicious packages we don't know anything else\nAnd when the FBI tells us or authorities tell us more than we can start having that broader discussion eight six six Ninety\nRight I was gilly McNamara and record the radio [noise]\nListen to read I radio show wherever you are with our free app for your iPhone or Android more info at red eye radio show dot com and use the keyword mobile\nTo keep you trucking cc are tires these\nServices dedicated to providing high speed tire certainly cutting edge to thousands of devoted service team liquid over Fifteen hundred service trucks five minute alignment ...

route front of you know the that if you could tell me okay this is early voting began with a political science all over the place\nAnd so I started driving around trying to find the building insane I only did what building that's going to be in but when I but I Will know it when I see it because I had a political science will be all over the place right right yeah and they were the only thing is they didn't have any parking\nIf you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college ah yeah yeah which\nAnd I just thought to myself because that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a court house right uh where you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little farther couple of more miles and I was going to go there and I said\nI Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been out of before you know I had about a thousand foot walk through pouring rain but when I got in there everybody friendly ... no matter what the ... is ... outside the anger the rage that we see in the media every day\nEvery time I walked into a polling place hey how you doing everybody's laugh and joke in what's going on what

got their families\nAnd our job any of them were heading right now right and and and and our job is the fact that we have we have time to pay attention to everything so we can articulate what's going

this going okay as we go in and get what are you know again twelve days out from the mid term they need to build some momentum so they need to I guess return\nUh some of that are positive stuff to back to the market uh we'll see where it goes uh in terms of or any kind of rebound later today or or maybe next week if that has to happen\nBut you can bet there watching this and a lot of it has to

have not just about the attack\nThat they are for open borders\nWe've been saying for years\nAnd this is what we said ... pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and the earlier this week\nThey have to be positioned very clearly\nThe question has to be asked\nWhere do you stand on the border\nThey must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement\nBecause it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do do support\nDon't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want\nWhat do you want\n[noise] he said again I have argued elsewhere the party should have been raised an immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat and a former Democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we have said that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this was a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president\nTo back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have this comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means\nWhat does that mean specifically what do you want and he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and [noise]\nAre you for that that but you can't\nWe have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on this show together the issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a\nWas a like a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy ... which was the amnesty that was two thousand five ... just ... they they made the decisions to a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years the Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do\nWhat with their plan be thinking about this and that by the way that the Republican failure\nMhm because of Republican should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it should be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said\nYou make the accusation Democrats wide open borders and when they cry you our line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done\nIssue than the challenge and that's what it was shown a saying here that again they haven't had to answer they haven't had\nTo they don't they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that\nAnd there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you know get rid of ice you don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats won border security they may have compassion for people that are here\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we brought it to your attention\nThe demographics\nThat want the least legal immigration into this country\nAre blacks and Hispanics ... when you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see the the numbers\nOf uh\nMinorities in this country who want\nThe lowest level\nOf legal immigration that even from has never talked about mhm\nIt's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat mhm\nNo the American people stand with the president on border enforcement they do\nHe's winning that politically\nThe other side of it is is that\nThe Democrats have not been forced to\nTo say what they want at all\nYou do with the president wants\nYou know what the Republicans won\nAnd and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say and you have to you have to force them and backed them into a corner and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they had no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and\nGive you the specifics that they do not the second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the caravan saying we'll poll well we're going to pull aid from you ... but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you right\nSo we can't take in the entire world\nBut this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people from\nBut you need to embrace free markets you need\nTo you need to do something yes\nBy the way he's also we when we talked about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunter and flag ... and all that and so people start question well why do you want to come here right do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then you know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to well what do we want from people who come over here as\nCitizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can have a discussion when only one side has said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't go after they're part of the party than indoors is open borders and just keeps quiet on it well silence is your consent\nYes silence is your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states\nSo why are you preaching that\nNow That's Douglas shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat\nWho are about\nTo use Claire McCaskill's verbiage or isn't a crazy Democrat at a says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person who votes Democrat and they want border control sure\nIn fact the constituency that votes most Democrat most the time actually to get out of illegal immigration and illegal immigration is a demographic that wants the least legal immigration into this country look\nYou have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice\nThey they're saying it\nBut they're not forced to say the words open borders\nBut they're not forced to say the words open borders\nThey should be forced to say it\nBecause that's what they're promoting and if they're not\nIf they're promoting border enforcement at any level [noise]\nTell me who and I mean the ... from the party that is actually saying that in promoting his Chuck Schumer promoting that\nMay be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe clear [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats but\nSaying this is what we want because that's the official\nPolitical battle how can we ever how can we have a debate\nOn illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won officially tell us what they would ... what they want right\nExcept for those that are in the party that promote open borders and the elimination advice they won't even have the debate why right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans we Republicans have a Thirteen Years to pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that in that role of doing so right they have another opportunity to do it right now with the caravan coming

FBI said last evening that hit identified seven suspicious packages\nAddressed to prominence liberal and democratic political figures over the previous three days a contained quote potentially destructive devices and to quote\nThe bureau initially said it had recovered five packages that were similar in appearance and for the return address of an office for representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida the packages were address to Jordan\nParents and for the return address of an office for representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida the packages were address to George Soros Hillary Clinton\nA a former president Brock Obama former CIA director John Brennan a care of CNN and former attorney general Eric Holder the FBI said it was possible\nThat additional packages were mailed to other locations\nAh this investigation is of the highest priority for the FBI Director Christopher Wray set in a statement we have committed the full strength of the FBI's resources in together with our partners on the joint terrorism task forces\nWe will continue to work to identify an arrest whoever's responsible for sending these packages we ask anyone who may have information to contact the FBI do not hesitate to call no piece of information is too small to help us with this investigation law enforcement officials involved\nIn the investigation told Fox News at the similarity between the packages has led them to believe that a single individual or group could be responsible\nIn addition to the five packages identified by the FBI US Capitol police were investigating a suspicious package address to representative Maxine Waters of California\nAt the Capitol Hill screening facility and Marilyn water set in a statement that the Capitol police have told her that her Washington DC office was the target a suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI late Wednesday the Los Angeles central male facility was evacuated after employees\nFound a suspicious

its earlier statement\nThe LA police department tweeted that its bomb squad had rendered the package at the male facility safe and investigation will be turned over to the FBI so that's the latest that we\nUh have a right now uh again or the one thing that is uh that I I think uh [noise] everybody wants to know\nIs where these lie bombs were the Israel bombs now we must admit that ah that the

October was Fox News we're ... was a tie a than the misery scout that has holy up by one in that and a dead heat\nYeah it is it is is a dead heat and so the fascinating thing about uh this radio ad is what is said in it where there's you'll hear two men talking\nAnd they're talking about you know a Josh Holly and the problems with him that are declining as he gets wind and works out during work hours which we've found really interesting for a Senate race to be the main accusation in an ad that clearly is a desperation ad\nYeah they'd be gorgeous why not but he drinks why he purchased wind purchased wind and went to work out right uh and when you're an attorney general which probably your hours you're probably a salaried workers we just did you grow your own state a salaried employee is uh yeah uh\nBut [laughter] but I Am thinking that that that's it but do we know we'll we'll play coming up on after falling the bottom of the hour yeah gets about admitted that I Want to play the whole thing and\nIt's where they get into the two people talking and this is her campaign at ... by the way this is not some pack running the ad some other outside group this is her commercial and they say well you know she's not like those crazy Democrat\nI Will set it at all I mean with if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most in that ad uh-huh uh it was terrorists yes and we've talked about the mid west it was something that we talked about yesterday ... that the the the the the farmer\nThat is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly out because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so it is something that we uh we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats\nTo help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad\nIt was terrorists twice\nHere's interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person in the street and said what do you think about ... do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation where Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are yeah\nUm you know it's it it really is about the presence I guess in the state of the industry that particular we had a streak right and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it even if\nYou're not a farmer or you noted on ... yeah right now you know like you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they bring very vocal about it if you're in that state even if you're not a former ah you know again depending on the impacts they they felt it was worth\nI'm making that point ah which\nKnow I Will see if if that point works\nI'm making that point ah which\nYou know I Will see if if that point works out or if if any of this works er here within two weeks\n[noise] it's\nA I I think the most notable\nPoint is the word crazy\nYeah because it is it it\nThat positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say it she approves this message this is her campaign that\nShe's not saying the people that are protesters\nShe's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out\nYou know over the last several weeks\nThese are the mainstream high ranking members\nOf the party\nThat she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy\nThat's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know ... or you know with my my party in it knows ... approach or are you writing again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation and say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme is you know in there that she doesn't she's ... it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put in to that ad right\nWhere the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric has what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah because I think what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that ... they're they're they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats my not part of the crazy Democrats ... but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not\nA you know not radical not yet a extreme cause extreme is something that is a term that Democrats have used a lot and it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term\nWord right ah but this is\nThis is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing\nIt doesn't matter that you're not\nA Cory Booker\nIt doesn't matter\nThat you're not a ...\nA lizard with war and or just you know pick a number of them that are in the Senate\nOr that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times it's because of their actions\nAnd and we said this a few weeks ago\nTheir actions\nGo outside of their state in terms of the race right they will\nUh taint the ...\nEspecially of course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we so\nThat's the effect is that come out one Harris or or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and those people in the ... the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with\nAt some point a Kamala Harris or you know\nInside with as you're crazy Democrats she'd as she just did as ... outside [laughter]\nAnd which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote up and\nWhere does she go on this well she made a choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but\nIt's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale that tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats then that doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats with that no vote she condones that behavioral\nLetting we saw during the ... Kevin I'm process and and that's why I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not ... we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right here in undecided independent\nWho is looked at the cabinet thing and said they're crazy I mean they're they're really crazy and I can't vote for care\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the feedback coming back ... that had maybe recede by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right\nBut you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the length of what you will do you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with that vote on Kavanaugh\nThat was also condoning their behavior him not you know all of that that's you know that's the evidence to back up their opinion yup coming to that conclusion just have it all just proved that eight six six Ninety right I\nWas very much and they're

we do [laughter] it's ... it's a political ad that if you haven't heard if you want to hear Claire McCaskill's\nAdds a radio ad that she started running in Missouri the Democrats and the Democrat\nCalling other Democrats crazy Democrat and not one of the crazy Democrats yeah Albert in Texas Albert welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show high Albert\nHey good morning Eric uh Gary first time caller I was calling to let you know that the FBI is doing a very thorough investigation near and so it won't be give them a boot political issue they'll let us know so after the November election\n[laughter] we're real or not [laughter] yes I think oversight committee I get your masters and that\nHappen so [laughter] yeah we'll have to declassify it uh yeah\nWhat are they now you know that the the things that are ... and yeah thanks that's because we we saw what you're going to say we we knew where you were ... we were going with it a ... it's a it is fascinating though because it it's something look at is not the number one question that you would want to ask is a reporter\nMhm that report them I'm sure they're gonna have a press conference today some part is going to ask 'cause that was what were the bombs Leiber\nNot right where they you know we're we're could they have been a detonated by opening the package because the concern is not just a you know about you know the message being sent or the intent of the person or persons responsible\nBut also about the threat that it's still or might still be out there in in the system because let's say that they were going or are going through stages where they're reaching out to these individuals' first and then there are others on their list\nWell the concern would be by you know the the package handlers and people that might even be walking on a ... up to a porch\nAnd and they see something ... ... these devices ready to go off could they have been detonated a rapidly either remotely or by opening a package\nI think that's information that needs to be made available to the public as soon as possible you know without impeding the investigation itself\nIf possible [noise] ah\nJust we got to bring this up quickly I I haven't checked the overnight markets you know I haven't I haven't checked but six hundred down\nSo we'll see whether it's just a correction whether there's really worry we know there is in the housing market and we know for example about you know foreign coming down and and St look thanks for all the thanks for all the help with the tax cuts but the terrorists are killing us\nAnd and it is something like what happened yesterday on the news playing out makes a lotta people nervous and and of course than the markets because one possible do you have to consider is that it was a foreign enemy or that was that was involved are responsible\nFor these suspicious packages and and the the concern that it might not be over or something else might happen we it was a lot of uncertainty yesterday so some of that is built into that drop I mean you often see that if there is something that that is happening\nOr as as big of a new story as as you saw yesterday or that does make the the markets very nervous so uh we'll see where it\nWell and and that's something that was you know was was brought up the yesterday by you know some of the experts say look you know there's there's three things that could be it could be somebody in their right it could be somebody and they left it could also be a foreign entity\nYeah just to disrupt the American you know an electoral process or it could be just terrorists yeah who have decided to do it and again which that's that's why we find it surprising that are so late into this because it's been three days since the ...\nA bomb initially that\nNobody has stated whether these were active live bombs that would have gone off right if if somebody would have touched it in a different way right apparently they were handled it didn't go off\nWell because I Would think that if there was a threat of these devices going off whether they could be set off a remotely or by the handling the package itself that we would see that warning come out by authorities would we not\nYeah because we learned that that was the case and they didn't warn the public and there was still a possibility of such devices being in the mail system or being out there in in the public and it's still being a threat to the public\nBeyond that the intended recipient recipients over the past few days that they would want to get that message out and and we will be hearing that [noise]\nI Would think that and if we hear that that you know that they were armed and and they didn't say it will someone's going to have to answer them for on attracts here's your forecast\nThose heavy showers in southern Texas will continue to slowly move eastward throughout the evening\nAnd into the day on Thursday we'll see that area of low pressure hug the Gulf Coast and provide heavy rains from Houston over to New Orleans so I can certainly you only the windshield wipers on through a good portion of the south as this system continues to move eastward\nWe'll see the heavy rains into the deep south by tomorrow\nEast of eyes sixty five and I Ninety five in the Carolinas also on friday and the weather maker were describing not only with showers for the\nTexarkana region today but into Oklahoma\nOr not you're not surprised or shocked but very interested in the fact that the biggest issue it was mentioned twice was the terrorists now I don't know why you take valuable time because if if you believe as a Democrat\nThat the terrorists\nThat are on products that are hurting farmers in the mid west\nAnd you believe in and you've you've you've mentioned it\nYou know whites okay because you believe it's important you also know or you believe is we ... we instead this way back when in springtime\nOr you know we've said this when when the uh weight before that we said this one the Republicans passed the health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but has used against you in in the mid term elections and it has been\nSo you've got that and you've got the terrorists that you believe you mentioned it to whites in there because you believe that there's a significant number of people who might be attractive to that anti terror message\nThat Trump has been so loud on ... why are you throwing in and wasting any valuable time in a commercial about\nWhen he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym anybody knows that when you're an attorney general here ... you don't work hourly you're not\nYou're ... you're you're really you're on your ever on the work you're not\nWorking right so if you're sitting there and say oh okay I'm going to go out and got to stop by and get a bottle of wine or something like that or I go to the gym during the day because that's a lot of people to go to the gym today and\nBest time to go or you know but but that's it they didn't ... there was no real focus honestly they would have been better to leave that out completely and joke goes straight onto the crazy Democrat well maybe\nThey maybe they should have mentioned the crazy Democrat twice and by the way I was just thinking the law and order ... uh uh you know didn't didn't uh I Can't think of his name\nAh jak yeah jak ran for Diego he was he became the did not do that the opposition ever use the fact that they they ... in their office the whole time that\nWe've always talked to weight loss named him on TV [laughter] they drank all dive after every case win or lose to try to run their drinking at the end of the day and they're often not wine like ... it was hard liquor they're always the ranking [laughter] we thought it and so when I heard that would come on come on their\n... their prosecutors they all drink either [laughter] well ...\nWhen we get getting back to the ad and you said there certainly are on the show that\nBecause we focused in on using the term crazy Democrat instead of using the term extremist Democrat yes or a leadership of the Democrat right\nRight and there's the verbiage is clearly some kind of response that they got verbatim they were hearing that repeatedly that phrase crazy Democrats by people in their collapse the in their internal were showing that this was a that they you know this was a way a hot button\nThat they could connect to some of those undecideds right now those independents who were leaning right at that moment and the concern they had was the crazy Democrats the ... that's that's why that was used\nIt was used and directly came from a likely from that that kind of called out research response that you get\nBecause there's there's no other way to do there is no other reason\nTo put that in and that that becomes what the Hail Mary then this really neck and neck dead heat raised in Missouri it is I mean it's out of all of them I think it's probably a if it's not the closest it's pretty ... pretty close to the closest Senate race right now uh so\nI think it's it's um clear that they want him to connect with those people that are leaning right that her independence that are winning writing might otherwise ... from McCaskill the problem in that is her her actions is specifically with with capital\nBecause in siding with her party Kavanaugh you were condoning that kind of behavior right and you can come out and say no I just wasn't sure and I need to be sure when we see\nThat doesn't sorry perception is reality especially in in in this kind of situation that is that is going to and could well that issue this side and many of these races the uh the outcome of the the Kavanaugh situation\nAnd and when you look at the polling there in in Missouri to begin with a a if you look at the September polling a you know as the CNN or McCaskill was up by by uh by three and with a with likely voters and you get to the Fox news poll which was\nUp until a was nine twenty nine to tend to and it was a tie and then you know through that whole time the cabin all thing in ... Missouri scout a huge sample of a over twelve hundred likely voters and holy up one still margin of error is to point seven\nRight uh and still nobody is at the fifty percent mark\nSo they're still a ton of undecided there the\nUsing that term crazy Democrats a Democrat using that in an ad\nBy the way apparently ticked off other Democrats in Missouri ... I was reading an article on that earlier a but using that term means that the undecideds are talking about it\nThe undecided that's part of their mind set you know the Democrats are crazy these are crazy Democrats now that had to come directly from cabinet yeah\nThat's part of their mind set you know the Democrats are crazy these are crazy Democrats now that had come directly from cabinet yeah because for that to be to do it for that to\nGo to the level of ... uh from\nFringe too extreme is\nToo I just read my leadership too crazy Democrats mean that exact term they're not stir crazy that is the mindset that they view and a significant portion\nOf undecided independents in Missouri that she's trying to get aboard I'm not part of the Democrats I'm not part of the crazy Democrats I I I I think for myself I'll go to the middle I Will compromise which means what you'll compromise with Republicans and\nYeah you know it's it's a ... this is why you have this raised that you have here it's not because her opponent is is is this big great strong opponent\nPitch because there's weakness across the board and [laughter] it is bipartisan that's in nature I mean she's getting she's get of course they're they're Republicans in that state that would never vote for a ... you know that that that's a given\nBut those people in the middle and this is what we've been talking about for a long long time those are the ones that may vote one way or the father and her for one party or the other\nAnd they're the ones you have to convince\nThey're the ones that get you over the top and right now she has too many weaknesses that that hurt that really don't serve her well with either side and I think that comes directly or certainly her vote on Kavanaugh was an indication of weakness if if it didn't help create it\nWell you know there's it's it's one thing\nYou know you you can uh the ...\nInsults the ah the accusations against Donald Trump being crazy being nuts you know everything that you remember him to the whole mental health things that has sort of disappeared hasn't it yet but he's mentally ill and all that but you know you can look at the end you say okay that's that's an attack that's always thrown at at one person the president always gets that\nYet but we're talking about a political party as a whole\nWe've been talking about the the the Democrats from twenty sixteen where they said look we've got to go and figure out what the people the heartland as\nAre going and we said back then we said yeah but they're they're talking crazy stuff\nThey're talking you know the whole transgender saying well\nWe have compassion for everybody but if you think you're a ... if you think you're a man and you're a woman doesn't make you want man and it doesn't make a man and shouldn't make you a man legally and you shouldn't as a man be able to compete against a woman ... the majority of Americans believe that\nThe trans racial thing that they started adopting President Obama before he left office talking about the fact that he's come to know that race is a social construct no it's not right and and so we talked about that craziness well it's gotten to the point\nIf it's no longer the Democrats in order for Claire McCaskill of put that in the concern is no longer the Democrats aren't relating to the average person it's at the average person has now joined the Democrats as crazy ... and the capital of thing I Believe is what put them over the top\nYeah and and and that behavior by the way as we pointed out\nNot from protesters\nFrom from\nThe high ranking officials and and and members of the party on those committees\nClaire McCaskill's now as a Democrat believe she's fighting against the crazy Democrats ... eight six six Ninety ...\nWhat's the difference between standard number two diesel and premium fuel run Justin is director of product management for cynics the makers of ... master ... premium diesel fuel and he fills us in\nAny way to consider the total operational costs to pray for the call if you look at the cost for\nPremium diesel fuel and he told us that\nReally want to consider the the total operational costs or the price of the oh you look at the cost for replacement\nAnd look at the cost of ongoing maintenance unfortunately those costs seven gone down they've actually continue to increase switching to upbringing in a", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "25"}
