let's go to Gina in New York City 'cause I hate to admit I think you are right you know let's\nI'm going to agree with you in part and I'm going to disagree with drew in another part for Republicans are such feckless pools that even despite the Kavanaugh hearings and despite all the people that are saying we're going to go to the polls and we're going to vote the Democrats I guarantee you\nThe house will lose twenty seats at least minimum Republican Party\nAnd we haven't been able to weed out these rhino slobs dire sending us to the left\n[noise] yeah well I Do agree with you and you said you agreed with me in part I Do agree with you that the Republicans are probably going to lose the house now I don't want to I'm usually an optimist but I just want to be real it doesn't I don't know how many seats it takes twenty something\nBut the fact is that um we're in trouble and it doesn't look good because the member the house is done on an individual basis uh area by areas state by state so it sure seems to me that uh we're in trouble and we could easily or lose\nA house represents I don't think we're going to lose the Senate but we are going to lose the house of representatives if enough people don't go out and vote is very very scary what's happening let's go to a how 'bout that Curtis in Graham North Carolina Curtis you're on with mark\nHigh [noise] okay [noise] well [noise] um [noise] I\nKind of agree with what that last caller saying about the much rhinos I'm destroying their base I'll tell you what the civil war it was actually the first civil war has been going on and

gotta fight hard for it and that's part of my message tonight if you don't get out there and vote we're going to be in trouble let's go to Fred in Tallahassee, Florida friend your honor with mark\nA marker for it real well how are you doing I'm ...\nUh the stability in our country should the Obama administration has just go to\nPot oh\nNo he was banned on and off for started voting\nBut not the first president I got a full load for on boats you only got impeach but and that was a real does spoil the oh my dad was a staunch conservative but\nHim and law and child was good buddies who wanted to go there\nAnd done all kinds of stuff [noise] you know you might be a different party and I have a few different ideas but you got along and you know you can have a conversation without it turning into a ... about politics\nAnd\nThe way things are going now\nA Hillary brought up the ... the Democratic party has turned into the party of the ... the way they did judge Kavanaugh is totally deplorable\nBe before you go in and sounds like you to go but I I'll say that everybody else out there the fact is I'm not one of those people that wants to make it easier for people to vote\nI think if you don't know enough about what's going on and you don't care enough to go out of your way the vote I have a feeling you're not one of my voters that you're going to do it based on emotions and feelings which is what the other side is anyway to begin with\nAs opposed to as our caller just said\nA knowing the facts and and knowing the issues and that's what can you don't have to agree with me but at least go in there don't do based on emotion you you hate President Trump so much or he he's a man and you know we don't want to listen to ... so you're the woman I remember that was years ago maybe it is again\nThe vote for him because they don't share your philosophy or your principles of course there's another issue\nWhich is as a teacher part time teacher I can tell you this most students don't know our point of view what I often use the minimum wage laws they'll say of course I Want my re uh want to get a raise or what do they call it also not just minimum wage livable wage I Love that one like it's a job of a business this may sound heartless\nOf job of a business to give you a livable wage no it's not\nIt's a job I teach economics job of business to make a profit if they don't make a profit they won't be don't you don't have any work or they won't hire you or the lay you off when they won't hire your friends\nThat's how the job of a business to give you a livable wage and it's not the job of governments to decide what wage to give you\nThat's what the Soviet Union did that with communism is that's what's socialism is\nAnd as most young people they've never heard the other side where does money come from I said that for years people do not know including adults not just young people young adults\nThat the government has no money in the tone it just takes in ... from some group of people in the form of taxes and give it gives it bothers when students here the snake I never heard that\nI never heard that before see conservatives couldn't win it's a harder thing to explain\nA than just being emotional and say you know whatever livable wage pro choice global warming of course it changed the climate change when it gets very cold just see these catchy things they left and the Democrats are much better at that than conservatives are takes a while to explain\nWhy there shouldn't be a minimum wage if there is you you just can't raise that arbitrarily or the government should do some bureaucrats and do it\nIt takes a long time to explain capitalism why that's the best system ever created so far\nAnd this is tough to be on on our side it it takes a while and if you have a meeting against or oh good luck it's a wonder we win any elections is one of the President Trump won with all the things that against\nA and let's go to David in Greenwich ah let's see where that is in rented to New Jersey and sounds like fire\nDavid\nGood morning thanks for taking my phone call um\nI I guess ... points on that you know President Trump is hated for what he says and and I get it it's not for what he does you know let's not forget in this country that on President Obama came in I didn't vote for him but I like them as charismatic the money in this country and you should know this uh from as you're teaching\nThe money in this country dried up and went back up on the shelf ironically it comes right back out again President Trump cannot force corporations to invest money or make things happen I mean he's a businessman he's a wheel on dealer so he's hated for what he said\nNot what he done second I think that people in this country should understand that the Democratic and Republican Party are are\nAre corporations just like if you want to I wanted to start our own right eye radio corporation political party we could do it too so when they take it so personally thinking versus us and listen to them it's not an us and them to corporations and the ... that's that's how they listed\nSo when they take it so personally thinking this is us and this is that it's not an us and them their corporations and the ... that's that's how they listed myself again I think to vote in this country you should have to pass a fifty question test and at least get a Seventy five\nSo you know how to vote why you're voting where you're voting what parties coming\nUh as far as the civil war in this country at a friend of mine told me when I Lived in South Carolina once when I mentioned the civil war and he said it wasn't the civil war it was a war of northern aggression because there was nothing civil about it well we are in the ... civil war right now and with regards to this next election I Can't see\nIt not getting more ugly than it was I personally predict there's going to be a red wave\nCome a long time in Congress and that's because of the Kavanaugh hearings themselves a and you know I'm I'm just not to question it's it's a it's a screw in question but if somebody turned around tomorrow and said\nI mean the bottom of the bus drivers are taking the bathroom break at a fast food restaurant and he says Mr Schumer Mr or or ... or or or Mr selling so expose themselves to be in the bathroom\nDo they get a hearing from it do they not get a hearing I mean isn't that ridiculous I understand what happened with a capital airing\nBut uh this country's out of control and if it doesn't straight now are there could be a civil war where the national guard protect our borders and if nothing else anyone living at listening out there should understand that\nYou know there are countries out there that are that are against us that don't like us and they want to sit down and they want us down in the dirt and this is going back\nFifty years and a hundred years we leave our guard down and we start carrying ourselves apart internally someone's going to make a move on us and I appreciate you taking my call sir\nAbsolutely no you know you're pretty articulate about it the only I don't agree with you for sure is a I don't I don't want to give a test to see because just because you're going to answer questions I guess your test would include questions about government and so on\nBecause I've seen very bright people don't and wisdom was because I have a master's degree and the doctor but I Know people doctors just because they have a degree doesn't make them very wise\nSo I don't think I Want to test for voting I Do want to make sure we had a caller about the integrity of the voting system that isn't real big trouble but I certainly don't want to test for voting but I I I Know\nI certainly won't don't want to make it easier like you can a motor voting rights you can or voting the day of the election\nThings you know or or voting even three months before things happen right that was a problem in Florida I think you know where where people had voted and they didn't get to see what happened the next few weeks I Want to be a reason for it I don't want to go out of my way to make a difficult\nBut there are people who die I remember in El Salvador they saw it online and they were bullets being shot at them obviously and bloody some of them to vote and they held up I don't know ... I Can't even think what color was they held it whenever they were using to signify that they had voted\nWe we don't take that seriously enough so I don't want to make it easy for the people here he sounds like I'm contradict myself to make it easier to people on a reform to vote the same token you can't ever voting in of\nCourse a test of course that was has a bad history in terms of the south terms of trying to keep the blacks from voting and others so that that's not my idea of not you know but I certainly don't want to make it so easy that they go through the DMZ and vote well go to the DMV the department of vehicles that's\nThat's a chore too so yeah I've got a story later weekly here at the Generation Z and giving it away and they're not voting because\nYeah I've got a story later weekly here at\nThe Generation Z I'm giving away they're not voting because they this is great they got their ballots I guess maybe ... through the Internet or whatever but they don't know where to get ... that's the true story middle kind of get postage stamps\nAnd I bet you there on the other side so maybe there was something to be on the caller was talking about\nLet's go to John in Denver, Colorado John you're on with mark\n[noise] hey mark [noise] uh I don't agree that the American civil\nWar the vast majority of Americans today or civil upstanding people were very bright line and the reason Trump got elected to the\nAmerican public are disappointed it I mean the legislator\nA home what got elected because he was an outsider and pick because he's a businessman and then the money that his business\nAnd he's very a proven and he knows when he's in a bad deal\nAnd he [noise] I think through a great job with foreign policy I I I really admired him that he puts American sovereignty first a lot of recognizing the international court system\nUp when you get the influences in our world a like a looming out either do to reverse they ... they're so\nPowerful and wealthy

I mentioned this last hour and have a drink with him at night\nAnd President Reagan will ask what had happened with all the vitriol during the day and Tip O'Neill way was speaking of the house at the time you said that's the day time does that night we're way past that and you saw us in a ground talking about that that these were his friends\nThat he he was saying all those things about because of what they've done their search for power\nAnd oh yeah probably now you can't even have a drink at night because look what it may have done to judge Kevin uh\nIt has become an all out war anything as I said and everything goes now lying is commonplace as with an image that's with Harry Reid claiming Romney didn't pay any taxes someone as friends or someone told them that wasn't true and he was a cold on that he said well it would work didn't it\nWas a total insanity of the charge that Kavanaugh was part of a group allowing for women to be gang raped so much so that even the New York times didn't print that accusation\nAll of it is fair game now and now any accusation is to be treated seriously if it has made this case\nBut on the left against someone on the right\nSo the assault you may have heard about this maybe you didn't hear about it that Keith Ellison may very well have made a else and sorry may very well made against this girlfriend is not important he's running I guess Minnesota for something I think it's one of sir turn in general are lieutenant governor whatever it is\nYou don't deserve the process of being a a a proven guilty just the accusation is not\nSo she may not have been politically motivated for what you used her you and your masters in deception used her\nThis is all just crazy and I I Love with Graham said he's going to get to the bottom of its suggesting that someone and then find science officer wanna Ford's attorneys may have been responsible for strategically delaying the leak deploying to lead to harm Kevin O's chances\nAre it's just amazing as he said those actually Senator Hatch so this the goalpost moving never stops\nAnd here's my summation and then we'll take your calls the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the ... to cross the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right\nThey chimed in because they too are left this group before they our civil liberties group\nAnd so they came out against this nomination and I quote the ... board of directors deeply concerned about allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to his longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh\nThey passed a resolution stating they oppose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court there aren't credible allegations\nViscerally ACLU allegations that judge Kevin O's engage the serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you see anything then that have not been adequately investigated by the Senate what would it be advocates adequate\nWhat does it Dr Ford's credible testimony subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct\nYou mean the great thing that even the times wouldn't publish the inadequate investigation maybe they can investigate better and judge Kavanaugh's testament to the air and leaders the doubt about it is a fitness to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nAnd this is not a decision take lightly we cannot remain silent on these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment of higher score to the land and trying to shorten it the standards for such an appointment on the burden is on the nominee\nThe burden is on the nominee to prove that something that happened how exactly does one\nDo that the burden is not met as long as there are hundreds of questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assault assault get it on resolved allegations so if they can never resolve it which they can't because there is no cooperation than while I can never be confirmed\nAnd it it goes on and on I I don't want to make your two depressed but there it is again based on allegations I Want to know I just want to know where in the past the ACLU wanted someone convicted because of allegations\nBut this is what the Democrats and the left have no soul there is no place to go with all of this except down in the gather and the loss of a piece of America tell me

have people going to the polls that are still kind of on the fence of where they're going to go you get a seven to twelve percent push\nAt those particular polling places where you have these friendly faces now it won't do any good if you got to curb margin that's all grumpy and you know wants to get in fights with everybody the the thing is is you just have a nice pleasant person there\nAre I

about that is true and I do you ever feel you're living on another planet I often feel that way I watch what goes on but it wasn't really about the spirit of the letter of the law it was about getting him\nAnd that's why the ... it was held for months or weeks whatever it was\nA ... you got to know what's going on and that's why in the they don't care if they've destroying anybody saw about power and Lindsey Graham out of the best it's all about winning any sense about cutting out for you know what\nA and these were his friends but no it's it's ... it's reached new lows that's wife knows just joining us I mentioned the first hour that we have a new civil war going on\nA with a soft civil war or not and it's a it's it's really a fight for the soul of this country let me know what you think

crime and cover up their life\nShe's a psychologist or a little girl boy it's raising me in collection at the end of this that the\nThat the virus technique or body language shrinking her head down toward her shoulders not that he not so great about what the people in the eye quite you know always that up or gay so think that stuff that can do when they're trying to get away with something I I think\nMitt forward as a liar I don't know what happened in that realm and don't care because there is no physical evidence can have in the country [noise] ah we presume minute than in a life guilt can be proven and there was no guilt proven toward Brett Kavanaugh any way shape or form and that makes myth poured a liar\nAnd that's that's really what she is out in California\nWe have a move but what for we have twenty three counties that have declared that want to separate them Cal Oregon for there all day and the liars here are in charge of government or they're in charge of every aspect of our politics at last we fight nothing's ever gonna get better [noise]\nWell I certainly agree with your and a lot of people said this about fighting back because otherwise we're going to lose the country I mean what made this country special is is it risks now left takes it over and good luck\nSo that morning couldn't remind him forget your name you know you use expressed is very well let's go

before they're released\nI'll either go ahead you hear me yeah now I can go ahead\nOkay um so I was saying you know kids to you when they start getting to the age of of even slightly paying attention to what's going on in the world they're twelve Fifteen Years old\nSo these kids started paying attention and for the next eight years\nAs someone that would have been ... says all this Obama stuff you know no winners and losers in field day now these kids are twenty twenty five thirty years old and all they know it was Obama so now I've got a twenty two year old daughter and a twenty year old daughter and they are both\nHate Donald Trump one of them refused to sit down and talk with me at all the other one I got to sit down and and talk with her and I showed her some facts kind of changed her a little bit and then and then I've got my ten year old that loves Trump\nAnd he goes to school and all the kids in his class\nThey dared Trump supporter so this generation that's coming that wasn't raised up in the mama I'm years\nTo complete my ten year old knows more about politics than my twenty and twenty two year old daughter too\nYou know and and I think that uh these kids when they grew up you know and basically and Obama years so we've got this generation and we've got another generation that's coming up that uh is gonna be hopefully the generation that saves us\nYou know so I just wanted to to you know kind of let you know about that and you know it's a generation gap that I see with my own kids from\nYou you got to get rid of your two older ones\nYeah that I see with my

majority\nUm that you're there they're they're afraid you're talking about fighting and that's what are the Democrats and the the liberals are doing they're I think I'm In the silent majority is you know they're afraid\nTo say anything like that guy you know earlier said that uh he voted libertarian you know instead of just coming out and saying hey I voted for Trump you know that's a very scary and you've got a small group of people\nWho are ... and the majority and I think this ... ... and uh all the spin\nOn it is really going to show at the polls were the we've got a huge silent majority\nI'm you know so\nWell I think they ... yeah yeah no I I think you're right I Know you guys are move me a little bit you know I came on pessimistic about losing the house\nI don't know just listening to an end by the way you try you also made a very good point\nWhich is and I said this before who the president is makes a difference who the people young people grow up with that is what they hear and that's what they learn right that's why during the Obama administration to get a lot of young people only hears that side and now the Trump although we have the media against us which hurts a lot\nBut if they see the economy's doing well and their lives are improving the lives of their parents that starts to influence them in more people like that ... in his own microcosm in his family\nThat ten year old is a Trump supporter and the ones who grew up with the Obama you can't even talk to them\nI Know that feeling [laughter] I have my own house so I Can't be hard on him let's go to a ... in Fresno, California Iran with mark\n[noise] hey how are you sir [noise] yeah I think\nYou're ready to argue that it was whether there was a civil war going on [noise]\nYep [noise]\nYeah

gonna say the best thing we can do instead of taking sides out of people's yards us keep winning this is one of the reasons why I like Trump because he's not only a fighter\nBut he's fundamentally change the Republican Party in a positive way late fighters out of the um [noise] and the media is complicit\nWhen you look at what happened the Steve ... but he was that guy he was an employee of the Bernie Sanders' campaign the guy dish that attempted\nMurder ... ... he was yelling this is what healthcare\nYou see what I'm saying it was I mean so you never most people never even heard of that Rand Paul was on the field you know he was not far from where the shooter was\nAnd that's one of the things he was yelling that he was shooting you take the children being separated from their parents or the pictures that you see most of those were generated under the Obama administration [noise]\nYep I appreciate your call very much but now you're national forecast for Romney tracks\nWe begin the week hopefully a little more quiet and uh we began the week last week with hurricane Michael in view we also had a tropical system move into the desert southwest over the weekend tropical storm surge geo\nProviding heavy amounts of rain to the desert southwest will continue to see rain today in South Texas now as you move a little closer into Colorado along I twenty five\nYou're going to pick up the potential for snow\nWe'll see mainly all rain as you get into Oklahoma and north Texas the rain showers will extend from central Texas today into the architects and lower Ohio and Tennessee\nOh it clear conditions are bound today for a good portion of the west west of the Rockies the northern plains will be clear the deep south drying out\nAnd that's the one thing that's one thing though Trump ran on you ran a round and and that issue in in the legal immigration was yelling at this this health care at where there's thousands or millions of people are paying more reunion more for their actions than before\nAnd and and you you how do you think they're going to go\nIn and and went in with a party that says are going to get rid of it in our ... which still there and if they get rid of it I Know they're going to win because I I Can't see them with with this ... Affordable Care act it ... which is which is not\nIn like to shake ... ditch attacks you can get repeal attacks like they got rid of it\nJust that that that's why it has gotten Robert me to act out of it in the margins unconstitutional the worries that choice for that and why is Nick how can we get the Congress should do with that you helped me\nWell are ... ... yeah I think I can I don't think they have courage or they're afraid you know\nThe poll numbers are actually I don't know if you can believe them but the poll numbers seem to show that the repeal is not as popular as was I don't know if that's accurate or not because we've had problems with the polls but you make another great point jury which is what I said there's John Roberts appointed by a Republican president\nAnd all of a sudden he changed on Obamacare we're pretty sure we're going to win that\nYou can't even trust her own which is how about for Democrats they complain about them Kevin Oh they voted ... you know the four votes they're going to be there every single time it doesn't matter\nYeah eight but even on the Supreme Court is the Republicans who deviate from what you thought they believed in again you're not supposed to question them on every single issue now they don't even answer it\nBut you couldn't even trust John Roberts ... good a Supreme Court justice who else then who's the awful won the suit or that the H a Bush a point that I mean he wound up being a disaster\nSo we we we have this problem and thanks so much for your culture the problem is\nThat people are not as you point out John McCain was probably trying to get back and President Trump but you can't even trust trust you don't have to worry when you vote for a Democrat when you vote for liberal when you vote for the left is that what you're going to get\nYour vote for our own I mean I I gotta tell ya I wasn't even sure that Susan Collins was gonna come down on the side of Kevin I was worried when she was going to give her speech I don't know if you remember a few hours before she gave a speech people weren't sure what she was going to do\nAnd they often you have people like Jeff Flake right to life dimension him\nUh he didn't even run again because it's so unpopular and hates another one that aids Trump so much\nAnd you could even be sure his role and what did he do uh a woman it costs them which looks like she may have been part of the ... gang but I don't want to say if if it's not accurate you know some of them were paid did you did you watch them by the way clawing at the Supreme Court will try to stop his nomination of these people losing it or what\nAnd that's why for those are just joining us now I said at the very first our we have a civil war going on but we can't even trust their own that's sensitive Jerry's question\nThey run as Republicans conservatives whatever and then they get in there I don't know if they want to be in favor at the parties or they want to get good press who knows what it is it gets them that's why I say this for years and it's a good time to say to the audience and now\nWe didn't first become Republicans and then the site on our principles we had a series of values and we said oh with those values then the Republican Party makes sense and if ever they deviate from that what is the point of being Republican what is the point if the party can stick to it what's the point of John McCain you know\nChanges his mind or voted or what he said he would do\nOr Jeff Flake 'cause he's angry at President Trump and we can go down the list of others like that\nBut you don't see the Democrats doing that now you could say you got mentioned in there but ... didn't Trump win West Virginia by forty points or something like that I don't think he had much choice and he tends to be somewhere in the middle but that's unusual\nFor the most part they never deviate and that's why I said in there and we'll take your calls\nThe if the Republicans lose the house of representatives\nGood luck the next two years they are going to have subpoenas they're going to have hearings that go into a peach President Trump there's no doubt in my mind if they have a majority they'll be able to do that in the house representatives they'll have hearings they'll try to teach the judge Kavanaugh\nThis is going to be chaos and I am sure one of the color set up a number of colors that you can go out there and vote you better get your neighbors to vote you better get your friends to vote this is serious stuff\nThis country will never be the same if these guys getting power and it doesn't matter if President Trump when's the next time if you have a house representatives that trying to destroy him and his people as Lindsey Graham pointed out they only care about power\nI mean I'm not going to say they don't have any principles any views but I'm just trying to say they think they're so right there so arrogant but anything goes and you saw it and you're watching it at the Kevin hearings\nThey they didn't care about ruining his reputation and in fact as I pointed out before they didn't even care about the Ford they didn't care so much about her she was in your case running for president next time and the same thing with Kamala Harris you can't trust these people [noise] we we know what they're in for you\nDish H.
