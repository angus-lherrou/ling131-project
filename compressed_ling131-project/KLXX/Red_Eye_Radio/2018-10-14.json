was up the award show where they know on the left no no no uh nobody in a lump was talking about his ah you know his mental state when a he said that uh George Bush a hates all black people because of Katrina didn't hang\nRight that that that that's not a because it again that's not a threat it's something at that time politically they could use a not so much the Taylor Swift award show moment but the the uh George Bush comment\nAnd it was notable to the left but they didn't they didn't labeled him as insane\n[noise] hey if you think\nIt's I I don't know by the way I don't know what uh uh uh

if you don't look at the video you're like is that Congress talking because his demeanor was calm and straight to the point\nIt wasn't the Taylor Swift moment [noise] it wasn't that it wasn't the moment or after Katrina that George Bush um it wasn't that it was something that the content of the comment [noise]\nReally couldn't be debated by the left so what do they do\nWell they go to the labeling and the name calling and then you know all of a sudden will now he's crazy which means he's not capable of making a thought at all you know this goes beyond the Mia Love thing [noise]\nUh you know and and the comments were all over the place you know the the token comment a from a Thursday or you know to the insane comment but the same comment is well he's not\nCapable he doesn't have the

Michigan Marianne welcome you're on red eye Radio Welcome to the show\nA high I really interested in what you're talking about and about the stock market going down the number of reasons like you said\nA including perhaps a political agenda with respect to some businesses\nBut the thing I called about is about our country being able to produce everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that which is why NAFTA was so bad the good thing about doing it here if we create more jobs\nNo its horror Mary it's horrible the last thing you would ever the last thing you would ever want to do is make a law that everything must be produced here\nBecause prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies\nThat would make the goods and services that you get prices would be much higher than they should be due to and retail doors shutting raft and right oh it will be the opposite for ... you would go in a massive recession if\nWe had a policy that we produce everything in this country\nPrices of goods and services would sky rocket through the roof\nIt's not whether you are capable of producing everything right here because yeah with modern technology\nFor the most part we probably could produce now there are some there are are are some rare metals that we don't have access to that we absolutely have to get from from other countries but said we even had those rare metals do produce everything here\nYou know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point\nA to a to get to we're not there yet but as we\nThe ... really one of the most underreported stories of the entire year ... is that the United states is now on it happened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of oil in the world [noise] mhm [noise]\nYeah [noise] um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did\nBy the way I think that's the number one reason icon is supporting a or the or the president his tax bill ... way way down\n[laughter]\nBut um the you know the [laughter] that'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the line too is that right so the but the but\nYou put in place all of those dynamics for a great economy and all it's working up until what the ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials is still hot and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly\nControlled by the government that is something that U.S policy put in place that doesn't need to be there [noise] look\nAnd we don't win and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property yeah we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even a for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a few things different in in TPP but remember the great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the ...\nCandle I had already agreed to that yes uh uh\nBut remember the great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in TPP\nCannot had already agreed to that yes uh uh you know ... before so that was lauded as a great victory and uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided you know not to uh to take that you and I went through and\nAnd and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old\nNAFTA the biggest victory that the president has claimed\nThat he claimed a was the fact that the tariffs worked\nTo get what he wanted with the automobile industry right along he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile in Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah\nNobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that's viewed as a victory well if I remember two of the president's major goals his goals his stated goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit [noise]\nI don't see how this does it because the majority of the new NAFTA does is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent ...\nAh and ah [noise] the rest is still the same right\nSo you ask okay what were the what were the because at the president's trying to make the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles what did you get you increase the cost of automobiles\nFor people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries and because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods\nTo you know producing them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite of the two things that you wanted a reduction in the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere\nWell and and the right now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry\nAre now you you talk about you know the farmers I mean if you if you say it's a very populist viewpoint right we need to help the farmer [noise] but when you think of\nThe role that they play and and the and the global market in terms of food\n[noise] ah you know set of before a few minutes ago but [noise] they feed the world that food goes all over the world um you\nKnow and and they're traveling the administration look your your your\nMoney that you gave us a thanks but no thanks we need the business\nThat's what we need and and that's the because\nForget about the political part president doesn't need them [noise]\nHe doesn't need to uh I Know everybody does it politically what this president doesn't need that and they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite\nRight because it is you know it's just protectionist policy which brings about\nThe trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers [laughter] it's I mean they get their government bailout with the ten percent mandate so I have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably scrambling\nWell in terms of of getting things done as you said it was it like it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced you know yes yes\nAnd and that's the other thing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the uh the supportive of a lot of people and other than I Know people who are otherwise conservative and say you know they supported the president they say well well this is all negotiation\nOr wait\nHe was a master negotiator why does he need the threat threatened and ultimately cost\nPeople a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get the ... to go see Asian done he's a master negotiator he doesn't need to do that\nWell as I said you know ... and again him or we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA right well and that's it except for the you know ... and you can look as we said you can look at it the one percent increase in the market share\nFor the United states in the Canadian dairy mhm but then they really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America actually ... but the president did allow ... what we\nExcept for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall\nWas that worse the loss of business\nWith the tariffs that the president\nHas put on that does raise the cost of goods and services\nAnd affected the cost of raw materials and other goods and services for American businesses\nAre businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule right because now but now he mentioned that but his big victory this is what the president said we're not is this isn't our opinion\nWas the automobile thing I got what I wanted in automobiles what did you get\n[noise] well we made it so some ah some employers of in Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour ... some have to do that won't find you've just made them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker\nRight ah and even with the was it I think it was a Wall Street journal said Boston I forgot who else said well it's only a two point five percent tariff so really isn't going to affect that it isn't that grade\nSo we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that\nBut the other than the president want to do is make sure that\nWe could in the United states seller vehicles overseas but that's less likely to happen because the cost in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up ... as to his taps on what what Mexico\nYou know could send us in cars before other terrorists hit ... we have an ... they haven't reached that cap\nAnd car buying in the United states has stagnated so they looked at that promote Canada and Mexico and said it's sort of like what they did in South Korea where they said okay you can only do we now doubled the amount of cars uh with the safety precautions to twenty thousand that we can sell\nAlison so see we doubled the market for the United states and the United states was only selling six thousand to begin with right they were ... were ... everyone emerging the cap well they're not read the caps have been set in NAFTA the two countries in Canada and Mexico are reaching that gave him enough buffer space\nSo it's actually not go into effect that it's more the ball it is symbolism over the substance said okay we're going to produce them here and not over there [noise]\nThat's run I radio show dot com\nThe red eye radio million mile club would

interesting looking at our sleepy and the map for the house race or the house races [noise]\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats\nAnd one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the toss up district still remains at thirty two and a two yes [noise]\nI Would love to see what your district that was a that that that shifted and ... and again not from Tulsa but from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those started to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number\nA for a majority [noise] right so right now\nOnly Nineteen those thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats [noise]\nSo it will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls are and we and we will more and more are in the coming weeks that's going to be the I think by the time we get back a week from Monday\nThings will start shaping up because those undecideds\nMore and more of them will start making up their mind and that that's where a shift happens and what is the impact of the capital and the entire\nThing and really look at the our CPA for example in Montana isn't a toss up state right with test or you know up or the last one was done you know nine twenty two which had test her up for the one before and and uh with the ...\nAnd before that was tester up just to why isn't that a toss up state why is that definitely there on the on the Senate race yeah unemployment rate right and and so but ... my point is though yeah is the legitimacy of\nThe R. C. P. average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\n[noise] well ... ... and [noise] I guess historically can shift happened ah with\n... if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done by the recent polls that were done in that race ah the the uh you know test her up by by four and the grab us a margin of error is three\nPoint seven so that you know that right there could be neck and neck are they calling a toss up because of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error once we ought to consider is not a toss up that's my point my point is it's our cp has it has definitely blue [noise]\nMm [noise]\nOn my map is still showing great it's just one great\n[laughter] I sit there and get it when it just wipe grey eye thanks to the staff at our cp for listening to us that it was it that way of what happened that just when it just when gray yeah All right I Apologize yeah I don't know if it updated it and then what I had was from a week ago or something\nBut it just went great extent tiny grain asked myself like I Do wonder am I looking at the right Montana well and the look and when you're pause and like and all of a sudden updates Edwards gray in front of me that\nBecause ... Arizona was in grade before\nOr Arizona was like blue would slash is or what men slightly favoring blues and I was going to have sat next because of mix Sally and all of a sudden boom that appears in that comes up is great\nAnd that because Mick Sally there's been a huge wing there okay in recent polls are going from\nAll right I'm going down Ari Sienna ... Santa and and now she's plus six that's a huge swing [noise]\nDifferent pollster\nBut it is a it's it's a pretty big swing so um and it is a it's a different uh the pollster in fact I'm\nWell okay I Know what I was looking at I had the one that said there's the RC piece Senate map and the one next with is the Senate know toss up\nOkay they don't include any taught some Senate that is what I was okay that's what I was a ... I Know ... if you click that that's and I thought that was their general analysis oh right right it it makes sense now that 'cause I was saying how can you call that\n... Montana and not be a toss up at this point right All right question answered oh by the way in it the wrong map [laughter] [laughter] the New York times CNN\nPoll this live pull that continues basically ah you know four days up until the election actually look at Tennessee\nBlackburn now are on the days ten eight to ten eleven Blackburn now ahead by fourteen [noise]\nWhat'd you say it was a political that did the article on bread is sending in his volunteers right furious that fact that he said he would have endorsed Kavanaugh\n...

listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly and update you so you understand completely what we're talking about are the Democrats accused the Trump a campaign of colluding with the Russians\nTo hack and or change the outcome of the election ... the evidence we found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a law firm\n... who paid and opposition research from\nA ... a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele\nWho got a information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order to change the outcome of the election by getting unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information as a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was a ...\nWell the cofounder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\n[noise] really now they ridge Virginia Republican subpoenaed Simpson on September twenty ninth\nOr after the lawyer said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committee\nSimpsons burned a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign by the law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\nFusion fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the CIA\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course a lawyer is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\n\nWell then what does ... say they're trying to find here's I either get are they going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think that's all right are are they going to ask him about ah ah who\nHe believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you are listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought that up\nOr I don't think so what are they going to ask him up on me I Would I be going to ask him about Kanye West [laughter] probably not they're probably going to ask him\nThey want to ask him up on me I Would I they're going to ask him about Kanye West [laughter] probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their role\nOr in\nThe uh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election [noise]\nSo here's my question [noise] thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife [noise] was employed at fusion GPS yes\nThe\nInspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the and an associate deputy attorney general\n[noise] ah\nThe inspector general would have than access to any communications if they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking\nOr does he oh he what he yes from the department of justice yeah well yes because it because it while they were done internally they run it on ride on an official yes device from the department and I and and again\nIf those are the ... that's the number of it right away from the point being is that you look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because your GPS doesn't want to cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that [noise]\nBut ah so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with a you know a\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do\nAs you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still preserved in any way\nWe we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fit mhm yes I have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand them what I Would wonder is a blend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't\nLet let's take him at his word mhm that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right then I Would ask his lawyer then\nWhat do you think they're going after right\nIf they're not well look at ... ... is is part of what they\nHypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing as a mall or investigation the Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russian collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the mother investigations is going\nIs at the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know of a fusion GPS committing any crime [noise]\nI don't know of one I don't know where there is any evidence of that you would uh concerning you know get gathering information and getting the money from ... thrown opposition research firm that just on the level is is that what you do you get dirt on the other\nParty's\nThat just on the level is is that's what you do you get dirt on the other party's candidate or whatever you do up as well the what they do opposition research is self explanatory so what is he worried about [noise]\nWhat would they be what what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about [noise]\n\nWell and and the heightening the timing is interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior out testify I'll go under out I'll do there are plenty of people that don't wander oh mhm so what is the crime that he is ... ... that what is the charge\nThat Glenn Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going to try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson [noise]\n\nOr is there someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating his firm [noise]\nYes [noise]\nThose are the questions that what they are those are questions on the investigator would have run into their ...\nYes that's all we're not indicting

there [laughter] if\nIt doesn't matter whether ... saying you know a a George Bush hates black people after Katrina or you know I support Trump the ... the one valid thing that he has set in all of this\nThat is you know in in and of itself is correct and true is that people\nShould be able to make up their own minds and it doesn't matter who they are what walk of life they come come from a they shouldn't be judged negatively because they decided to vote for one person or the other he said that on Kimmel I Believe based on your skin color you know and and shouldn't be based on your skin color\nAnd that's that's what it gets down to it right when you when you look at this and and you know the the\nTo the American people 'cause I guarantee you if you're a Democrat out here right now you know ...\nThat that was a stupid move by them right\nThat if they wanted to oppose cabinet posts cabin off but coming out with those statements that a woman is always to be believed everyone knows is pure trash yes nobody is to always be believed just because of\nTheir demographic their gender or race whatever everybody knows it's the evidence but they actually tried to sell that to the American\nUh uh the people and you think about is just it's just it's nuts and then by the time we got to the middle of the week it was the Democrats promoting instability including the mainstream\nOf the the Democratic Party or like a Hillary Clinton or we saw Eric Holder come up and backtrack or everybody knows that's not what I meant somebody wrote that don't use the word kick\nAnd you know to you know where we are uh you know right now looking at the polls and seeing how they're all going to react mhm [noise]\nYeah and it is it and it is also the wagging the finger toward people simply for believing in the process there they're being a indirectly condemned for doing so I'm just saying that you're essentially\nOn a person's side and that you support what we allege he did\nYour it which goes against it and think about it\nI I think the perfect example the perfect imagery is the ACLU what they used to be a seal use as to what they had become today that the presumption of innocence means nothing nothing to the American civil liberties union anymore it shows used as something of course what Americans understand and the ACLU probably did decades of a a damage\nOr to themselves by saying that doesn't matter that the allegation matters by taking a side instead of defending the constitution\nAnd that's when it gets down to and so like I said it's going to be really interesting to

well some of the Colts on that ... a good news is a Dow futures up ... of the president's state in yesterday that\nThat ah the plans are meeting with China again yeah and uh hopefully that's what this is helping the bounce back up because we looked at the bad news over the last couple of days with the\nFed dropping Thirteen hundred and we said there's nothing you can do and I think the president can do to stop what the Fed's going to do or not you're not going to stop nothing you can do to stop the borrowing or the interest on the bonds ... there's a ... on the regulation of attack as more of a Congress thing\nWhat can the president do the president can give optimism that we're going to get a deal done with China and he said we're gonna you know meet\nA yesterday and hopefully that's one of the reasons that the stock market is tempered today is the hope that uh a deal is going to be done yep\nYep yeah 'cause you see a sell off like you saw in the past couple of days and that's about people losing confidence in those companies that are issuing concerns over those raw materials especially but terrorists overall we'll see what happens with trying to for on the trucks here's your forecast there's been a bit\nWhere a snow rain line is set up for the early morning hours and we will see rain pushed to the east we can describe the snow area as being between I Seventy to the north I forty to the south\nI thirty five to the east and a twenty five and the west snow mixed precept and then all rain as you move closer to Texas a small band of snow will be moving out of North Dakota into the upper Great Lakes\nMainly rain just south of Detroit for areas of the coast will be dry today the east coast high pressure sunshine into South Florida all quiet on the western front including the Pacific northwest\nProbably going to say well Republicans are crazy because she's ... that\nThat might be how she defends himself which by the way well she does well that would have heard her because she is trying to position herself as somebody who was by ... so just assume that okay because we can you can hear\nIt already she was just talking about the crazy Republicans well not for somebody who says they're going to be a moderate and work with both parties\nBecause keep in mind I mean this is a the Jeff Flake said but it's also the state that was represented a by the late John McCain and the left hailed him after after he passed for being someone who essentially rose about politics and work with both sides actually that was\nNot the case in the end and they weren't describing it his behavior in the Senate correctly he moved to ...\nThey didn't move to the right to be clear but\nA bit on that on\nOn that point she is trying to position herself and appeal to the people that might have supported the John McCain right\nOr look a Cuomo can get away with saying conservatives are welcome in New York right yes even the ones that are\nThere because we know that right and and just being on you get a\nYou can get away with that New York yeah you can get away with probably saying it in California right and you can be a Democrat and say look I Know all of the people are nuts everybody here's crazy or not right\nAnd still get elected as long as you promote democratic values might be a little bit different in Arizona\nThat's that's where the differences because you had essentially to a historically speaking and soft Republicans\nAre remember he said he said that an extreme conservatives in a who oppose abortion and support gun rights had no place in this state yeah that's a huge number of people that are state\nDeath either by the way um you know this and this is that said that terminology thing and I I Know I'm splitting hairs in preaching to the choir in terms of our audience not gun rights it's my rights\n[noise]\nUh yeah the gun doesn't average out even doesn't that right I was going to have the right place at gun has no right to gun doesn't have any rights\nI assume all of the the guns rights when I put it in my cold live fingers it's the people's right\nYes a very interesting I just want to get to this topic because you happen to bring this up and I didn't know about this many employees on the Las Vegas strip fear being replaced by robots and you were telling me there's actually these and I'm looking at it right now that they've come up with these drink robots that will make bartenders obsolete desk\nAnd you can come at the design I've seen I don't know if this is in place in Vegas just yet but the design I've seen it also includes you walk up to the kiosk or the chaos cause even embedded into the counter like they do the are they actually have like a a if you go up to a bar and a gambling city\nOr for those who don't gamble or never been\nWhen you sit at a bar you can get your drinks actually for free if you're gambling and they'll put the right there at the seat\nThere is a video poker thing you could play mhm right\nBy the way the drinks not free [laughter] it'll cost you whatever you lose and\nVideo [laughter] to be clear you mean they're not giving yeah anything free now that uh uh just that they don't deserve to buy a bunch of alcohol and lose money on it no I'm the those are the [laughter] getting back to the robot thing\nI'm a I'm not sure what the strippers will look like\n... I ... but but for the bar is they'll move away from ...\nOh man oh no no no no right now bartenders robot brothels yeah I guess by the way we never really talked about yeah we didn't talk about Houston didn't we didn't talk about and we did last week uh well I mean\nYou know if you think about remember the old but I guess they still have them the coffee vending machine where would make you a cup yes yeah I always go back to terminate her to\nThe security guard making the or it was a ... that went to make a a cup of coffee didn't work out too well known as ... to walk up behind them and then became him which was weird but you think about robotics in serving food that's been around for a while but it will be different\nIn a bar like this where you go up and you basically uh order it you know and you know the type it in a you're going to in certain\nThe sudden the drink is going to be made and even delivered to you depending on the set up on the counter\n... by automation [noise] you know I think of John ... a guy who has a pretty good uh\nBusiness uh or has over the years in Las Vegas and also from ah the bar rescue [noise]\nYou're never going to see a well first of all there is no way to steal from the till I'm not blaming bartenders from for that I'm not condemning all bartenders but that does happen in the business and you know ... caught it\nWhere they were you know skimming or whatever from from the register but even to a greater extent pouring way too heavy\nRight ... robots not going to do this well either one but I here's the other point 'cause I was thinking the same thing I'd asked John tap or how far can you go with the robot bartender ...\nKind of regular Barbie all robots right and just a person walking around or do you have to her is is there a 'cause he talks about the science of a bar mhm and the science of the bar is about people and interaction\nAnd wrote a a a robot can't be pleasant\nTrust me I Know a few of them well a robot also can't be angry either ... it'd be an angry bartender right\nOr can't be a drunk bartender [laughter] well that's that but how how far do you go with the science of it I I can see this working totally in a place like Vegas where the focus is gambling not not communicating with the bartender or not walking into your corner bar\nSo my wife and I uh recently went to a place that had\nA robot roulette wheel\nNow we walked by it several times\nWe didn't we didn't look at it\nBecause it was often like they have\nA a a a what would you say it it's there's there's there's poker and blackjack where you walk up and the screen has you know a dealer but it's it's animated right and so that you know the the whole tables animated the cards or animated\nWell on this roulette that's what I thought I was ... that I thought it was all animated it's actually it's it's an actual wheel in the center [noise]\nAnd you don't you're not close to every one it's not crowded like a real roulette table\nAnd so we thought okay let's see how this works and it was interesting we played it for a few minutes and it was interesting because I said you know that's that's not the animation thing is still gives you the view of a real roulette wheel right and that's important for a lot of people they don't trust ... well\nIn in the case of a a a Vegas and in a in a bar setting there's a couple of settings you're going to be a nightclub kind of setting in night clubs are huge in in Vegas\nUm where they don't care they just want to drink\nIt's not your pub riding where's where the bartender right they needs to be pleasant needs to be a companion for and carried maybe a little bit of a conversation on with you in Vegas it's not that it's not that for the most part it's either the gamblers or\nAh like I said the nightclubs and no one cares anything except about\nThe alcohol when it comes to the bar is all about the alcohol\nOr it'll be interesting to see how far this goes\nI Want to be alive when they come out with the home version of the robot bartender [noise]\nAh yeah ... you're walking your house and they basically you've got bottles that you insert vodka whatever I mean right ten different types of alcohol that you put in their front and the mixer and\nBottles that you insert vodka whatever I mean right ten different types of alcohol that you put in their right and the mixer and everything else and then you just walk into your house and\nYou say Alexa give me a screwdriver\nThere you go out and then she hands you ...\n[laughter] I Know like so [laughter] I doubt it oh my God [laughter] and then it's ... alcohol no lights out drinking alcohol [laughter] hey I Want to get drunk [laughter]\nHey six eggs inside the red eye this engine report is brought to you by Detroit\n...
