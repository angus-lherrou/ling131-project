friends with his father who is a Democrat and jets recently on Facebook he's asked me to not contact him anymore and please I trained him\nBecause I'm a Trump supporter and I just found that that devastating because that that you know over ten year friendship and he's willing to throw it away just because we think differently and I don't see where that is necessary\nYou totally support my

mark someone who had really diametrically opposed refused to you\nKnow why not I mean if you're compatible in every other way and you you why why there's one little facet of our lives to find everything you know of course I could\nHave played by like you're ...\nYou're consistent but I'm going to play devil's advocate okay\nBecause it doesn't politics get into values somewhat about what people care about right or as an example and I'll get in trouble with this I think a lotta times single women who vote Democrat or looking for the government to take care of them are and so the you start to get into your values system I think\nSo now I'm going to play on the other side maybe not marriage because it may affect lots of things I'll give you another one maybe this is very I teach my students values or what should count not so much and I say it's my pin you don't have to agree with me not so you know looks are obviously important at the beginning but that fades over time\nIt's if the person's values that you should care but here's one what if you are religious as an example because of that because you're conservative and you believe in God and the other side doesn't so if you have kids some day\nYou're obviously going to fight about that you want them to go to church or whatever she wants no part of that so I hear I'm almost contradictory myself I Do understand if it's going to be something really permanent\n... share the same values and he isn't this one of the values and I'm not saying not to be friendly\nBut I that's why I'm saying I Want to ask everybody to could you marry someone and you were very consistent he said sure why not it's one thing\nAnd when I'm pointing out there maybe it's not just one little thing maybe\nAnd he too could you marry someone and you are very consistent he said sure why not it's one thing and when I'm pointing out maybe it's not just one little thing maybe it's something very important what do you think about that\nYeah well I mean we're all Americans here I mean [noise] yeah I guess it could be some ramifications down the road but I mean if you like me and my girlfriend get along and we have a good will pour with each other and I love her and she loves being I mean\nI you know I I I Can't imagine that coming up to the extent I mean I'm fifty eight so I don't have to worry about children which is a valid concern but I mean hey you don't want to go to you know people my mom and dad my dad was a southern Southern Baptists my mom was a Roman Roman Catholic\nThey got along fine for fifty five years you know I I guess you don't love each other's noses and that you learn to live with the other person it's all of marriages without compromise anyway so\nThat when you're good my producers not as good as you he\nHe he said to me you're going to be divorced than five years anyway if you marry someone at the opposite views feelings is being cynical well you you have a good attitude about it and you are consistent when I challenge you said yeah what what's the big deal and you're it's very fascinating that you said on the social media sites\nThat it's only one side this stuff you know be a Trump

Thanksgiving or Christmas and most of my Irish Catholic relatives are very hard core left his which brings me to shame because I Know what my ancestors went through when they emigrated here and I appreciate that everybody has their own opinion\nBut the reality is you want to enjoy your meal and be grateful for the meal you have so that way you can appreciate the difference of opinion later on I mean I I admit back in Ninety two I was disgusted about Clinton\nBut I never told my cousins or my my answer that we're going to talk to you guys I mean that to me to me I Hope most Americans and most of the American people view that as being immature and stupid and there is going to be a long term repercussions for it\nAnd I I wanted to ask you a question if I could I Know you you find this brief\nSure well\nAnd the People's Republic of New Jersey as in other states like the left coast when there are candidates that are running for federal or state office\nYou don't see Democrats or Republicans giving a lukewarm endorsement to pro choice or pro life very there are there not whereas on the second amendment\nThere are a lot of Republicans who do not even remotely even answer even the simplest questions than we are just some eyes this voters that don't worry once this candidate gets in\nHe or she will support the second amendment I I don't see the left\nDoing that on a faith basis for pro choice Democrats and yet some Republicans like Utah means Romney are we really to believe that heaven forbid mittens Romney as a U.S senator he's going to support the second amendment and I mean given his track record I mean come on\nHas voted for for president but they gave me just the idea of having another left wing gun grab or the U.S Senate on the Republican side doesn't appeal to me any more than the Democratic party candidates\nI think what you see ...\nI just I I Would there be some accountability I mean their Senate races Florida's Governor Scott\nHe just signed

and I I predict if all the senators in the east coast I'm left coast states get elected as Republicans I anticipate they're not even gonna do anything for the second amendment that I'm not saying that brought a monkey wrench don't just it's disgusting how\nI mean you know everybody to get a question mark next to the name of the candidates on the line when you look him up I mean\nThey can answer yes you know yeah yeah and I but I don't want around you and I think if you didn't make a call ...\nAbsolutely but did you made a big mistake I think he used the word monkey wrench which got the candidate for governor in Florida in trouble right we're not supposed to just use that neural talk he must be racist even bring that up one of the things I was gonna say do you that uh it's amazing that the other side\nWe're not supposed to just use the normal puck you must be a racist even bring that up one of the things I was going to say to you that uh it's amazing that the other side doesn't imagine

controls the United states of America can throw up the road back to you\nOh yeah no I I agree and you know you may not it sounds like you're discouraged 'cause you're a libertarian and they never win certainly any big off since then I have friends who are libertarians obviously I say obviously because on my side but I Do have people Democrats were my friends and so on but\nThe report but she

troll ... April it controls that I mean it it is what it is\nAnd and you know when I hear you say you know people hate the conservatives are they hate this\nYou know hey is a very powerful word to bury power or um you know I Do like some of the people in the other party I mean I'm a I'm a conservative no matter what I Love what Trump's do it\nUm you know I I Can't believe that a not a Kennedy\nBy now uh you

on with mark\nMartin Morning [noise] hey I'm real good topic I uh I'm actually calling into a little story about my sister but I wanted to also say you know Facebook [noise] I've I've shutdown Facebook just because even if I had it with my friends and family\nOnly I still found endless arguments on there for I mean just for no reason you know it's almost like they were\nTroll blaming waiting for me to say something and then they\nWere all along you know um it almost feels to a point sometimes when I'm Talking to people I Can't even really say what I where I stand because people just get annoyed at the name Trump sometimes you know a ... but with my sister even\nBefore the election actually happened um I I don't even I don't even think I think it was still between a cruise and Rubio said\nJust hang in there um I was just thinking of a you know people are funny that way I worked at a at a station ... in uh Los Angeles as I said I don't want to say too much about it except for one of the hosts had a\n... have this a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to see what he did but it was it was pretty famous at us in this day\nAnd they didn't talk for a Twenty years or something and then um one day a host said to me you know mark or her father died\nAnd she didn't even know it and I had to tell her the news and she said I'm a while I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked for I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that finally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him\nBecause she disown them all those years for personal reasons so one has to think that eventually you hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short\nBut when you hear the family stories a brother and sister daughter whenever that because of politics\nThey disown their parent or their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship\nJust over politics and you see that almost always on on the left hand side\nVery discouraging but are brought up the topic because it does happen it is something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nMark it's great to talk to you I'm I'm going to get a you know Republican and conservative my whole life and I went into the ... right after high school\nAnd um and most people um that I met in the military were because because they felt like the Republicans were the only one that would ever support\nA raise for you know the military pay that kind of you know just said okay well that's there for me and then after that I'm probably went on um when I'm\nThe first are you\nWent on um when I'm the first I'm\nA Gulf walk him about um I just remember you know listening to on the radio and and just being like I Need to find someone that talking about this 'cause at the time I was driving a lot and and the spending a lot of time the car and\nI'm just wanted to listen and you know he's found conservative radio and you know I never really talked about it with other people\nUntil people started asking me who you're going to vote for oh why you are voting for them and it was like people started coming to me and pulling it out of me I wasn't I was pushing anything on them and\nUm and when it came down to the Trump it was like for a lot of people around me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and they just walked away from New friends and relatives just stop paying my friend and I\nAnd they just how can you you know I have to use for someone who's just you know terrible and I'm just like you don't understand I get mad at Republicans for Twenty years for letting the media and the and the Democrats walk all over I mean this guy won't let anyone walk all over him\nAnd he's doing conservative saying since to make our country better and\nYou know I still see people rallied against him and I'm just like wait a minute we have the greatest economy in that we in the country's ever seen you know we have I mean I'm the jobs for a truck driver so that keeps five thousand dollar bonuses for somebody to start that job\nYou know I mean\nFor construction jobs that are just they don't have enough people to do them and they and you know these tech jobs that pay huge amount of money ... ... you know that you get the right degree you can get a great job if you if you don't have a degree you get Dr driving a truck working construction and\nYou know everyone seems to be still upset and close to stand back and look what's going on but you know I I had a friend\nTell me right to my face that I get so mad at you when I when I read the things you wrote that I just want to shoot you in the head and she made the hand signal like he was pointing a gun to my head and I I just feel so hurt by that and\nYou know I I haven't talked to our attention that was you know nine months ago and it just seems like a lot of my friends are just like ... you know we can't be friends with demand that because she likes tunnel Trump can I just don't want to be around her anymore and\nIt it is hurtful and um\nYeah I had some time I just felt like I was the most hated person on the Internet because on top of this I'm a transgender woman so a lot of people on the right hated me for the trans up people in the left heated me because I like Donald Trump and\nYou know my family a lot of people my family disliked me because I've transition and and also because I'm a Republican and then I have a ... ... people that looked at me and like how can you be Republican nephew chance he hates us and I'm just like nobody does it\nYou know and so it's like all these angles for coming at me telling me that I'm wrong for being who I Am and I don't think there's anything worse than my people telling you they can't accept you for who you are\nAnd and it's it's just horrible well\nFeel your pain and I use the bill Clinton line but\nI can hear the sadness and you know my heart goes out to you can imagine what you're going through a is it's tough enough or the challenges that the regular life holds for all of us here alone or when your friends or a band than you and maybe some family members to [noise]\nIt's pretty discouraging I think you need to find new friends you know people who at least will share your Republican views\nWith and I think you're going to find a not everyone but a lot more Republicans are tolerant despite the fact that we have this view that we're not tolerant people uh that you know we're racists bigots and all my phone has a all this kind of stuff\nWhen we're not you just have to find the right people and and maybe it is that time to do that and maybe joined different organizations but that may\nHave ... I have a volunteer work for a Jeff dolls I was running for Congress in my area and Jerry Connelly and ...\n... is an army veteran and they they um that you know African American and Jerry Connelly the older white guy in there for ten years called him a racist it's just like I said yeah\nBy the way I've got I got to think if you're a service and and my advice to you didn't ask me is just hang in there and there are other like minded people but you know in this world\nIf or when I ask people many good friends do you have in some people re say nine and some say one and some say to it's hard to find good people it's hard to find special people I just want you know you're not alone that way that we all have those kinds of challenges maybe not your particular challenges but we all have our own Lincoln I think that\nThere is someone I don't like all have to get to know them better\nUh it it's tough life is very challenging and and can be very stressful and it's hard hard enough now we have the different colors are said we've reached a new level where\nYour political views are enough to lose your friends let alone anything else so my advice to you sound like a nice person just keeping their don't give up and and try to find like minded people okay and you have you have a great night [noise]\nUm ... the thing I just brought this up because I Know it's a real issue\nJust imagine aside in this country whereas some causes set including my young friend there were all Americans to the final analysis John Kennedy said that even about the Soviet Union that we all bleed the same air you know what is this stuff\nPretty sad to see this in America and today let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine or seven thirty three thirty nine\nBooks with ... radio toll free ... be ...

I. mail is that going to be a problem and she said no\nUm I went through this my wife walked out on me a twenty five years ago because I wouldn't stop listening to your affiliate and I'm like I said I have to be extremely careful [noise] um what I say around the neighbors\nThat is just truly amazing she was helping you out\nYou know ... ... and I told her I said you know my former wife how nasty ... she was\nAnd she doesn't make any difference you voted for Trump and like I said I could never vote for Hillary she remodeled room or former wife\nMhm Mm [noise]\nOh boy I'll tell ya thanks for your call and you know you got to find Republicans who have compassion which is not hard and you know often is porno not you know they're good and bad served as good or bad liberals and so on I'm not trying to say that\nBut you you just hear these stories are blind used to read his mail and now she refused to read his mail he voted for Trump I didn't even expect some of the stuff let's see what's going on because in Canada let's even bad in Canada use caffeine ... Ontario you're on was mark\nAnd mark thank you for taking my call wow [laughter] it's a whirlwind um and as you say\nIf you like Trump or my husband and I we both follow its very carefully what's going on in the U.S and the states and we absolutely love Donald Trump\nAnd um there's a big problem we have to be so careful of what we say shit here the CBC which is\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corporation right for candidate [noise]\nThey report the news coast to coast and they are all the people the last say the Trump bashing every single day every chance they get\nThey just I don't know what is going on and with people my daughter just graduated a couple of years ago from best journalism school\nAgain Canada and she had to be so careful when she was going through the course or to lean bit lean on the left right\nBecause here you can't get a job in Canada's professor if you're not ... [noise] really laugh\nAnyway they don't present both sides of the story edge that at any of the universities here as far as I Know and their children today are being brainwashed it's a social\nUh it\nIt's terrible what's going on\nAnd I don't know ... people now my rights\nTo assume that people in Canada are pretty far left I mean you got your do though he's pretty pretty far left you had a good prime minister before that oh I had I Believe is\nWonderful ah and we had our um our debt was not a big deal at all we hardly had actually had a balanced budget and everything was Harper and soon as they put him in a to do\nBecause of his name uh you know what he graduated from was um ah what do you call that acting um\nActually yeah that's where they went to school for acting thing or a billion [laughter] during his\nActing you thanks for your call he's the acting prime minister he still continuing the official prime minister I play it makes you ever wonder why we ever will election on our side her body's telling us they're surrounded by liberal\nAnd the lady one reaches mail anymore daughters sisters a son it it just doesn't seem to matter how ... how do we ever win elections\nWell I guess we're just finding the people that that won't talk to us and the friend us so we don't get you know the people on our side wouldn't do that so you don't know who they are let's go to well I don't know if we have time for one more call it wouldn't be that fair to you\nBut I'll tell you this ... is a new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and say I got to be careful what I say my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... or the when they found out what my views were I was in big trouble\nI've been to a friend did I mean is this the McCarthy Era of member McCarthy who is you know calling everybody communist and with whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what it's come through and let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this\nI Am a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show host let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that it was probably a conservative\nTalk show hosts are some liberals are most of them are not among many good you know what shepherd I been what what kind of America to we have in twenty eight teams when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about All right let me know what you think but now you're national forecast for video road log\nDangerous flooding continues in Texas\nThere'll be a little strange today to the forecast more showers for central and north central Texas today on top of what we've already seen there look for an additional two to four inches\nThrough the day today and tomorrow it'll be clearing in Dallas by Sunday for the Gulf states look for coastal showers thunderstorms for eastern Florida Today\nHigh pressure from the east and west coast a metal mean clear skies don't look for clouds in the inner mountain west or the west coast also the deep south will be\nMainly dry today New York city fifty nine degrees and clear rain late tonight but ending by tomorrow in Chicago we've got rain showers in the forecast fifty five the high clearing by tomorrow and Los Angeles California the fire whether watch continues for today the ... will be eighty seven\nSome of the things people are writing and you know it was opposing me but I thought I don't want to jump in here and and you know say something on lights you regret or anything but I Know people that don't even talk to me because it was revealed on Facebook how I felt you know\nUh back when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good a with a lot of relationships you know\nWhen I started to go in your direction first of all I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kind of stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned to like you kind of indicated I've learned not to say much about politics in ... when they know I'm a talk show host and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave your lawn gets their chance to you know trying to\nSay all kinds of things that they can say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but\nIn general uh I Try to stay away from it I think the social media right\nAnd that does some good but the like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever used Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the radio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious with the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things are happening they're finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you have ... five years\nAnd I admire that Tom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on was mark\nMark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color out you're still listening I I I Do a lot of community radio up here where I'm at\nAnd she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know all the duct tape is she CBS NBC or just regurgitate it everything [noise]\nThere's a bright spot and let the Canadians we're aware that the U.S electorate we're going to do it fast can not get the candidate that the media was trying to\nFear that the U.S electorate we're going to do it fast to not get the candidate that the media was trying to and us\nAnd that worked out in the end so all that horrific stuff that came off of a a fault Kennedy and I'm a\nAt a Charles Adler and uh and right and uh and and green or\nAll of that probably helped a jet of Obama or get a Trump elected because it was trying to hurt for when we're coming down from Canada like that and uh but the reason I called was so we'd already been told\nA for your Twenty years Thirty years that ah you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and you know the racial issues that we had to confront\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected she ignored his mandate and he went\nClear off on another Chang judge and things got worse so we were very very disappointed a you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama will review review disappointed and it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise] ...\nWell I think if they voted for him because they want to show they weren't prejudice that was a mistake you know color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is then he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was when he first came out I Am not to mention his personality in terms of dropping of billionaires and who's the rent Reverend Wright and pretended that the you know they weren't as friends any more you can see who he was\nYou get to know someone sometimes by a their character I uh I mean people can pick on Trump that some things he says and does so it's not foolproof\nBut I knew he was far left he he really has got closer and closer he's in high def for for half a second I'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him\nProbably as much as people dislike trouble then is a high bar I've got to admit that ah people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in ... Illinois you're on with mark\nHey mark a I've got to average ... observations and then a point to make\nA first of all you notice all the calls that you have coming in [noise] it's\nAlways the liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the observation and then also you had a caller who said was touting that she was highly educated [laughter] yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem with or liberal friends and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise in the power of the individual\nNot the state and isn't it funny\nHow the left can sit there in town for individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country which specifically states that we have powers are as individuals and not not the state over us as individuals but\nThey are fighting for their own demise when they fight against\nBoy you said that very very well and I by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights that they're so far out there than you know they claim they're against fascism is example with antifa but they're fascist themselves\nThey it when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about what does this group think what does that group think\nOr they want more power for the federal government whereas we think it as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives so\nThat yeah I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right to pretend to be the little guy and\nThey they care about my minorities and they cared about the basically for no they didn't\nThey just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left for the old Democrats that you could count on to be moderate to scoop Jackson's of the world of course John Kennedy a lot of people say when the tax cut that he gave he'd be Republican today\nThe Democrat Party that I as a kid supportive and someone said one of our caller said then they left me um

usa for a long time but why don't you tell her audience ...\nShore high numbers usa is that nations are just grass roots organization\nA focus on ... at of course is concentrate also ahah we talk to on illegal immigration as well but our ... going on I was on ... ... and now that sustainability\nYeah did you say your primary you're getting cut off a little bit there did you say your primary job was league you know folks in legal or illegal immigration\nI our primary focus is focusing on on legal immigration that of course illegal immigration a lot of people come here legally eventually becoming become illegal immigrants so so we focus so we do we do spend some time on illegal immigration as well\nDo you ah support legal immigration or have certain numbers of that you'd like to see\nWe do for a obsolete support legal immigration a local support is is ... family on ...\nOr so that means that we support handing chain migration which is\nWhich is extended family reunification strict immigration ... um we support ending ... we would like to see the visa lottery ended as well we'd like to see 'em as we'd\nLike to see that the uh employment based green cards are given out to highly skilled workers where there is truly a need and the American workforce for those kinds of workers that are coming in\nSounds a lot like the administration's position right away the ending chain migration and a supporting these is with high end talent ... with the press is\nUm there there are a few areas um we we do we support the administration scored sending chain migration I support sending movies the lottery um it it uh support\nFrom tighter restrictions on refugee admissions we believe that we should be taking in our fair share of of internationally recognized refugees but at the same time\nAnd the Jordan commission recommended uh\nWhat what we we advocate for today is it called for ending chain migration and ending the visa lottery and reducing legal immigration to their recommendation was to reduce it down to about five hundred fifty thousand\nWhich at that time the current level was about a million which is around words that today so so there was bipartisan support for this but you had a huge\nPush over the years especially in the early years in the in the mid to late nineties you had a huge\nPush from big business U.S Chamber of commerce groups like that that that always want more workers because they look at us as as a a\nA supply and demand issue if you have a large pool of labor than you can keep wages lower it's just simple a gas price supply and demand\nType type theory I'm so ... you had the big business groups pushing for more on immigration and in the mid to late Nineteen nineties but then you start to see more of the special interest groups the immigration attorneys um some of the some of the um\nSome of the more ethnic base groups after that to thousands start to get a take a large interest in in legal immigration naturally when you started to see the big shift in the Democratic party\nSo that you know I during the week I've been mentioning so you had the conspiracy it's not a conspiracy but the mutual coming together adventurous the Democrats who want more votes they see the power Republicans would call them a country club Republicans like the wall Street Journal\nI told my listeners they start the title of the editorial he would say a ... as if they were going to talk about illegal immigration and somewhere in the middle aged which on me and talk about how great immigrant in this war and I thought OK you

on the attempt to buy the Honduran refugees to come in here would be refugees as I said before but the ... there's a fulltime job you're right\nIt is yeah yeah it is it it it keeps us busy there I mean very very few times it's on ... on the ages of our nation's major newspapers 'em or not being discussed somewhere I think I've been with numbers just over ten years now and I think we've had maybe\nSix months where nothing has nothing has really gone on over those over the years but typically there's usually always something going on there's there's always another caravan heading that way or something called\nCatch and now you're national forecast for Romney tracks\nFlooding continues in Texas there'll be little change today to the forecast more showers for central and north central Texas today on top of what we've already seen there look for an additional two to four inches through the day today and tomorrow it'll be clearing in Dallas\nStates look for coastal showers thunderstorms were eastern Florida Today\nHigh pressure from the east and west coast a metal made clear skies don't look for clouds in the inner mountain west or the west coast also the deep south will be mainly dry today\nBut Mexico is least giving the appearance\nThat that they're going to try to stop this caravan from from reaching the U.S Mexico border um\nThat they're taking it fairly seriously at least they're giving an impression that they're taking it very strict barely seriously so off to see what actually happens when they when they reach Mexico's southern border and want to gain entry into that into Mexico to get up to the United states\nBut again that the caller was absolutely right what they're going to try to do is they're going to try to game our asylum system once they get here they're either going to try to get in illegally undetected or they're going to come through a um a port of entry and claim asylum or\nWhen they if they do try to come in illegally undetected but get detected apprehended by border patrol then they'll entered their asylum played by defensive asylum ... but again they can't enter an asylum plea unless they get into the United states\nSo my recommendation is keep 'em outside of the United states see if Mexico will allow us to move out\nOkay if you seriously wanted me consider or as a ... here in the United states than what we'll do is we'll send our asylum I bet you to cater to you will hear your case and then we'll only allow you into the United states if you pass through the initial tests which is a credible fear test but I think\nThat I mean again ... you will want to rent that when we both agree wait a second it's mark now they want to bet when we both agreed with you [laughter]\nYeah yeah I'm well here's your Here's New here is not a problem we we got her over here you know what they're called the call they're called homeless sixty thousand people and in in California and sneak in their bedroom and the women children\n... and ... ... ... why ... why every teacher with the other people's problems\nWhen we got her if you can't you can't take care of the Iraqis are homeless refugees year that's not going to bring out here in Philly they take care of that\nI said let's never met a meal of the euro's near where they came from MIT their bedroom and take care of them in the responsible dish I we should try to take care of our homeless vets\nAnd and and women and children ... she was saying\nOh I'm selling that I'm going to lead Chris and we do found or you can go ahead ...\nYeah no no I couldn't agree with you more and that and that's the reason why we take the position that they take on immigration or we want to reduce legal immigration law those as well because we have our own issues here in the United states that that we need to take care of now when we're dealing with foreign aid\nOr money do we give to other countries to think there's a there's a number of different things that we can do it the first that plays a little bit more ... to while for policy type ...\nSo there are strategic reasons why we provide foreign aid to some of these countries that we we provide\nWe provide aid to I think just as as as the world leader you know the United\nStates is the biggest strongest nation on earth we do have to take a little bit of responsibility to make sure that there is you know that that that there are human rights violations and governments oppressing their people things like that around the world and we will have always done that throughout our at\nYou know throughout our two hundred two hundred and fifty year history [noise] um so when it comes to that but I think there are also\nOther things that the government can do I think the government can courage business to go down at a faster some of these countries maybe give them some sort of a tax break for investing in some of these more needy countries in helping to rebuild those countries so there are other ways besides just foreign aid\nBut but I think going back to your original point couldn't agree with you more I think that's why we can't take\nA break every single person in in every other country that happened to be living below the poverty level because we have from Americans who are struggling in the United states today that we also need to take care of we need to put them first and that's what we need to do we need to start putting America First ahead of the rest of the world's problems\nNow and I want you to clarify this for me see if I understood it so someone just gets their lego over on our side of the border they can then legally request asylum\nThey can they can legally request asylum ethics and\nThe definition of asylum though is you have to have your persecution back the whole country song your government because of their race religion political views or a social group that you belong to that spot just federal law but that's also an awful lot\nHowever what we've seen over the last decade or so is that they're very very first step\nTo claiming assignment you're in the United states is that you have what's called a credible fear interview and in that interview you say that I have a clear a returning back to my country because of [noise]\nWhat happened was we've lowered the credible your standard so that somebody could claim a criminal gang violence or domestic abuse or or something like that but it got hooked on to the actual that an accent of\nA sigh Lee is so because of that\nWe allow people to claim asylum who don't actually qualify for asylum by the time before and file objects that case rejected and they're and they're sent back home\nSo what the what ... what by attorney general Jeff Sessions that by the
