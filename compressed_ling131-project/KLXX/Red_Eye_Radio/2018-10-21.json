a step to Cuba doesn't get killed off or to Venezuela and and see how that works out for them that socialist life\n[noise] yeah but they they don't know that right no you're good but they\nAnd now that that's why why does the capital and I'd go down there and play football and see how that works out for him\nYou know people just aren't educated [noise]\nKnow what I mentioned Bruce or something last night one of the things you said on my show years ago was\nEvery generation has to learn what makes America exceptional over and over again because certainly if the schools aren't doing it and ... knew that if they can indoctrinated kids get them early enough they'd have future generations of voters but you're absolutely right they except for people like me they never hear the other side I get both sides they don't even know what party I mean\nBut they never hear well why Bernie Sanders during right\nFor people like me they never hear the other side I get both sides they don't even know what party I mean but they never hear well why don't you can just can\nYou can write but the opposite president sets the man is a pure communist [laughter] I mean what's your name Hillary Clinton is assault landscape personified I mean it was the rock Obama ... why do we want these people to turn this country into what ... is\nRight why\nBecause you're asking me you know I'm On her side to it\nWell people don't understand they don't how evil communism is was they don't know I remember I quoted Michael Moore the when they do in our capital planning on let me just finish for wait hold hold on hold on one second I caught him you know it's okay\nI go to Michael Moore when they said to him he said he doesn't win capitals and they said to him so what would you replace it with and he said we haven't found yet\nSo even there are some people are proud of don't even yeah that's what he said uh you're but you're absolutely right because they've never heard the other side and they think the young people think today that socialism is wonderful they have no clue because\nThey've been taught that\nYou know I mean it's I I'm sure you've taught civics in school to you're taught how the government works to three branches and we had to learn that we had to run a court case these kids today they they don't they don't mean man in the street I Need to ask people these questions and they don't have a clue not a clue\nAnd the building and the next election\nI mean I think there needs to be certain criteria for being able to that maybe you need to be a landowner have to have a have

Canadian Broadcasting Corporation right for candidate\nThey report the news coast to coast and they are all\nThe people the last say the Trump bashing every single day every chance they get they just I don't know what is going on and with\nPeople my daughter just graduated a couple of years ago from past journalism school\nOkay in Canada and she had to be so careful when she was going to the course or to lean bit lean on the left right\nBecause here you can't get the job and Canada's professor if you're not\n... really loud anyway they don't present both sides of the ... at at any of the universities here as far as I Know and the children today are being brainwashed it's a social\nUh it\nIt's terrible what's going on and I don't\nKnow ... people now my rights to assume that people in Canada are pretty far left I mean you got your do though he's pretty pretty far less you had a good prime minister before that oh I had I Believe is\nWonderful ah and we had our um our debt was not a big deal at all we hardly had actually had a balanced budget and everything was Harper\nAnd as soon as they put him in a to do because of his name uh you know what he graduated from was um\nAh what do you call that acting um ...\nYeah that's where they went to school for acting\nThing still doing it [laughter] so bearing his\nActing you thanks for your call he's the acting prime minister he still continuing now the official prime minister Ali point you make\nAnd election on our side everybody's telling us they're surrounded by liberals you blind guy the the lady one reaches mail anymore daughters sisters a son and it just doesn't seem to matter how ... how do we ever win elections\nWell I guess we just finding the people that that won't talk to us and the friend us so we don't get you know the people on our side wouldn't do that so you don't know who they are let's go to well I don't know if we have time for one more call it wouldn't be that fair to you\nBut I'll tell you this ... is a new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and say I got to be careful what I say my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... or the when they found out what my views were I was in big trouble\nI've been to a friend did I mean is this the McCarthy Era of member McCarthy who is you know calling everybody communist and ... whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what it's come through and let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this\nI Am a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show host let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that I was probably a conservative talk show hosts are some liberals are most of them are not\nAmong many good you know what shepherd I been what what kind of America do we have in twenty eight teams when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about All right let me know what you think but now you're national forecast for video road lot\nNo was climate Prediction Center has issued the winter outlook yeah it'll be warmer in the west with no change in the chances for snow\nAccording to the national weather service in the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S is expected to be wetter than normal but no parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter\nNow NOAA warns the forecast should not be interpreted to mean that periods of prolonged cold or heavy snows won't happen\nMost of the country will be dry today with the exception of a place where we don't need any more rain and that's in Texas where we could see heavy showers again today on the order of two to three inches for extreme southern Texas\nAnd portions of West central Texas set to receive at least another inch today your winter outlook on today is forecast from red eye radio a meteorologist John throughout time mark\nGood good hey I just wanted to follow up with something you had mentioned um briefly a little while ago about a social media and the effect it as having on relationships friends family colleagues um I've had experiences where I I quit the race for five years ago because\nI just couldn't take reading some of the things people are writing and you know it was opposing me but I thought\nI don't want to jump in here and and you know say something I'd like to regret or anything but I Know people that don't even talk to me because it was revealed on Facebook how I felt\nYou know uh back when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good a ... with a lot of a relationship you know\n\nWhen I started to go in your direction first of all I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kind of stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use Facebook that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned to like you indicated I've learned not to say much about politics or the ... when they know I'm a talk show host and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave you alone it's their chance to you know trying to\nSay all kinds of things that they can say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think the social media you're right\nThat that does some good but the I like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the radio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious with the social media special refining out that they're you know so many things were hacked into finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you have ... five years\nAnd I admire that Tom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on was mark\nMark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color adults you stole listing I I I Wish to do a lot of community radio up here where I'm at and she's right it was a it was pretty horrific they're worried that they you know all the duct tape because she\nRegurgitate it everything [noise] there's a bright spot and let the Canadians weren't aware that the U.S electorate we're going to do it fast can not get the candidate that the media was trying to and us\nAnd that worked out in the end so all that horrific stuff that came off of a a Paul Kennedy and I'm a at a Charles Adler and uh and right and uh and and green\nOr all of that probably helped a jet of Obama or get a Trump elected because he was trying to hurt for when we're coming down from Canada like that and uh but the reason I called was so we had already been told\nA for your Twenty years Thirty years that ah you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and you know the racial issues that we had to confront\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama\nAnd then when he got elected she ignored his mandate and he went clear off on another Chang judge\nAnd things got worse so we were very very disappointed a you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama were really really disappointed and it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise]\n... well I think if they voted for him because they want to show they were in prejudice that was a mistake you know colors should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is than he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew we was when he first came out I Am not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill ... who is the rent Reverend Wright and\nPretended that the you know they weren't as friends anymore you could see who he was you get to know someone sometimes by a their character I admit people can pick on Trump that from the things he says and does so it's not foolproof\nBut I knew he was far left he he really hasn't got closer and closer he's behind that for for half a second\nI'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him\nProbably as much as people dislike trouble then is a high more than a myth that uh people who hate Trump ... Trump let's go to Dave in ... Illinois you're on with mark\nHey mark a I've got to average ... observations and then a point to make a first of all you notice all the calls that you have coming in [noise]\nIt's always the liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of cute communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the observation and then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated [laughter] yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem with liberal friends and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise\nIn the power of the individual not the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in town for individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country which specifically states that we have powers are as individuals\nIt over us as individuals but the air fighting for their own demise when they fight against the founding of this country\nBoy you said that very very well and I by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights that they're so far out there\nThan you know they claim they're against fascism is example with antifa but they're fascist themselves they it when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about what is this group think what does that group think or they want more power for the federal government\nWhereas we thinking as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives so\nI I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right to pretend to be the little guy and\nThey they care about my minorities and they cared about the basically for no they didn't they just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left they're all Democrats that you can count on to be moderate to scoop Jackson's of the world\nOf course John Kennedy a lot of people say when the tax cut that he gave he'd be Republican today\nThe Democratic party that I as a kid supportive and someone said one of our caller said then they left me um they're not the same party they might have been let me know what you think he's six six Ninety red eye which has eight six six nine seven thirty three thirty nine I'm Mark ... on red Iranian\nBook with ...

children in this country who are victims up sex trafficking of sexual violence etcetera\nAnd you don't see too many federal lawmakers proposing laws to curtail that personally I like to see a law on the books that would make it a federal crime to victimize children because they are one of the most ...\nMembers of our society a ... ... eventually these individuals are going to grow up they become

course we know some of the stuff that's gone on in the oval office that's why I mentioned President Reagan wouldn't walk in there without his suit and tie and I've learned I'm not always agree on this that if I as much as you guys who are Democrats can't stand to Donald Trump or George Bush for that matter\nI felt the same way about a mile but I Know I've learned if he walked in the room you give

Democrat and I always find it a public and yeah\nHe did oh boy [laughter] well you balance the budget and you know whoever can balance a budget that's who I think should run\nAgainst Trump or you know\nEver since two thousand eight we've had quantitative easing\nWe've had just government spending that's gone on and on and on with no end in sight and some well you know the somebody's got to pay the piper on that sooner or later and I think\nIf somebody could make a case to show that they really know how to balance a budget that would be who probably would stand a chance against Trump although I probably wouldn't vote for him on pretty much of traditional values\nYou know it's to me a word that is consistent with conservative and you know if it works but it ain't broke don't fix it you know something that works it's a good thing\nOr you have now I'd I'd have coffee\nWith is Nikki Haley I Believe she has an elected as a global perspective and I have a degree in anthropology\nAnd I would really like to sit down and talk to her about where she thinks waste and and the family of nations on this smaller and smaller planet but we have to learn to get along with each other and so those are my thoughts what do you think mark\nWell first of all mentioned Nikki Haley is ... is amazing because he leaves surprised me I I thought she was okay as governor of South Carolina\nWhenever South Carolina but she's been a phenomenal or ambassador to the United nations really letting them have it in a very courageous not being afraid to save like it is she's a very impressive lady I think she's going to run for president maybe you know obviously not this time but in the future\nYeah yeah\nYeah I I Will have to have someone with a very large perspective on who we are as a nation and clearly\nWe can be a good a good companion a good name for a good partner in a global perspective I think that's very important so thanks\nFor those ideas and we'll let you hold on\nOne second 'cause I'm going to ask you your ... your answer the question but\nI don't like John Case if there's something about the guy\nOr is he didn't come across well he did run as a Republican last time against Trump and the others there's something about him that irritates me something I mean I I don't agree with him on everything is a little too liberal for me and that that's fine that's neither here nor there but something personally about him\nI I think he's arrogant I think he comes across that we have heard some things about him I had a former a producer my TV show who said something about women or something like that that was years ago so that's not fair that is a rumor\nOr something about that guy and rubs me the wrong way but you don't feel that way you'd like\nTo bail us budget I mean\nWe we can go on with the kind of spending I mean\nI Love this country and we had a lot of good programs I gave her culture and you know we need to defend ourselves and said you know we we just can't keep going on every time somebody as another lobbyist that it was something that they just get it because they have enough money for the next campaign\nI mean that's both sides of the aisle it all and it's just been going on and on and on\nAnd they can't go on forever I mean when you get to the point where the debt as big as the gross national product you know theoretically that's bankruptcy and where we got to find a way you know we've got to find a way to to to have a\nBetter reasonable expectation about what kind of ... we can have in this country\nOne of the things I always say is people do not understand that the government\nHas no money of its own you'd be surprised maybe how many people think oh you remember that woman or during the Obama campaign the first ones that\nAre Obama's going to pay for a mortgage and pay for gas and they said where are you gonna where's he going to have his stash stash same out of his stash right she he was going to personally pain so people don't know that base that the government has no money of its own\nI thank you very much for your call very well said and I appreciate it very much and we'll take the rest of your calls at eight six six Ninety red eye or right now you're a national forecast for how many trucks\nNo was climate Prediction Center has issued the winter outlook it'll be warmer and the west with no change in the chances for snow\nAccording to the national weather service in the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S is expected to be wetter than normal but no parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter\nNow NOAA warns the forecasts should not be interpreted to mean that periods of prolonged cold or heavy snows won't happen most of the country will be dry today with the exception of a place where we don't need any more rain and that's in Texas where we could see heavy showers again today on the order of two to three inches for extremists\nOr there was no cooperation all that kind of stuff but there are other senators life or what's the name of ... Heidi Heitkamp whatever name as a she's a big trouble and in fact the way it works is the whole ... a Kevin a fiasco was helped the Republicans\nThe Democrats were always be there are always ready to go out there and do anything they could to go against Trump but now you've got Republicans motivated and in fact if Kavanaugh hadn't won I think they would have been so demoralized would have been worse but our problems are in the house\nThe house of representatives because it is quite possible that the Democrats could take back the house and as I've said for the last few nice if they take back the house\nYou're the Capitol hearing will pale in comparison to what they'll do trying to impeach Kevin I'm trying to impeach Trump with hearings with subpoena powers a with calling for their impeachment he's not going to be fun [noise]\nNo I think it's going to get ugly I personally but that that happens I think that a lot of good will come out of that I promise you that\nThat wouldn't be crazy I mean\nI honestly didn't believe anything forward said to me I didn't really do any of its down critical to me [noise] um [noise] I mean I did a lot of background I have it all and he just seemed like the most honest I'd probably be one of the ...\nI did a lot of background I have it all and he just seemed like the most on it I used to be one of the what what are the best judges that are on there as of right now in my opinion\nI mean he got all these other we've got\nKnow I was going to say it seems like a decent guy and you as you started say over three hundred opinions or whatever but the fact is in her case\nI just think they were using her as long as we're talking about\nWho should run for president a Democrat side uh Spartacus Booker in I call them that because of his own Kamala Harris they they were just using that woman maybe maybe she imagined it if someone didn't do that assault on her\nAll those things are possible but they use their for their own purposes it was disgusting to watch\nA little difficulty with\nThe horror of war who was it really was\nIt was ... he was\nYeah that's what Lindsey Graham was so good when he came out and said that I'm not going to put up with this stuff you guys are doing this for power you yeah you know now it ought to be ashamed of yourself what you're willing to do a but that's where they are they ought to be [noise] yeah well thank you so much for the\n[noise] absolutely I'll I'll definitely call back again\nThanks so much to him and uh yeah Jo measure would be good picky seems like a decent guy uh like I said I don't it's not fair for me to take away some of his courage uh when he seems so nice and and reasonable and I think he is going to win but someone who is less than decent I said I mentioned this\nIs Hillary I'd love to see Hillary run again a for selfish reasons I think she is going to run again because these guys\nMeaning Hillary and bill they can't keep away from power that's what the what is an aphrodisiac people say so and the Democrats even have figured that out they don't even want her to enter the fray she's viewed as the kiss of death for democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm election\nForcing the former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors by the way that makes sense\nBecause I sit on the air for many months now you know she's still looking to see a why she lost like she's going to come out I suggested she'll come out with a book a hundred and one reasons why I lost in none of them will be her I have nothing to do with her\nAnd I said she could join OJ Simpson as he looks for the killer to figure out who killed his wife but few Democrats are willing to embrace Clinton on the campaign trail despite the party's near universal support for just two years ago\nWith many concerns that a high profile Clinton presence but only dampen the party's prospects of retaking control of Washington from Republicans yeah they're worried about her throughout the mid term elections Clinton is rarely rally together with other candidates appearing mostly at low key fundraisers and loyalty because she can't get many people to show up\nShe's the kiss of death won a party official said I'm telling the Washington Examiner Democrats don't want her to campaign for them because everywhere she goes she carries the stench of death well worse than I thought\nAnd it's the only political figure in America that is less popular than Donald Trump stretches that and that's a real testament to her\nDemocrats were relieved that the bill and Hillary Clinton announced that there international Thirteen city speaking tour wouldn't begin until after November now that that was a clever move\nI think they're measuring how they can have the best possible impact and have kind of decided to wait until after the election and that's what Dick Durbin of Illinois at a house Democrats segment of that saying when I think people who have been part of our pushed to retake the house I just don't think of them at all I think it's a very good things that they're not being visits\nI think of people who've been part of our pushed to retake the house I just don't think of them at all I think it's a very good thing that they're not being visible it wouldn't help our cans age\nBoy one minute you're the nominee for the Democratic party and the next minute they don't want to see anymore maybe that's part of the problem these guys don't know when to get off the stage\nActually but I like that Hillary can in twenty twenty I liked the sound of aid and I like our possibility that she could run up you know like our stamps she could run forever right but don't we have forever stamps forever bill and Hillary could run you never get rid of them actually\nI could take them a lot better than Brock Obama right most presidents when they leave office they they're quiet and give that credit to George W. Bush\nBut not for Iraq Obama he's in there he can't sit still he can't keep quiet so maybe Hillary and bill they do have some redeeming value for those of us on our side because if they run again like if he runs again\nI think she's going to lose I think we got to get something going on our side Hillary for president in twenty twenty\nTell me what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine or ... same number thirty three thirty nine mark guys are filling in on red eye radio\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral oil for the last one hundred years but today's technology brings us other options to consider it's better quality unlike mineral oils synthetic oils have a consistent molecular restructure giving it\nThe ability to support pressures from higher horse power engines especially at lower rpm ... it also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy very cleaner synthetic pick up fewer contaminants as they do their job of lubrication\nThey also have better oxidation stability resulting in an overall cleaner engine synthetic and semi synthetic oil may be a bigger investment up front but the benefit of its high quality composition will pay off in the long run\nThis report is the service of shell wrote ...\nBooks with ... radio toll free at age ... he wrote a [noise]\nDish HDTV keeping you connected coast to coast from the comfort of your guests have to find out more additional by drug ... for my truck dot Gov\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with addiction please call this toll free number right now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight that's eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight by calling your addiction team you're taking the\nFirst steps to recovery to help you need could be one call the weigh eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight make the free call now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight or addiction team is the third party advertiser for various treatment centers in place in networks individual results will bury visit your addiction team dot com forward slash Kearns for more information\nI drive I Know you've got plenty to manage on their own that we make I see in her life and I've kind of ... we've gotten all you need more parking more rain coffee more clean salary than rather than with\nPilot fines they tried to ... tonight and on them rather than twenty four seven you want and we got it\nHighlights ... and get them I find that out to check out targeting in real time reserves salary and why why\nDid you know that studies have shown that almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems such as obesity diabetes heart disease even sleep disorders and our truck drivers lacked the same access to health that other Americans enjoy\nIm stance is is that drivers are often unable to get treatment and the early stages of disease minor illnesses become severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work\nThis creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to truckers won dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need\nLearn how SDF can help we encourage you to educate yourself in tears honest in Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help to that trucker spawn dot org let's band together for a better tomorrow\nAnd if you're a trucking industry professional then you need to be in the know and there's no one more in the ... and the readers of owner magazine written for executives and managers owner provides information on operation vehicle maintenance regulations and information technology but that's\nLaid out here with his monthly premium location and fleet under dot com website has all the latest news and information to keep your his his operating efficiently\nIndustry experts to award winning writer and columnist owner is the number one source of trucking information in North America informational ... executive her for a lot of these videos international", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "21"}
