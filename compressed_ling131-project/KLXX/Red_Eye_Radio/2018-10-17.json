really want that to be like a commissioner in your in ministry and do it said it at a cost you fifty thousand dollars\nAnd he said to be more not many weeks or months later someone else would ask for the same commission so that'll be fifty thousand dollars these guys were out for power and money it ... it was something that oh you are yeah\nClinton Foundation just to do I mean they just they racked up ... cows millions and that but\nYou are you kidding me they did it because she's such a great speaker and Chelsea's a great speaker was found an old half a million dollars to speak I think I

Montana governor Steve bullock a you know the obvious ones from Pocahontas or the Joe Biden who are Spartacus Booker who Kamala\nHarris and probably leaving Cuomo I'm leaving some people out who would you like who's nice who do you have a Bernie Sanders right in the same 'cause that that's what I suggested to caller I think I could sit down with Bernie I have a coke or something like that with him and\nThere's nothing we would agree on me seems like a nice guy what the caller was talking to was in a nod never sit down with\nHim um so that's the second question is there anybody in the other side no matter what side you're I could you sit down with Donald Trump I actually heard he's a nice guy then he's got a different persona I don't get mad at me I'm not saying it's not a nice guy that I don't support his views\nBut he comes across pretty bombastic and right so there's lots of things that maybe some of us wish you wouldn't say but they say he's very soft spoken in in in a private he's

I Would enjoy that I wouldn't do it he was if he would let me call and if he was listening [laughter] in England and not you know not just a demagogue everything out on I like him\nHis personality I don't want even the leaves him but the it would be called\nYou know what Lindsey Graham said about you know what Lindsey Graham said about Bernie Sanders a little I always have these stores I'm Bernie Sanders got married in a Soviet Union and some people think he never came back\n[laughter] that's funny than his\nMother and I thought you know I was like hey Philip thanks for your call appreciate it\nYour mark ... program\nThank you so much by by oh and here's someone's going to and I think is going to answer me right away the in Las Vegas Iran with mark\n... yeah I think the one I Would want to have coffee with is a tight as now she ran for governor here in Las ... only two hundred vote to show\nAnd he was a school teacher in a sense of a woman and I I really do think that in the tide is could approve of all the dirty tricks and terrible things that Democrats are doing there's just no way and I predict she's going to switch party affiliations shouldn't his pitch to\nElections stuff is over because I'm sure she Kissinger Paul there's a lot of those\nCars that it's just not acceptable and she was raised better than that I Know so yeah if I was going to have coffee was selling the dinner 'cause there's just no way in the world she can approve of any of this okay\n... ... well except for one thing and I appreciate your call didn't follow the rules the game was you had to pick someone running for president not that I Know her and I didn't know some of the other candidates running I certainly didn't know them well but to the game was you had to pick someone who's running for president\nAnd say who you would sit down and have coffee with an eye on the other gentleman agreed me Bernie Sanders I\nThat's I think he's a head right now so we got to hear your votes let us know

radio a meteorologist John trout\nCorrect so yeah you know\nI I I I Would think that ideally he'd make a great pie minimum at minimum you'd make or break the ice posed to a you know I mean look at Trump Trump is already wise you chose a tense\nAs the tea and it's it's great insurance to have a man like that behind you sew anything ever God Forbid goes dramatically raunchy cameras all you've got it you've got a man who could step into your shoes and probably to just as well as you\nWell you run your very articulate and you are blind challenge to for a Republican you did very well so I appreciate your call and you have a great night thanks so much and let's go to ... ah yeah we have time right now Ken in ... that Hammond, Indiana\n[noise] yeah I wanted to speak to the question of of prosecuting Hillary Clinton [noise] um ... you don't win much rural or if you lose an election you wanted to choice\nOf prosecuting Hillary Clinton [noise]\nUm ... you don't win much real world or if you lose an election you out one or two choices you leave the country or you go to jail or worse right our moral reasons we're a stable democracy is because there are certain political norms that we don't like\nAll remember on the set aside the to the possibilities Democrats going through ten years of Donald Trump's tax returns after he leaves office\nOr think back to the Bush administration a lot of people thought that the enhanced interrogation was unlawful right so so we don't I don't think we want to get into a pattern where the incoming administration prosecutes the leader the leaders of the ... the former administration leaders of the other party\nBecause our our politics have become too hostile as it is we need to take a step back and understand that there are certain traditions that are critical to our are having the stable democracy that we have\nAnd rule of law is only one of the [noise]\nMhm well that's an interesting point because you know a lot of people and the other side I think she shouldn't be above the law but as you point out that she has a unique position of also having been the opposing candidate which of course doesn't explain\nWhat the what what what they what wait a second what the FBI and and the Justice Department they were the soft to trying to get rid of the incoming president\nSo this is a very complicated situation and she may or may not setting is jar and I just\nHear the Justice Department though but I Will give you one further illustrates my point after the civil war right the Confederate Sam ... committed treason could obviously committed treason yet we did not try to walk them up because it was more important than the rule of law that we come back together [noise]\nGood at that point can I you know I said you may not hurt me I said whoever talked me last night in quite said that get it but that's what I was thinking on this issue with Hillary a you made a good point that's a great point with the civil war I appreciate you could you have coffee with on the other side or a\nSilent when it probably I Would probably lead toward a been says\nUh-huh and he's a bright guy\nYeah he's he's things things that are good you did you pass the test you did very well thanks so much\nHere I Am a kid's Tucker across that have you ever watch that or Fox News got these people answering questions in the news that's kind of dumb but it's interesting because who'd you get along with people the way it used to be with Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan you get along people on the opposing party and and get away from\nThe politics for a little while because you would least respected them speaking of respecting them was going to live in Pittsburgh Lynn you're on over the mark\nWell you know I had a rude awakening this morning I uh I woke up and my radio was still on and I heard right kissed Joe and has a dissertation on how\nI'm basically he can shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and and why you should be able to get away with it [noise]\nUm but as Hillary is concerned um I kinda signed on to the previous caller just right before me [noise] um if she really had broken the law and then found guilty\nThen certainly should be locked up\nUm but right just Joe that sounded like a polluted twisted demonic rant and it when I hear people like him talk\nIs that the Native Americans in this country had bars on the shores of this country to keep his mask the lazy hateful ancestors out of this country\n[noise] and I would like to have coffee and wait on on the other side I'm\nEven though I disagree with most of her politics um as a progressive myself that would be a Lisa Murkowski\nBecause that woman she's a she's a strong woman she's she's an example to to to women on my side uh\nNow that's a woman with some integrity and the character and strength at and she's a bad ass [noise]\nWould you have said that if she voted for Kavanaugh's nomination [noise]\nNo I'm thinking about some of her actions over a period of time I remember when when uh\nThere was a little spray with Trump and I'm a she says she wants to go on to live in fear of a tweet wow that really knocked me back I was really impressed with that so uh she showed that she's a she's a woman up strength\nAnd character and she's not going to be bullied by anybody on on either side so\nBefore I let you go who's your choice who is your choice of the Democratic nomination [noise]\nWell I haven't decided yet I Would like for some of the old you know the old timers\nTo just step aside a here in my a state that we've we we have someone that a lotta people liking ah his name is Conor Lamb and I really like for you know you know with like for more people like him the rise\nAnd I don't want to see Joe Biden run again\nI think that he had a history of saying some stupid things and and uh it I I Would not like to see him run again a he's a good guy but\nUm you know some of these people just need to step out of the way and a lot of new crop of progressive uh come through [noise]\nYeah great point Lynn I appreciate your call a\nEspecially on the other side [laughter] by the way saying talking about stepping aside so you got Nancy Pelosi in her seventies\nCliburn I think his third in line\nSonny ... in his seventies their own there's nothing wrong with that except for ah she was saying a lot of people would like there was an article about ... times where it was about people stepping aside for the younger generation\nProblem is in the house if you serve in the house\nAnd you don't you're committed ... is not a very uh what can I say a interesting life to leave you know I mean I'd love to be a congressman viewpoints me tomorrow that's not what I'm saying but compared to the other positions there\nBut the Democrats have that problem to let me know what your thinks we're asking to questions who's your choice to run against President Trump and who could just sit down and have a cup of coffee with\nYou guys are surprise me it just evolved that question\nBut you're surprised me 'cause you're picking people on the other side that you admired least could sit down and talk with so let me know what you think about that to

to see\nRun against President Trump the matter which side you're on the president's somebody you're also aiming vice president choice it evolved in our offices you my idea that hey who would you sit down and maybe have a cup of coffee or whatever cope with that\nIt's as much as the way it used to be that you know you have your politics you have your views and then there's still people right and you hope they're decent but adjusted suggests the times we live in where people don't even want to sit down with the other side\nA you know they're just so angry right I I don't blame you half of the Kavanaugh hearings I I wouldn't want to sit down with a sport I guess you know I think he's got an unnamed we've got to keep that going Booker\nKamala Harris what a ... a piece of work she is and the listening Pocahontas right the list goes on and on so I I get it that's why I came up with Bernie Sanders 'cause I don't know you foolish as can be in my opinion but\nI went to I can you go to Brooklyn College where I Would I think he did um and if he didn't he certainly from New York City and uh so I thought you know I can sit there with Bernie ... maybe it would\nWalk away when he heard my views I don't know maybe they'd be intolerant but let me know what you think and let's go to a chat in Decatur, Illinois chatty around with mark\nHey mark how are you going to see\nKandel it's good to hear\nA I Would like to see oh Alec Baldwin run for president\n\nDid you hear that that someone else has suggested that\nUh no I didn't hear anybody else just\nYeah yeah how come\nI Would like to see that I Would also like to have a cup of coffee with it I Can't see I won't shove the ... but [laughter]\nYou but you guys I knew he he hasn't announced you you're cheating you got to find someone\nI Know but a lot of the people that you bring it up haven't announced either Pocahontas\nAnnounced a ... okay you're right you got me there so I don't I won't say announced that those who we are actively can no way I'm trying to get out of this give me a chance those are actively considering we get to have a pretty good guess and I you know what you I'm going to keep you on but I Want to read the list is not fair so here's the list that I haven't looked at it I mean there are others like\nLike I forgot Bloomberg so he'd be on a list so the Spartacus Booker\nAttorney general Eric Holder Bernie Sanders\nPocahontas listen to the Warren Joe Biden Kirsten Gillibrand no one's mentioned her\nI didn't know Chris Murphy from Connecticut was running\nBut there was one guy he moved away from California any on Facebook not just to meet everybody said anybody who could support Donald Trump is no longer a friend of mine and among friending you\nSo I think you're going to do that or at least throw it out there last night I Want to hear those stories and once you've done some of them really sad people lost their whole family or certainly you better not do to Thanksgiving the maybe we'll do that tomorrow night for tonight who is your choice for president\nAt least for now and who could you have a cup of coffee with don't cheat and bring up people are not running that that made

we live in and [noise] I hear that a lot and it's not that I'm trying to argue with you or disagree with you but I think we're looking at it in a different sense that\nI think it's not really that I don't think that's the case I think it's more of it's the media so ... and they're out there they don't care now\nThat I've been trying to hide what tests that they believe in\nAnd they don't care [laughter] and so because of that they they get so many we find that people that just buy into that garbage and that's why they have this perception of this is the times we live and and but it's not really that I think it's just the media is so abusive but I Want to get your take on that\nYet you wow you you may have points I should have brought up thank you Daniel Lee the influence of the media right first of all they don't hide how they feel I don't know why I think of an entertainer when I used to watch Johnny Carson oh uh I never knew his political point of view I suspect he was a Democrat or liberal but he never had it out there\nNow again he was a comedian\nBut but the media is such a powerful role because so many people that's all they hear right the major news channels not so much right now that we have more the blogs and the Internet and all that stuff talk radio\nBut the place to be role and they have an agenda who's the guy from CNN or like the character that it's

right and he wants to publicity\nAnd they don't you're right there is any more they don't hide wise they act like advocates and they're not journalists\nOver the problem I have with it is is that this is supposed\nTo be a country that has room for all people are all political parties and they're making all about them and that's really an immature a point of view and way to perceive of and look at things it it means that you\nCan also that other people and that's not what America's top [noise]\nI I got an answer but I've got aunts my producer who just told me said the Anderson Cooper no 'cause

stealing it was because he owes nobody is saying\nThis ... problem has only I think going to be solved by making people accountable leader and FBI when you see I I mean the justice system but we can

with Iraq Obama him down to the lowest person working in the White House right now under this administration\nThey need to be held accountable and by that I mean they need to go to jail and they need to give up their mind because money is what gives them the power and and without the money and without the power and nothing and we just start taking this seriously\nMy God we ... the man show\nUh out

last night one of the things you said on my show years ago was every generation has to learn what makes America exceptional over and over again 'cause certainly if the schools aren't doing it and ... knew that if they can document the kids get them early enough\nThey'd have future generations voters but you're absolutely right they ... except for people like me they never hear the other side I get both sides they don't even know what party I mean\nBut they never hear well Bernie Sanders and\nGiving rise to the office of president sets the man is a pure communist [laughter] I mean and what's your name Hillary Clinton is as solid landscape personified I mean it was ... ... why do we want these people to turn this country into what is the way it is\nRight why [noise]\nBecause ... to it [noise] well people don't understand they don't how evil communism is was they don't know I remember I quoted Michael Moore than when they do in our capital planning on let me just finish for a whole hold on hold on one second I called them you know it's okay\nI quote him Michael Moore when they said to him he said he doesn't win capitals and they said to him so what would you replace it with and he said we haven't found it yet\nSo even there are some of the people are proud of don't even yeah that's what he said uh you're but you're absolutely right because they've never heard the other side and they think the young people thing today that socialism is wonderful but I have no clue because\nThey've been taught that\nYou know I mean it it's I I'm sure you've taught civics in school to you're taught how the government works to three branches and we had to learn that we had to run a court case\nThese kids today they they don't they don't have any man in the street I mean to ask people these questions and they don't have a clue not a clue and the building and the next election\nI mean I don't think I Need to be certain criteria for being able to that maybe you need to be a

side which is the point of the times\nThat we live in that people are so angry on both sides that they couldn't even sit down and have a cup of coffee with them All right so that's the those that's the one or the day and you're supposed to pick oh you have two choices there to make let me know what you think you'd call it an eight six six Ninety red eye in six six nine and seven\nThirty three thirty nine and we go to John in Seattle\nJohn you're on with mark\nMark are you there I'm here I'm okay a lifetime is the John Cage sick I Believe he ran for president as a Democrat and I know in front of a public and yeah\nHe did oh boy [laughter] well you balance the budget and\nKnow ever going to balance a budget that should they should run against Trump or you know\nEver since two thousand eight we've had quantitative easing or just government spending that's gone on and on and on with no end in sight\nAnd some well you know the somebody's got to pay the piper on that sooner or later and I think if somebody could make a case to show that they really know how to balance a budget\nThat would be who probably wouldn't stand a chance against Trump although I probably wouldn't vote for him or pretty much of it\nOn who we are a nation and clearly we can be a good a good companion a good name for a good partner in a global perspective I think that's very important so thanks for those ideas ...\nHold on one second 'cause I'm going to ask you you you answer that question but\nI don't like John Case if there's something about the guy\nOr does he didn't come across well he did run as a Republican last time against Trump and the others there's something about him that irritates me something I mean I I don't agree with him on everything is a little too liberal for me and that that's fine that's neither here nor there but something personally about him\nI I think he's arrogant I think he comes across that we have heard some things about him I had a former a producer my TV show who said something about women or something like that that was years ago so that's not fair that's rumor but something about that guy and rubs me the wrong way but you don't feel that way you'd like\nTo bail us budget I mean\nWe we can go on with the kind of spending I mean\nI Love this country and we have a lot of good programs like head agriculture and you know we need to defend ourselves and you know we we just can't keep going on every time somebody as another lobbyist that they don't want something that they just get it because they have enough money for the next campaign\nI mean that's both sides of the aisle it all and it's just been going on and on and on and they can't go on forever I mean\nWhen you get to the point where the debt is bigger the gross national product you know theoretically that's bankruptcy and where we got to find a way you know we've got to find a way to to to have a\nBetter reasonable expectation about what kind of ... we can have in this country [noise]\nOne of the things I always say is people do not understand that the government\nHas no money of its own you'd be surprised maybe how many people think oh you remember the woman or during the

right she he was going to personally paid so people don't know that based on some type of government has no money of its own\nA thank you very much for your call very well said and I appreciate it very much and we'll take the rest of your calls at eight six six Ninety rent I mean right now you're a national forecast for how many trucks\nWhether highlights around the nation today persistent rain is expected for the next few days over Texas where excessive rain as possible in the central part of the state with re precipitation over the higher elevations of Arizona and New Mexico is expected to spread northward into the central Rockies\nTemperatures twenty to forty degrees below normal from the southern plains into the southern Rockies under persistent clouds in precept\nSanta Ana winds in Southern California over the next several days should gradually abate around the horn we've got New York city checking in with sunshine for later today in sixty the high\nChicago only forty seven today\nOr there was no cooperation all that kinda stuff but there are other senators like uh what's the name of ... Heidi Heitkamp whatever name as a she's a big trouble and in fact the way out is the whole ... a Kevin a fiasco was helped the Republicans\nJust the Democrats were always a ... they were always ready to go out there and\nDo anything they could to go against Trump but now you've got Republicans motivated and in fact of Kevin I hadn't won I think they would have been so demoralized would have been worse but our problems are in the house the house of representatives because it is quite possible that the Democrats could take back the house\nAnd as I've said for the last few nights if they take back the house\nYou're the Capitol hearing will pale in comparison to what they'll do\nTrying to impeach Kevin I'm trying to impeach Trump\nWith hearings with subpoena powers a with calling for their impeachment he's not going to be fun\nYou know it's I think it's going to get ugly I personally but that that happens I think that uh nothing good will come out of that I promise you that\nThat would be crazy I mean\nI I honestly didn't leave anything forward said to me\nI didn't really do any of that but it didn't sound credible to me [noise] um [noise] I mean I did a lot of background I have it all and he just seemed like the most\nHonest he's part of the water the what what are the best judges that are on there as of right now in my opinion\nI mean he got all these other we've got\nAs of right now in my opinion\nI mean he got all these other we've got\nKnow I was gonna say they he seems like a decent guy and you as you start to say over three hundred opinions or whatever but the fact is in her case\nI just think they were using her as long as we're talking about\nWho should run for president Democrats side a ... book or in I call them that because of his own name that Kamala Harris\nThey they were just using that woman maybe maybe she imagined that if someone didn't do that assault on her all those things are possible but they use their for their own purposes it was disgusting to watch a it was difficult it was\nHorrible who was who was\nIn ... he was\nYeah that's what Lindsey Graham was so good when it came out and said uh I'm not going to put up with this stuff you guys are doing this for power you yeah you know now to be ashamed of yourself what you're willing to do I have but that's who they are they ought to be [noise]\nYeah well thank you so much for\nThe [noise] absolutely I'll I'll definitely go back again\nWell thanks so much to him and uh yeah Jo measure would be good picky seems like a decent guy uh like I said I don't it's not fair for me to take away some of his courage uh when he seems so nice and and reasonable and I think he is going to win\nBut someone who is less than decent I said I mentioned this is Hillary I'd love to see Hillary run again a for selfish reasons I think she is going to run again because these guys\nMeaning Hillary and bill they can't keep away from power that's what the what is an aphrodisiac people say\nSo and the Democrats even have figured that out they don't even want her to enter the fray she's viewed as the kiss of death for democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm election forcing the former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors by the way that makes sense because I've said on the air for many months now\nYou know she's still looking to see a why she lost like she's going to come out I suggested she'll come out with a book a hundred and one reason why I lost and none of them will be her I have nothing to do with her\nAnd I said she could join the OJ Simpson as he looks for the killer to figure out who killed his wife but few Democrats are willing to embrace Clinton on the campaign trail despite the party's\nNear universal support for just two years ago with many concern that a high profile Clinton presidents would only dampen the party's prospects of retaking control in Washington from Republicans yeah they're worried about her throughout the mid term elections Clinton is rarely rally together\nWith other candidates appearing mostly at low key fundraisers and low key 'cause you can't get many people to show up she's the kiss of death won a party official said I'm telling the Washington Examiner\nDemocrats don't want to the campaign for them because everywhere she goes she carries the stench of death well worse than I thought\nAnd it's the only political figure in America that is less popular than Donald Trump stretches that and that's a real testament to her Democrats were relieved that the bill and Hillary Clinton announced that there international Thirteen city speaking tour wouldn't begin until after November now that\nThat was a clever move I think they're measuring how they can have the best possible impact and have time decided to wait until after the election that's with Dick Durbin\nOf Illinois said a house Democrats segment of that saying when I think of people who've been part of our pushed to retake the house I just don't think of them at all I think it's a very good things and they're not being visible\nIt wouldn't help our candidates boy one minute you're the nominee for the Democratic party and the next minute they don't want to see anymore maybe that's\nAnd say boy one minute you're the nominee and\nThe Democratic party and the next minute they don't want to see anymore maybe that's part of the problem these guys don't know when to get off the stage actually but I like that Hillary can in twenty twenty I liked the sound of it and I like our possibility that she could
