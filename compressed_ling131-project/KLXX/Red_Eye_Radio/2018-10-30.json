from MSN dot com Democrats are sounding growing alarms and the final push before the midterm elections that the party lacks the message it needs to go that President Trump and went back democratic majorities in Congress as\nWe haven't had a real message since the last presidential elections so wide change it now is a democratic strategist\nChris ... we had no message in twenty sixteen we had no message in between you have no message going into this election you have to get people a reason to vote for you not a reason just to vote against someone else\nDemocrats think they have a good chance of retaking the house majority despite problems given the fact that they're voting base is fired up\nOr to send a message to Trump polls tightened however and there is recognition that Trump has started to fire up his own base to narrow path\nThe Democrats once saw for the Senate majority has largely disappeared ... in terms of the Democratic party having even a semblance of a message it's just not there and that's the reason this election is going to be unpredictable said could finish nobody should be surprised if it's a good night or a bad night\nAh Democrats found a winning formula and two thousand six when they captured both chambers with the promises to champion a series of specific policy proposals\n... early the following year including the minimum wage hike and cuts in student loan rates this cycle they've replace that design with a shorter slate of broader themes a preferred blueprint in their eyes because it allows democratic candidates to\nTailor their message to the concerns and demographics of individual districts sounds like a hope and change philosophy right ... ah this is not a national campaign so Nancy Pelosi\nOr it's one district at a time yet Democrats outside capital or voicing concerns that of blurry or message could haunt Democrats at the polls if voters are left on certain what the party stands for Rahm Emanuel the Chicago Mayor and former chairman of the house democratic campaign arm said his party needs to be more clear and his message for the country\nOr I don't want to say we did everything right into six but we had a six in oh six agenda set of ideals are that are very clear a second democratic strategist that Emanuel makes a great point I couldn't tell you exactly what we stand for no so in that sense I think Romney's right\nAt least back then we had a target we knew we needed to do to get there I can say the same now\nAnd that's troubling\nThey talked about democratic leaders are quick to reject that the notion because they've talked about health care costs and boosting wages and fighting government corruption by the way\nThe leaders are quick to reject that the notion because they've talked about health care costs and boosting wages and fighting government corruption by the way the infighting government corruption if there isn't a more useless campaign issue to go on ... by the way any government corruption when you think of a government corruption\nIf I write or a Democrat if you're a Democrat I mean you're well if you're an American ride to Democrat or Republican Russia inclusion right and we know it was the Democrats who colluded with the Russians not the\nNot the not the Republicans there's no evidence of it mhm and any government corruption that you could look at right now and I don't know they claim they're running a I'm On corruption I don't know where I haven't seen an ad on corruption\nBut if one thing but if they worry that you could promote if they wanted to get away or if they wanted to help eliminate any type of corruption or a wrongdoing and the process is a support voter id\nCertainly they're pressing for that right yeah I think they're talking government cried out right I Know but you start with the idea that because that's where it comes you know you come down to all the voter fraud situations and you often have officials that are involved in it so\nBut the biggest my my point was the biggest ... the biggest question on corruption is the Obama administration and the FBI and the department of justice and our intelligence agencies it is on the uh the Pfizer court\nRebuke in the Obama administration for violating the rights of American citizens when it comes to secret warns those are the things that we used to view the ... when I say we [laughter]

Russian collusion thing they cared about that all about among Russia right that it disappear\nI haven't heard anything on it right I mean they're not campaigning on on any of that now it's that Trump

call the president\nYou know a hateful\nAnd they talk about the divisiveness that in the moments we mean moments after such a tragedy\nThey themselves are being divisive\nBeen in a while I don't I don't I I think a lot of them are driven by by their debt own definition of hate that's what I mean\nThere that's on full display is it not\nBecause define hate for me\nBut he was hate all the time

... we didn't say you commit\nBecause if you're if you're trying to make the point\nThat anything that Trump has said and I don't know a trumpet set about Jews that would be viewed as negative all I Know is that when it comes to the Jewish faith\nTell me a bigger supporter of Israel than Donald Trump I haven't\nGosh how far do we have to go back and look ... look when you when you go to the un I'll play the audio coming up here I'll find it for I didn't get a chance to play yesterday but I'm from Alan Dershowitz it goes right after the Democrats for having such a cozy relationship with Louis Farrakhan right and that's okay\nThat's just come right fleet league glossed over from ... exactly it's from from from Obama but Clinton and as if it doesn't exist and that's why I brought up earlier that if you're going to bring politics into it you've got you cannot without being biased and and this is where\nOr when we look at the media we say you want to see the bias there it is right there\nHow come they're not asking a former President Obama\nShould stay away from Pittsburgh\nWhy shouldn't that being said\nWell because he look listen to the description\nReal simple from ...\nLoose Farrah Khan formerly known as Louis acts as an American religious leader black nationalist\nActivist and social commentator\nThat's how he's described\nThey'll tell you that he's a an activist that's the word they use\nHave you're listening to the things he said\n\nHe doesn't have hate in his heart\n\nAnd and you know that's fine\nMeeting with Farrah Khan is fine Trump is the proper hairs are again\nOne of the most well known or a\nJewish attorneys in America Alan Dershowitz there can't be any tolerance we have to zero tolerance President Obama meets with Farrah Khan shame on him President Clinton since the same platform with Farrah Khan shame on him Keith Ellison joins Farrah Khan fella Farrah Khan is one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic eight\nJust because he's black doesn't give them a pass on anti Semitism and any liberal who has any positive association with Farrah Khan is part of the problem not part of the solution right\nThat is completely lost and CNN\nBecause if you're going to see what has what has Trump said that Santa somebody\nWho has Trump met with\nOn a high level\nWho is anti Semitic\nWell some people but that's that's crap some people\nThere are some people that listen to the show that I guarantee I don't agree with their philosophy\nBecause some people support you\nSome people listen to you does not mean that you have

Trump's black approval right now at a record\nHigh yeah well and and I I think right now you're seeing again everyday people this this is the question\nAs it is with every election what is what is what are the American people thinking right but but but really we're not talking about real things we're not talking about I mean\nIn part on the positive side as the last caller pointed out you know he focuses on the winning which which I I Would assume we didn't get to ask them but I Would assume it would include the economy things that are going on the positive things that are going on with the economy\nBut but really it's it's not about that what drives the election right now if you think about it\nBecause there were conservatives before Kavanaugh there were conservatives that clearly recognized the positives and the economy but they're still never truckers they're still right now maybe going to sit on the sidelines for a while\nA number of them can't quantify it but let's just I think it's safe to say there were a number of that right so there's that\nThat part of the Republican Party that after Kavanaugh looked at it and said I'm OK the game has changed\nNow it really is about building this wall around the constitution as I've been saying\nIt is about protecting the things that are very real and we can have our inhouse discussions on what to do here what to do their terrorists know terrorists by the way where the original tariff babies\nAll of that can be discussed internally no problem we can have those very real debates on very real issues\nWith no issues going forward because right now the the the game has to be\nProtecting the constitution because the process is being with all it was it was all but shrouded in terms of the confirmation process uh Brett Kavanaugh ah they were given way too much leeway but guess what ultimately it works\nI think to the benefit I don't know if it will actually show that\nIn the house of if it will mean a win for the Republicans in the house but it showed enough to bring the Republican Party together\nLike I've never seen it\nIn a one thing I just wanted to bring up here 'cause we're you know talking about the different uh you know challenges out there you're talking about you know never Trump or\nWhatever you know maybe staying at home and I was thinking of a local story here you heard that the Dallas Morning news endorsed a better or ... and they claim you know you hear the conservative\nThe conservative Dallas Morning news a conservative Dallas Morning news and the conservative Dallas Morning news yeah there's no way that you can be a conservative and support bait or work number Ted Cruz no you're not a conservative and I started thinking when I saw that story to begin with\nHow many think about this in the media there seems to be what Jennifer Rubin for example I'm a Republican conservative no you're not\nShe's not a Republican conservative she's she's a liberal or a Max Boot who is the the ... you could call ... former conservative columnist to see the picture of him with Stormy Daniels and the other day yeah like it's like wait a minute [laughter]\nYeah nice conserve your Stormy Daniels and he posted a picture of a him with Stormy Daniels like proudly on on uh on on a a a Twitter ... which is like it was most bizarre thing in the world and and you look at other you know you look at a a a um a Bill Kristol ... ah who just has lost it you see John Case it\nOr who just you know completely have shown that they're not conservatives but you've got in the media you have a a lot of different people who are claiming that there are conservatives and they're speaking for the conservative movement\nBut they're not conservatives anymore and I don't mean because they're not supporting Trump\nOr I'm Talking about there any allergy has actually changed who they support actually changes ... you can sit there and say maybe I don't like Donald ... I don't like Donald Trump but I don't like the fact the cruise now is with Donald Trump and so I'm not going to vote to say you're voting for ... because\nBecause the ... the Ted Cruz and conservativism has failed you is the most bizarre thing on the planet you can possibly say it makes no critical thinking sense at all you're not a conservative why\nBecause as a conservative what is the most important thing and let's go to the late Andrew Breitbart who before he died was on our show\nAnd we asked him you know why should people vote for Romney back in twenty twelve ... Supreme Court\nYou know if Trump was done if Trump was done today\nI'd be happy I was I said\nThat to a friend over the weekend or because they were like okay but but but\nThe work's not even he's not able to get work done because then I said no he's he's got a lot and I said but but imagine even the tax cuts didn't get done\nI'd like to imagine that 'cause now I'm paying more in taxes let me let me and met and that ... would you please [laughter] um [laughter] but imagine that the you know there were a number of things and and imagine even that the economy more weren't growing as as fast\nA ... and they just want to be happy ... there are a number of things here and again we don't\nIt's not the we never share the endgame you and I are the races never finished because there are so many things to do\nBut it's what we're looking at right now\nIt's what we're looking at right now\nI I can I can sleep go back I can sleep at night well I can sleep during the day well I don't usually sleep but I'll go back to march twenty sixteen them a depression that existed\nMhm [noise]\nWell and think about where it might have gone\nWhere it might have gone on the bench yep that's what I mean ... ...

Newt Gingrich\nA and remember the contract with America that that he'd come up with a he's talking about the fact that they should have come up with 'cause he's talking about ... proposed Republican pledge on on on healthcare you and I talked about this a long time ago that the Republicans\nIf they lose and remember health care is one of the leading issues out there right underneath the economy if they lose part of it it's their fault for not oh yeah solving the problem of health care and not going in with a plan for it and he talks about you know a a a pledge that you know that that the ... that they should take\nA and there's ten different points to the the pledge and then what would they do and they should have had this a long time ago I Believe you when I talk about this a long time ago when they pat\nYou know they they got rid of the individual mandate pass a little bit but we said look the premiums and everything else is going to come back to haunt them right if they don't do something that could cause them the house we'd state of this over a year ago\nAnd he goes through all the different ah ah you know we were talking about the accomplishments that they have done and they should have talked about okay and here's what we plan to do the Republican promises for additional improvements and they go through everything protect patients with preexisting conditions\nIf the American people reelect Republicans to a majority in the house and Senate we pledge to enact a series of practical and specific changes based on what works in the public and private sectors to build a better healthcare system the system will keep people healthy and provide effective treatments and economic security for those who get sick\nThese legislative changes will and they go to the pre existing condition which really goes back to the block grant right\nWe do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches like high risk pools and reinsurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it goes to the states the states make a decision as to what they wish to do\nRight and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring additional transparency and accountability across the entire prescription drugs supply chain\nA lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by eliminating the health insurance tax\nReducing Washington's mandates that limit choices that drive up costs for insurance strengthen Medicare by protecting Medicare part D patients from excessive out of pocket costs maximize medical innovation they go through that but basically go through all the things that they should that they should actually do this has been a failure the Republican Party completely\nThere is something that probably Ryan\nThrough all the things that they should that they should actually do this has been a failure of the Republican Party completely there is something that probably Ryan\nShould should have been talking about on a consistent basis there should have been a marketing plan for this with massive television ads leading up to the election that if you will like this if this is our plan this is our contract ... and Newt Gingrich bringing it out and this is two days ago it's too late oh yeah yeah ...\nIt's not going to work uh now we're inside of a week first of all it's because a Newt Gingrich is is only going to ... no one is going to uh pay attention to Newt except for the choir\nOr because that's who he's preaching to but you're right with ah the Paul Ryan at the beginning of this year\nWe talked about in twenty sixteen all of the we're going to do away with was Obamacare we're going to do away with Obamacare we will do away with Obamacare and then by the time they got there the sentiment by the rank and file a changed and it was like okay well we'll do away with the\nSome of the Obama Care and then they finally got to\nThe individual mandate which of course then under the funding mechanism and then forced them eventually will force them to pay for it in another way premiums going up all of the ... which is exactly what we're seeing\nAnd we we talked about that disconnect between twenty sixteen and the end of\nLast year now you have this this whole new cycle\nAnd and whole new opportunity to essentially launch the new plan based on what you know about the public scent of it and they do know what then\nWhy wouldn't you do that to say\nIf you give us if if if if we\nAre in charge this is what we want to do and go editor point by point as Newt Gingrich to\nAn end and it should have been it should've been Ryan and the president yeah this is what we're going to do look it isn't done yet and you promote the daylights out of it yet I because it's one of the top issues that Americans care of\nAll because here's what I Would say too is that there's nothing wrong with saying look the the Senate by the American people is is shifting on health care and this this is where the sentiment of the American people is right now this is what they're telling us this is what they want this is the plan we believe will work\nYou don't necessarily have to go back and apologize for not getting it done because the American people don't care that you didn't get it done but what you do have to do what you are charged with now is because you know you break it you pay for it\nWhat you're going to have to do now is put together a plan a very realistic plan and put it in front of the American people but that's that's not happening I mean Newt Gingrich is one thing\nThe party didn't have well any desire to do\nGingrich wrote it because you saw this was a failure of the Republican I and we said this by the way we got criticism\nBeyond criticism we got criticism when we said they're not repealing Obamacare right stop saying it we ... we got criticism and guess what we were right they weren't repealing Obamacare but they were just they were what were they were doing was really what the mandate but the actual benefit state which means somebody has to pay for it\nWhich was taxpayer money through the back and an increase in premiums but you didn't solve any of the problems right\nAnd so you should have focused on solving the problems immediately there should have been the president and and and this is why we have said\nWe know that people loved the rhetoric but it's about the winning and it's about getting things it's about\nWe know that people loved the rhetoric but it's about the winning and it's about getting things it's about getting things done more to the way that we wish to get things done so we don't end up with the Medicare for all\nSo we don't have a monopoly running our health care system\nOf government monopoly running our healthcare system and this is what the Republicans were supposed to be fighting for\nAnd they did not do this\nAnd we criticized President Trump from the very beginning for not taking a stand on repealing Obamacare but just saying well just send me whatever and I'll sign right\nBecause the president has shown that when he sticks by something\nLike the corporate and individual tax cuts and he keeps promoting it and he keeps fighting you know a lot of people have told us the last couple of weeks with the like about the president that he's fight fight fight fight fight fight fight the fight has to be more than just rhetorical\nYou've got to take the hardy issues and one of the hardest issues out there is health care\nWell and and I I've heard the point made by pundits that well you know there are things that that that he clearly understands that are within his wheelhouse like taxes because he's a businessman\nBut you can not that you want to oversimplify healthcare but one of the main concerns the number one thing that this president did this candidate\nWas do what do they do knowledge well acknowledge the problem right I mean overall yeah but I Do but that's one of the problems deregulation a no ...

'cause that was to cry and then the president finally had to admit no well no we did get rid of all the bottom of care\nBut I mean but that's ... by the way that's\nMhm 'cause that was the cry and then the president finally had to admit no well no we did get rid of all the bomb and care\nBut I mean but that's ... by the way that is part of the the you know you're not talking about people not wanting bait that's part of the problem that we had with the right ... we should look he didn't get rid of Obamacare yes I did just you know we didn't know and people would argue with us why because they just wanted to believe what they wanted to believe in the facts didn't matter in that\nBecause the heavy cost is coming from the regulation that is still in place the hospitals and employers\nBanned by what you know those those policies and plans have to cover\nWe're still paying the cost yeah H and we continue to matter what age six six Ninety ...

I have a feeling Papadopoulos is going to write a book on this if it's true what he's stating and yesterday you had to leave a little early to go to a conference and and we talked about this the Papadopoulos you know coming on the ... the the tweets saying by the way Congress knows who's a spy was in the campaign so do I can't can't tell you yet\nBut he's also said that he made he may reverse his plea\nFrom what he learned in okay probably as we are and the question about on about the whole Michael Flynn thing\nNow again we're talking about you know those those are separate charges\nBut\nAnd and this this whole thing if there is the\nThe basis\nOf a ... if the very basis of all of it\nWas about the uh the spy on the campaign the uh the the ill gotten\nPossibly Pfizer warrant\nAnd all of that if everything stem from that ... of what we're looking at with Papadopoulos a Michael Flynn if if the if the fact of the matter is is that they were on to Michael Flynn because of of that we don't know we have no idea but if that were the case\nWhich means that would be no basis for those investigators to be talking to Michael Flynn which means\nThey shouldn't have been there and the charges would be dropped now we we have no idea because he's his hearing a sentencing hearing is coming up here and I'm In a matter of weeks now it's what five or six weeks away well\nBecause he's his hearing a sentencing hearing is coming up here and I'm In a matter of weeks now it's what five or six weeks away well\nBut the question is why was delayed by\nThe special prosecutor why did why did Mohler agree to to lay not once but multiple times the sentencing hearing for Michael Flynn then you add to it Papadopoulos and then add to it\nThat the White House handed to the inspector general's office at the department of justice all of that\nFrom the Pfizer warrant\nA situation and turned it over to here's our which knowing and and we have been pointing this nobody's been asking this question ... outside of us that I Know of\nWhy would you send it to the inspector general because you believe something internally was was some kind of wrongdoing ... at the department of justice how and here's and the way to find that out is through a proper I generally investigate noble\nWhat I'm what I'm thinking is Papadopoulos the reason he said that\nAnd and he said first off that you know I I I may\nTake away that guilty plea you know for line mhm like women if you lie July book possibly get you out of that how could it and he said not necessary to get it reverse but just to bring forth what happened and I started thinking okay and then he started talking about the spy the only thing I could think of is the spy was somebody\nNot an operative for the Democrats but somebody from law enforcement who was put there because it all relates to the Carter page warrant right which was\nIllegally got and across the board\nAnd not only we could have possibly affect the Michael Flynn case because if the warrant was illegally gotten than anything that comes from it mhm is tainted every in every single ... everything and that's what I'm thinking so they got the warned in part of the war was\nOnce they justify the warranted law enforcement plug\nRight somebody in law enforcement that kind of in a ... or an informant that were maybe not an FBI person but an informant that the FBI put in there\nYou know that just to to look at Papadopoulos and it was all based on the information that they had gotten from the ... and the war and and everything is in her connected with the buys a war\nAnd so everything around it as tainted and that's what he feels can possibly get him off on that\nOr at least X bows what was going on toward the prosecution eventually just says okay the the you know that you're guilty plea is is waived or whatever\nBecause it looks so bad for the FBI and the department of justice look something's going on here when when the president said well a lot of the top secret in our allies would rather us not release it so I'm going to give it to the inspector general to review you and I both said it doesn't make\nAny sense that doesn't make any sense at all because you're not looking you that that's not what you do you're not talking about the national security advisor you're not talking about the uh the the uh the secretary of state you're talking about the I. G. of the department of justice\nAnd the entire role the entire reason that the IGA exists is to investigate wrong to wrongdoing and inside the department of justice\nCorruption yes\nAnd the only thing we can think of is they believe that after they declassified it and those emails back and forth\nAnd I think we can think of is they believe that after they declassified it and those emails back and forth and text messages between the FBI and the department of justice what they found was the corruption that they believe will take down the entire case\nI Can't think of anything else what else could it possibly be the inspector general does not care he does not review top secret material to find out whether it should be released or not he only looks for corruption yep\nThat's and knowing that the idea would have access to anything and everything that he wanted to access inside the department of justice you actually have a better investigative tools and Congress yes\nEight six six Ninety ...\nEngine report is brought to you by Detroit\n...
