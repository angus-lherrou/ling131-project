was wondering if September for a week or so to speak with us you can click on TALK when the last couple of days when I look forward to the jury is actually through so many lives in the morning\nI can easily get used for filling in for them especially because you didn't so gracious demeanor calling comments about my work and you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am only or next on my Web page with Marcus will show dot com where you can email me you follow me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question\nAfter this we go next to be on October twenty ninth on another show but ... again check that out on my Web page there are a number of topics I said I Would get to tonight so I Want to keep my word first I Want to talk to you about illegal immigration\nI've been talking about this for over ten years now in the air doesn't mean I didn't think about this Twenty years ago and so on\nBut I've never wavered in my position the issue and you guys were bringing up the last few days so I thought I Would focus on on the first segment at least and see your response\nIssue is really not that difficult if you'd knowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally have come here legally which is why those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens one of the college last night said you know markets illegal aliens forget it\nSo you have the term argument an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or loss them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally and the argument might be quickly over if they're legal they're not allowed to be here and the story in another caller said that why you know what is this going on it's pretty simple so as an example if you own a home\nAnd someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they wanted your home to go into your home but they just lacked the proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walks in tears to your bank\nAnd wants to take the money out of your account right\nThere would be asked to prove that it's their account if they said it was their account they just didn't have the documents to prove it the bank would not permit them access isn't that obvious\nWhich is why it's so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as this that can have your house and bank account if only they could find the misplaced documents for years now I've said the left as one of the argument over language\nSo I'll give you some examples undocumented in this case over legal livable wage\nAnd and the minimum wage right we we've lived with yours for minimum wage here's the wage that the government by the way the term that people should be paid which is ridiculous on his face in a free market economy and a capitalist economy\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through reading schools\nAnd intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution you take away the benefits like free healthcare and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses\nThat hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first thing you go to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and they'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home run they actually had a right to use the wrong language self deport there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no better I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remains that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be saying for the right reasons and for heaven's sake\nEnough of the government sending out the wrong message message with actions like by legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know\nAre bilingual government documents a country is United by language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values\nOur ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at all is island\nThey were so happy to have a blended\nAt the land of freedom so let's build that wall and do everything to end the loop legal immigration and take our country back tell me what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye that's

eight six six Ninety read I were talking about illegal immigration in ...\nShe's in D.C has to say about it my friend [noise]\nUh hey well\nI'm a\nLanguage that you were talking about one of the biggest glaring things is that you even do it yourself but I I used to do it but I'll marry you say American would actually we are us citizens in America and uh\nThe liberals are lot not a liberal that's called radicals there they actually have taken that word in applied it to everyone on the side of this or so\nWhen they when they were talking American\nYou know we think that it's just citizens here now they're thinking the whole world this whole side of the world and immigration means nothing to them I mean this is just normal stuff and we have seen grain wars when we say Americans and they they say American say brainwash us\nTo think\nThat we're saying citizens and they and they think they're brainwashed us to think that\nAnd everybody uses American but when you look at your passport if you have one it's a U.S citizen that's what we are\nAnd that's a huge difference we have to be so deliberate with what we say are words have got to be delivered and that's that's got to be all the main thing that we have to do even on the air because the the radicals or taking those words that choice that's what I say about\nWell I appreciate your call but I'm not going to give up that were to name I just refuse to do it\nI eat when I hear that word America or Americans it'd be you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind\nI'm not going to let them use or that and just because they think Americans you know north Americans whenever they want to use it for not going to let them get away with that oh and you know some of the songs right America the beautiful but that that's not there's I'm not conceding that to them there's not a chance I'm going to do that\nAnd I don't want to concede the language them at all that's why it's important in legal immigrants and we literally I Know people kept me on that um but I don't I don't see anything to them and and if you do that and then you're kind of given up a little bit now where Americans we passed for United States citizens great I get it\nBut there's something special about this country called America when the United states of America America usa whenever you want to call it\nAnd so appreciate your call but that's my take on it and now you're national forecast for cobra electrons\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of snow with a system\nOn Lake Erie now from Erie PA oh to Cleveland, Ohio on I. eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies\nRain for Texas continues today we're looking at close to two months worth of rain forest some parts of central Texas snow in the southern Rocky's\nA little too warm for snow in Denver the overnight lows thirty four high later today at fifty nine\nIt's winter weather preparedness week in Colorado a reminder that winter weather can arrive quickly and oftentimes without warning and the high country and there's today's looks true national forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nEven though the across a\nNo no it's a it's an interesting idea\nAnd it forces them to monitor their own people at that point\nAnd as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us they're poor right a lot of especially Mexico ... since the poor and is not our problem right [laughter] you're pro ...\nAnd ... and then you can also add onto that health care bill up for the health care bill I'm Still ... villain for everything that eventually it will stop and dry country of origin will stop stop spending here or let me but\nI just nothing like the right and center and that's the point with right now it's been the wrong incentive you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get to have free hospital care right and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and this is terrific or you you you know I I Would come here to that's why ...\nIn charge interest and we can make money so interest then you know what\nYeah you should have given this idea to President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for the wall\nYou know any better than I Do only ... dollar\n[laughter] that's a great coal thing Steve appreciate it\nVery much actually I I I did apply um so tell me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be a way up there in the department of education but as a person I sent to then I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president and I'm a good friend who's the head of communications for I think the department of health\nUh and so yeah it does happen and you know some people but you know what I'm\nThe stories that the I think they were having someone else's leaving the administration it's tough to work there\nEspecially if you're a conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want it it's tough it's tough and a lot of your points that out yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot to become president United States you could say well to New York trip this power all that kind of stuff I don't think he needed that\nI think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing I mentioned this last couple of days of the ... power not only hearings and subpoenas but you know they're going to go after taxes because they're they're sure they're going to find something there\nThat though oh probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of deal the Russians but even if they don't what business is it over there's\nWhat his tax returns are it's just not their business I Know certain presidents have done I'd I don't think they should\nIt's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's none of your business Democrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know what I don't I pay what I'm supposed to pay do my share but it's not anybody else's business\nBy the way after the cabinet hearings and all this other stuff as they go after taxes\nLie to good people exactly why good people want to serve ... especially people in that sense why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider\nDemocrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you how to live your life\nYeah they're the party that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those that hey I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they're much more likely to say I want to go back to my family into my life because they don't believe in this whole part and that's what illegals don't know\nWhat makes America special one of the big things is limited government that government stays out of your lives\nAnd don't you find it ironic to say the least that a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government\nAnd what are they do when they get here they vote for exactly the same thing they left it's really bad\nSo the you because it it takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews\nAnd you know they say who's the vice president United States they can't name that that's not so important what's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country exceptional\nThat we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get and I don't try to indoctrinate them I give them both sides I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights you're going to have energy\nPut on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible that's why some people question is\nWhy I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military I Can't have a tank in my backyard or grenades or is let alone nuclear weapons\nSo there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that shows this debate in perspective where the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think well mostly people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people will have a real tendency to be bad and they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were out of the strongest tribe and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they did this because we can\nI I don't trust that and there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and I didn't get into this so much last night's caller mentioned that\nWe have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant so there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of and the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose\nBut even there right how do you pass a law you guys know this the house has to pass the Senate has to concur and then the president has to agree if he doesn't agree vetoes it and then the house and Senate can override it\nAnd then the Supreme Court could say you pass a law that's unconstitutional they really were afraid of big government so that's another big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand\nWhat makes this country so special but most you guys do and even if you're on the left I Want you to explain to me while I'm wrong about illegal immigration gave me a call at eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three

I mean when the ... the United states was founded on the fact of what as they say pilgrims\nLanded on playing with rock but the Native Americans were already here so that land was taken from them from the beginning second about\nWashington gap once they took over the land they decided to get in here and go back overseas and get African American leader who will and everything else and bring 'em back over there to pick your cat okay then once you did that that\nI don't even agree with the fact that in turn down Confederate flag me pulling down Confederate flag or statues because that's how my children\nIs real good to have them up because in ... with us you know that the north won the south laws\nAnd then Texas southern states didn't even want to let that black free like it was ordered city from the beginning we didn't find out until would\nNot generally pain but yet the gym and do a live below the sorry the twentieth of June Eighteen\nFifty five so my point being is this your dad wannabe Ali's while I Want to have yeah I Want to complain about the sanctuary city my whole question\nIs I'm ... from the white man is not being in jail for a for\n... million with these little girls you know you got all these men this for one and most of them out in the ma joined them away but they're not being locked up for a certain crime and they feel\nLike that's real nice for them to be able to be sued in those things you have comments\nYour last one will know ... and I'm like well you know I'm ... I'm well I appreciate you letting me finish on on the show that I'm doing but okay go ahead I'll let you finish but you may want to do it again and\nOkay I mean I'm I'm a cut it out and then you know a lot of times when I look at the the summer the incidents where people have been shot was not people\nI I Do kind of agree with the police I don't blame them because we should uh you know say you should have just you know adhered to what they were saying instead of you to do but\nStill I mean I don't no matter how\nYou know and here to what they were saying instead of you to do but still I mean I don't no matter how you get and how you put it out immigrants to a land that was never our within the first place\nNear ... and the third way and I know I'm gonna let it had no if they want to go in the eastern while still wasn't\nThem around and respond okay I'm going to try to respond to okay\nSo I gave it a lot of time so first of all you said something about the land was taken from the Indians that they were here first the only problem with that is there were Indians before those Indians and the ... before those Indians and there's nobody living anywhere on planet earth today that didn't take it from someone else that someone was there originally\nThat's just what happens in life it's it's you could say it's unfortunate and shouldn't be that way but you need to know your history so even Indians took it from other Indians\nAnd in terms of the slave trade you also probably know this may be don't\nMany of the people who are involved in the slave trade were blacks were brought blacks over here I'm not saying it was good it was obviously terrible to bring people here against their will but you don't have to put this in perspective the time it was a slavery was absolutely a\nFallen horrible but if there's one country that's trying to atone for that more maybe more than any other country in the world\nIt's the United states of America we understood that that somehow they can no ... no no no it's my turn now to monitor\nAnd we understood I just had a black person that they are I mean the the overwhelming majority of Americans want the best for all their citizens they don't care about race in color and so on and the uh I don't I wasn't true your last point I wanted to respond to it\nAh but then you said that the police when they do do some shooting I couldn't tell if you were trying to say that they ah they were not being responsible in some cases sometimes that does happen someone gets shot and never should have been shot and they they're they're good and bad policemen they're good bad talk show host\nBut in general you probably notice to most blacks are the murders by blacks or buy from other blacks and in ... many inner cities they want more police not fewer because they want to be protected I actually I'm going to keep going on so go ahead now you respond\n[noise] [noise]\nOkay and like I said no matter how you look at it the one thing I can say if I Can't say anything about\nHow so how president I appreciate everything he's done because the aisle he a dog what Air America dirty laundry is that every body weight the racism under the under the rug like it's dirt now that it out and being forecast that\nEverybody would you got new that Republicans that to get this name because how he how and how he acts that whatever the\nCase may be stupidity goes a long way\nIt goes a long way but I think a certain ... like a lot of my people like up to a lot of my people\nY'all can get mad at this man I Want to but the one good thing that he did bring about\nIn this country with air the fact that the racism and hatred in America alone it's horrible it's horrible\nWay way way we weren't so where's he wears the racial see me with the most black unemployment rate maybe ever but we were exactly see racist or I didn't catch that\nI'm not saying like I said he aired the dirty laundry this country has been races for many many years but\nWants to fly didn't know that now\nThe laundry this country had been right this was many many years but\nEverybody was so I didn't know that now I I didn't know that is ... ... and that's what\nRadio station ... because yeah very therapeutic expect black the beep to respond on here\nNo one would expect anybody responded by the way I'm by the way you kept saying might people I thought we're all Americans that we all live in you know the same areas John Kennedy said we're all in this together and people on your side and by your side I don't mean color I mean values in politics people on your side have group mentality I\nDon't see people that way I see people as individuals and I want you know I like people to share my values are way way way way back no it's not your turn now I'm finishing so let's not talk over each other\nI Would be happy you may have heard me say this this week I'd be happy with nine a black women Supreme Court justices if they shared my point of view because I don't care about color and it looks like you do\n\nYou still there oh I think she hung up and if you didn't maybe I certainly didn't I just wanted to know that maybe something happened here we dropped her but uh\nYeah it's just it's it's sad because the old you are there some rations here yeah there are some people that still think Elvis Presley is alive so you can account for that you know there there's always going to be knuckleheads out there\nBut the overwhelming majority of Americans want what's best for everybody live their lives they don't care about color did we make a mistake a long time ago we did we paid for that and try to make a difference in a ... and she said oh President Trump at least the showing how bad things are no I think the country's doing fantastically that's what we did last night\nOh how great the country is under President Trump here is there's some things he shouldn't say but you notice they'll charge and was stuff like he's a racist but then they can't name anything to prove these races right\nAh it's it's very discouraging when you get calls like that might people I Love that phrase my people what do you mean that your people you're the one that's caring about color\nI I don't care about cholera ... let me acknowledge something I noticed someone's black that lasts for better or no attempt to the second and then I get to know them who they are because color tells you absolutely nothing about someone it tells you nothing\nI care about values and it doesn't tell me anything about ... tell me what you think eight

um\nI get the feeling that it's not going to well in Florida I don't know about Texas but\nI don't know if you have any insight to what's going on there I Know that I'm a several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida after that terrible hurricane last year\nAnd a the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because\nThey can vote or in the

I think we're going to offer as individual yeah go ahead\nI was going to say I'm concerned about to have to I don't know what the ... congressional um situation is and I'm In you know the Florida or Texas but um I don't understand you know I also don't understand why\nThe money when you look at the\nPoliticians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrats\nWho live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states and you don't they understand that they're going to have a ten percent tax\nIf the governor's race just worn by the Democrats in Florida and he wants to do a lot of radical things and he got as that gentleman a couple of callers ago that you know the states are\nThey can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer health care they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats\n... don't you don't understand that for their own their own them\nDown there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrats to invest and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nYou're not the politicians including Democrats in that and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand that as I've been saying tonight it's very hard to explain the conservative and Republican position especially\nWhen the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change 'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are on the surface if you don't explored they oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah\nOr equal pay for women that they have no idea the background that they're talking about and I turned at the same job necessarily\nA and that would make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of left his than liberal positions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know that I think the overwhelming majority of American people do not want to go through impeachment again I was wrong I was for it was Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection\nUm people ... people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Canada\nI think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did a gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leads leaving that aside they treated him some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and\nSo they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when Dukakis by the way of announcing that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think at uh eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else that you want to talk about but right now is your national forecast or ... roads blocked\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of snow with a system\nOn Lake Erie now from Erie PA oh to Cleveland, Ohio on I. eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies\nRain for Texas continues today\nWe're looking at close to two months worth of rain forest some parts of central Texas snow in the southern Rocky's\nA little too warm for snow in Denver the overnight low thirty four high later today a fifty nine\nThat that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville or Jeremiah in runners mark\nYes sir hey I'm your on your mark how're you doing well great I'm well I'm\nA recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant um well I wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married\nUh got married and then\nShe ... she left she's gone\nAnd it's the fast track to green card now the way they have you ever heard of the way the act and I'm just not touching up from what the previous previous speaker was talking about um\nYou know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here illegally have a have a\nYou know get pregnant and then just totally disregard everything\nAnd then live off the government um you can't get deported you can't um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever no I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this is this is a ... I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then\nThey want to just stay here and and uh it\nIt's an amazing thing I'll I'll go in my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience [noise]\nIt it it's an amazing thing I'll I'll go in my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience\nI'm I'm Out there to live with it you know with a lawyer ... everything I guess you don't ... you don't see your child then\nNo no um they do restraining orders I'm under the way the actors it's the women against violence um act um\nSo if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are here is the fast track to green card and\n... and you know I Would probably I've run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on talking about father's rights and what happens is the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster\nLet's go to a Georgian Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nGood morning march I keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a latch don't suit but I think it's also a misnomer\nWe do not have a illegal immigration we haven't in Beijing going out these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we were being invaded by the failures of the other ...\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nIf there was any if it was their military doing it we would be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent late allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and that happens because there are people on the other side of having agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America has said the United states\nThey just see it differently than we do and they and they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against them President Trump was smart enough to make that his top issue and it's not at least one of his top issues and the American people responded\nAnd I think they did it correctly let's go to ... there's so many good calls here and let's go to Stan in while loosing Pennsylvania I'd probably miss that up standing around with markets\n[laughter] Oh thank you mark a great call you know you're got a great program there I really appreciate it\nI'm actually a Jersey in who's visiting here and so I'm a escaped you know enemy territory for a while hopefully we can get Menendez out of their uh God but uh I was calling basically uh uh\nI guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the on the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people\nIllegals not only voting for bringing them into other states to vote in other states and it was like really absurd and are sick and um you know how to stop that [noise]\nAnd if you remember like during the ah was when we were sitting up governments here in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war is [noise] they were taking a people who are voting and\nDying their ... you know there are some purple you know they couldn't vote more than once\nAnd I would say like if we can do that overseas why couldn't we do that here [laughter] so we wouldn't have known not only illegals but people voting more than once in a you know disenfranchising other people's vote and a\nYou you know the whole controversy over voter id that the other side had money doesn't\nThe vote and a\nMinute you you know the whole controversy over voter id\nAnd the other side had money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's a big crime to ask someone to you aren't let me see if you are who you say you are so you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal you know the oh or being races were made this you know\nHow could you do that yet I by the way my position is different than most people I don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put some for some effort\nI'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or get to vote on the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I think it's also about uh like you said the\nVoter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and I'm saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes into vote\nAnd you know you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that and while you're there voting where they just take your picture\nAnd start the process of creating a voter id since you're already there it's not like you had to go someplace to you know to get a voter id you're already there so they take a picture of person and say you are a digital camera feed it into facial recognition\nSay in a in a tri-state area and see if that per person pops up\nIn another ward or district or state on the same day and you know like you said a digital camera you could check and check and see if they voted\nPreviously on that day and age\nBut at the same time he could be starting of voter id form you know they sign that you got the picture you do that you have their dress\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know or you go back and you bring to the id to them mail it to them\nAnd uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them to see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered and more than one place\nAnd well there are two problems okay first the other side does it they won't vote for ... I think he was often often evidently I Know that but there's another point that you didn't think of\nI don't know that your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures or they can't even find my name is the time if I don't know Pennsylvania yes or no I wouldn't know originally you know I'm right right so you go in the ... who are you oh my\nGod that's you go over to that table you're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out and if I ever won the Newbery vision visual valid yeah it is scary so if you had it also gives them cameras to take the picture I don't think so but you have to stand you have some ideas but they're not going to work I have a great evening\nI I I tell you one one thing I did have a women's vote one time it was a primary and uh I had a I asked them if I can have you know a write in ballot\nOr right and uh\nAnd he said oh yeah yeah you you can never write in doubt I walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nAnd it was like\nTotally amazing you know what's going on ... and he said well uh [noise] oh oh you know you're a you're wanted vote Republican and goes uh or or a Democrat\nI couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do or writing ballot and I says well you said I could ... says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write invalid or not right you know I\nThought it was I thought it was gonna be worse\nThey have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in dollars\nRight you know I\nThought it was I thought it was gonna be worse than I thought it was gonna say you can only a write in on the Democrats like you can't frightening and if you're a Republican and why my

out\nBut uh no I wear my Trump care I wear my Trump pat I where would I Want to wear and I think we all need to take that position and are Republicans better get out and vote and and I I'm a black person but I'm going to say that\nI don't understand any white person\nVoting for a Democrat anymore because it seems to me that if you're not with them white people are the enemy and as a black person I have lost family members they tell me I I think I'm white I'm like what do you mean what what is that what you know that's a\nCrazy statement I don't think I'm white I think I'm Free I think I have liberty I think I should be able to choose and who I Want to choose and you are so right with what you said about Obama we are being as he was the worst president in history as true history is going to Buress out on that\nBut we waited and we are joined the Tea Party I mean that was what it really started for me to get very active because I realized that these people are on there\nOn a rampage they were on to take away our rights and I think the people in this country you can hear my voice but understand something they want to take your liberty and it's time for give me liberty or give me death\nJust it\nNo you you said a very well you're very articulate and I think that is the battle I don't know if you heard me the first night this week when I said this is a civil war going on in this country between those who you know Manhattan's country yeah and in ... and ...\nLiberty and freedom and we'd better ... and you know with and I think it's time for the Republican politicians like ... you know\nUh when Rand Paul's I'm afraid somebody's gonna get murdered though we're not afraid somebody's going to get Martin veterans' day or something he could very well happen as they've already tried it and you see the yesterday or candidates who out campaigning one was not to the floor yesterday he that's sort of stuff shouldn't even happen\nThat shouldn't even be happening and I'm Wondering where the campaign workers you got somebody that you've got you and your team out there and somebody just cold ... personnel on the floor see they should've carry that other person out of there\nThat other person should have been on a gurney\n[laughter] if you were to ... somebody got to beat him down\nI Love your and I'm just hire your passion yeah no you're right we know we have to everybody else\nWe are the second amendment party\n\nAnd we and I'm not saying going out there shooting people but I'm not going to I mean I think we have the right to defend ourselves against them and we need to take that stand\nWell that's a ... a propaganda that once you to think that way that the rule is it the parent has to be on the sovereignty of the American government\nAnd just to give you another example of American citizen goes you know let us many many decades in another country and has children their children are automatically citizens could they act out some kind of lengths that residents say in the United states before they had yet to\nBut that's not true Frank or babies they don't have to they don't have to the parents don't have to have a ... as you say you know flabby citizens have sovereignty and some minor ...\nAnd the color of skin let us know if we're wrong or but that's not my understanding that if if they're born here and that's why you see the people come here all the time he we talked about that a pregnancy in the hospital that people come here from other countries and tried to time and so the baby can be born here\nI I if I'm wrong call me at eight six six Ninety red Iowa I Want to know I don't want to say something is incorrect\nLet's go to\nLet's go to rich in Charleston South Carolina richer on with mark\nMark a good job and I don't say Phil and look as we had a concept when I was in the navy you're sitting in the chair you're the commanding officer you are doing a great job okay thank you um Yes sir Yes sir great great job like I said a moment point is this here's here's the thing\nOkay thank you um Yes sir Yes sir great great job like I said I'm On my point is this here's here's the thing with the purists definition of terrorism as I understand it\nTerrorism relies on the the fear of the use or the fear of the threat of force of violence coercion intimidation to subdue the opinions abuse the will of the people that is directed at so\nI think it would be safe to say that the left is by and large are domestic terrorists\n\nThat would be something I Would think that that's that's that's the way I'd go with that I mean if if I mean look there they're shooting at the ballpark shooting up Steve ... you know I mean the by the grace of God the man still alive today\nOkay um you just you just had a

wanted to ask you what did you think of the tax cut passed by Congress and the president\nIt was a really helpful for ...\nUh one of the things that happened was during the Reagan years we reduced marginal tax rates for people individuals top rate was Seventy percent\n... percent during World War two a Kennedy took it from Nineteen Seventy Reagan took a ... they just twenty eight [noise] unfortunately Bush and Clinton and Obama\nRaised it back up towards south over forty percent and uh so at the individual level we began to take the rates down a little bit but business taxes is where the United states was ... the rest of the world or the rest of the world started experimenting with lower\nBusiness taxes low or corporate income taxes when we took our individual rights down and did very well back in our will quite a lot of Eastern European countries after they left the Soviet Union their individual rights like Fifteen Percent Hungary it's business tax nine percent\nWe're at three o'clock we had the highest business taxes in the world and then we sat around ... how can we can't compete with China and Germany and stuff like that in Ireland\nAnd the tax front than most of the country's law the average European ... about twenty five ten points better than what we used to be you know we were at thirty five they were twenty five and they would beat us when they said let's say I doubt that will be ... like invested ... million dollars where do I put it chip I invested I taped us joke thirty five percent of everything and I\nIf I put it in Germany it only takes ... I don't generally pot and were shipped to that down and we're seeing a massive\nA diversion of a foreign direct investment [noise]\nOut of your it did I get a for starters though is a a five hundred billion dollars half a trillion dollars in the last six months which was arranged by American companies\nOver seats and we used to have a lot until\nThe Republican tax reform punished you if you brought me back to the states he left it overseas is maybe three trillion dollars to the left over Shays I'm partly because largely because our tax policy said we will hurt you if you want to bring the money to act and if you don't bring it back that's okay\nAh show three trillion stock overseas because of our tax policy and we said you know what we're not doing that anymore\nIf you earn money and I'd stay through tax it but if your money in print French people take some of that but you got to bring up the whole day America\nGood they'll ... they'll probably no penalty for bringing like back then I said how 'bout that ad that we've seen a tremendous again half a trillion dollars buys it and come back last six months and an apple they said look we have two hundred and Ninety billion dollars of earnings\nOverseas name ... billion right back and said you know what because it's no longer had allies to move buddy from London to New York or Texas um\nWe've read all back now it's all coming back but right now where they live and in a London back because it doesn't matter in terms of our access to capital\nWhether it's in London or in Arkansas are whereas before it\nDid show the money might as well are ready to be back but\nWe've seen a half to try and come back immediately and we'll see more as a as we move forward\nAdded that guy's overseas you know German and French people and a resilience making decisions are sending their money to the United states rather overseas is really irritated Europeans\nBecause we're much more competitive than we used to be and that's been a big help\n[noise] yeah I Know I can see why is it just seems so obvious all these things seem so obvious to me I have a couple of more questions and we're going to get some of the callers questions for you also but right now we're going to take her in our national forecast for Romney tracks\nLake effect snow on Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of snow with a system\nOn Lake Erie now from Erie PA oh to Cleveland, Ohio on eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the Midwest and northeast in fact everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies\nRain for Texas continues today we're looking at close to two months worth of rain for some parts of central Texas snow in the southern Rocky's\nA little too warm for snow in Denver the overnight low thirty four high later today at fifty nine it's winter weather preparedness week in Colorado reminder that\nOh in Denver the overnight low thirty four high later today at fifty nine it's winter weather preparedness week in Colorado reminder that winter weather can arrive quickly and oftentimes without warning and the high country and there's today's looked at your national forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nI didn't have to pay check every two weeks since ... once a month we said send the check like the electric bill and the phone bill or on April fifteenth said send the check the whole year and ... is the IRS person I was talking to I interviewed for the the papers right he\nSaid there'd be a revolution [laughter] it's\nA you know there were I think if someone had to write you know check my little one ten twenty whatever there would be you'd have a new Tea Party right or\nAny of these days with very yeah it make it clear to actually pay\nNo let's go I promised a color to mark in Albuquerque New Mexico you're on with mark and with Grover Norquist [noise]\nI think ... I'll tell you what you just two words right out of my mouth and here's what I've always thought flat tax and it's ... percent a\nCross support it don't matter whether you're a Warren Buffett or whether you're the guy work down there with Donald seven\nEliminate every deep Doug seem that there is as far as I say uh with the tech fuel eliminate all federal tax is\nWhether it's the fuel tax that we pay or whether Social Security\nIncome tax you name but if it's a federal tax it no longer exists you will limit the six teams that bad but in that in order to raise taxes if you're going to do it as Congress that means\nYou have to have a super majority of both the house in the Senate to foot the bill on the president's desk for him to sign up for ...\nFor it to become a ballot\nOr election of on every two years if that's what they're going to do and it requires a super majority of all register\nVoters in order for the taxes to be ratings and I I think you know and as you just mentioned\nAre it does it come out of your pay check you write the check\nEvery month or every quarter and believe me once people realize how much they're paying out and taxis they would they would there would be a revolution in this country like you would not believe because I was self employed and I had to write that check every quarter\nI couldn't believe how much I was having to pay taxes\nInteresting groove or what do you think of that to his idea\nI think he's right and a number of the ideas you put out there are in state constitutions uh in California and Nevada\nOr if you if the government wants to raise taxes state government wants to raise taxes it's a two thirds voted legislature because taxes are about as permanent as constitutional amendments which usually take two thirds or to impose on people\nAnd if you say it takes two thirds to raise taxes\nIt really slows but the tax and spend down doesn't stop them completely but it really slow it down it has to be a really good idea it has to have rod support a to an act and it I think a flat tax with a super majority to raise taxes\nUh would dramatically change our policy curious\nWhat do you think about some people propose the sales tax consumption tax so what's your response to that\nWell in Europe they have a value added tax which is a sales tax at every\nStep of production if you're going to have a twenty percent sales tax is have European countries do you really have to you can't just collect it at the supermarket 'cause everybody would buy their stuff and then\nDown the street from the supermarket out the back of a truck or so they put that twenty percent at every level of production the farmer pays that the guy who\nTrucks goods into town pays at a twenty percent on his ... to ... percent tax but it little amounts and there's no one place we can avoid ah\nThe difference between the United states and Europe is Europe and\nHas a sales tax up at the national self actually die you added tax which gets every level of a production [noise] ah it's why they have higher taxes to leaders scooping income taxes and high income taxes you can only get so much money out of an income tax\nPeople will quit working out work around that hide money [noise] um when you add to that the difference between the United States Europe is that we\nSales tax they do some people say no no we want to\n... reading the income tax and have a national sales tax tax in stat books kind of what they promised Europeans and the Japanese and the Asians and the Africans when they put that in overseas\nOr it will be in addition to it will not be instead of and if we could\nAnd I'm for bringing that income tax down towards zero I'm what you want to do is we just spend it\nNot just turn it into a different tax what who cares if you got rid of the income tax it took the exact same amount of money out of ... how would that change anything it's the same amount of money out of your pocket or it it makes you feel better somebody else's writing the check\nBut everything you buy from your house cheer car cheer cheer for dear close would cost more that that the taxes would be hidden in that so [noise] um [noise] I think going to a single right tax income tax ah and reducing spending his route to go to that if you got taxes down enough\nThat you could shift from a ten percent income tax too you know a Fifteen Percent sales tax cuts\nGet discovery water or at yeah I I wouldn't mind that but you got to get the government to half its presence size before you could\nRisk that and you really have to have protections how do we know we're not going to end up with both an income tax and the sales tax too many countries have had been hit with that\nAnd there's no incentive and the part of politicians because they get their money campaign contributions right is part of this have you know give me this donation someone in a lower your taxes this they don't want the thing solved eventually right that would reduce their campaign contributions to the enemy of my part\nHaving taxes that I'm a complicated allows politicians to raise money or to protect people bit by bit where everyone's you're paying a one percent in the same percentage less ... less opportunities to make money for politicians\nAnd lawyers and accounts maybe my final question for you will maybe I've got two more what about the midterm how you know what do you know if the Democrats ... take the house what do you think about what's going to happen to pack situation\nIf the Democrats take the house there'll be no tax cuts for the next two years ah they will do push-ups protects increases that want to waste a trillion dollars and higher taxes Hillary ran on raising taxes by a trillion dollars over a decade\nAt least to try and I'm from where we were we cut taxes uh trading and a half ... they want to raise them a trillion from where we were so that's two and a half trillion dollars in taxes\nPer decade that they want to increase taxes will be pushing for that [noise] I I think with both Trump and the Republican Senate that they want to get a tax increase but they'll sit there and say hey if you want\nThe military to get paid will only do that ... only passed on just because ah the soldiers and airmen and Tim and buy it if you give me a tax increase their what they were spent two years\nTrying to get a tax increase [noise] um I Hope they will fail that is what I Will be working on 'em but Democrats\nOn the tax issue like teenage boys on a Sunday they keep asking for the same thing in different ways that just again and again and again that keep coming back but I Want one thing going higher taxes\nAre and they will ask that question twenty different ways of the green taxes it will save the planet that will be and the taxes that only paid the other people or they will we package the same tax increase\nMaybe maybe a new Supreme Court tax to pack the court who knows they can come up with anything quest talk about it\nReally I didn't hear that yeah yeah\nI hear a lot of us want to get out of it and they want to re of Britain proposed a tax for it or even or course president Americans for tax reform had people get in touch with him\nAt our website at H. E.
