he's a separate from that can believe that we've talked about how many never Trump or as we mentioned this last week how boom I said ooh wow all of a sudden they are absolutely\nIn in support of of of cabinet and furious and I haven't talked about the never Trump or is it I Know that had built alliances with Democrats because of their hatred towards Trump yes and now they're fighting with each other\nBecause when it comes down to it\nWell except maybe for Bill Kristol\nThe one the one old out [laughter] except for except for Bill crust and I haven't seen it\nYeah exactly so you know they're

it and you know and it's a great point spent twenty six years in public service and the hope what what and that's why it's not about him what I think it would I think it is and I think it's bigger than just Cavanaugh I think it's the realization\n... from ... I think you're the realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump yeah and don't like where the Republican Party is going where they've realized\nA we've got to come home for a while because those people are insane I Know a case you're Cortez yesterday said the writers insane or we'll go through whether she actually had an substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see what what\nAre the left is doing to Kavanaugh when you see the presumption of innocence is is gone when an allegation itself is enough to destroy someone's life\nThis goes beyond a political issue it goes to what one Trump the election it is\nBut it is the culture war but it's also and and I and I say a culture where because it's a war on it it's it's it's about\nIt's about fairness it's about the belief in the constitution look\nWe don't we were never tremors we've criticized Trump when we were you know we were never on that never ever got about ... ... voted for\n... are you and I don't practice political I dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're not going to see us at rallies going ra ra ra whatever my candidate does we will tell you is the best ... well you know who has the best idea and what particular issue and why\nAnd we ended up voting for the person who most reflects what we believe not everything that we believe because that would be impossible as and as adults will see that what do we know many\n[laughter] [laughter] I think I Would only vote for air as I read Rick Perry and one of his was one of his first interviews after dropping out of the election and twenty six being you know well ah you know I guess he wasn't your first choice they told the interviewer will know my first choice was\n[laughter] and and so I I think when when you see that that ... it it's just been it's been brought back to many of these ... going on and many of them who started making alliances with people on the west yeah\nYou know trying to build these emotional as I saw on social media from some of the people that I Know that are never Trump hers but all of a sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this\nI mean you really ... this is what you really we wow\nWhat were you know we thought you know this is almost like the McCain funeral well we thought that there are actually people out there in the Democrats' side they don't want it to come together to find the common ground that we have and now the realization is no they don't and I think a lot of people this is a wakeup call look the party isn't perfect\n[laughter] if you listen to the show you know when we talked about the Republican Party or a or listen to the pocket from yesterday show [laughter] but the the the party isn't perfect but again everything's when you get to this point to the actual election it's a binary choice\nIt's a choice between this group in that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one\nAnd I think that's what a lot of uh never Trump or looking at right now saying whoa ... who you know when when um\nOh ... who was at a I'm trying to think of the the the\nOh oh yeah yeah it was a ... member was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump rather vote for Hillary\nI thought this would because I I I saw that a\nA Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that and I saw it on social media and a lot of people furious ... excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary\nAnd and that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now well except for Bill Kristol a and\nAnd those that are Jonathan is it ... they're at a use it on Fox News on the on the the the money block and I think Fox businesses as well he was one of those [noise] otherwise\nConservatives that what came out with the I'm with her remember that yes past jak I'm with her right that by the way that was after\nThe the the house report that house GOP report the eight

where we are cloture vote on a friday the Senate all members of the Senate will be able to see it the next couple of days at a statement\nYou and I were looking for an update to the story a just a little while ago and we did that during this past break and a Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying that all senators will have an opportunity to review the report\n... over the next couple of rice as we do that and you know because the the cloture vote could happen you know late friday so they could take all day Thursday and all day friday a and I suspected that ... while he may not allow multiple copies to be made again there's only one single copy\n'em that he could easily say well OK over the next couple of days we'll we'll take our time with it and it won't be the the one hour restriction\nA you know maybe a each of them can go into that room are either as a group or individually and they can you know take their time with it\nUm and and they likely will do that but I'm I'm guessing they will do that either and one large group or or smaller groups even\nAh in order to to see everything\nUh we had seen the story or late yesterday that the top FBI a lawyer a James Baker offers explosive testimony on a normal handling of the Russia probe into the Trump campaign uh and that's a Fox News headline from uh yesterday was going through additional\nMaterials here in the last hour and saw the hill dot com and John Solomon\nOf who I Believe was with the was a circa yeah certainly news yeah when when they when they released the ... they were the ones who desert order I circus or a car to write new I Believe it was both of them that did the story on the Pfizer courts rebuke in the Obama administration this goes back to ... way back in May of\nOf of twenty Seventeen well his story goes to the specifics of it and the specific of the allegation will get into the the the details of it but here just as the first line congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith Democratic Party lawyers that's Perkins Kuwait\nTo talk about allegations of Donald Trump and the Russia collusion weeks before the twenty sixteen election and just before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign so that would have been late September or early October ... at the latest ah in twenty sixteenth if while [noise]\nYou know talking about a blue wave in the Senate so you have to assume that McConnell still going to be in place or in the new year but the point being\nA Democrat doesn't want to go out and blatantly violate that rule ah because they know internally that's going to create a lot of problems for them going forward\nI'm not saying they won't do it but but uh there's a huge disincentive for them to to to do that but you probably could see them saying look ... and it it's going to be this it's already this run the liberal media\nOr NBC News on on Wednesday well there are dozens of people dozens of people I think they said over forty people that have said that that have ah have information or potentially they could be witnesses that's one of the words they use to potentially and their story\nOr that that could help substantiate all these claims and blah blah blah\nThat's not how this works they don't get to control that but the but nonetheless that will be the narrative and you'll probably see a couple of senators or during the day on Thursday or friday more likely on friday as they try and hold an elevator doors open\nThey're going to try and and block they're saying this was not enough that the we need a greater background check they did an interview enough people uh they didn't talk to Ford or\nKavanaugh there's new allegations that are coming out yeah are that are uncorroborated too so we need to investigate them since there is no cooperation we need to find the clobber I mean it's going to go down to the ... but I I I Do believe that\nBecause the ah Republicans most likely want to abide by the rule that Democrats\nWill do everything they can to claim\nFor example is Adam Schiff has done all along and Adam Schiff ... not on this but Adam ship since we will be talking about uh the whole a Russian collusion investigation coming up in a bombshell\nOr out of a of out of DC uh yesterday about the James Baker ... uh uh apparently telling the house or the house or a I don't know which panel it was\nBut uh in in test closed door testimony yesterday telling them\nHe talked to the Democrat the Democratic national committee's lawyers right before they got the warrant right and and and James Baker top FBI official or at that time which without question shows the politics played a part any talk to them about\nWhat was going on and he talked to the DNC lawyers about\nAn investigation that was going on which is absolutely\nThe wrong thing to do right\nNow you cannot nobody can defend that in an investigation so it's getting to where you and I ask questions over a year and a half ago is this where this is going and we ... you know the thing is every question that we asked\nAbout where this where what might have happened here in what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question on has come true\nAnd it has all come out in a in a series of reports you know if you look at it it it ... well at least it's it's there has been\nPeople the media has looked into those questions I guess we could say right um that\nWell first of all one of the first questions the big question really\nWas there a potentially is there are we looking at possibly a gross abuse of power under the previous administration that that uh a person or persons\nKnowingly used false information to which is the Giuliani pointed out you know there's a there you have it there's your your your perjury um but they they in soliciting for\nThat's a ... court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up falling off the top of the hour might point out Adam Schiff is though Adam Schiff\nHas claimed for the longest time that there is collusion there mhm and since we can't see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and out of the feeling the Democrats do the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah you know in this because the Republicans won't release it so that they won't release it and they know the Republicans won't release of because Republicans\nYou know a ... ... ... ah in the in the Senate want to keep a this\nRuling affect that hey we can't be black but not every background check we do have our bridges of of every judge we're not going to do that\nAnd so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may force the Republicans to release it here\nIn the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I could finish the show here\nIn the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours the rest of the show go home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM [laughter] so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in the ... I really think that\nYou may see that led said right do you go to mark is in Virginia Marcus welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show high [noise]\nHow're you doing [noise] hey I just what you were saying Adam Schiff to investigate it I think he's been a leak in the old time he may into [noise]\nThat I Know it has I mean well I don't know if you ask for it [laughter] right we all believe yes I mean I grew up in a a whole family a Democrat my whole life and even even my father lifelong Democrat my sister my brother in law everybody [noise]\nThey're they're like totally disgusted with what has happened with the Democratic party yeah yeah I can I don't think it's going to last I mean they they ah overplay their hand well they went off the rails said\nThey did but keep in mind Marcus in ... and thank you for the call we all share is a\nBig big old there hey my I got two kids and college fake socialism the greatest thing in the world\nSure and and that's what's going to keep the insanity alive that's why it's not really there I don't see them coming back from where they are a because this is now the mainstream the mainstream has to follow look [laughter] uh it doesn't matter a who's a protester is or what the causes\nThe main stream has to follow look [laughter] uh it doesn't matter uh who was a protester is or what the causes\nThe party the protestors the far left now leads the party they lead the media they're very active in the media [laughter] they're part of the media you know that's what the ah you know they were saying former CNN officials or or or management uh including Chet Turner\nAre saying they become a CNN's become too political and Jeff Greenfield coming out saying who used to run CNN coming out saying you know it's the these the people at CNN believe they're part of the anti Trump resistance their activists as we've\nWe've known for a while but\nThis is not going to change that is not going to end they're not going to they may have overplay their hand here but what they'll tell you as we didn't do enough what they'll tell you as we didn't ramp it up enough\nAnd even if he's confirmed this weekend\nAnd we move on from this don't believe that they're empowered\nBecause they at least got the delay got they got they got the supplemental background check done and all of that they put the pressure on Trump and and they were able to manipulate Trump and the Republicans although it's Jeff Flake\nAnd that's that's going to be around it but on the the other side they're going to know\nA that they're in they're in trouble because because at the Supreme Court at this point then you have\nA a five four maybe not on everything that would be viewed as originalist store construction in stores they call it conservative which would I think is mislabeled ... of it but they will uh you know it's going to it they know\nThat if Trump is reelected in twenty twenty that's why I think they're going to go up up the insanity or whether they win or lose any seats or whether they take over the house or whatever there it's going to be pure insanity from now till twenty twenty\nBecause they know that if there's it between now and twenty twenty if there's a Supreme Court a seat that opens\n... we've seen how insane it's been now where they're promoting the fact that there is no presumption of innocence right how's your wife I mean this is where they are right now so how far would they go who knows but they don't ... I Can't I\nDon't think they can imagine Trump being president until twenty twenty four because then there's a possibility of two or Supreme Court seats that was your civil they moderate their message in order to maybe be able to win\nOr will they just up the insanity for the next two years yeah the uh\nThe Trojan Horse or a tactic oh we'll just moved to the middle a little bit in order to gain

you're listening for the first time I know that this is all calculus I think most people that I'm listening for a while to the show understand where we are going\nWell it it ultimately when you when

in the Hillary campaign to pay to offer Perkins ... within paid a opposition research firm fusion GPS who paid a former British spy who got dirt he says from people close you know Russians close to the Kremlin on verified that they\nThen taught to use against Donald Trump to defeat his campaign and when that didn't work tried to destroy the legitimacy of the election and use that on verified information that they got from the Russians are to get themselves a Pfizer worn a secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd what we're being told now is that somebody from the FBI met with the

they get fifty or more we've got a Christian Battle Creek Michigan Chris welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show\nThey are good that [noise] [noise] well I'm curious about and it's just something that went through my head is what do you uh what do you guys think about the idea that the whole reason\nThey held everything and that they've been doing what they've been doing and they laid the groundwork for in the hearings by a claiming that he gets kind of partition and attacking them is that\nThey didn't think they were actually gonna be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh so what they've been doing is laying the groundwork to once he's elected and is on the Supreme Court from this point forward\nThey're going to claim he's part is in and try and demand that he recused himself or abstained from any votes\nThey deal with anything they want to but they if they don't they can do\nHe's ... now that's not he's the only person that can recused himself\n[noise] okay yeah they can't scream that\nWell they vary greatly those lawyers screaming all day long but they'll get nowhere can't get anywhere with it okay I've heard lawyers you know try and no show that judges should recused themselves oh yeah great at how well\nYou know when they lose the electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know that we should do away with this process we should change the way that Supreme Court justices are seated and we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules right\nAh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm\nI Can't remember we've even there's been some cases were review been said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves or I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we've talked about that in the past and I remember I\nCan't wait we're an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they receive the down the it's got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argue the case or something um then but but again that's up to them because if it or\nOr there for example they're arguing the case it deals with the law you know with the company and their wife works for the company and writes for the company's ... at that point you have to recuse yourself but to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't ruin anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at them that's not\nHold any water yeah ... you remember when the talk about ah you know his nomination this was back during the Gorsuch nomination process or the talk was well the the president should nominate his sister\nYou know and it was like OK let's [laughter] she would have to recuse herself from every case of that [laughter] well that company is indirectly working with my brother's company and the and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that uh well\nWith my brother's company and the and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that the well she's part of his family but the ...\nThe the process and you and I were having this discussion during the break\nThere is a great deal of respect by everyone that seated on the court right now for the process\nNot that they make the decisions that we should always agree with in fact a a while I can think of three that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter] but we can\nTalk about that but the procedure\nOn procedural issues\nAll of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court\nHave a great deal of respect for those procedures and how you move forward with the case uh it is not\nIt is not driven like the social media world up today at the Supreme Court in terms of procedure\nNow the hearings often have these interesting comments that come out of um an questions that come out of them and then the media takes him and runs with them often out of context or they did that with Scalia or but you know there's but but still in terms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect what each of those that are ...\nBut I I think you make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the\nFederal judges to begin with is not the social media world that I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that it's not the social media world that we live in\nFor example most people don't know that a former Justice Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great great friends were great I'm One needs to make that their ... their their family their families used to\nVacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find two polar opposites so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we haven't said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to ask the judges\nPrivately what they believe about the process of cabinet is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that way because they don't even to the\nDoor this is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate in two thousand nine controlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the the content of the three oh two cigarettes\nIs likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if this uh if some content came out just imagine that we never heard Dr Ford's name but the claim came out what they would do is look at that and go okay well is there anybody backing it up because the claim would be in the three oh to\nAccept that they found that they couldn't find any anyone with first hand knowledge of the event or the claims\nThen they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well they know the Senate knew back then that you take something like that a simple plain that cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but here's here's the point\nTalked about with all the federal judge ships alter forget about the Supreme Court just the federal judge ships out there that background checks are done how many thousands\nThat are on cooperated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are uncooperative did I ordered to defeat somebody\nAnd never get known to the public eye only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rural ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the set of complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority\nThat is a more construction is well journalists core and then\nLearning of this this rule now it puts it all into perspective she knew that if she turned Feinstein\nIf she turned this information over to the FBI took that as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official three oh to report and you wouldn't hear about it\nBut it would have never it would've you know that's the ... when you think about that that's the whole point\nNobody would've ever known that this existed right her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... you were not would not have been able to collaborate and then at that point\nIt died just like probably the thousands of other allegation s ... you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices over\nThe decades and that's that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now what makes sense as to why\nFeinstein for her politically white worked to her end\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to lead to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it now you know why Lindsey Graham was so enraged yeah

well as he says\nTo talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election but it was lawyers meeting with lawyers right why why\nNot an agent asking some questions of the attorneys\nNo it was attorneys and the attorneys made it so former\nFBI general counsel James Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee he's private law firm ... that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay research firm fusion GPS\nWho then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy to compile the dusty a oven cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a Bible testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect the dossier was connected to the ... main law for them and and it was the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the Pfizer court in October twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI\nOpposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer to hide the Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed a gym beggar was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to divulge the testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the Perkins Kuwait law firm\nAnd the FBI we've often state of the ... I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four\nYeah you can do a couple of seasonal you could do probably more seasons then law and order a couple of seasons of it because we've always broken down\nAnd since we've been on it for such a long time I do believe that you know you could include us in the group that was first in asking that so many of the important questions on this when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack\nEnd or changed because of change than to hack and or to change the outcome of the election and then the reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones\nWho colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump\nOn verified\nInformation still today yes\nAnd oh by the way if it's on verified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's false after [laughter] after ever over after over two years right so and and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that\nIt was to destroy the legitimacy of a lead shit presidential election in the United states and they tried to do it by taking that information\nThat information\nAnd and ... well faking it as in allergens instead of\nOpposition research to the Pfizer court to spy on the Trump campaign is exactly the accusations they and they don't make it against Trump\nYes they still make the say he's treasonous for Russian collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party and all those things that I just ... brought up right now\nAll the way to the whole Pfizer court and you everybody knows it's true\nI don't know of anybody decide or or that as\nIt tried to even debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others that circle news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out\nUm and what was going on the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together in the last two years here's the problem with\nHaving something go on for so long\nWhere it is active because it is still active Mueller and his team are still working which means it's still relevant even though right now on the left they've gone very quiet on it\nIt's that you have more time to shed light on the truth\nThat's a problem for anyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario\nWhere do you think about it I Can't even apply to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right\nLonger that you go on and you look at the you know the allegations that have been made the story starts falling apart as more investigations go on as you've seen you know with the ah the ah you know Evan Eddie's right or a thing\nInvestigations go on as you've seen you know with the uh the uh ... you know Evan Eddie's right a a thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it still remains\nYou know a milk cooperation for these particular stories right they they go nowhere mhm and so the longer time that you do with whether it's you know you're you're able to find out more of the truth and\nLike I said more the truth of what

ten points just a but in July ... and now it's down to two which is in the margin of error which means it's a dead heat\nYeah yeah I I think it's interesting because I've been questioning the methodology\nA and I mean just not that I doubt the methodology I'd just have some questions about the methodology and what's going on with the way the but the FiveThirtyEight dot com is putting together they're basically a composition type poll based on all the polls\nAh in all the districts\nAre for the house seats it's interesting to look at it but I'm not so sure that I buy that well as of right now it's roughly Seventy five percent chance that the Democrats take the house um that may be the case I'm just asking about I have\nActual questions about the methodology and how they're applying it to this big scale I'm very smart people at five thirty eight dot com\nOr so but I Do wonder about again the polls they're using I'm a registered voters versus likely voters a demographics

FBI official this is from the hill and John Solomon congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign mhm\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring

the presidential election the revelation was confirmed or by testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation\nRepublicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon or\nThe other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between ... law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground about the FBI's use of news media\nIn twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump\nThe interview was one of the most productive\nWe've had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said another said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI about at the media contacts citing ongoing investigation by the Justice Department inspector general into alleged\nIllegal leaks during and after the election about the Trump collusion probe and other\nMatters these revelations illustrate a new how much the FBI and Justice Department had withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the DNC fusion GPS\nAnd steel that we're trying to defeat Trump and so that is you know breaking news because what you have there you have you had the first person from\nThe last administration the Obama administration\nThat worked in the FBI you have them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon test to find the time when we were ... there's no reason\nIf you're investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the ... lawyers\nPrivate lawyers\nJust before you got a secured Warren right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said they talked to they talk to ... the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why\nWhy would that be why would that be\nSo that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure in the upcoming days\nOr they just want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to a near record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices this from Bloomberg now\nOver ... largest producer is currently pumping about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that's just shy of the record set\nIn November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrels he said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nAre the key insights distance from Bloomberg their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again to pressure from Trump\nNow we talked about this because we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now\nPressure from Trump\nNow we talked about this because we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil in the war yep we beat Saudi we'd be ... every other country and somebody called up and they said well the outcome prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors in a ... there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices have gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you produce your own oil here and we become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here well and\nAnd you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you had the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably\nAt some levels well that comes from an expansion as you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have a they don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations\nOnly the regulations were holding us back that we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nThan I'd give I'd give credit here to President Trump yet where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia ... excuse me\nWe're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we funding with their military where we're there for you all the time mhm uh and whoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia ... pact member veal pact member [laughter]\nVery good you know back in the field that member right Saudi Arabia or to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we talked about when he does extremely good things we talked about the fact that no other there was no other Democrat courses nor the Democrat there is no other Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one of the point I just wanted to make real quickly because we talked about the new NAFTA agreement ... um the wild stops it to be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we had said look we said this a long time ago we said one of the reasons that we are concerned\n[laughter] and we're ... babies are one of the original terribly terribly [laughter] you know one one of the reasons that we were concerned who said look\nEventually when this agreement comes out it's not really going to be different\nThan the agreement that that we have now ... or ... who is leading economists for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing\nYet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like a lot like the old NAFTA mhm Mexico's only significant concession was on automobiles in parts rules requiring more production in North America higher weight higher wages for workers\nAnd potential terrorists if its exports to the U. S. exceed two point six million vehicles that even though there's a cap because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance\nThey talked to judge Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower price models now assembled by Volkswagen miles to in a few other manufacturers in Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry\nBut they're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tear up and it will hurt us consumers us\nThe entry but they're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariff will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we upset and they said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from studying at expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments are they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with\nSouth Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed by it\nAnd as we said all along are we there's been a lot of us you know industry that has suffered because of this and you wouldn't have if you end up basically but the same deal\nOr things that you claim are great things that can't be enforced or as we said the auto things that hurt the economy and will hurt lower income people will then", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "04"}
