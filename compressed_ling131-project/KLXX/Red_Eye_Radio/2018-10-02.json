that\nLiz Swisher one of the cabinet as former classmates who are over the weekend a one on CNN and was interviewed by Chris Cuomo and was asked the question what do you know about Brett Kavanaugh that he was not truthful about in the hearing crumble asked\nHere's a quote I Would have stayed on the sidelines if he had said I'd drink to excess in high school I drink to excess in college I did some stupid things but I never sexually assaulted anyone ended up quote\nAnd then she said but to lie under oath to lie about that what else is true\n[noise] at the say right here National Review but what's your comment about what she believes capital ought to have said in order to be truthful lines up almost exactly with what Kavanaugh did say during this testimony I quote\nI drank beer with my friends sometimes I had too many beers sometimes others did I like beer I still like beer but I didn't drink beer to the point of blacking out and I never sexually assaulted anybody as\nWell and and he pointed out you know sometimes I went to sleep which by the way is what nearly one hundred percent of people do after a night of drinking\nI I but it's just you know and and you know\nI was you said it yesterday that the story started falling apart for them because immediately after they got the FBI investigation then boom or it they started with the all the you know ... everything else and it was his drinking what did those words really mean in his uh you know a a yearbook went to the slang or really mean and\nSo you know with that particular point they said ... okay we got to start

Midwest is moving off to the east we saw those heavy showers in Iowa portions of Wisconsin northern Illinois\nWhere all the media you know where where where they are located and we know a ton of you listen and you all know\nWhat NBC did was a complete have jobs that isn't journalism an allegation in itself without anything else to cooperate it\nIs not a story it's not a story that a manger that a major newspaper or a major TV network should ever run it lacks completely on any type of journalism ethics and\nHad that been someone claiming that about Obama in two thousand eight that it never would have something out is that what will you know it's coming out now is the leaks that completely anonymous\nYeah right there was another one uh ... completely uh uh of anonymous people are just sending letters hey I was abused right and then that's being like oh this is another letter in from somebody else have you have paid attention to social media\nBut you can make these people don't even use their real name on social media most often right [laughter] it just and and it's to me it it shows you know that\nComplain about President Trump\nUsing the term fake news about and directing it at you right if you put out that kind of piece of trash story\nBased on an allegation and ...\nThat this person is walking back everything\nThat they say\nAnd you can't find anybody to cooperate it you don't do with that story it's the same thing as I mentioned from I it was we talked about yesterday\nFrom Eric Brady at USA Today\nWhen he wrote will should Brett Kavanaugh will be coaching girls' teams not until the investigation is done and then talked about in his original article a credible source\nBy the way just the note as I said on yesterday show I I Know Eric Brady um was it used to knew him as a kid he was a really good friends with my neighbor across the street just\nSo people know right it's important see that's what you're doing your blood people know that [noise]\n'cause somebody might find out in and I as I said last night I said you know I've I've uh since I knew him when he was young and you know we've kept\nIn touch over the years just on Facebook or which is a spacious Facebook vows delete it but that was a piece of trash article that he wrote and said you know claim it as a news story not an opinion that credible evidence that there is no credible evidence against Kavanaugh it's a ...\nAnd and this is and that's why when you said that during the break it just it has hit home with me they're never going to\nGet off the break here no no this is and it won't end when Trump was no longer president this is not going to end no because in fact they'll feel more empowered Trump is the one who calls him out\nThe next guy or gal likely won't\nAnd here's what's interesting too so NBC goes with the interview from sweating it they admit\nThey can't find anything to back it up anybody else to back it up they go with the interview an interview\nThe story on the ... this is the prosecutor brought in to do the questioning at the hearing and the memo was released\nAnd on Monday\nNBC News decided that wasn't worth reporting now hit it Mitchell had reported\nThat mind finding is that judge Kavanaugh is not worthy of being seated on the highest court\nThat would have been the lead headline in fact it would have been an NBC News but right now if you're wondering NBC News why nightly news\nIs that an all time low\nThat's it\nNobody believes you and I see right through you\nYour tax nothing more nothing less\nAnd it's shameful behavior yes oh stop feeling insulted when Trump says your fake news right\nYou're not even worthy of his recognition frankly\nBecause you're nothing if you're going to put somebody up there you admit you can't backup independently as a news organization anything the woman is about to say you put her on the memo which is part of the official process from the prosecutor gets zero time\nYes we don't feel that the president should stoop to your level right that'll really take 'em off\n... well ... that's in and that's what ... that's ... and that by the way\nComing from a guy who ... who has how many times that we sat on this program there are times when somebody needs to just take the the his Twitter account way for a few minutes\nAnd and there are times when he doesn't speak effectively we're he says something that totally doesn't work a communications from this White House had been horrible but that's how bad it can be see but it's all you don't bird you shut it you have\nTotally doesn't work the communications from this White House had been horrible but that's how bad and the NBC but it's all you don't bird\nYou shut it you have an earned the right over him because it's also what you get from the left as well because of this president said there were changing the way that we do thing yeah\nWe haven't no\nWe haven't shall we don't care who secular communication when we we never we never change our standards of what we will do whether it's Obama\nWhether it's Bush whether it's Clinton while we were working together with Clinton [laughter] whether whether it's a a Trump we don't care no or certain ... and if the two idiots silver and I can do it NBC you certainly have the ability to do it you don't want to do\nWe know they go out of their way to put somebody on do an actual interview with somebody and that they themselves as a news organization camp backup and one word she's saying but ignore part of the official process and that statement was part the Mitchell a release that the memo was part of the official process\nThey could take it and take it to another prosecutor and asked that prosecutor well what did you think did you watch it did you what do you think of Kavanaugh's and Dr forge claims\nAnd what'd you say the same thing the memo did not even that they completely skirted the entire thing and then you're going to have\nAll these guys and gals chomping on cigars in the boardroom at NBC News trying to see what's going wrong wire ratings go well what's what's what's the problem here but well it's interesting because\nOne of the the one of the other stories that came out\nDuring the day on Monday is that you have the founder of CNN Ted Turner that says the ... has become too political this coming from a guy who's clearly on the left\nAnd is the founder of the network and then you have a the the uh the the former show runner really at the Greenfield Jeff Greenfield death or who ran CNN for years comes out and says\nThe people that work at CNN thinks that they're part of our act\nAs if they're the quote a they they count themselves as part of the anti Trump\nResistance we knows is we see it it's it's very obvious but when you have other people that were you know there before\nThat can look at it and say this is clear what's going on these people are active it's so not journalists they instead of opinion they're not even they won't even be a ... they they like cowards hide behind the word analysis\nThat's the new word for opinion\nRight opinion at the top\nYeah but opinion should be based on some well see why your hand analysis should\nBe here's the situation\nBut it's not it's here's my opinion so if you're going to have an opinion piece called opinion but you know what\nThe cat's already out of the bad people see right through these news organizations it's not tolerated anymore and you wonder why they're not trusted and you wonder why those CNN shows or at the bottom of the cable news and NBC is at the bottom\nOf

are saying well if the FBI investigations finished by Wednesday\nAnd I've been hearing this even though not officially different articles stating that yeah the FBI could get this wrapped up leaving heard Tuesday right or that or what Sunday or Monday I forgot what I heard that ... and now I hear in Wednesday it can be of a you know wrapped up even though the president has said\nYou know you can expand it but how far do you expand what does that mean expanding it expanded what\nWell what allegations and it well it would be expanding it too and in the in fact the coverage that I read was expanding it to essentially anybody that might be connected with these allegations which is the any other claimed witness along the way\nAnd if you expand it to that well you may first of all you may or may not get cooperation from that person this is not a criminal investigation\nSo they can they can call you or you know ask you a show up at your door and ask you if you would mind talking to them about this but that person doesn't necessarily have to do that\nLegally they don't have to talk to them and they're not they're not this is again not a criminal investigation and that person is not the target it if it were\nAnd now it's like what are they going to do their own version of losing it and well most\nOf us you off and you're breaking up on us that much but but you you you know we've asked ourselves that question a you know where do they go from here remember after twenty sixteen after Trump won in a again\nA you know as a as a a former President Obama said there was always a twenty percent [laughter] after\nThe election and you know it's a hundred percent I'm Out in the smartest president that we ever had to stand the room right to understand that it's a hundred percent because he won a uh but you know they were remember all the self reflection that happened at that time\nEric and I went into hysterical laughter Robyn nice on a time in late November early December twenty sixteen when they started you know getting reflected been saying we need to we need to and just start instead of just\nFlying over flyover country yeah we're not some work boots and some coveralls on Amazon we we need to lead to buy some having to work I Would say some coveralls and and we need to go into these towns and find out how the people are ... you know how they're thinking oppose will tell you you don't have to go there you don't\nDon't know if you really don't I don't have to go anywhere to know\nA significant portion of the middle class is thinking well even remember the ... the reporter uh who worked for the times that didn't even\nTo to the store is the is that he went to [laughter] it was his name Brian Williams I don't think it was [laughter]\nBut but you know you don't even have to I mean\nThat but it's it is a very basic point that\nHow can you be doing analysis real analysis not the opinion how can you be doing that in an election year if you really don't know what the sentiment is I'm not expecting them to have the same internal set of campaign without or that a party would have\nBut I Would expect that they would certainly have somebody maybe inside those campaigns are parties that would see some things and say okay there's there are real because Obama is not always a twenty percent chance he said that after the election but really\nYou know it was a couple of idiots overnight said\nDon't don't buy the hype in Pennsylvania watch Pennsylvania watch Pennsylvania because there was something else going on and it was anecdotal but if if we could see that really was out\nAnd we did research that they were not going to say there were no tools but we don't have the tools that are available that a news organization like the New York times or Washington Post or any of them have\nRooms filled with people that can I can do that we had to restart\nWe didn't have what either party had that two weeks before they started seeing the turn in Pennsylvania right uh in Michigan and Wisconsin then and we you know we might have had anecdotal evidence but we didn't have the same information\nThat they had where they started seeing that that to turn and and you know remember that as you look at the polls now I mean we're ... we're I'm very interested in what the polls are going to do\nNow for those people that because we always get the people will call or two polls are number right actually they are ... you can find polls as we have done if you listen to the show for any length of time\nWhether it was really twenty twelve and twenty sixteen will really started looking and saying okay what polls were actually correct right and what you find out is\nA yeah two months out three months out four months out the polls aren't that accurate once you start getting thirty days in ...\nYou start seeing that the polls start tightening and by the time you get to a couple of days beforehand or people for example say that the polls for drop are completely wrong no they weren't you know there were polls that were dead on for the numbers\nThey may not have the polls didn't figure out the electoral votes and you know you and I said well maybe they should start doing that I don't know how much money would cost them to do it right or not the the by the time you got to the the the polls are done on what the people are thinking\nUh and and so to get to those specific districts and and break them down and you would probably need more votes you would meet need more numbers than what you what your sample sizes\nYou know country countrywide so that might be a very tough thing to actually do to predict but they did know\nThe internal polls they started knowing about two weeks before that there might be a shift happening or in in certain districts are in Pennsylvania and and uh Michigan and Wisconsin\nBut the fact just the polls on the where the people voted some of them were down on yeah you're right I mean just within a half a percentage to\nPoint to the actual numbers and they said don't show Hillary winning or no show with Hillary would get in the raw vote and that's what she did get\nVery close to it and the same thing for Trump he won the electoral college ... so you know that's something that they since we've had to elect ... you know two very close votes ... ah you know back in two thousand and uh in in twenty sixteen\nPoll and then figure out the electoral college you know that way if there's a better way there's a better way to do it but well you don't you saw back in the day with Tim Russert she would he would sometimes break it down and say and paint scenarios going look\nIf this happens here and these districts here and those districts and this this precinct here in this state and all these come together you could see\nThe electoral votes in this state go to they he would break those down but you couldn't really I don't know that there was a that wasn't so much of a poll as it was really a demonstration as to\nWhere it might go that wasn't based on sentiment that wasn't based on respondents that was based on basically history and indeed given precinct or or any given district in a state\nYou know they would break that down they don't try and do that anymore but if you if you watched election night\nOf twenty sixteen\nWhat you saw was this I mean it was a very smoggy attitude it was they were almost doing it it was almost a parade for her Hillary Clinton\nAnd then into the evening\nThe later it got after the polls closed it just went down where it was a downward spiral\nBecause it was reality and they had painted the picture in the media helped of something that wasn't true\nAnd they saw it as landslide without looking at again you know how this might add up right\nBut looking at the polls now as we were we were you know doing earlier a ... in our pre show meeting a I I see a ton of races out there I mean I'm looking at the Arizona race right now the Arizona Senate race Mick Sally versus send them a Christian send them at the Democratic a Democrat and a Martha McSally the Republican\nAnd you know the the last repulsive send them up three seven six and three ah and but the but uh in earlier polls are earlier in the month\nA mix Sally was up by a couple well right now the latest poll was one to the from the sixteenth to the twenty okay rush still not into the mix of the whole cabinet thing and cinema was up by three but margin of error four point seven so that's a dead heat\nThen if you if you look at that overall except for the ah the one likely voter poll by CNN that was that was done where she was up by seven everything else shows that that really is a dead the that is a dead heat right there\nAnd we don't know what the polls are going into the cabinet vote I think a ... and again I think that the cabinet vote has the potential to energize both but I Do believe that it may energize Republicans more\nBe it he whether he is a not confirmed or confirmed\nThe energy that I see right now the motivation to voter motivation on the right to me is much greater than it was two weeks ago I don't know if I can necessarily say that about the left because I think the left has been on maximum overdrive for the last year looking at the last two years looking at this mid term right\nAnd so the energy is there I Do think just because I how important it is\nWhen you talked about the possibility of and again you don't we don't know one cabinet is going to do cabinet can get on and do what what what Roberts did you don't know mhm but the possibility and I were talking about were Roberts you know change the uh you know the the wording mhm\nAnd to fit the narrative that he wanted to ... people were shocked by it but on other things when it comes to regulations he is eight seems to be a construction and so all Supreme Court justices at times can be a mixed bag\nBut you just you never know how this is going to affect the election is going to be interesting to see what the polls are over the next couple of weeks more you're causing damage coming up if you'd like to get in lines open eight six six Ninety ride I\nCut me off was

wouldn't be\nWe wouldn't be standing here are just want to spend a couple of moments on this you know people want to talk about the capital thing but there's really a huge deal and I do think that\nUh this is something that the president politically can use\nA ... to help in the midterms when he's out there doing the rallies you know the the the we got the trade agreement and everything else\nNow the specifics of the the the trade agreement some good some bad mhm\nAh no the good is we don't go to a situation where we don't have any trade deal with Canada and Mexico that would be bad if the president decided to go in that in that direction I still don't think we won't know and it's very tough to predict what's not going to happen\nBut I don't think the president would have ever gone that direction\nOf course yeah in fact I think that President meant to say and that audio we just heard was the threat of terrorists\nBecause he knows that terrorists aren't good he's admitted it yes\nAh but the the the when you look at this the free trade agreement and I've got an email today from a guy saying you guys are the only true conservatives they think this deal stinks well number one we haven't really given her opinion on the deal and as we said last night\nThere are some parts of it we don't like it all including the major portion that the president has promoted but there's some good things in there\nAre now we did open up some agriculture and dairy now we heard about the dairy that was one of the big things the president promoted but his Wall Street journal points out we will only expand our market by one percent\nWhen it comes to dairy in Canada but still it's movement in the right direction and if you're making that more free trade world for that\nAnd that's a good\nThing or one of the reasons we didn't hear about timber\nIs because that's one of the victories of Canada got with Canada got was the president remember put the tariffs on soft timber or in

it because it was in the middle of the night in the U.S\nI said two things about uh you know the president and and the timing of things so when he was that the the summit in Singapore mhm after they did the the photo op with Kim Jong Eun he had his own press conference\nAnd he said to reporters these were global reporters saying look in a year from now I might be I might tell you that this deal did not work out didn't go the way I wanted and I'll probably make up a story you know make up an excuse\nThat was self deprecating humor and the other point that that I think that the other thing that America Mr course was his his wind in his victory speech that night of the election and and twenty sixteen um because what I what I heard was a humble public servant speaking\nAnd of course it wasn't a lot of that wasn't replaced by the media you really had to search for it but when you look at\nYou're how he started to appoint people and we said look this is going to play out differently because these the people who are being appointed\nIf they accept that you know or if they're that nomination than they know what they're in for right so he's getting the people that the put the cabinet and place and the staff in place that he really wants in his second year\nI think the case could be made by recent\nActivity or lack of activity that may be the president did this also settling in\nWith the media or he's been directed to tone it down a bit until after the midterms if it could be either or but I I\nI Do believe that the president has always been in the private sector comfortable in his own shoes that changed when he went from having zero bosses to having more than three hundred and twenty million bosses in one night and I think it you know I think it it it had him kind of all over the place\nOr for a number of reasons during the campaign and after the campaign as he became president\nAnd I think there is a case to be made as he's settling in and learning the

... you said ... will they come off the brink she's over it oh yeah oh yeah that's ... she but she made offensive comments on social media telling a Muslim Trump supporter to go\nOff and go to hell ...\nGeorgetown University said bears used our own and not the views of the university yeah run a statement\nTo the Daily Caller yeah\nIn other words we don't want this to affect student enrollment were you know uh\nWe believe she might have crossed the line there that I have a line\nIn my mind and I know uh just about where it is\nBy the way the last thing that we ever want to do this is why when we talk about free speech and they want to shut us up and then we don't want to shut them up and that's why we don't want to shut them up they never want to stop\nThat Georgetown professor ... letting people know exactly what she thinks fan that's why free speech is viewed a beautiful because she doesn't hide it you know who she is and what she is said and what she thinks\nAnd I don't think it's a Georgetown can make their own decision on whether she remains or not that's up to them we're not calling for anything\nWe know we know what populate the halls of these universities we know who

Republicans are ... are spending this much and and the fact is I look I don't blame the Republican Party and I don't blame the president why\nThe American people don't care can people don't care 'cause there's no political pressure this will continue\nAs I said this is this is my uh twenty ninth anniversary that this week of doing talk radio or the first issue that we had which was back in eighty nine\nWas the whole clean sweep that Congress was spending too much money and it's time for a clean sweep and monarch forget the protests all over the country people in front of congressional offices saying we need to cut back I think the deficit at that time was four trillion or less ...\nMaybe even three I care don't even remember what it was at that point ... but it was nothing and people were upset about it they were actually marching in the streets\n[noise] yeah like today something to get them are marching advantage what are you guys marching for the debt\nWho's that national debt oh\nBy the debt for every working American by the way every working American uh uh went into debt eighty I think it's eighty one hundred dollar yeah last year from the fed or get them every working American\nThe that that's that basically as it is split up on every working American that adds eighty one hundred on your behalf but remember in the tax bill last year ...\nThe only the only kind of people that are actually paying more for the debt paying more in taxes are people like Eric and myself who's taxes actually went up yes\n'cause we're enormously wealthy exactly that's why it's ... as the one caller said a couple of years ago billion a billionaire yes which was a surprise to all of us yes keep it up\nI'll tell you this if I was a billionaire ... I'd get rid of the\nFifteen year old vehicle that has two hundred and ten thousand mile oh yeah yeah yeah no I put that out what the trash [laughter] that would be gone my butler would I Would\nBut because of certain business adoptions that we both share ... ah we can't take them anymore and therefore our our business didn't matter [laughter] no nobody cares about oh we're not upset\nThat we are actually looked at the tax by the taxing was right thing to do as we've all for the state of before a irrespective of the unfairness towards us other problems 'til the spending\nA and and that's what it comes down to ... because the the the fiscal policy uh you know you you look at the the monetary policy of this this nation and and while [laughter] all over the place that especially in recent years but like over the last Twenty years especially\nBut beyond that the fiscal policy\nSomething very different because and this is it once you start creeping in once you get the foot in the door it as the government provides is provides this provides ... we'll start talking about making cuts start walking into the neighborhoods of America and start saying well in order to get our national debt and or\nWe'll start talking about making cuts start walking into the neighborhoods of America and start saying well in order to get our national debt in order we're going to start cutting back on this program this federal program and yours your child's school\nStart taking things away that's when\nPeople start getting motivated that's when they start paying attention now they wouldn't they still wouldn't be able to tell you the majority of them are there still wouldn't be able to name the three branches of government but they would tell you to get out\nAnd you are not welcome in that kind of policy is not well\nThere is because this is what it comes down to for a Obamacare spending and a number of issues that conservatives are watching and have been watching for ever\nEnter important because they've always been important but\nThis is it an end Obamacare as one of those you know on the way to getting to what the single payer system but the idea that you're going to get something and somebody else is going to pay for it well then the liberals like that one couple of ... in California well we'd like to Obamacare we voted for Obama we didn't know we were going to have to pay for\nThat's why even though you have when you had Jake Tapper of CNN and and even ... questioning a case yo Cortez reality and Gail I'm In Florida and and and Gillum about ... you know the\n... of Medicare for all because they understand what we're spending on right now how do you pay we're already going to be a trillion dollars in debt audio ... you can't pay for all ... and pay for what we're paying\nFor it today it's impossible so the only thing you could do is put massive debt\nOn the ah on the American people the other thing that isn't being talked about either as the because interest rates are going up ... how much of a bigger bite that's taking in how much an interest payments the American taxpayer it's growing exponentially yeah every single year now and we've talked about that over the last year but a\nA until it actually starts affecting people and that may be you know you know too late it could be ten years from now Twenty years from now I'm Thirty years from now odds are are you and I will both be dead when it happens\nBut as we've said is immoral and nobody wants to hear it but it's absolute immoral and unethical to be putting what we want today on the backs of

ignorance we talk about ignorance of the issues that's one thing and that's why people ... it's it's forming opinions not knowing what the facts are or just because you have a particular narrative this is what I find more than anything\nAh where I Know that when I was in my twenties I didn't say much you're getting minutes opinions because I wasn't sure what all the details worse why hesitated to do it it is the whole will never see it is the is the confidence well no there is a confidence today that exists\nOf promoting the\nYour opinion and being vehement and passionate about it and after about ten seconds\nYou go you really don't know the issue at all here do you not talking about you Robert I'm Talking about\nOther people that exist out they're mainly on the left I see it but the ignorance is even greater than just the news to it I\nI was when I was a when I was a bill collector in college I understood with the three branches of government work I went to twelve years I went to twelve years of school everybody wants to twelve years some of the vast majority of the population went to twelve years of school so I joined the\nEighth grade I Love your with the three branches of

three of them we all know but if you can't name all three of them then you don't understand the separation of powers the majority of people Seventy five percent of people could not named the freedoms and the first amendment to the constitution of the United states\nThe majority couldn't name ... or you know a a more than one freedom which was not on the the majority could name one freedom\nWhich is freedom of speech they couldn't even they couldn't even\nName that that's more we understand how people may not know what the story when that we understand is why we exist and we understand that a lot of people call us and say we learn stuff about it and therefore we can go out and we can form our opinions and that's the way that you should do it but it goes more than just the news stories it's dead after ... years and I listen\nTo multiple sources shark and what form my own opinion absolutely\nThat's what we always say don't believe us go do your own research ship\nAnd but as far as the

other talk radio at that time\nBut you know gas or whatever else and you know paying attention to news reading books reading the newspaper I wanted to know what was going on but it isn't the fact just to let you know Robert we understand that\nPeople are busy\nI Know some of my really good friends part of the reason I'm good friends with them is they never listen to me they really don't know a ... there are so busy in their career\nWhere they really don't know them a new show what's going on like a lot of our audience does because you're really into whether you're passionate about it for many of you as a hobby which is I think it's a great hobby to have a\nBut the fact is they're not out there promoting and opinion that's to me the problem the confidence or the arrogance or or\nYou have a particular narrative in your head of what's right so you pick up bits and pieces\nAnd you proclaim that you have absolute authority on a particular topic when after five seconds anybody in the know will tell you you don't know what you're talking about right and that's it's the air is not having the lack of knowledge on a particular area\nThere's too many things for people to know there's things on on topics that I have no clue was\nAnd I'm not going to try to be us my way through it\nI'm not going to go into the mechanic today at one time I was able to tear apart an engine and put it back together again I couldn't even attempt that today and if I went in and started pointing out tubes and started saying well this does that and that does this and this does that a modern day mechanic would look at me and say\nDo you what's going on and\nThat's the problem that I see people that are so confident or maybe it's arrogant to believe that they know exactly what's going on and after five seconds anybody that with any critical thinking skills will say I don't have a clue well where does that come from\nThere's it's it's the citizen has greatly empowered by enact a or acting on\nInformation\nThere's great risk to this country by people acting on the lack of information that's the difference uh being ignored for whatever reason\nWhether you just choose not to\nFollow the news or you're too busy or whatever it is is one thing acting\nRegardless of how ignorant ignorant you are on the topic\nIs the difference in today's world\nIt's not just issuing an opinion anymore on social media remember we saw last friday\nIs why we're still talking about cabinet of\nIt is to get in your face or what they call the direct approach\nAnd the media is helping\nThe media is NBC and all of them are helping spread the lives\nJust by giving them a forum\n[noise] you're you're there's two problems so there are people that are ignorant and willfully ignorant and wanting to form opinions based on their ignorance and then there's those in the media that understand the ignorance and understand if we lie to them and as we've said before and we talked about this last week lined by omission\nOr newspaper articles will say we didn't lie it there's not an untruth in here yeah but you left this out and you're left that out threat which gives a completely different slant to the story and leads people in a different direction from the truth that is a lie that's lined by omission right\nAnd they understand as we said Jonathan Gruber set it\nWe can lie to these people I'm sure\nWe can lie to the stupid American public\nWill remember buzzfeed politic claim or a disclaimer on that story they knew they couldn't verify we have no way to verify any of this we're ... we're going with it anyway that's essentially what NBC did yesterday with the the third accuser as she's being called\nThey gave her an interview when they admit it as a news organization they could not corroborate any of that and as her own story was falling apart yes\nAnd she backed out of her own story\nAnd then NBC nightly news decides not to run an an actual official part of the proceeding and that is the woman who was brought in\nThe prosecutor was brought in to do the questioning issued a member\nNBC ignores what's real\nOn display in front of all of America or the few people still watching\nSomething that is that they themselves say we're not able to corroborate any of this the New York times interviewed dozens of individual individual people and could not\nFind anyone with first hand knowledge of her claim and she's now walking back her own claim\nAh we don't tend to go to a call but Mike in Indiana wanted to say that Feinstein ... she wants a presumption of innocence
