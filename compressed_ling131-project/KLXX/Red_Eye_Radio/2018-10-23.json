among early Republican voters that can put a dent in democratic hopes for a blue wave in next month's midterm election remember I'm reading verbatim from the NBC story\nA Republican or Republican typically dominate a early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to tell you the advantage\nWith him in person early voting for example the entire early voting picture and Florida which has yet to be gone in person voting is incomplete [noise]\nAh in Arizona where two members of the house democratic ah cursed in [noise]\nAh [noise]\nSo cinema and Republican Martha Mick Sally ... our neck in neck and the contest to fill the retire Republican Jeff Flake\nA Senate seat forty four percent of early voters had a Republican affiliation compared to thirty three percent of the Democratic affiliation right twenty three percent of early voters were not affiliated with either major party\nAnd the ... a group as other in the NBC News soon or a partisan analytics in Florida where a democratic Bill Nelson who's running\nFor reelection in a tight race against Republican governor Rick Scott\nForty four percent\nOf the early voters had a Republican affiliation versus thirty eight percent of the Democratic affiliation and Eighteen percent or not affiliated with either party in Indiana where a democratic US Senator Joe Donnelly is facing reelection challenge from Mike Braun\nEarly voters had a Republican affiliation compared with thirty nine percent who had a democratic affiliation and ten percent who are not affiliated with either party you know that's something to be looking at not just the\nNot just the voter enthusiasm of Republicans and Democrats which by the way is extremely important mhm because if you have more enthusiasm of Republicans in her mid term election like that that's almost unheard\nOf well especially when you talk about first day of early voting one one reason they like take a look at that as it because people are essentially chomping at the bet to to vote to to get there say\nAnd who was at which group is that that is more motivated to get their first that can tell you something\nAbout the the point I was trying to bring is not not the Democrat or Republican but if you have if you know if ten percent or in the one case was at a in Florida eight Eighteen percent not affiliated were independence going right now where the polls on were independence lie right now\nOur independence being affected by what has gone on now independence for the most part did not like what was going on in the cabinet hearings [noise]\nWhich may be a huge uh you know a driver to the poll of independence but we're independence going in this election [noise]\nI haven't seen a lot of you know election polling analytics on independence we've heard a lot about the enthusiasm of Republicans and Democrats but of course that's key because independence and most elections decide you know where the country is going mhm [noise] and I just haven't seen much\nI'll I'll do some more research on it now yeah I'm going to do more research see what's out there on on independence but it just popped into my head right now we spend so much time talking about were Democrats are Republicans are\nAre not realizing that a significant portion the the determining factor of votes in most states is still you know the where the independents line [noise]\nYeah you you get to the break down to the polls that we do have available to us and that number of I guess ah not independence but\nUndecided voters starts to become much much smaller and that's where that's why we're you know for me I'm anxious to look at some some of the latest polls because [laughter] you go back to uh the Montana race or any of the other Senate races and if you've got numbers that are that are pre cabinet\nThat that's something very different though I mean it's it's something that because people will make this this inevitably happens the closer you get the more the the fewer undecided you have\nIn any given race and it's crucial just I think that's it's the job of the pollsters to to show those numbers as close to an election days you can but\nYou know again a and they haven't been as active as they were in years past and you and I've been following that you know for a while maybe that's going to change in the in you know later this week well\nWe know for example that the internal polling that was being done roughly two to three weeks out of back in in twenty sixteen\nThe Hillary people knew they were in trouble in the internal polling you didn't hear a lot of talk about that at all in in the general public but after the election post election that's what you started hearing that they saw the you know that that's when they started seen in some of those districts in those states you know when we're talking about Pennsylvania\nAnd and and Michigan in Wisconsin that's where they saw some of the change at that point ... and they said ... and you know they saw that swing at that point and in most elections as we see what you see in July is not necessarily what you see the last three weeks\nBecause they're doing the polling consistently\nYou have the political parties that have an idea they see where the momentum is going at this particular point 'cause we are just two weeks out now so for the last week especially if you went inside most political parties and say we're what does your polling showing\nYou're going to have one or another say okay the momentum is moving our way or isn't moving our way mhm we just don't have access to those particular polls at the moment [noise]\nYou know well we know afterwards yeah because the the ... the analyze you know what happened in a you know particular you know political election you know we'll we'll be analyzed after the election but it's what's happening right now and the internal polls are probably showing that\nBut when we look at so many of the polls out there so that that haven't been taken in two three four weeks some even more than four weeks out\nWhat was going on in September is not the mindset of the voter of a significant portion of the voter right now\nRight yeah I mean it it's it's I think um it it will be interesting to see what the rest of the early voting in a turnout is like and and where those numbers comeback but but ultimately you have to get down to those polls in each of those individual races and I just suspect we're not\nGoing to see you know a a [noise] I guess an\nOnslaught of those polls leading up to that are leading up to election day or two weeks from today by the way so um but the early voting on Texas and Florida are you\nKnow will be interesting I think to watch but then you go to those tighter races I'm In Texas it's it's a war\nThan and cruise cruise the latest polls has been ahead by at least in the latest two balls or by seven points or so and they are CPS average he's ... up by seven and he said over fifty percent and and each of those last two popes so\nYou know that's not one that I Would call at this moment two weeks out assuming those numbers are still in that goes back a little over a week ago assuming those numbers still hold that's not one that I Would call a\nYou know neck and neck or or up in the air and undecided right now I'm you know too close to call if you will I think it's right now that momentum is with Ted Cruz\nAnd if you look at it if if the last poll for the ah was ... I don't have it here in front of me the last poll for or work and Cruz was a week ago a yeah it was a little over a week ago I guess my point would be that doesn't even include the last debate\nDoes yeah yeah that's and and that's my point is that is what I was I was asking you at the top of the hour or the or the crucial meeting\nI said you know because I Would I Would think that you would have won and maybe maybe we'll see one ah later today or or Wednesday that covers the debate maybe they were waiting and and going through Monday to to have people digest that debate and\nAh you know I don't know I really don't know but I I expect we'll see some more polls but they probably won't be as numerous\nAs what we're seeing in\nThe last month or two we have a line open if you'd like to get in eight six six Ninety right I\nWas ... radio or\nJoin the conversation using the shell row tell a hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine radio and shoveled tele making your hardworking journeys more manageable\nAt the desk ... we have hundreds of flatbed specialize million mile drivers blight because if you like driving for a little little trucking company with national power than we have a long term home for you to ask you as a family\nWhy because if you like driving for a little little trucking company with national power than we have a long term home for you dance ski as a family of sixty locally run sleds bed and specialized companies in communities all across the u._s._a. and care\nWhere you can put down your roots you on short haul or long haul want to drive our late model drunk or your own trying to you like to drive zone over as a team\nAbout the challenge of specialized loads than the desk\nThe family of companies is your million mile ... along with consisted miles great pay and talk to your benefits sounds like what you're looking for and go to Dr ... dot com and learn more about our family of trucking companies\nThree nine o nine five to eight by calling your addiction team you're taking the first steps to recovery their advisors are ready to take your call right now your future is still a bright place the help you need could be one phone call the weigh eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight\nThree hundred dollar ...

we'll get to in a moment but ah as as you know the uh uh how Hollywood celebrities and I love going crazy the New York times story the other day that the Trump Administration may eliminate\nGender ... officially returned illegally identifying individuals as biological males or females ... and of course have gone nuts and the Babylon be which is like the onion a parity website\nParody news website where are the greatest\nHad this could actually be a real headline in the leftist me really good anti science Trump Administration to revert to definition of gender to an objective scientific standard\nThe anti science anti facts Trump Administration is considering reverting the definition of gender to a biological objective and scientific standard drawing the anger of the pro science left\n[noise] [laughter]\nThe party of science [noise] they even have their own best science guy too [noise]\nYeah I just I just I we I was going to be muster up yesterday just didn't have time and I was just thinking what we were talking about\nYou know how the the expanding victim and oppressor base of the Democratic party right now we're talk we're using the example of the transgender movement against feminist mhm where feminists now is and we have set feminism is dead if any man can be a woman whenever they wish to be a woman for sure I mean\nIf you look at the ... in fact the uh the civil rights are at this is gone if anyone anyone simply by claiming simply by claiming can belong to any protected group there are no protected groups\nRight and we saw this with a whole host of the war in\nBut the but the thing is is that um the the [noise] it was it was\nPart of the whole well there's too much money in politics\nOr oh who's the guy that was on um\n[noise] he used to be on CNBC then he went over to MSNBC or Dylan Ratigan [noise] you know that was his ... and he you know had had the fake anger thing going on but we said look great system [noise]\nI work at ... you don't want a break it down to two words a Casio Cortez [noise]\nShe spent [noise] next to nothing compared to her opponent [noise] Hillary want Hillary didn't win right [noise]\nUh but I Know but nobody in a life really has complained about money in politics right civilized Hillary's it was funny 'cause some I saw that on social media somebody said fellow Trump won because of the money in that said ah no Hillary raised more money in the ... they just shut up they were quiet life right hoops\nA look at look at uh look Democrats don't complain about money and politics them if they're raising the money you see that in the exact nobody's complaining about not I\nHave not heard one Democrat come out and say it's just wrong in that Robert Francis O'Rourke is raising unprecedented money pursue it\nRight now in fact it's quite the opposite they're they're promoting the idea you have sons is a good thing\nSo when that started coming out and that was McCain's or you know that was McCain fined gold and and that's when the rules and regulations came out his two groups of people that\nCouldn't that couldn't run advertising or you know within most it's sixty days of of an election I Believe ... six it is within an election because it might influence\nFor ... ah you know within ... sixty days of a of an election I Believe ... sixty this within an election\nBecause it might influence an election right well that's the only reason you're running ads is to influence an election and the reason you run ads close to an election is to influence an election and at that point we just said do these people understand\nHow the country was formed do they understand about the petition of government for redress of grievances irrespective of who that group is do they actually understand that and clearly they didn't want to understand it so we said this spat going back ten Fifteen when you when I started working together\nSo going back Thirteen an hour or maybe almost Thirteen and a half years ago right when you and I got together and I know we were saying that beforehand ... but it's like we said we don't believe in the first amendment you don't believe in the second amendment and so that's grown and grown and grown and grown and grown and since that time we have said look if you don't believe\nIn these major attendance at the constitution of the United states you actually don't believe in the United states right and now we're to the point here where they don't believe in the Senate they don't believe in the the well the who was it came out said that the presidency was adequate\nYeah that was a few weeks ago and that was Michael Moore was Michael Moore so it was somebody in that same it was the same time well no it was at the same time when he said it's over that the ... century essentially to the office of the president of the United states you know it's over this is you know it's it's now gone it's\nAnd then someone in that same period said we we need to do away with the presidency\nAltogether right and so that we've heard the electoral college just to go now it's the Senate that has to go right that's being picked up by more on the left every single day if you go to social media oh it's just not fair of a sudden it needs to go\nSenate needs to go to and as we've said that is extremely important because if you do understand the constitution which unfortunately\nThe majority of America does not [noise]\nHave you seen the polls a majority of Americans can't tell you what the three branches of government are they can't tell you what the rights are in the first amendment to the constitution they don't know they a lot of them don't care\nBut the majority of Americans don't know according to the polls and when it comes to the ... you know the separation of powers the three branches of government that's the vast majority of Americans\nCan't tell you that well then you don't even know how our country works which I then we have stated we understand why people say the country isn't exceptional you don't even know what makes us exceptional right or if you believe that the Senate should be gone if you believe that the electro college should be gone you don't understand the basis of what this how this country was formed\nThat it wasn't that that it wasn't on a pure democracy it was on a representative government we're the minority would be protected were individual rights would be protected something that the left used to understand and promote\nAnd now they don't care as long as it's as long as it's they they don't care to protect the minority as long as it's the minority that they don't care about [laughter]\nOr they don't care about individual rights as long as it's individual rights of people they don't care about right and but when you get down to it it's a clear under a not understanding of how the country was form so\nWe have said that that's a huge issue for many conservatives because they do understand the constitution and they understand everything that we just talked about right now and that has energized them to go out and vote so beyond just because\nThe Democrats were against a nominee that Trump picked because Kevin all went way beyond Trump's that's why you had the conservatives or never Trump hers come ... most of them [laughter] not all most of them uh uh come aboard at that time and that's why we've seen I I Believe a more United\nA Republican or Republican Party so you can look at that you can look at something that may be driven by the fact that look we're concerned about the house because the whole rash\nA Republican or Republican Party so you can look at that you can look at some of that may be driven by the fact that look we're concerned about the house because the whole Russia investigation goes away if we lose the house ... are also when it comes to judges the fact that if they win the Senate\nOr ... and Trump has another chance to get another judge in maybe in the next couple of years and that would be unprecedented because conservatives understand that if you can have a construction is cord and you can have\nOf not only a five to four but six to three ... that that could move the country in the right direction for the next generation and that is extremely important and the other thing is and this is new and it's the caravan\nSure and it's it's interesting too is that you you mentioned it earlier but it bears repeating here they even if the care of and then it likely won't reach the border before an election day two weeks from today that the news cycle is what's keeping that story there and and\nWe've talked often about how the news cycle you know changes so not drastically but so often\nUm and the because the protests by the left is one thing even even during the Kavanaugh a confirmation process itself what was the first protest\nAll those documents remember we need to be able to agree we need time view that that was their first protest well then it became about Dr for\nWhat we said after he's confirmed whatever happens and you know we didn't make it a a production but if he's confirmed on on Saturday through the vote this was before the confirmation vote then on Monday it they'll move on to something else as they did\nBecause it it but there is there is at the point being there is a new protest and new hot button or almost daily but certainly a couple of new ones every week so we got two weeks left so you got the care of and that's that right now is new but that goes back\n... if you ... I guess this adds onto a consistent issue that's been around for a long time but the Republicans thanks to this current president when he was campaigning for president\nOh and\nIf you think about it you know everybody talking about the conspiracy theory and who's paying for it and who's not paying for it\nIt is working for the right it is a motivator for people on the right to get out and protect 'cause it if he needs money for the wall\nHe needs the house the president if he's going to get money for the wall he's going to need the house right\nAnd and so to me this has been a huge motivating factor and\nI saw the other day that after uh the the illegal immigrant caravan them which is to get in the United states from Honduras that they walked about nine hours right well at that and and blisters and they were going to rest her while mhm well at this pace they won't get to the United states for a month\nRight so ah you know if that was the pace that they are are are going at as to you know who was supporting them you've got you know a right wing website stating far right wing\nWebsite stating that it's you know ... groups you of the wall Street Journal said in you know basically they're not sure they talk about the leftist politician and Honduras that organized system started it and then they were surprised how quickly or the number of people got aboard they talk about the people without frontiers\nThe U.S Mexico a group that isn't got involved in it who directly is giving the money nobody is really sure here at this\nUh particular moment yeah a lot of these groups have funding in the past\nFrom folks on the left including ... whether they have directly given the money or not who knows right but the fact is if they are right now it's working against them will have some audio coming up here just a little bit actually from the view right right which was a really good from a from Meghan McCain talking about it all coming up plus your calls in comments eight six six\nThere's just a little bit actually from the view right right which was a really good from a from Meghan McCain talking about it all coming up plus your calls in comments eight six six Ninety right I\nWas born ... radio with a record ...

Republican allies were casting they care about uh of thousands of migrants heading towards the U.S Mexico border as a failure of Democrats\nTo help an act immigration policy in the GOP controlled Congress dumped some Democrats said Trump is vulnerable to counterattack on his court campaign issues\nGiven that his policies failed to reduce the number of unauthorized immigrants yet party leaders and democratic candidates have been largely silent ahead of the midterms and refusing to engage with Trump\nOn this particular issue that's why we said this is a loser from the start where people were saying you know what their hope is a you know before the election day\nTheir issue that's why we said this is a loser from the start where people were saying you know what their hope is a you know before or election day that these thousands will be at the border and then the military will be there and there will be violence it will be going on and it will hurt the Trump and it will hurt the Republicans\nOh that's not going to happen you know you and I were discussing before and we said well maybe\nMaybe it's Charles will pick up a bunch of people in his private jet and drop a hundred our energy [laughter] you know in order to ... and people are claiming well that's going to be the next thing there to live in in cars whatever\nLook the problem is if you have ten thousand that arrived at the exact same time as good a if it's a couple of hundred that's going to be that won't even be news no well I mean because they're not going to be there won't be violence it'll be simply there'll be taken are gonna be violence or simply the border patrol can handle that kind of thing right and if National Guard or needed out there or something like that but\nIt's if the ten thousand all

the pills or whatever let's what can I Do what do you recommend a I I don't know that I Would go into that for me I Would want medical experience first if I'm going to turn to somebody you know\nYou know for for me it's really interesting and and I've been blessed that I really never had major sleep problems at all ... and and I feel blessed because of it but I Know as as I was telling you what are the yesterday the last week\nI still can't get on a regular schedule where you sleep you know really one time of day who's the de ship to so tough now I'm back on this ship sleeping twice a day 'cause that's what I did when I came on this shit and I you remember I just said I'm going to you know I I couldn't\nI was trying to figure out okay what time can I sleep all I Can't do that with my body my body tells you when it's time to sleep yeah and and I'm Glad that I can pick up on what my body tells me that because it's twice a day I go home and I go to sleep and and and then I sleep again at about five to six o'clock when my body gets tired\nAnd you know I mean you know what a disciplinarian I Am at that and people that know me in a bill me my whole life said you really became disciplined I mean you have to sleep during those times and I said if I don't it throws up my tier mind my mind is gone if I don't\nIf I don't do it but because I'm a because I'm On that schedule\nRarely do I ever have to you know take even anything over the counter ...\nAnymore I I was for a little while they're taking the melatonin maybe once in a while and sometimes on weekends I may have to take a little bit of it because my I changed my my sleep pattern but that's even rare now I'd ... decided no just sleep and if you wake up in the middle and I get up you know do some stuff\nFor an hour and I go back to sleep and it was my ... my my dentist my ah who's a is asleep therapist who who uh said when I told him I scheduled 'cause he was always concerned as my dentist\nUh who's a is asleep therapist who who uh said when I told them I scheduled 'cause he was always concerned as my dentist is there is also went to sleep therapy\nAnd I told him I scheduling what oh she's asleep twice a day goes when that's how the basically the caveman used to do it came I used to go to sleep like seven o'clock there is no TV they went to sleep seven eight o'clock\nThey woke up and midnight one o'clock and set up for a couple of hours and back to sleep again that's how human beings used to do it and he said so you're basically into it and he said do you find many problems and I haven't had any problems no type of medical problems but to me the only thing that really insurers\nAre that I I mean it it's almost that I Do have to I Do have to work out almost every day working out does make a difference for me it's tiring out my body does make a difference doing physical activity\nI'm having trouble getting to sleep I have trouble finding the time I mean my my life is so busy it literally is a around the clock you know huge family or other business aside from you know this ah and and then of course a lot of the stuff pertaining to to this\nYeah but it is but I've known your long enough you can operate without sleep I can yeah yeah well I I'm In my mind in\nPoint I was up to a um a Sunday Morning and\nUh up until a almost one PM\nOn Monday a afternoon that's when I went to bed Monday afternoon\nI got up at six thirty and then went back to bed for another Ninety minutes\nAs I can I can I've known your long enough to know that you can operate with sleep your brain still works my brain does not work them the same at all if I if if I don't sleep crack you know it is so tough for me to to to do that so I guess as\nWell and for the call yesterday for the same thing while I mean my allergy well yeah and and for me it's the same thing it is also too about the exercise and diet and everything else because had I during that time I mean you know where the where the big a family wedding on Sunday and I was I mean I was there until I was the last one house at night falls closing up\nA venue and and uh and and clearing everything out a loading out a but\nHad I had a well a piece of wedding that's that sugar [laughter] you know what I mean cause you and and you have to know that I mean everybody was looking at me strangely although I did it take some home and I had some Monday morning you know when I when when it was time and I knew\nThat wouldn't be that wouldn't cause me any any problems but you you have to do that and it also has to include like for me to the difference with people I Know people that can like drink coffee you know full strength coffee and have no issues um it's you know comedians and cars getting coffee\nIt's amazing to see Jerry Seinfeld loves coffee\nAnd he talks about him he's they drink\nYou know it looks like he's drinking at least two or three cups\nIf I had two or three cups of coffee in the day well then that would be no I I just couldn't I couldn't do that I can drink a total of maybe one and I'm good but\nThe I have to know the the point being is I have to know that I've got to keep exercising I die it's got to be right especially during those times when I'm not going to get that sleep\nI'm going to have to really mind my piece in Houston and lots of water or\nThe insomnia thing I've I've been there\nUm and and maybe it's because I'm aging I it's not about insomnia for me it's about schedule a typically lately it has not been this this past weekend was a total anomaly but typically it has been here lately you know get into bed a and getting a good seven hours of sleep\nBut typically it has been here lately you know getting to bed a and getting a good seven hours of sleep on the average um and I I Do notice the difference of ... it does it is you are a especially physically you're you're better\nYou or\nMentally your your better I mean this has been a big issue for truck drivers for a long time because there's ours a service that regulate other drivers and and a lot of changes to those hours of service going back to well gosh going back to the Fifteen Years\nAnd and I'm like that I couldn't do it why couldn't do it it's a airline pilots and and you know they all go through they ... they all have their their hours of service you know based on operating you know the the aircraft are operating the big rig\nAnd I for me I don't know how someone could sleep in a you know in the cab of a truck for me I ... and I I think I guess eventually I'd get used to it but\nBecause you gotta you gotta create that sleep environment right a or a people tell me though the same thing I don't know how you sleep during the day I don't know how you sleep all night um or or stay up all night and sleep during the day but for twenty two years now I've been I've been doing that and it's it's perfectly normal\nI don't see how people work on the rotating shifts

... I don't know I don't know how we did that you can't get a routine down now you got to have your routine and that's the whole thing you've got to have your routine\nOr whatever that is uh that worked for you whatever works to get that sleep you've got to stick to that and that has to be disciplined and you know it's a that would\n... I I don't know if they still do that is in law enforcement and out but to me that ... that are well that would be an an alert is concerned yeah are you alert when you're out there well I guess you've got to change sleep just like yeah I that would be a\nTotal concerned yeah I have a friend who's been a prison guard for a long long time and that's that's kind of what they do they it's called that's called shift work right where you're changing you know that that your routine\nAll the time my dad did that he was talking to me about recent he said I I still don't know how you do this and I said well that is easier than what you described a back into your military days he would do that when he was a military police officer in the air force they would do shift work especially in the early days\nOr when he Rosen rank that you know changed he didn't have to do that but uh you know for the longest time they did the same thing and uh as an MP and he said that was just for me he said that was just difficult it was impossible because you don't have a routine\nYou know they can't do is on Sundays when I go back to my regular sleep shift yeah I get up at like\nFive in the morning yeah I have to change it a little bit I pick it up so I'm tired by the time Sunday night comes around and go to sleep ...\nOne thing I Can't do in Sunday's Evers lift weights I lift weight in the Sunday I cannot my muscles are too much stimulation to yeah just on it that's the one thing I Can't do any other day I could do it during the week it doesn't bother me on Sundays and do it right eight six six Ninety ...\nWas gilly my camera and regardless of what a radio [noise]\nJoin the conversation using the shell row tell a hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine radio and shell motel on making your hardworking journeys more manageable\nAt the desk ... we have hundreds of flatbed specialize million mile drivers light because if you like driving for a little little trucking company with national power than we have a long term home for you to ask you as a family of sixteen locally run flatbed and specialized companies in communities all across the u._s.\nPut down your roots you on short haul or long haul [noise] want to drive our late model drunk or your own trying to do you like to drive zone over as a team\nAbout the challenge of specialized loads than their desk a family of companies is your million miles\nDavis along with ... ... miles great pay and come to your benefits sounds like what you're looking for it and go to Dr ... and learn more about our family of trucking companies find do flatbed be specialized opportunity to\nBe fit your needs at ... dot com that's dry V.

Booker yet well\nThey're they're trying to buy vote that's what it amounts to well yeah but I give it away at giving away the whole everything mhm they can buy their ... ... well if they got married it could be president and first lady\nYeah yeah I ah I doubt that's going to happen but clearly the it's always about buying the boats\nYeah you want to give away something you promise something for free I mean back in the day Hugo Chavez in Venezuela\nIf you if you uh don't remember Venezuela was a a a socialist nation now they're they're just uh the remnants of a socialist nation but in Venezuela they would send checks out in the mail before election day [noise] you know yeah it's always about well\nBuying look oh I I think I think ... every every politician on boats on on both sides looks at people's self interest not to do it all depends what your self interested that's why I voted my self interest right I I vote for my self interest but what's my [laughter]\nWhich was my it it really didn't work out for me just laughed and why shouldn't we since we have to pay more under the Republican tax plan\nNo but what is my what is my bigger self interest\nMy mind bigger self interest and your bigger self interest is not what other people's self interest is my self interest is not getting free stuff no my self interest is freedom\nHanding the liberty of ... and in the ... of of our nation\nRight that that's my number that's my self interest is low so people vote for their self interest all the time for other people's self interest is give me free stuff mhm [noise]\nThat's not my first self interest because I Know that it's a bogus concept I Know that it doesn't work I Know that it doesn't solve the problems that they claim that they're trying to\nCure [noise]\nAnd so they're simply selling to people who believe and don't care what the future may bring look we live in a nation that doesn't care about the deficit or the debt either side now doesn't care about it [noise]\nIt's completely and totally irresponsible both Republicans and Democrats don't care about the deficit don't care about the debt they don't care they don't care what it does to a future generation\nSo for for both sides now [noise] keeping the status quo of what we have today is extremely important sure [noise]\nKeeping the status quo of what we get from the government [noise] I Can't tell you when the banks for getting bail out how many people called up and said there shouldn't be bailing out the banks who should be bailing out me right also government's role is to give you money well from somebody else\nAnd that's where this shift was from you know a lot of people in fact that that said that they were either conservator voted Republican and they were talking about saying it and it it it really was kind of this mentality that had been built through the media and also from\nCapitol Hill and at that time uh you know at the uh the the under the Bush presidency or that the world is coming to an end to remember a McCain and Obama had to come off of the campaign trails to rush to the White House to save the world [noise]\nYou know because the world is coming through with that [noise] ah but the that\nThat a a fear drove a lot of people after the bailout started happening\nTo say well listen you know that's going to happen then right I Want mine so it became is almost the looting effect right the government money looting right idea hey I wouldn't mind if they if they're thrown out money to throw it to me and I drove ain't right to throw it to me we were saying no throw it to no one\nRight way and and that's because when government gets involved in every aspect of your life they become a ... and everybody understands us when you take it out of the artist and talk and you're talking about should we be run by a monopoly right should our healthcare system be run by a monopoly\nDemocrats just to be scared to death of a monopoly why because they understand the monopoly has complete control right there for ten ten you know can do whatever they wish to do you know we live in a way we live in a a a a time\nAnd you know already got responds whenever we talk about health care well other countries spend less on health care\nNo they don't know not for the same services they don't know [noise]\nWe can't make that correlation you because you can't compare you can't you can't compare it if waiting times are double\nFor some procedures that's health care and ... exact finally held tears or if you talk to my my my cousin out of Ontario mhm back Twenty years ago when he desperately called because they didn't have the technology\nIn Canada and take care of his brain tumor right [noise]\nNot only if you're talking about the you know the people who might vote Democrat or or might be in the center are being independent and look at this idea and go well well well that could work or does it really effectively work with their particular situation\nAnd then on top of that or does that interest me is if I'm really thinking about a generation who is having fewer kids\n[noise] there's the book or plan even resonate with them [noise] kids I've I've you know what about me\nI'm not I don't I'm not worried about my children\nBecause I don't really plan on having a family I'm giving my children the debt well yeah [laughter] thing is I'm not going to have kids because it's too expensive even when you're fifty thousand dollar plan enough it's not enough\nSo I'm not a oh wait a minute but the thousand dollars doesn't help with raising my child now that's what I needed the aisles and dollars a year that exact and help with raising my child cutting out that's\nBecause the idea is that we have you know we have too many kids in these poor families that by the time they're Eighteen they're a disadvantage because they can't afford college or home and all of this all these items\nYou're not trying to get the future vote of those kids who haven't been born yet you're trying to get there but you know would be parents votes right now and they're thinking to themselves well no I've got a number of reasons why I don't want to have a family\n'cause I Can't afford it you're not giving me so it's never going to be All right so now I'm so Camilla Harris\nGets my vote because she's promised me six thousand dollars if she gets a lot and to have it with my kid exactly want ethics thousand now\nAnd or Bernie gives me or maybe Kamala Harris comes adds onto it and says free college for everybody and she gets my vote too because she's going to include existing college loans and of course free health care that Medicare ... to it yeah so the\nWhat you can get me now is ... my kids your civil thousand I Know I'm not having kids ... thousand Eighteen years from now no and and my kid gets it I don't get it you know I'd rather get the six thousand dollars now\nAll the ways that will give me both will know give me the six to ... don't get me six thousand dollars give me Fifteen thousand dollars to raise my kids now right instead of the fifty thousand dollars at my kid could use down the road right now I Want it now give me an now gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that then\nYou're not trying to get the vote of the the baby that's yet to be born you're trying to get the adult vote they don't care about the future\nThey care about now see they're not thinking we're ... we're trying to tell them Gary we can do the strategy for I don't know a couple of million apiece they're just not thinking you're either not going big enough or you're not going direct enough [noise]\nLet's go to William in Virginia William welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show high [noise]\nHey great show as thanks I Will say I was thinking about out when you take out their cash that bombed out so\nThat's our attacks will be so high that that you'll end up getting only twenty five percent of that\nNow and then we'll be right but

everybody eight years from now yes everybody eight years from now will be taxed on it right and therefore nobody's going to be against it because it's a year from now so eight years old only be upset eight\nYears later when we actually types that money that yes exactly yeah yeah thank you uh well we appreciate the call it but but\nAgain you have to go direct you have to go with who directly to the account of\nThe the person you want a the vote for him so it's got to be free college for them it's got to be a free money free you know a Medicare for all all of it for them to you and it has to be now you know you can't waste any time\nSince ... remember when they when they when they were talking about the reports of Obamacare kicking in or when they signed it rather they signed it into law and of course the rollout didn't happen what right away but\nYou had people calling and making appointments [laughter] I Know [laughter] where's your insurance will I have a ... ... ... no no\nNo that's still a few years away you know what do you mean I Want to know there's doesn't do me any good if you're on the other\nThe other thing you know about Harris winds and to want to join a writer and she

guy\nBut here's the thing you get Kamala Harris she promises this then what happens inevitably right she gets a good let's say she got elected based on those master promises\nWell two years in her first midterm all of a sudden there's that shift in power let's say the Democrats won the house and Senate and twenty twenty as well or they didn't get it they don't get it done in the first two years and there's a shift in power well she doesn't get it thought\nLet's say she does get it done and the first two years\nWell then there's the rollout it's not going to happen right away now you've made people angry and\nHere's the [laughter] the only thing you're going to have an angry mob these social isn't doesn't work it doesn't get me and my ... well no because she's too much of a conservative

[noise]\nSo [noise] they're [noise] it's it's different you can have a conservatives say well never Trump and maybe maybe I you know think about it and twenty twenty in terms of uh you know we'll look and see what what happens in twenty twenty ride I didn't vote for him and twenty sixteen\nI stayed home or whatever\nBut in terms of the mid term\nWhile yes it's supporting Trump there were there a couple of things at least Trump will do this on ... so I've got to get out I've got to vote I've got to be motivated to get out there and allow him to be able to possibly seat another constructions\nBut it's exactly what you said to it is they're they're you were going to have to build that [laughter] Republican wall around the constitution and around the process that is in place that preserves the constitution\nAnd and I think that's really a strong it at a ... a strong addition\nTo uh the Trump momentum ... to have conservatives who are any uh logically driven who do know the constitution and do know and are extremely fearful of what came out of Democrats\nDuring the cabinet nomination which to them early has nothing to do with Trump but it is all United in that same ideology and I liked what you call it the republic because you'd call it that a couple of times the Republican wall meanwhile we played a couple of of audio cuts from from President a former President Obama for reasons mhm\nAnd that was I'm Still looking for what was the major issue\nBecause look if you look at cabinet what came out of cabinet and and I I specifically go back to a conversation that I had at my at my family reunion I and this was a a gentleman who I talked to a relative by marriage ... okay is a professor at an extremely liberal college\nAnd from what I had known him as for the longest time because of other friends who know him a very very big liberal right very big liberal we had the most amazing conversation in July most amazing conversation went on for over an hour [noise]\nAnd you know very quiet conversation just you know what do you think whatever [noise] and he just told me she said you don't have liberal I Am I said well I've heard that we never had a long discussion because I'm pretty liberal he goes\nThe campuses are insane 'cause they're not liberal and I'm a liberal those maybe I'm an old 'cause I never thought I'd think of myself as an old time liberal and what I found out is he's ... he's a lot like for example at ... ... you know he's an old traditional a liberal and he talked about Trump because look you know Trump's of stuff that goes but look\nA lot of stuff that Trump says actually because when he goes too far actually helps us a little bit so people make claim they really care about are offended but their nominees but\nThe fact is because my dad loved Donald Trump ... my dad died before Donald Trump run ran in a won the presidency but my dad would have voted for Donald Trump was Trump's not a racist and not what you know it's not a racist\nAnd and he said that goes but he goes our party because my party\nThey voted for Donald Trump was Trump's not a racist I don't know what it was not a racist\nAnd and he said that goes but he goes or party because my party is killing itself\nAnd I wonder if I had a conversation with him today after cabinet\nBecause Eric you don't want to you and I both know that the average Democrat I'm Talking about the work and the the working class Democrat who you know who lives in so many cities across the United states I Know who they are because I grew up with them my family\nPart of my family is from that working kind of a Democrat family I Know\nThey you know where Democrats came from in the north east you know we talked about Tim Russert ... you know in in ... when if you ever read any of his books I mean he came from a south buffalo Democrat Party but they're very conservative extremely conservative you know morally speaking and that's been passed down through generations\nYou'd think the average rank and file average working class Democrat\nRelated to the Democrats saying\nThat evidence doesn't matter that due process doesn't matter\nThat the presumption of innocence doesn't matter\nYou notice nobody's rallying around that anymore right now nobody's using that as a campaign thing\nNo Democrats going out right now screaming always believed her mhm if you if you voted dumber if you voted Republican in the Republicans going to vote for due process we cannot have due process we cannot have a presumption of innocence it may have been saying it two or three weeks ago\nOr not saying that now they can't sell it no they can't sell it to their own party so what are they selling\nTheir selling Trump fear and maybe a little bit of the increased premiums for for a a a ... as they call the Trump Karen I own a but is that actually going to have an effect right now no no I don't see that happening if it might have had more of an effect if the whole cabinet thing hadn't happened\nWell because health care costs have been going up forever they were going up during the Obama years I mean after they put the the even though Obamacare remember the first couple of years\nLook at the ... as we went through twenty sixteen the increase their it politically you can't get away with that anymore because it is it's going to go up people with ... with with an employer based health care [noise] no the costs are going up [noise]\nSo the only thing that resonates forget about saying well a Trump care is is ... raising premiums nobody cares about that it's about what are you going to give me if you're going to you know again appeal to somebody who's on the left Rob not everyone but but then the people\nBut you know something the the free stuff and we talked about that earlier with Cory bookers you know the new new program then maybe bonds and Camilla Harris over the weekend but that's more of a president show that that's more for twenty twenty and that's not really you can as an individual Congress when you're there not walk and I'm going I'm going to give you all free stuff\nThat's why Schumer is not making any noise when he announced the days after the or just a few days after the uh cabin on confirmation you know we're going to focus on health care well because nobody cares when it comes to the mid term yeah [noise] you know so what do you do\nThey they may when you're talking about an individual which is the presidential candidate it may be the focus is going to be there but there's just too many races to be focusing in on right yep [noise] because as we have a fascinating too as well I\nJust say this is a fascinating you set it earlier is could this be one of those unique midterms in terms of you know the numbers of low you know the average turnout or what demographics or what motivates anyone remember twenty six team was unique very unique\nAnd we've changed as a nation since ...\nRemember twenty six theme was unique very unique\nAnd we've changed as a nation since twenty sixteen there are many things that have changed the left has ramped up their rhetoric and and the craziest over the top [noise]\nNo telling what the ... when we get past the midterm two weeks from today when we look back on what we're going to say eight six six Ninety ...\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been
