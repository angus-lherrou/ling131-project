Ford or to the FBI have hurt therapy notes from two thousand and twelve and\nNo no no no she didn't know she did she was just telling you well she did and I mean not all of that is what she did not want in fact she was holding back the notes from that there is from the FBI\nNo no she was holding them back to the Senate not from\nThe from the Senate yes at the same thing there's no difference\nNo no there there's a big difference in other words within it it just said it's part of the FBI it's a separate branch what are you talking about\nWell no you can give it to the Democrats then you give it to the Democrats and then they and they present it and the people get to see it the FBI were well what'd you forget about is the FBI is not investigating anything on the ground with them I wasn't a criminal matter it was a background check they\nIn fact what the FBI would do with it would be put it into the three oh two right which then the Democrats and the Republicans would both have\nThat's how that works right that's the only role of the FBI in this entire equation\nIs to give the Senate the information\nYou're making it sound like the FBI but then do an investigation on it no it would end up in the partisan body anyway\nThat's in fact the only purpose the FBI serves in this scenario\nIs to deliver that information to the White House in the Senate\nIf I mean she would officially be get putting it into the three oh two had she'd done that during the process and the way I agreed to take it out the way they they tried to put it in the process would chairman Grassley twice his call for it\nAnd ah it's a Feinstein of Feinstein would have gone right to the FBI at that point they could have done it that way she could have given it to the absolute into go that way no\nSo it's a useful conversation\nAnd and anyone and if if that that would if foreigners if that's accurate the report that they tried to do that a and Ford's assuming Ford's lawyers are telling the truth again they're trying to circumvent the system so the information will get out but won't be in the three oh two\nAfter because of the background check the supplemental is over\nFor cover electronics here's

plains so\nYou can look to use the wipers for a good portion of the day today on sections vi eighty in Illinois and Iowa and from I thirty five\nDoes not support Dr Ford's allegation and quite the way you will have claimed ooh that's a challenge is not right I urge you once again now for the third time in writing\nTo turn over the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications with the ah with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence in addition to the evidence I requested\nIn my Tobar second letter in light of recently uncovered information this is interesting here 'cause that was the key of\nLook at the uh the last sentence with recently uncovered information please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect\nContact with senators or their staffs particularly the offices of senators Feinstein in her role into other than a your communications with me and my staff member\nMy step in preparation for the September twenty seventh hearing the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge and Patrick Smith and a W were mirrors Julie sweat Nick or their representatives sincerely Chuck Grassley that letter sent yesterday\nSo it was like I said the last Colorado as she was willing to turn them over to the FBI\nAnd our and our point was ... when I'm when I said no it's like because\nOur point is to go directly to the Senate to begin with\nYeah there is no investigation they wouldn't be in bed they simply\nTake it and give it to the Senate Judiciary committee kind of ended up in the report we wouldn't see it that the the only senators were set the only the centers would see it and there for a goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence mhm and she wants to the people who said she wants to people to see it so then the people can decide\nGive it to a classic directly outside of the three oh two\nBecause then the other members of the committee including Dianne Feinstein would get it and immediately leak it\nExactly\nOr\nWe're just released the entire right to the to the Washington Post and let them printed completely sure\n'cause they're not political [laughter]\nOkay that's a relief well ... the Washington Post and the wall Street Journal no I'd be from you know from the west point of view and and that was the the point well no the senators or political\nThe FBI is not well neither is the Washington Post according to the liberals\nAre and that ... let me see that ah when was that sense here in front of you were okay 'cause that letter must have been late last night to Shannon Bream a pulse uh ten forty seven PM and then I'd seen the uh uh Mollie Hemingway the last paragraph sure as interesting\nAmong please let us know your please give to us you know what you have shared with Feinstein in her own oh\nWhoa mhm\nYeah because of uncovered evidence so what do they have\nWhat what is what is that what does that one about so again I'm we're getting into stupid area again\nWe're getting into areas you know with the lawyers stayed in they're going to do something that doesn't even make any sense\nYeah yeah and I ate a demand that doesn't even a ... a demand that would in a demand that would ensure\nIf you went through it that way that the nodes would never become public right you would never know what was in the ...\nThey would not because of the Senate rule see the light of day\nIf you want this public\nThere's plenty of ways to do them\nOr eight six six Ninety run out let's go to Sherman in Indonesia Sherman welcome you're on right on Radio Welcome to the show listening on line high\nThanks good afternoon from Indonesia I'm a longtime listener first time caller you know I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican\nAs you pointed out it is just sheer committees job to investigate cabin or and this whole situation\nAnd Dianne Feinstein struck the justice I don't know why everybody's just not totally up in arms about this maybe eventually they will be but to me that the wheel criminal it all over this\nBecause it by signing released it releases information back in July it would if they quietly handle and investigate it thoroughly\nIt would've maintain the anonymity of laws they forward it would have respected cabinets reputation and they would have gotten to the bottom of this and I had a cabin or would affect ... started nomination or in the later was at Fort would have been proved to be right\nOr not but I and Feinstein obstructed justice year and pull this last minute and she should be you know read out of town a rail for obstructing justice I mean it's a criminal acts\nWell if you look at it as a whom who betrayed the trust\nOf of Dr Ford\nIt was fine and it was ... it was the end it was the Democrats right now they're the ones that lead to to the media gave it if we're taking Dr foreign at her word ... then the only people that have been trained doctor Ford or the Democrats right\nExactly and that the biggest\nThing that's being there and it's it's a comedy of the ends justify the news is just over and over getting more and more rural and I just don't understand why every American would it be up in

connect on a few times a week on Facebook but we see each other on a regular basis and everything else we love each other we tease each other about the politics\nAnd there was no way that either of us none of us\nWould ever draw that line and say well you can't be my friend I Can't there's no way we can have the debate just like family\nBut not for the far left not for many\nOf us are let it wasn't

daughter's getting wedding he will be there\nYeah I I think that was it they jumped on that story a and it it I saw it on the hill a late in the day but I\nI thought to myself ... I'm ... I'm sure they're going to make this work while your daughter's in the wedding is certainly paramount uh I'm certain there was there was no way the Danes was going to miss that\nThe right now the Republican Party\nUm and I I really have to wonder about like you know if you look at at ah at lake in his comments about the report they seem to be I guess indicating that he still could be a yes vote I'm assuming a that's the case or columns as as well Manchin is on the fence\nAnd the latest we saw I think mentioned had what a nine point lead in his state\nUm it\nThat's different though when you broadened it out to the rest of Texas\nNow certainly he's done better than a lot of the people who jumped into different races\nOr the former ah Dallas County sheriff Lupe Lupe Valdez uh and uh you know her running against ah the the current Governor Greg Abbott\nUm that's you know again he's he's very well in the lead but well when you broaden it out to the state right level you gotta go wild you got to realize that you you have to pretend you're in the middle\nWell then and that's a bit of Russia's trying to do is try and do is try to picture himself and he's not in the middle on anything no but he he realizes that he has to lie even to get demos he can't be truthful even with Democrats in taxes\nAnd hope to get elected and yet the realization I mean the Democrats used to be that way all the time they used to\nWe need to move to the middle we need to move to the middle we got to move to the middle we've got to move to the middle\nAnd and then over the last ten years or so no they were basically this is who we are I guess my point is that\nWhen you think about\nTen years ago right now\nWhen you think of ten years ago mhm\nWhen Obama was running for president ... and ... wasn't it right about now right around this was in October remember he held it would've been no would've been the convention\nWhere your conviction ...\nWhen he was at the stadium the football stadium in in in Denver and they had like ... it looked like\nHe was a you know the the the entire stage it was set up when these elders mhm and everything else where he looked like some Greek forum yes yes\nMhm and ... and people going crazy and and remembering his first term Evan Thomas from\nNewsweek at the time he's God like yeah he's he's a ... you'd always post partisan he's God like heat hovers over the rest of us he's the smartest person in the world to now ten years later\nOne of the leading\nSocialist candidates in the country mhm I ride\nOn Obamacare and we don't I don't need all but yeah we're not all you know we don't need about that\nSo they don't have the Hollywood like about that that's that's a great point because here's the thing is that is deadly in inside the state it doesn't work\nEr work has no problem taking money\nAnd the liberals who have been pouring money into the state but well into his coffers in order to be Ted Cruz and an effort to be Ted Cruz um you know so you know he wants the liberals basically fill liberals to are you guys stay outside of Texas\nLook we've got our liberal places in in Texas now there are plenty of the districts that are blue and counties that are blue including the county we broadcast\nFrom yeah but but here's the point is though the point is not who he would have gotten in addition if he would have got ... Obama ... but the fact is he knew he could reject Obama publicly yet\nWith and the ... ideas into his core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing to do and you know no no that's that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too is that\nIt does nothing for them\nAnd it only irritates someone who might be in the middle and ...\nI mean it's it only works against that middle which might get you over it actually is the only thing that in this case especially that's going to get you over the top for the win but he knows by essentially denouncing and saying you know turning down the Obama endorsement\nIt does not hurt his base\nThey don't care right into a hopeless Obama's\nYesterday's news well listen I mean\nI'm liar Lanny Davis remembers he was going to be the hero you know so he was the here over the ... the point is is not that Lanny Davis is is a rock Obama but the point is is that there is a new hero for different reasons every day on the left\nAnd by the way that you're always going to be the demon tomorrow\nThat's the way it works\nBecause you could be someone who is a fellow victim of whatever right now\nBut tomorrow you're going to be the oppressor\nThis the person standing next to you will have a new reason to weigh victim and will need a new oppressor and it's going to be you here's here's but\nMy my uh again I could be wrong but here's my here's my got that liberal Democrats the ones that would vote for you know a beta or care in the state of Texas right [noise]\nLook at I Can't believe we're gonna use the word they look at Obama and say he was a poster\nHe really said he was going to do all this stuff and he didn't do a damn thing right he just sat up there any like being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes that we believed in that he went from God to like to pose or in ten years\nOr by the beginning of his his inauguration to the end\nOf his term as president of the United states that is how the modern day liberal looks at him\nThey look at him and they just say wow\nOkay I'll do eat him anymore he's not to think about this is all Obama is not the president like Kim 'cause you and I talked about is that you know by the by the time we got to the terms that Obama would be the leader we ... also predicted it but I thought there was a great chance that Obama\nBecause there was nobody else and Feinstein you know or or or pillows she's getting old and you know Schumer is to New York and so it would still be Obama that would be the leader for a while of the Democratic party he's not seen any more\nNow going back to the the tragic night here in Dallas\nIn July or twenty sixteen when five police officers were killed by Michael Johnson and the hours that led up to that horrific night it was just a few a couple of hours before it started I was online\nYou're on Facebook and one of the local TV stations was live Facebooking the protestors because it was a protest march\nAnd was peaceful up until that point of course but\nThey were talking to the leaders of the protest associated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protest the ones who were speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because they're broadcast the six PM broadcast news broadcasts was over so they went to like Facebook so I'm watching it [noise]\nThe thing I remember the most\nIs them saying what does Obama done for us to remember this was ... twenty six ten months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen waters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us nothing\nAnd I thought to myself\nYou know there because that was one of those\nUh cracks in the foundation if you will of the left although it had started happening before that for me\nBecause you had young\nAnd the two that were speaking were African American [noise]\nWhy does Obama done for us was Hillary done for us\nThe left or the Democrats that the Democratic party\nThinking they're going to get the when\nYou don't get the win just because they may agree with you at the moment\nThe protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single cause now it's multi directional right and it ... it it always will be that's why the party has no direct\nLines out that's what you get with identity politics yet because there is no there's no doubt that there is there is no general issue or gold ... goals that they actually want because when you split everybody yes when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party having a particular political goal this is probably the closest you'll get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh yes if the\nActivists are are going in multiple directions then then the party has led by them they're going you trying to us every direction and they have no direction at all except for abortion\nWrapping right now you're nights the

FBI provided to the Senate twelve detailed thrilled to reports summarizing their interviews with the witnesses as well as supporting materials cited by the witnesses during their interviews\nAmong those question where mark judge PJ Smith Leland Kaiser that three individuals Christine Ford claimed were president when Kavanaugh allegedly through or on the bed and sexually assaulted her some time

there\nWho you claim was terrible interviewed those people that had first hand you claim have first hand knowledge we're going with your claims you tell us right and they did\nFor either ... or or for it so interesting to know that that's what that is what it has come out in the summary well\nInteresting here is that it was likely going to happen anyway but you mentioned this uh believe it was yesterday on the program and and we were we were wondering in this process because of the rule the Senate rule that keeps the details\nIn those three oh two reports a secret\nCan be viewed only by a hundred people\nThe there is going to be inevitably there is going to be a a summary over\nYou'd only buy a hundred people\nThe there is going to be inevitably there is going to be a a summary overall

criticizing people on the left and I don't care about the ... right I care about the participants to make the country was what she wants to end it and now you you're an eight on\nMay ...\nSexual assaults as we've taken very seriously here Tucker and I think that we're all in the crowding out the voices of women and believing the men and not believing women in this case this woman came forward and we're not getting certain circumstances here we end up your the ace hailed him on your the ACLU\nYou don't believe in collective judgment or collective punishment and have a right to vote this reminds you believe 'cause I think I Know more about your organization or you have a lot of company ...\nBook it's an individual determination about this woman just hit or die and actually actually thinking back and reasonable mode so why would you say it's about women being heard when of course it's not in one wasn't making one allegation with one man hauls instances there haven't been other men who denied accusations and\nThat we've said all are saying is that in this instance like in previous since since women deserve an opportunity but at the Harvard hold on so we hear on the washing\nJudgment and collective jaw manager where do you do other women have nothing to do with that ... is on the merits of the issues against Kavanaugh has not been honest in fact I took her I Believe that that had he come forward and said listen\nAll of us were young at some point in life we just saw that they know you're getting now you're just getting in the class he sends me ask you are living a vote it will be asked to have somebody like one of the time\nThe ACLU is the reason that the first amendment was defined in Clarence Brandenburg versus Ohio case of Nineteen sixty seven he was a coins men\nAnd you guys defended his right to speak and that's why I have the right to say what I think is true the isn't he was now decided they're not gonna offend anybody\nThey disagree with no sir I think we have do we are just I think right now he's you know I Love we're defining we're now that will tell you this do you want me to name another group it\nOut or help them in the ... all that with people on different ideological hanging from the eighth or ninth or grew corn on the air trying to shut down because you know trying to do my principal\nThe memo from your group\nWe're not going to assist in cases that may advance the goals of white supremacists or others whose views are contrary to our values if you're not defending people who are on popular who disagree with why do you still exist we absolutely ... percent of the people we are doing a survey around if you look\nAt the case in New York or were defending the and we looked at all I have to say hello yeah I mean\nYou know so it was known it was done at that point [laughter] right well because they they do draw the line\nAnd they are political organization and learned just let it go where no longer that ... and ... and he read remember when they they said they're going to change right that they're not going to defend\nPeople that don't share the same value right hope that you didn't you bloated completely you were not going to defend their rights over there to free speech but again as we have settled law\nOn this issue there had been so many\nHuman said had nothing to do with how Tucker Carlson right there was trying to bring it down to no wait a minute we judge this case in our system we judge this issue by the merits of this issue as we said earlier\nBecause somebody else has been sexually assaulted does not give them their opinion any more credibility on this particular issue the only thing that matters is the evidence to back up her\nAllegation that's it ...\nIt doesn't matter that other women have been a\nCriminally sexually abused just like if somebody was making the allegation that they were robbed somebody else who was robbed does not have a greater morality or greater credibility to judge that particular issue which judged on the evidence that exists\nAnd that alone right that's what that's the only thing that you can go by in this system and the ACLU is now saying to hell with that right\nBecause no other case counts\nNo other criminal case counts no other victims\nOpinions carry more credibility just because of their victims it is the evidence and every particular case that counts otherwise anyone can make the claim\nAnd if you're saying\nWe believe the survivors and you'll be have like the ... the ACLU or any organization or protester right now that is chanting the same thing\nThen wait for it\nBecause at some point\nOne of you will be falsely accused\nWell you know when they say believe the survivor at that particular point mhm\nJust alone believe the you know believe the survivor which means\nBelieve the person making the allegation right well actually believe the survivor actually means believe that people make believe the person making the allegation is if they're if they are in favor of the political issue the the the the actual a background political issue that we're really dealing has here as long as\nIt's someone on our side that's making the accusation yes we all know that's what we all know is what it really means what to say believe the survivor means you believe the person making the allegation irrespective\nOf any other evidence that exists right because you can't say believe the survivor and ended up that no you can't you can't\nThat's on American to say that that's an American\nThat's not believing in the constitution it's not believing in individual rights it's everything that the ACLU used to stand for that now they reject completely and Tucker Carlson later on said he lost his temper temperature when he called them ... well you didn't they are hatched\nThey are they're trying to put me on their hands because they're trying to portray themselves as people that care about civil liberties when obviously they don't it's all about politics to them look\nAt you and I have our ... our day to day politics that that we promote on the air but we also promote individual rights

I Hope I got a cute I run your\nTrial the fault in Italy [noise]\nHow the questions we ...\nWe should not move on to another candidate\nThat was senator Spartacus in New Jersey [noise]\nHuh\nTucker Carlson that was the senator ... yeah when I was I was doing the ... over Cory Booker what\nOh that's where he still doesn't matter whether is innocent or not there's been enough questions raised that he should drop out now [laughter] so if you just raise just throw up the allegation yeah and and there's one flight away the germs were later on and said he goes yeah I I Know what I said what do you think about it goes where we've been through this already that letter McCarthy\n... you're not a communist right\nThat's exactly what the same thing that liberals were outraged about yeah now would they endorse the exactly for um detractors are forecast\nThe desert southwest back under dry conditions after what was hurricane Rosa has moved north where it will see stretches of by ten mainly clear today with the exception of far western Texas there is a moderate to risk of excessive rainfall however from eastern Iowa\nInto far northwestern Illinois and south western Wisconsin\nWith a larger risk area extending back into the central plains so\nYou can look to use the wipers for a good portion of the day today on sections of by eighty in Illinois and Iowa and from I thirty five\nSaying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by a liberal president who had been accused and it would act similarly\nI don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test\nSenator Booker why I like it no it's just dead wrong this is all about partisanship defeat opposite\nWas happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting up\nCanada Day everybody would behaving the opposite way and so it is partisanship and I think the framers of our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like I agree yeah\nI ... and and that's it I mean we we talk about the process you know it's\nIt's telling that we're at this point and still at this point in fact heightened your you'll likely see the chaos heightened today and tomorrow up until the main vote on so late Saturday or early Sunday Morning whenever it happens\nBut we're at this point but it is all of this chaos\nActual vote and what is it that that matters it's only about the vote I mean this is further proof that this was only about the delay delay it as long as you can in hopes an outside hope I guess that Kavanaugh would pull his own confirmation and withdraw his own confirmation and or the president would do it\nUm that wasn't going to happen or the one wants to let got loud that wasn't going to happen but this president and and now we know very clearly that certainly isn't going to happen by the nominee himself but\nYou look at this entire process and it has been distorted greatly there is no guarantee here that that Kavanaugh we will be confirmed with the\nOh your process and it has been distorted greatly\nThere is no guarantee here that the cabinet we will be confirmed with the actual legitimate process of all of this in place well you know when you when you hear Dershowitz or talk about you know McCarthyism ... and and what happened at that time when\nYou know you someone who accuse you of being a communist and so you'd get enraged and they say well sorry you don't have the temperament the allegation itself meant you were blacklisted right the the the fact that you lost it at anything was used an a you know against you\nAre and I thought ... which you know really when he said he said so you're going to direct or forty years and now you're losing control because somebody's calling you were communist you're on the temperament for the job so you're on your blacklisted from the the ... you know from the industry\nAnd it's something that liberals used to have in their mind and I think the important thing is and it's obvious\nBecause you and I have been having this discussion a back and forth because it is the left it is you know\n... we call it there's supposed to be anti fascist yet what are they promote what is their actual mindset it's authoritarianism and its fascism it's it you must live the life that that that we that that we wish you to live and what you see here\nWhat you see here from the Democrats the mindset that they're promoting everybody that you see Michael Moore and Amy Schumer and whoever whatever Hollywood people are down there screaming and yelling about you know a Brett Brett Kavanaugh and believe\nThe accuser that the the the defendant\nHas no rights at all the defendant is automatically guilty that is the mindset of a fascist yes that's not the mindset\nOf somebody who believes in the American constitution and the spirit of America and the spirit of due process in the spirit of the bill of rights of the United states it is the mindset of a fascist\nWell and and what we call somebody when we say they have the mindset of the fascist we back it up with specifics not just oh he talks mean therefore he's a fascist know\nWhatever's exact words in what is he actually wish to implement when we talk about President Trump\nAnd you know they started on that\nThey've moved on and this is a very very important thing for people to understand and I think that's what this is what maybe you're not in the Republican Party it started with Trump\nAnd enough people hated Trump where it stuck for a while and then they decided to move on from Trump and they moved on to Kavanaugh and all of a sudden the realization as we've said all along it was a bogus argument completely bogus and allies against Trump to begin with but then they moved to somebody else\nWho more people look at and say when all this is somebody who we really really like\nThis is somebody who we really would like in that position as much as we don't like Trump this was a great great great great pick and then you see the same tactics used against Trump that might have been okay for some people because they despised him so much somehow hit somebody they like and then they realize oh no if it can hit him that it can hit him\nOh my God they can come after me next thing go after anybody and that's what you learn with the fascists mindset they'll pick out an attractive target to get people you know motivated behind them even people of you know well of goodwill\nAnd all of a sudden those people of good will wake up one day and say and sometimes they wake up in a society and it's too late\nIt's not too late here in the United states and it's not too late in this instance and it looks like that because people have fought back are you now have you know created this unity in the Republican Party but\nAnd it looks like that because people have fought back are you now have you know created this unity in the Republican Party but remember it only goes so far because people of good will buy into it at times\nYes because it fits their political narrative but it is the mind what you're seeing is the mindset of a fascist and the fascist in this case is not the Republicans it is the Democrats and\nIt's not debatable\nWell I mean it's very simple when you look at the group that says they're anti fascist and their name in fact this condensed down to those condensed from those two words\nThere the group that's willing to go out and hurt people use violence against people they disagree with\nPunish people\nThey're the ones who are acting on it they're the ones in California who create laws that if you don't talk the way we want you to talk we can send you to jail\nIn New York\nWe can find your business to the extent\nThat you will be out of business\nTell me that's not fascist\nYou you don't create the ours\nThat somebody wishes you to create we will destroy your business\nYou wear a hat\nYou go to a restaurant and try and have a peaceful dinner we will come on to that private property and we will shout you\nOut you think like us you behave like gosh you reject the bill of rights and if you don't we will destroy your life\nRepublicans are finally coming around and you're not even realizing oh my God\nThat's what that party has become and it's not the fringe this is the important thing that this is not the fringe this is the mainstream yeah this is the Senate Judiciary committee it's the mainstream power of the republic irks me of the Democratic party and\nYou have a vaccine waters who doesn't get any grief from the lab for saying this is what we need you to do this is what we want you to do go out and get in their face\nEvery chance you get\nAnd all of a sudden you've got pushed back yeah\nRight because the average American will put up or for a while until all of a sudden it's like whoa okay the lines been crossed and I believe many people believe now that this line has been cross I Hope they do mhm let me put it this way I'm not going to make the prediction that they have yet it seems that they have\nBut my hope is that the American people have had enough\nAnd that more people will start rejecting the the mindset of fascism that is being promoted by the mainstream of the Democratic party yeah\nAs you're always say tell us where we're wrong you
