comes into\nThe substance issue huge for anybody who is paid attention over the last Thirty years as to what he's been involved with but Jim Brown is not part of popular culture today with the youth and millennials like Kanye West is the left is scared to death of Kanye West because he smack in the middle\nOf the the culture that is expected by the elite liberals to be a liberal supporter\nI have a different opinion and if he does have a different opinion than Trump is exploiting the mental issues that Kanye West had nobody was talking about mental issues a county was when he when you know he was up the award show where they\nKnow on the let no no no uh nobody in a lump was talking about his ah you know his mental state when I he said that uh George Bush or hates all black people because of the country and I didn't\nWrite that that that that's not because it again that's not a threat it's something at that time\nPolitically they could use a not so much the Taylor Swift award show moment but the the uh George Bush comment and\nIt was notable to the left but they didn't they didn't labeled him as insane\nIt if you think about his demeanor because I don't know by the way I don't know what ah what what do you call it the the hero voyage or or what whatever Trump is on right now ah [laughter]\nNot sure where that I mean [laughter]\nAh I I really don't know ah ah well I think\nYou can you sometimes you can go through a lot of cardio journey is what he said yeah you're you're there you go through a ... a lot of Kanye West lurks okay under than this one I don't understand the sense that All right they are and I do I have no idea what this means I get back\nKind of get back to you know I mean look look to the Beatles for inspiration she loves you yeah yeah yeah she loves you yeah yeah yeah\nWell no I disagree with you if you're looking for complete and total accuracy in a song tax man\nMhm yeah oh sure also from the Beatles yes yes I mean that's accuracy is yes I mean that that was come you understood that exactly wasn't one for me\nWas that when they had the Ninety percent tax rate was nine for you and one for me I think it was on yeah which was actually the tax rate at the time you know and\nThink the but\nIf you look at his demeanor in the way ... is actually taught I think he was on chemical things where he said a couple of things\nAnd listening to them it's like I was like if you don't look at the video you're like is that ... talking because his demeanor was calm\nAnd straight to the point it wasn't the Taylor Swift moment\nIt wasn't the moment or after Katrina the George Bush um it wasn't that it was something that\nThe content of the comment\nReally couldn't be debated by the left\nSo what do they do\nWell they go to the labeling and the name calling and then you know all of a sudden will now he's crazy which means he's not capable of making a thought at all you know this goes beyond the Mia Love thing\nOr you know and and the comments were all over the place you know the the token comment a from a Thursday or you know to the\nInsane comment but the insane comment is well he's not\nCapable he doesn't have the facts wired to do the wires Khamenei joy why as anybody surprise\nThat\nA a black man in rap ...\nThat's been in rap now for a couple of decades mhm looks overall and remember\nYou know you're a lot of rappers\nView themselves as a lot of old rockers did as revolutionaries ... and you look what are you looking for you're looking for where you believe manipulation maybe\nAs revolutionaries ... and you look what are you looking for you're looking for where you believe\nManipulation may be happening well if you want to look at manipulation if you want to look at bigotry if you want to look at intolerance if you want to look at an elite establishment that is telling\nAll blacks you must think a light or something is wrong with you I'm not surprised more\nMale rap stars haven't come out and said well this is ridiculous\nAs Kenya is doing\nI think it's completely and totally normal that you'd look and you'd say wait a minute the Democrat Party has been manipulate look we get calls\nFrom

that you must act this way you must think this way there's only one way to think and if you don't think this way you are betraying your race\nSomebody's finally going to stand up and saying\nYou're full of it\nThat is just naturally going to happen\nAnd that's essentially the point that Congress made on chemical\nYou know this this is ridiculous that someone can't think independently\nThat they've got they've got to be a part of groupthink\nI mean imagine Trump had said that\nOf blacks think alike but they should think alike politically\nCNN would have a twenty four hour special report

I mean I'm able to this story about the it was in my it was in my God I improvised Ted I called them girlie men because they weren't willing to take risks they act or told the magazine\nThey were afraid of everything he explained libel heroes in general want to do little things so there's no risk involved but today there are regrets Schwarzenegger announced says his rhetoric was counterproductive it was short sighted in the long term\nBetter not to say that because you want to work with them\nIf you have a little sense of history you know the best things were accomplished when both parties worked together and start come compromising like Ronald Reagan did with Tip O'Neill by the way that's completely\nAnd totally bogus and that the way to a successful country is compromising why do you think we have the debt we have today\nCompromise compromise\nOr giving up altogether [laughter]\nIt's it's somewhere in that area but ... but he buys compromise is only good yeah if what results from it in a good compromise is not good at what results from it is not good right right\nWell what they what they need a more ah\nAh Michael Blum Bloomberg's is what they need they need people like Arnold to finally you know admit they're Democrats\nYeah you ... uh [laughter] uh\nSo uh the there you are is at ... and and I you know we needed we needed that I could not have gotten to the day well here we go stock market now uh I I haven't checked the futures yet or the overnight to a market shed a overseas\nBut a over Thirteen hundred points down in two days now\nI took all my money out of the market and bottom a move farm is going to be great\nUh as we talked about yesterday\nOf finger and and frankly\nThe ethanol thing has become you know the for the ethanol farmers that's one thing but you look at the entire farming community and I'm Talking to the political\nIf they're hurt going into ... and this is what we haven't been able to gauge\nYou go to Iowa\nI mean and for those people that the New York times of listening when you go to Iowa let me describe before Iowa is is the state in the middle of the country but when you go there it is\nAll connected to farming just like Texas has oil directly or indirectly\nI mean that is the driver there when you go to the to the the farm belt\nThat's everything what's the impact right now of terrorists politically votes for Republicans and in twenty twenty ... at the mid term this year and in twenty twenty\nFor the president and his reelection because keep in mind they may support Republicans who are on board for terrorists\nThis time and twenty Eighteen at the midterms\nAre they going to support the president who owns it completely if it's still ongoing in twenty twenty\nNot surprised by what happened the last couple of days you know you and I've talked about it but\nWe said look the big terrorists were hit on September twenty eight ... so I'm not surprised that when you look at you know steel and aluminum and how they have skyrocketed since the beginning of the year right and we said look eventually it's going to be a point where the market's going to say look you're raising prices too uh too much and when the terrorists went into effect on September twenty eight\nOut when the president is trying to get a ran a you know the sanctions on Iran which means the world oil market is going you know increase the cost of oil even though we are producing\nA more when steel aluminum or up when we uh we had been told the fourth quarter could be hit because of the two hundred billion dollars in tariffs at ten percent that went in\nOn September ...

Radio Welcome to the show\nUm I I really interested in what you're talking about and about the stock market going down there the number of reasons like you said\nA including perhaps at a political agenda with respect to some businesses but the thing I called about it's about our country being able to produce everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that\nWhich is why NAFTA was so bad the good thing about doing it here it's we create more jobs\nNo its horror Mary it's horrible the last thing you would ever the last thing you would ever want to do is make a law that everything must be produced here\nBecause on prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies\nThat would make the goods and services that you get prices would be much higher than they should be dude and retail doors shutting raft and right I don't know if the opposite ... you would go in a massive recession if\nIt depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we ... really one of the most under reported stories\nOf the entire year ... is that the United states is now on it happened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of oil in the world mhm\nYeah um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of a ... that will\nMake an economy great again [laughter] um and they did\nBy the way I think that's the number one reason icon is supporting a uh the uh the the president his tax bill ... way way down\n[laughter] but I'm In the you know the [laughter] that'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the line to you that right so the\nWhat the what you put in place all of those dynamics for great economy and all it's working up until what\nThe ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great but what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials\nIs still high and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly\nControlled by the government that is something that U.S policy put in place that doesn't need to be there\nThough have you know in and we stayed at we stayed with China and the intellectual property yet we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even a\nAnd a few things different in in TPP but remember the great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in TPP\nCannot had already agreed to that guy or a you know ... before so that was a lot of disagreed victory and uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided\nYou know not to uh to take that you and I went through and and and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old NAFTA the biggest victory that the president has claimed\nThat he claimed was the fact that the terrorists worked\nTo get what he wanted with the automobile industry right all all he did in the automobile industry was increase the cost of producing an automobile in Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah\nNobody is debating that that's not what happened right\nAnd that's viewed as a victory\nWell if I remember two of the president's major goals his goals his stated goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nI don't see how this does it because the majority of the new NAFTA does is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent\nMhm ah and\nAh the rest is still the same right so you ask okay what were the what were the because at the presidents running against the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles what did you get\nYou increase the cost of automobiles for people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries and because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods\nTo you know producing them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite of the two things that you wanted a reduction in the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere\nWell and and the right now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry are now\nYou know the farmers I mean if you\nIf you say\nIt's a very populist viewpoint right we need to help the foreign\nBut when you think of the role that they play and and the and the global market in terms of food\nUh you know set of before a few minutes ago but\nThey feed the world\nThat food goes all over the world um\nYou and and they're traveling the administration look your your your\nMoney that you gave us a thanks but no thanks we need the business\nAnd and that's\nThe because forget about the political pots president doesn't need them\nHe doesn't need to uh I Know everybody does it politically but this president doesn't need that\nAnd they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite\nRight because it is you know it's just protectionist policies\nRetaliation from our trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers it's I mean they get their government bailout with the ten percent mandate\nSo\nI have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably\nScrambling well in terms of of getting things done as you said it was likely it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced yesterday yes and\nAnd that's the other thing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the ah\nThe supportive of a lot of people\nAnd other than I Know people who are otherwise conservative and say you know they supported the president they say well well this is all negotiation\nOr wait he was a master negotiator why does he need to threat\nThreatened and ultimately cost\nPeople a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get them to the grocery Asian done he's a master negotiator he doesn't need to do that\nWell as I said you know ... and again him or we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA right\nWell and that's it except for the\nYou know ... and you can look as we said you could look at it the one percent increase in the market share for the United states in the Canadian dairy mhm\nBut then they really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America actually but the president did a lot of what we\nExcept for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall was that worth the loss of business\nWith the tariffs that the president has put on that does raise the cost of goods and services and affected the cost of raw materials\nAnd other goods and services for American businesses are businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule right because now but now he mentioned that but his big victory this is what the president said we're not is this isn't our opinion\nWas the automobile thing I got what I wanted an automobiles what did you get\nWhat we made it so some uh some employers of in Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour mhm some\nHave to do that well fine you just made them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker\nRight or and even with the was it I think it was a Wall Street journal so it must and I forgot who else said well it's only a two point five percent tariff so really isn't going to affect that it isn't that great\nSo we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states or we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that\nBut the other than the president want to do is make sure that we could in the United states sell our vehicles overseas but that's less likely to happen because the cost in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up ... as to his caps on what Mexico you know could send us in cars\nBefore other terrorists hit\nOr we haven't ... they haven't reached that cap and\nCar buying in the United states has stagnated so they looked at that promote Canada and Mexico and said it's sort of like what they did in South Korea where they said okay you can only do we now doubled the amount of cars uh with the safety precaution\nLike what they did in South Korea where they said okay you can only do we now doubled the amount of cars or with the safety precautions to twenty thousand that we can sell in South Korea instead of ten thousand so see we doubled the market for the United states and the other states it was only selling six thousand to begin with\nRight they weren't ... where do you believe that everyone emerging the cap well they're not read the caps that had been set in NAFTA the two countries in Canada Mexico are reaching they gave him enough buffer space\n[noise] man have you heard about transportation nation dot com what's transportation nation dot com transportation nation dot com it's looking for news and

it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just one small indicator it's a small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sleepy and the map\nFor the house race or the house races so Republicans took one from the Democrats\nI haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats\nAnd one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the toss up\nDistricts still remains at thirty two and a two yes I Would love to see what your district that was that that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those started to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number or for a majority\nRight so right now only Nineteen to those thirty to\nNeed to go for uh the Republicans but\nEven fewer uh fourteen\nOnly need to go for the Democrats so\nIt will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls are and we and we will more and more

the entire thing and really made him I look at the our CPA for example in Montana isn't a toss up state right with test or you know up or the last one was done not you know nine twenty two which had test her up for the one before and and uh with the margin of error three point seven right and the one before that was test her up just to\nWhy isn't that a toss up state why is that definitely yeah on the on the Senate race yeah unemployment rate right and and so my point is though yeah is the legitimacy of\nThe our CPA average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell the ... and I guess historically can shift happened\nAh with with if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done\nOut of the recent polls that were done in that race or the the uh you know test her up by by four and the grab us a margin of error is three point seven\nSo that you know that right there could be neck and neck or they call like a toss up because of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error once we could have said it's not a toss up\nThat's my point my point is it's our cp has it has definitely blue [noise]\nMm [noise]\nOn my map is still showing great\n[laughter] I didn't get it when it just Web grey eye thanks to the staff at our cp for

unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information as a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was a ...\nWell the cofounder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\nReally now the average Virginia Republican subpoenaed Simpson on September twenty ninth or after\nThe lawyer said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committees\nSimpsons burned a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign bottle law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\n... fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the ...\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course a lawyer is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\nWell then what does ... say they're trying to find\nHere's I either ... or they're going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think that's all right are are they going to ask him about ah ah\nWho he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you are listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought that up\nUh I don't think so what are they going to ask him up\nWould either going to ask him about Kanye West probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and\nTheir role\nOr in\nThe uh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question\nThinking a of a\nFusion GPS Bruce or his wife\nWas employed at fusion GPS yes\nThe\nInspector general's office\nOf the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the and an associate\nDeputy attorney general\nAh\nThe inspector general would have then access to\nAttorney general ah\nThe inspector general would have then access to\nAny communications if they're still there\nBetween Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're\nInspector general gets them for the asking\nA does he\nOh he what he yes from the department of justice yeah well yes yes because because they were done internally yesterday right on right on an official yes device from the department and I and again\nIf the those are ... that that's a number of ... right away from the point being is that you look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because you shouldn't GPS doesn't want to cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that\nAh so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with a you know a\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do as you would look to see if there were that it communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still preserved in any way\nWe we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fifth mhm yes I have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand from what I Would wonder is a\nBlend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't let let's take him at his word mhm that the house Judiciary Committee and the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right then I Would ask his lawyer then\nWhat do you think they're going after\nRight if they're not well look at ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing as a mall or investigation\nThe Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russian collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the mother investigations is going is at the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know of of fusion GPS committing any crime\nI don't know of one I don't know where there was any evidence of it you would uh concerning you know get gathering information and getting the money from ... thrown opposition research firm that\nJust on the level is is that is what you do you get dirt on the other\nParty's candidate or whatever you you do up as well the what they do opposition research is self explanatory so what is he worried about\nWhat would they be what what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\nWell and and the heightening the timing is interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior I testified I'll go under out I'll just there are plenty of people that do wonder oh mhm so what is the crime that he is ... ... that what is the charge\nThat blends Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going to try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\nOr is there someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking\nOr is there someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating\nHis from yet [noise]\nThose are the questions that what those are questions on the investigator would have run into their mind yes elite yes that's all\nWe're

be believed just because of\nTheir demographic their gender or race whatever everybody knows it's the evidence but they actually tried to sell that to the American\nUh uh the people and you think about is just it's just it's nuts and then by the time we got to the middle of the week it was the Democrats promoting instability including the mainstream\nOf the the Democratic Party or like a Hillary Clinton or we saw Eric Holder come up and backtrack everybody knows that's not what I meant [laughter] somebody wrote that don't use the word kick\nAnd you know to you know where we are uh you

president's dating yesterday that\nThat ah the plans are meeting with China again yeah and uh hopefully that's what this is helping the bounce back up because we looked at the bad news over the last couple of days with the fed dropping Thirteen hundred and we said there's nothing you can do I think the president can do to stop\nWith the ... going to do or not you're not going to stop at nothing they can do to stop the borrowing or the interest on the bonds ... there's a ... on the regulation of tack\nThat's more of a Congress thing what can the president do the president can give optimism that we're going to get a deal done with China and he said we're going to you know meet a yesterday and hopefully that's one of the reasons that the stock market is tempered today is the hope that a a deal it's going to be done\nYep yep yeah 'cause you see a sell off like you saw in the past couple of days and that's about people losing confidence in those companies that are issuing concerns over

might be how she defends herself\nWhich by the way well she does well that would hurt her because she was trying to position herself as somebody who was by ... so just assume that\nOkay because we can you can hear it already she was just talking about the crazy Republicans\nWell not for somebody who says they're going to be a moderate and work with both parties\nBecause keep in mind I mean this is a the Jeff Flake seat but it's also the state that was represented a by the late John McCain and the left hailed him after after he passed for being someone who essentially rose about politics and work with both sides actually that was\nNot the case in the end and they weren't describing it his behavior in the Senate correctly he moved to the left they didn't move to the right to be clear\nBought a book on that on on that\nPoint she is trying to position herself and appeal to the people that might have support John McCain right\nYeah I looked up\nCuomo can get away with same conservatives are welcome in New York right yes even the ones that are there because we know that right and and just being on you get ... you can get away with that and in New York\nYeah yeah you can get away with probably saying it in California right\nAnd you can be a Democrat say look I Know all of people are nuts everybody here's crazy or not ... and still get elected as long as you promote democratic values might be a little bit different in Arizona\nThat's that's where the differences because you had essentially to a historically speaking and soft Republicans\nAnd says because you had

of our audience ... gun rights it's my rights\n[noise] uh yeah the gun doesn't advertising doesn't that doesn't have the right place at gun has no right to John doesn't have any rights\nI assume all of the the guns rights when I put it in my cold live fingers it's the people's\nYes a very interesting I just want to get to this topic because you happen to bring this up and I didn't know about this many employees on the Las Vegas strip fear being replaced by robots and you were telling me there is actually these and I'm looking at it right now that they've come up with these drink robots that will make bartenders obsolete yes\nAnd you can come at the design I've seen I don't know if this is in place in Vegas just yet but the design as seen also includes you walk up to the kiosk or the chaos cause even embedded into the counter like they do the are they actually have like a a if you go to a bar and a gambling city\nOr for those who don't gamble or never been\nWhen you sit at a bar you can get your drinks actually for free if you're gambling and they'll put the right there\nAt the seat there is a video poker thing you can play uh-huh right\nBy the way the drinks not free [laughter] it'll cost you whatever you losing video [laughter] to be clear you mean they're not given yeah anything free\nNow that uh that are just that they don't deserve to buy a bunch of alcohol and lose money on it\nNo I'm the those are the [laughter] getting back to the robot thing I'm a I'm not sure what the strippers will look like\nBut but for the bar it they'll move away\nFrom ... man on ah no no no right now bartenders robot brothels yeah I guess by the way we never really talked about yet we didn't talk about Houston didn't we didn't talk about and we did last week uh well I mean you know if you think about remember the old but I guess they still have them\nThe coffee vending machine where would make you a cup yes yes I was go back to the Terminator two\nThe security guard making the or it was a ... that went to make a a cup of coffee didn't work out too well known as the two walked up behind him and then became him which was weird but\nYou think about robotics and serving food that's been around for a while but it will be different in a bar like this where you go up and you basically uh order it\nYou know and uh you know the type it in a you're going to insert your credit card and then all of a sudden the drink is going to be made and even delivered to you depending on the set up on the counter\n... by automation\nYou know I think of John ... a guy who has a pretty good uh\nBusiness uh or has over the years in Las Vegas\nAnd also from uh the the bar rescue you're never going to see a well first of all there's no way to steal from the till I'm not blaming bartenders from for that I'm not condemning all bartenders but that does happen in the business\nAnd you know ... caught\nThey were you know skimming or whatever from from the register but even to a greater extent pouring way too heavy right right uh robots not going to do this\nFrom the ah register but even\nTo a greater extent pouring way too heavy right ... robots not going to do this\nWell either one but I here's the other point 'cause I was thinking the same thing I'd ask John tap or how far can you go with a robot bartender ... kind of regular Barbie all robots\nAnd just a person walking around or do you have there is is there a 'cause he talks about the science of a bar mhm and the science of the bar is about people and interaction\nAnd wrote a a a robot can't be pleasant\nTrust me I Know a few of them well a robot also can be angry either right MBA an angry bartender right\nA gay can't be a drunk bartender [laughter] well that's that but how how far do you go with the science of it I I can see this working totally in a place like Vegas where the focus is gambling not not communicating with the bartender or not walking into your corner bar so\nMy wife and I uh recently went to a place that had\nA robot roulette wheel\nNow we walked by it several times\nWe didn't we didn't look at it\nBecause it was often like they have a a a a what would you say it's there's there's there's poker and blackjack where you walk up and the screen has you know a dealer but it's it's animated\nRight and so that you know the the whole tables animated the cards or animated\nOn this roulette that's what I thought I was that I thought it was all animated it's actually\nIt's it's an actual wheel in the center\nAnd you don't you're not close to everyone it's not crowded like a real roulette table and so we thought okay let's see how this works and it was interesting we played it for a few minutes and it was interesting because I said you know that's that's not the animation thing is still gives you the view of a real roulette wheel\nRight and that's important for a lot of people that don't trust right ... well\nIn in the case of a a a Vegas in in a in a bar setting there's a couple of settings you're going to be a nightclub kind of setting and nightclubs are huge in in Vegas um where they don't care they just want to drink\nIt's not your pub writing where is that where the bartender right needs to be pleasant needs to be a companion for and carry maybe a little bit of a conversation on with you in Vegas it's not that\nIt's not that for the most part it's either the gamblers or ah like I said the nightclubs and no one cares anything except about the alcohol when it comes to the bar is all about the alcohol\nOr it'd be interesting to see how far this goes\nI Want to be alive when they come out with the whole version of the robot bartender\n[noise] ah yeah ... you're walking your house and they basically you've got bottles that you insert vodka whatever I mean right ten different types of alcohol that you put in their right and the mixer and everything else and then you just walk into your house and you say Alexa\nGive me a screwdriver there you go out and then she hands you fill us\n[laughter] now so [laughter] I doubt at Ohio oh God [laughter] and then it's ... alcohol no lights out\nDrinking alcohol [laughter] a satellite dish or
