going to move on it when when you know you want to well if you want to open this door if you want to go down that road [noise]\nGo for it I'm sure you'll have some radicals on the left on Capitol Hill that will keep talking about it but it's not going to happen for a reason [noise] because there's nothing there it's the reason the confirmation vote went through and he was ultimately confirmed [noise]\nYou're not going to have them well we can move when we can do this it's those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given when when when Van Jones is rolling up their sleeves and working in a grassroots effort to change their mind they elect doors no\nThat didn't happen in fact Hillary [noise] had a net loss\nOf luck doors and Trump had a net gain after the election after the election because these people don't live in reality they don't look at the facts in anything\nThey don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that that the process is that they slap on the Superman Cape and they're going to be a hero in a moment [noise]\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabin are confirmation process that was while it was distorted [noise] if you look at it the President Trump was the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out [noise]\nSo there was a supplemental background check [noise]\nWas zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit\nHe wasn't looking to get credit from the the media or the left of course\nBut the people the everyday people look at it and they'll they'll look back on this process and go well what is the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean that don't follow it every day and we know people work\nAnd some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and you don't take it in like like we do or or or your average new sound would do [noise]\nSo you don't have all the details but they look back on this and they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself\nThat allowed to process it was Chuck Grassley that allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gave her every single chance to prove her case and she could not [noise]\nThat's the reality of this all not that the you know the left wants you to believe in the protesters and the Weiner's in the babies want you to believe\nThat it was the Republicans who squashed it\nNope they opened it wide you could not have given them or her more of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law but just something just upset standard a\nA preponderance of the of of running of the the evidence something\nTo back it up and she couldn't do it now\nAh and neither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done the uh the what what didn't what did we find out the only thing that we didn't find out\nWas Ford who said that her\nThe the uh the notes and whether she had video whatever the polygraph doesn't and the therapists notes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know because she refused and her lawyers refused to to turn them over\nEverything that we now I mean the there is and if you can point to go to the the as the FBI said we only we know that you know we know that are not ... but when the mirrors a came out and said that uh you know that her lawyers oh you're twenty people we wanted to interview well that's not the point\nThe point is they asked her directly who are the people that you say are witnesses to the actual event but she pointed out the witnesses they interviewed them none of them right could cooperate and say that anything happened in that case and none of them said anything she had plenty of time to talk she could have gone back to the Judiciary Committee\nOr Dr Ford could and she never did\nAnd with those no she could have handled them over a nearly well it was two weeks ago when the when the Judiciary Committee and the chairman as fast for them because the the story came out that she uh and her lawyer through her lawyers were offering those therapists notes\nTo the FBI [noise] that's interesting that we learned about after we learned that they weren't going to interview her [noise] and the supplemental background check that\nReally is convenient [noise]\nOh no we're we're willing we call them we were going to give them you know you knew there and they have to come to you had\nPlenty of opportunity or are they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee now were they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate Judiciary committee ... and the Senate Judiciary committee would have gone over would have gone over that right there isn't anything of substance that the left has on now is\nThe only thing that the left has is again and it was ever changing you always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman\nOr a you know you know you never believe the you're never believe the uh the the man\nAnd the Judiciary Committee but when it came to the substance of the actual case\nYou know of of the political trucks so that's what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview\nOr yeah you uh don't involve the FBI in a normal job interview and uh you don't put people under oath under penalty of perjury for the average job interviews I Do if you're saying it was just like an average job interview\nOr you're a little bit of you are a little bit mistaken it got down to the point where all they had was an allegation and they believe that an allegation should\nBe enough ... really [noise]\nIf we reversed roles would that be enough ... really is that where you are now the allegation is enough\nAnd then you've got to the point with Cory Booker well or does it matter the whether he's guilty or innocent doesn't matter it's just there's so many allegations right that he should step down because yeah that yeah so then you get what you want just to multiple unverified allegations and that's enough\nFor somebody to step down nothing that the left are brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify this because we always get those road that's not just if this was the mainstream of the Democratic party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy\nThey were trying to get you to buy that the allegation is enough\nThat if a woman says it in this case it must be believed not in other cases but just this particular case\nIt must be bullied now I Know that they generally said oh woman must be believed but then the women that said well why don't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right yeah and and so that's what we're being sold the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence\nUh you know doesn't exist uh for for a man or defending yourself in a passionate way shows guilt mhm [noise]\nAh everything that they sure while does not pass the rational thought or critical thinking test [noise]\nNone of it and it was from again I we need to repeat this this is not the fringe Democrats this is the main stream of the Democratic party it is the Senate it is the Senate Judiciary committee it is the leadership of the Democratic party [noise]\n\nAnd they're trying to get you just to throw away [noise] any mind set of due process site [noise]\nWell [noise] as we saw even independence when the polling came out last week you know didn't buy it when they found out oh we didn't know that\nAll are witnesses that they couldn't cooperated with the no\nConfirm yeah [noise]\nAnd and that's that's it I mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers [noise]\nAh the the process was even distorted to that extent so to in order to facilitate that [noise] and then ultimately it came down to one while it was a vote along party lines [noise]\nWith with what two exceptions really [noise] and then other than that\nThat's what it's always going to be and it doesn't matter that it's Trump as president it doesn't matter that it's kept when I was the nominee is where we are as a nation politically right now [noise]\nIf Trump wasn't president if it was somebody else yup and he was Kevin always up there yet it would've been the exact

Bush or anybody else that came together and most dead on the right or for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about\nWhat the work and and and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work there and why it's important for Republicans\nThe together a because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure of the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates um but the end and one of those moderates along the way would include a Lindsey Graham I was just going to I was\nJust going to a mentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago that the left was motivated because I hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know right to swallow debate the more or whether there'll be a\nA whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know that they are and young people and I haven't seen a change in the ... young people that vote Democrat are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term whale that and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight to defend Trump and his pick yeah because if you're defending his pick your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see the George W. Bush or read that called Collins numerous times\nAh to tell her how to a vote when you see the colon speech [noise]\nYeah and and except for ... ... ... ... ... ... there were some things I disagreed with her on her speech or like when she gave\nA Dianne Feinstein the past ... the big pass which he shouldn't have done because Dianne Feinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with and to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nAh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walk through every single a point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins defending the great Trump pick of Brett Kavanaugh\nUm you know you can only fight so much within your own party before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to\nA ... ah get done as a Republican the Republican Party right now it's a pretty big party it's a pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really is dismayed when it come when it comes to spending culturally uh probably a more right than they've been in a while\nA more constitutional and they've been in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues are there as bad as Democrats have been in the past ah ah right now and you know and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it\nYou have unity in that party [noise] as I said last week like I Can't remember when we had shut unity part of it is the fight or from the president but the president has always had that fight in rhetoric\nBut in substance you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions are on them and not stick with them and you know even you know going after sections that you're still goes after them as did others early on\nMade you think OK doesn't really know who is picking this really of confidence in the people out there and him sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said I don't know you know or what was the spark that drove Lindsey Graham to still be on the Sunday Morning news show same who GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state\nYeah right you you know and that's it because that's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussions within a the right on issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending to change the school\nThe extent that it is going to be meaningful and mean great things long term for this country I I think we're a light years right now or to say that this kind of momentum can get us to that point where we can change the spending habits\nI mean for Republicans and their mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably a ways from that because that goes back to again what we said the base of the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the left wild and social media and in the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process the Democrats have California you know not backing her officially\nA for her run and that kind of again that's there's\nThat's an anomaly often on the left they are better than the right at [noise] letting\nThe ah mansions of the world and even maybe a high camp a a ... do what they do in their state\nBecause it gives them the seat ultimately on other and the vote on other issues I'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill\nOf [noise] building building the wall\nReally if you if you think about it that guards us guards this nation\nAgainst the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks this is not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process\nThey do believe they can change the process and other items if they get a head start which is why\nThey start with well we need to do away with the Senate and we predicted this the moment they talked about getting away with a good well in a way with the electoral dollar the Democratic senators won't before they know that's it's not going to have you know it's nothing but the point being is their behavior is not going to change\nAnd they'll work to that and\nAnd it means if the because of they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of moving growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which again will never happen\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that tower that castle if you will that wall that mode has to be built around this nation to protect this constitution\nYou can get a few things done if you're not unified but I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified over the substance of of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm a very easy presumption of innocence ... due process constitutional issues not defending somebody\nWhen you talk about those are all ... huge Lee moral issues and that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they are able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty\nAnd get legislation passed\nThat is extremely productive and conservative and hopefully give Trump a chance to win and twenty twenty against eight or ... or a book or\nRight by the way I remember after the Roy Moore last that's when they got the tax deal done and that's when they got that legislation done they couldn't get it done before they lost that seat when they lost that seat that was motivating it shouldn't have been they should have been ... motivated before that eight six six\nOr they lost that

I think it is about the fact that\nYou have the as I've said why'd I think it was Washington Examiner said or a quarter of Republicans or identify themselves as socialist a quarter and a half a Democrat but a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how wide the Republican Party is\nUh right now and this and the anger and the unity comes from the fact that\nThey listen to a Democratic Party and the mainstream of the Democratic party who when you listen to it you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about the mainstream leadership those in the Senate Judiciary committee [noise]\nThat are talking insane ...\nThey're talking about things that are completely against fairness and constitutional issues that are just so important to so many of us are presumption of ... of of of innocence yeah and it's just driving the Republicans crazy for video world log here's your forecast\nWe begin a week with a very active weather map there are at least three other systems in the north Atlantic that are being monitored by the national Hurricane Center but we're focus now on tropical storm Michael expected to bring to the north eastern Gulf Coast by mid week the risk of dangerous storm surge\nRainfall wind impacts continue to increase will see at least tropical storm force winds arrived by tomorrow night\nFrom an area basically from west of Tallahassee into the New Orleans area but most of South Florida can expect some impact as well that would be the Gulf side or western side of the state system expected to track right on up through southern Georgia\nI Can't think of another Republican whose journey from anti Trump outraged approach from above ... was quite so illogical or half a sad end he suggests that you are auditioning\nFor a place Jeff Sessions as attorney general your response or a Frank you don't know what you're talking about in your world Frank is a noble cause to destroy judicial candidates whose conservative\nWhether it be Thomas lido\nMork now cabinet and bipartisan when it makes sense [noise]\nUh I Try to have a good disposition costs are like my job but don't mistake that I don't care about the conservative cause so if I made you upset because I Would not legitimize McCarthyism\nThing good and I think I can survive in South Carolina\nWell you know the thing is is that uh I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning\nI'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from the uh the outrage that he delivered a there on Capitol Hill that day\nI think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election\nIt needs to be carried through in that attitude needs to be carried through\nA on important things that that ah that matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows what kind of her nomination process we may go through a while a Trump still president but uh you know making some very solid point\nAh the what was going to\nConvenient that's what they do they point to the right ah Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president the left wanted to use that and [noise]\nAnd and and really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be the bipartisan willing to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was and in some ways he was [noise] but of course you're demonized now you're fiddler [noise]\nBecause you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly\nSo well you know the thing is and reading Frank Bruni has come to New York times that none of it relates to the actual\nCase and what he was talking about there is it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has a different since with Donald Trump right and you know in Trump is you know been in a Trump has been meaning to him and called them names and things like that and\nThere's been an animosity between the two and therefore [laughter]\nSomehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump side with Trump's candidate I mean it it seems\nThat really doesn't get what we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump [noise]\n\nIt really wasn't a burly doesn't get that and I don't know I have to go back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump or from a Lindsey Graham [noise] but Lindsey Graham's\nOr when he issued his concern that day or a week ago last Thursday [noise]\nIt was based on the lack of merits of the case and the and and on the larger a much through a larger extent are pretty much the treatment of Kavanaugh by\nThe Democrats and and not the not the liberals with the signs outside look through\nThe Democrats on the committee Frank Bruni has nothing to read the article he's got nothing well he's angry he's yeah they're they're they're wrong as I said we discuss this for the last two and a half weeks [noise]\nWe didn't have anyone I Am not seen any rational thought or critical thinking statement\nCome from the mainstream media or the Democrats to say that the position that I hold and you hold which wouldn't be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham yeah where is flawed at all\nExcept for rhetoric and bringing up other things that have nothing to do\nWith this case with this nomination process with\nThe witnesses and the allegations that came forward\nEvery single point that we had made\n[noise]\nWhich are the same word I can see as Lindsey Graham are all legit and the oldest going to drive them nuts and morals and correct and rice and you're wrong and reading Frank Bernie's column in the New York times you're a simple pin Mr Bruni [noise]\nTalk about the actual things that Lindsey Graham brought up gold point by\nPoint and say any of the things that he said we're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be lined\nUp [noise]\nI mean it is again a the [noise]\nOf the debate they don't have the debate can of the debate so they have to step up and ... what Lindsey Graham said on that day so they do what [noise] well they used to be for Trump now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right [noise]\n\nWell from their world absolute loyalty is expected as we've said in the real world it's I like this candidate for this don't like him for this all the right over there that's a good nominate that's that's a good nomination pick over there I like that I don't like this\nReal people and critical thinking people and people with rational thought Mr Bernie can do that\nI can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed with Lindsey Graham and John might in the future\nYou are you running for attorney general right [laughter] what ... what do you want to or to general what are you trying to get out of ... exactly ... well that's it he's only doing this well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have as he was against Trump and now he's for Trump\nWe've we've said with the simple ten you know a arguments that will never and I called them simple ten arguments because they never directly go after the the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always tried to bring up side issues that aren't [noise]\nAren't even a pertinent to what you're discussing right [noise]\nAnd you read British told me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing Trump spot to become attorney general yeah\nYou know evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because he was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with Trump's you must always disagree with Trump which of course it's aguaje yes [noise]\n\nYeah it it it is the insanity of the left and and again ah they were ... it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the site that had the greater intellect [laughter]\nThey're still trying to tell you that they are no they don't but it is the ... they keep going for the low hanging fruit band and the and and really the brunt of the argument right now is well he's just trying to get something out of Trump or he used to hate Trump but now he likes Trump [noise]\n\nDebate him on the points made on that day Mr Bruni can't can't

California\nA mark Marty welcome how you're going to run your walk into the show\nAre you guys good shows usual thanks like I had a\n... and I don't know the road but I think that if mark judge were to possibly a super slander a stock report or\n... whatever his name is uh uh I think that men do some I think I think it may slow them down a little bit in the upper ... agree with you guys are going to continue to describe it um but I think that if judge were super slander or libel oh\nHe's a private citizen yep he could not under the same rules of capping off now or anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who was\nBrought in with the slogan bill that would give them food food for thought\nYeah I I mean you look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking to basically not pursue this any further\nUm maybe there's something there may be there the they've already heard from judge ... or ... or is lawyers but certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is factors that he would have a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but\nUm he would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was ... was made public\nA through this with with the league and everything else ah that's and and who else would be respond\nChain of events with the leaked to the media and all of that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting you the names were brought out as a result of the leak\nForward as far as we know she didn't leak it\nSo if that if that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it because what responsibility do they have\nIn a case they're trying to ... by ... by mark judge and or his lawyers whoever leaked to the media would also be partially responsible or for getting his name out\nThere and that you could see\nI think ... part of that and you haven't any case there that was that was him yes the Medicaid eliminated because it's likely to get the of the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yes right right\nRight the only possibility of backlash on the it is you wouldn't want to put his good buddy or do they already\nThe wind is yeah yeah you know got tempered problems and I wouldn't want them to think that there was a historic visit in spite of use voted into those for spite and\n[noise] yeah well they you know it's it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out\nOr in every a predictable and even some are unpredictable ways we can we can try and come to use our imagination to come up with things and and thank you I'm ready for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question\nAh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process uh you you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination or as the capital capital did\nAnd and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of a mark judge\nOr that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden\nBut you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that that survived at all was Dr forge claim and and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further [noise] so\nThat's why I'm ... and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so she wasn't trying to link it to the ... a a media but in the ad in any case yeah\nTo me that would even be a ... and again I don't know who leaked and so I I don't know I'm just I'm On the doctor or right I'm just using ... that that as a possible exception here right ah but with the other case to me that's clear that what I mean it\nGoing going after Kavanaugh with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time right and they are public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm spiking drinks you know things like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out and print that right ... and say that about people right especially private citizens mhm\nThat says then you've got to make your case and say where's the probable cause while I think it might have happened that's not good enough no no absolutely not so I I like to just to having any personally [noise]\nWell I mean I I well because we're the ... the claims that were carried out and how he pursued this what role did he play and pursuing this in the media pursuing this and charging you a ... and and filing suit in New York sworn statement the New Yorker [noise]\nAh for publicizing it and and and publishing it that and you would have a case at least to the extent that while the New York times went out of their way and interviewed dozens and couldn't find\nThough well we're not going to hell whoa whoa where's the perjury potty approved the perjury\nHow do you prove the perjury trial and well you know ... if you don't want to take that one out like Diane Feinstein\nOkay well I Know ... ... ... well my point is we go point by point by what you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge poured who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with or would she has a spy or a as a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe that yes of course right I I I Believe there should be investigation there and I so I Would agree with you on that\nAnd I believe that I'm not in their promise I ... I Believe they are promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make a charge of any kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\nOnly one that ... that's ... says I've followed and I want you to that wasn't Republicans fault no I ...\nThat was combing who clearly was politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\n[noise] well do you expect the the Democrats just stop doing any of\nYou know without knowing which are like what\nIf you're get them ultimately in twenty sixteen amounts of loss\nIt is but because the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody an elected office would bring these up these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe said about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about ... which wasn't ended up itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email a investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would uh prosecuted\nWe said well it what matters here's the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call it is not always that that and not that she's above the law\nOr we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice\nHaving her in jail\nOr is not as great as not having her in the White House\nYou know here's here's the uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding Gary and sparks Nevada was responding to\nWhen we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened\nA he said she said of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness stating she's lying about it right\nOr you know or it was you know I you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of ones you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm\nUh and and so my point was I I don't know the doctor Ford situation\nIs there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah or any things in the wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can collaborate and so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it\nAnd and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen\nUh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't\nOr when the seats that they should be winning a in a first term of a president in the first midterm afterwards that almost always the party in power loses seats ... that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was\nAh was confirmed ... er and United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explained Clinton was in the Republicans [noise]\nSo if you're angry that justice isn't always done [noise] all I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the troops out there I guess that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton [noise]\nWas never charged because there is a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty would wander charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\n[noise] and it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime\nPart of the power comes from public opinion [noise] and it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted mhm [noise] and [noise] so the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary [noise]\nAh worry we know um [noise]\nOf his bumping gossipy for example Susan Rice sure felt we laugh when it said she said you know the ... that she would like to ... she would consider running against colon seems like an excuse me you're on the line item on ... now it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line\nAbout a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone in the United states knows its ally for everyone in the United states you could take them and you could show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you can read the law\nAnd and everybody wouldn't agreement that's what she did and there would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with it and can't do anything about it the best that we can hope for in any thing is that the truth is told I don't know what's gonna happen and the FBI investigation right [noise]\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption it's now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to relieve some of this information and uh so we're going to give it to Michael I have an eddy we went that doesn't make ... we're going to give it to like a horror which are my [laughter]\nDon't give it to my colleagues Minnesota them and they don't have the [laughter] whatever you do\nGive it to Michael Horowitz inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went Doug ... is it doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general of the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to\nOh wait a minute [noise] inspector general only deals with corruption ... improprieties Oh yes\nAnd and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story's been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not released it immediately\nAnd give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption [noise] and so we don't know what's gonna happen there but get us the truth and if the American people if they get the truth and still decided to do the wrong thing\nThat's on the ... [noise]\n... and that's that that's really what it comes down to is that ah we've been calling for transparency on on\nAll of it [noise] the whole Russians scandal thing [noise] we said multiple times [noise] regardless of where it falls politically as long as that is fully transparent and the process the American people\nCan decide [noise] up because we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it [noise]\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really want an investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want\nFrom three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this this will play out in the public\nOver and over and

because so much has happened in this process\nUh so the question is how much of this carries over a and is motivating on on either side uh it is somewhat Motor City motivating aren't likely on on each

the Republican Party I think it scared them strays right I really do I really I I usually when I went whoa wait well never thought they'd do this and\nAnd you know the last motivator that we could even come close to it I guess in ... during the the uh the Trump presidency or to to paralleling this was when Roy Moore last [noise]\nThey realized they need to get tax has done yeah you know they ... they weren't getting it done they weren't getting it done and it was well no more than ... and then all of a sudden right after Roy Moore's last they got it done [noise]\nWhat happened over the last couple of weeks or be a greater motivator on all legislative and procedural issues that and it should be for the foreseeable future\nBut that tax policy did not unite the actual party knowing that their nose and it didn't it and I mean that was the ... it was the effect of the Roy Moore last right that got them motivated and that's\nMiniscule compared to what you see and it was the last two ... and not just you know one of the ... of the Republican Party I'm I'm Talking about the members of Congress so yeah and and the politicians I'm Talking about the rank and file no nine eleven even the ... out where it comes from that is where the motivating comes from because\nIf you if you look at what drives the legislative process well if we were all still shouting away with Obamacare it would've been gone\nThe first several months that Trump was in office right so you know that's I I think you you point out the base of it but that's really where I was going with all of this is that the party itself which of course is driven by the rank and file\nSo the the things that are important to get done there has to be greater pressure to keep all of those on Capitol Hill and the

surge\nBeen completely bulldozed by the left and not the protesters not the media but members of that committee [noise] the the leaders of the party [noise]\nAnd that should be motivating to every Republican I I Believe it is but I think\nUh in in hearing or the Lindsey Graham talk about the the campaigning you'll do and some of those purple states are over the next few weeks to remind people that kind of campaigning\nHas to be done not just leading up to the mid term but after the midterm and beyond the Republicans as we've been calling them out for many years on this program need to do a better job of spelling out exactly what the left is doing and reminding the public what the left has doing it'd be factual\nYou don't have to ... you don't have to use the hyperbole your show exactly

Republican you don't have to be caught in any ... troops right all you have to do is pointing out the truth of where now and this is very very important [noise]\nWhere the mainstream of the Democratic party is now not the fringe\nBut the main stream and I think that one of the things that I have seen a and it's anecdotal evidence or to ... to to figure out what all the the the polls mean and how it's going to apply in four weeks I don't know but the one thing that I've gotten from independence\nIs they look at the Democratic party right now and they say oh my God\nWhat in the world are these people about there is no sense of of fairness there is no sense of civility for they don't ... they don't care about it you know are taking taking somebody and destroying their life\nAnd and I mean I've heard this from from independence on both sides and that they destroyed for his life by not keeping it secret then it went on to try to ... to destroy a capital is life on both sides just said it\nIt seems like the only thing that matters we don't care who's live we destroy we don't care what promises we break we don't care what we do we don't care whether we don't care about a presumption of innocence we don't care about giving you anonymity\nWe just want to win and we will do anything to when we will demean we won't play fair and I do think\nThat there is something to hear that his even outside of the normal politics that we go through every day that this isn't going to be a discussion if this goes in favor of Republicans\nThat that which means you're going to get a lot of independence that that moved in the Republican you know direction it's going to be not be because of ... okay will what will Gorsuch and cabinet do when it comes to regulations of the EPA\nNow it may matter to you but I don't think that's what's going to drive it I think was going to drive it is\nThe very clear drama that we have gone through over the last two weeks where people look at the Democratic party and say\nThese aren't fair people these aren't reasonable people\nRight and I think if you look at it I got to be honest with you the protesters may be driving the left but they're driving away mainstream America [noise]\nThe let me think that they're winning because the protestors are out there getting the attention for them and that they're they're jumping on in in some cases they're bandwagon and their claims the fact of the matter is\nThat's not the case with middle America they see the behavior of the protest it's not to dismiss a claim\nIt is in fact to do exactly what was done in this case and to properly vet a claim to the extent that the president came out and ordered a seven background check\nAnd that Grassley they doctor for her time on TV in front of the American people to make her case you know some sort of a great point there 'cause I when\nWhen I was given my explanation there I wasn't even talking about the protesters you brought up the protesters and I think the unique thing that we've gotten to the point now where there's no difference in in many of the public's mind between the protesters and the mainstream bright politicians they're saying the exact same thing just they're saying that it's it's not like you can sit\nThe public's mind between the protesters and the mainstream right politicians that they're saying the exact same thing just they're saying that it's it's not like you can sit there and say well those are just a crazy protesters no because the crazy protesters and the Democrat leadership of the Senate Judiciary committee or using the same argument yes they are\nThey're basically ... the the arguments and and claims made by these protesters and their tactics I mean look at even before we got to Dr Ford hearing the doctor forty hearing\nWhat was the tactic being considered the first day the weekend before the first day of hearing a confirmation hearings on Kavanaugh it was well what if we just all get up and walk out over the whole documents things by the way we're that go\nNowhere because they had nothing is Democrats always do these days it wasn't about challenging him on his position on on a

[noise]\nAnd you know that that was the question based on of course a parallel to Obamacare\nBut that the left doesn't care to do that anymore so they co opt the claims made by the far left and they have become the far left\nThe mainstream members of the party [noise] the ones who were elected to office have become that because they think it's working Kamala Harris can go back to California and
