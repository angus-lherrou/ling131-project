isn't just a Trump the anger was never all just at Trump\nFrom the left the anger has always been there the rage has always been there well excuse me\nIt's been there for the last couple of decades

it's not going to happen for a reason because there's nothing there it's the reason the confirmation vote went through and he was ultimately confirmed [noise]\nYou're not going to have them well we can move and we can do this\nIt's those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given when when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working in a grassroots effort

don't live in reality they don't look at the facts and anything\nThey don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that that the process is that they slap on the Superman Cape and they're going to be a hero in a moment [noise]\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet confirmation process that was while it was distorted\n[noise] if you look at it the President Trump was the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out [noise] so there was a supplemental background check [noise]\nZero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit but the people he wasn't looking to get credit from the the media or the left of course\nBut the people the everyday people look at it and they'll they'll look back on this process and go well one of the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean that don't follow it every day and we know people work and some people worker\nAnd you don't take it in like like we do or or or your average new sound would do\nSo you don't have all the details but they look back on this and they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself\nThat allowed to process it was Chuck Grassley that allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gave her every single chance to prove her case and she could not\nThat's the reality of this all not that the you know the left wants you to believe in the protesters and the Weiner's in the babies\nWant you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it\nNope they opened it wide you could not have given them or her more of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law but just something just upset us than children of\nA preponderance of the of of running of the the evidence\nSomething to back it up and she couldn't do it now\nAnd neither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done the uh the what what didn't what did we find out the only thing that we didn't find out\nWas Ford who said that her the the uh the notes and whether she had video whatever the polygraph doesn't and the therapist notes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know and that because she refused\nAnd her lawyers refused to to turn them over\nEverything that we know that there is and if you can point to the the as the FBI said we only we know that I you know we know that are not ... but when the mirrors a came out and said that uh you know that her lawyers oh you're twenty people we wanted to interview well that's not the point\nThe point is they asked her directly who are the people that you say are witnesses\nTo this actual event but she pointed out the witnesses they interviewed them none of them right could cooperate and say that anything happened in that case and none of them said anything she had plenty of time to talk she could have gone back to the Judiciary Committee or Dr Ford could and she never did\nStand with those no she could have handled them over a nearly well it was two weeks ago when the when the Judiciary Committee and the chairman as fast for them right because the the story came out that she uh and her lawyer through her lawyers were offering those therapists notes\nTo the FBI [noise] that's interesting that we learned about after we learned that they weren't going to interview her [noise] and the supplemental background check that really is convenient [noise]\nOh no we're we're willing we call them we were going to give them you know you you knew there and they have to come to you had\nPlenty of opportunity or are they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee how were they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate Judiciary committee and the Senate Judiciary committee would have gone over would have gone over that right there isn't anything of substance that the left has on now is\nThe only thing the left has is again and it was ever changing you always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman\nOr a you know you know you'll never believe the you never believe the uh the the man you had white males and the Senate Judiciary committee but when it came to the substance of the actual case\nYou know of of the political trucks that's what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview uh yeah you uh don't involve the FBI in a normal job interview and uh you don't put people under oath under penalty of perjury\nIf you're saying it was just like an average job interview or you're a little bit of you are a little bit mistaken it got down to the point where all they had was an allegation and they believe that an allegation should be enough ... really [noise]\nIf we reversed rose would that be enough ... really is that where you are now the allegation is enough\nAnd then you've got to the point with Cory Booker well or it doesn't matter the whether he's guilty or innocent doesn't matter it's just there's so many allegations right that he should step down because yeah that's yeah so then you get what you want just to multiple unverified allegations and that's enough\nFor somebody to step down nothing that the left are brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify this because we always get those road that's not just if this was the mainstream of the Democratic party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy\nThey were trying to get you to buy that the allegation is enough\nThat if a woman says it in this case it must be believed not in other cases but just this particular case\nIt must be bullied now I Know that they generally said oh woman must be believed but then the women that said well why don't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right and and so that's what we're being sold the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence\nUh you know doesn't exist uh for for a man or defending yourself in a passionate way shows guilds mhm [noise]\nAh everything that they sure while does not pass the rational thought or critical thinking test [noise]\nNone of it and it was from again I we need to repeat this this is not the fringe Democrats this is the mainstream of the Democratic party it is the Senate it is the Senate Judiciary committee it is the leadership of the Democratic party [noise]\nAnd they're trying to get you just to throw away any mind set of due process site\n[noise] well [noise] as we saw even independence\nWhen the pollen came out last week you know didn't buy it when they found out oh we didn't know that over witnesses that couldn't cooperated with the no confirm yeah [noise] and and that's that's it\nI mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers [noise]\nAh the the process was even distorted to that extent so to in order to facilitate that [noise] and then ultimately it came down to ... well it was a vote along party lines [noise]\nWith with what two exceptions really and then other than that that's what it's always going to be and it doesn't matter that it's Trump as president it doesn't matter that it's kept when I was the nominee is where we are as a nation politically right now [noise]\nIf Trump wasn't president if it was

Brian Hi you're on radio\nFrank thank you for taking my call ... ... as far as to Kavanaugh heroes go and and the compilation\nIt it wouldn't allow that who was elected president of the Republican side there would have done this to anyone whether the crews ... whoever\nYo ... says Trump fights back here it's like a lion and and and and and and he just makes me very proud to be in the ... and they're actually very proud to say that I voted that\nI I I Would say this Bryan that I'd I'm not sure and we will we will never know but I'm not sure how another\nRepublican would have reacted to the heat on Kavanaugh if they might have withdrawn his nomination and I think that's something to consider is it is it that Trump\nOr wouldn't back down and and he refused to withdraw that nomination that's a possibility I I don't know how to quantify that because we'll never know but it's I think we have to consider that possibility\nWell thank you for taking my call ... or you take care and but he brings a point that we've made along we met at last week made of the week before and you know while this is what you get when you get Trump now this would have happened no matter what\nIs this the the the craziness surrounding it and and the left behavior definitely would have happened I'm In the past Republicans other Republicans might have been\nApparently not Lindsey Graham but [laughter] but other Republicans might have because we talked about how the Republicans in the past I've had been quick to eat their own I don't I don't know I Can't say that about a ... because we don't we'll never know\nIf Ted Cruz had won or is he mentioned a Rubio or anybody else and other Republican were there or Mike Pence I have no idea\nUh we don't know if if they would have withdrawn the nomination\nUm when the president is president basically said okay fine we'll do another FBI background check 'em you know giving it the tire\nA vetting process of seven complete background checks so I I don't know I but I Do know that this president has been less willing to back down I'm as unpredictable as he may be at times\nHe did not back down from the barrage of stories from the media and the the behavior of course the over the top behavior by the left and as you say Gary the mainstream left we need to point that out this is these are people on the committees these are these are the main stream a\nI thought you know not one not too but a\nTotal of four they're really really voting for a group and so our time for times I'm ... and and I [laughter] I thought to myself you know okay that's that's a that kind of enthusiasm\nUm even if we were to show that uh we don't do and we don't do endorsements because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really do anything and tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion\nOn the ideas and we believe that our audience and the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions they may be willfully ignorant not our listeners but others may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision\nOr you know or are there still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about\nAh when that person is elected if I\nIf I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign I'm skills from day one going to watch them on on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course a head of that work\nYou are back them in order to you know uh to to\nHave them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W. Bush or anybody else that came together and most did on the right or for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd it really was about what the work and and and the results of the work\nOf this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work there and why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together or because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure\nOf the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates\nUm but the ... and one of those moderates along the way would include Lindsey Graham I was just going\nTo I was just going to a mentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the less was motivated because they hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know it this way out of eight them more or whether there'll be a\nA ... whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know that the young people and then I haven't seen a change in the ... young people that do Democrats are are not enthusiastic\nThat and that could hurt the Democrats but what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight to defend Trump and his pick yeah\nBecause if you're defending his peck your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see that George W. Bush or read that called Collins numerous times\nAh to tell her how to a vote when you see the ... speech [noise] yeah and\nAnd except for ... ... ... ... there were some things I disagreed with her honors and beach or like when she gave\nA Dianne Feinstein the pass and the big past which he shouldn't have done because Dianne Feinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with and to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nAh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walk through every single a point and came across as very very common sense then this is Susan Collins defending\nThe great Trump pick of Brett Kavanaugh um\nYou know you can only fight so much within your own party before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to\nA ... ah get done as a Republican or Republican Party right now it's a pretty big party it's a pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really is when you come when it comes to spending culturally uh probably a more right than they've been in a while\nA more constitutional and they've been in a while when it comes to social issues\nNot spending issues are there as bad as Democrats have been in the past ah ah ah right now and you know and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it you have unity in that party [noise]\nAs I said last week like I Can't remember when we had shut unity part of it is the fight or from the president but the president has always had that fight in rhetoric\nBut in substance you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions are on them and not stick with them and you know even you know going after sections as you're still goes after them as he did others early on\nMade you think OK doesn't really know who is picking doesn't really have confidence in the people out there and him sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said I don't know you know what was the spark that drove Lindsey Graham to still be on the Sunday Morning news show saying they'll GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state yeah\nRight ... you know and that's it ... because that's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussions within a the right\nOn issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending\nTo change fiscal policy or to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and mean great things long term for this country I I think we are light years right now or to say that this kind of momentum can get us to that point where we can change the spending habits\nI mean for Republicans and their mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably away from that because that goes back to again what we said the base of the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the lap while in social media and in the protests calling out or or even officially the calling\nYou see this to some extent on the lap while in social media and then the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process the Democrats of California you know not backing her officially a for her run and that kind of again\nThat's there's that's an anomaly often on the left they are better than the right at [noise]\nLetting the ah mansions of the world and even maybe a high camp uh uh do what they do in their state\nBecause it gives them the seat ultimately on other end the vote on other issues I'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill of [noise]\nBuilding building the wall really if you if you think about it that guards guards this nation\nAgainst the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks\nThis is not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process they do believe they can change the process and other items if they get a head start which is why they start with well we need to do away with the Senate\nAnd we predicted this the moment they talked about getting away with a good well in a way with the electro ... the Democratic senators won't before they know that it's not going to have you know it's not the right now but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that and\nAnd it means if the because of they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of moving growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which again will never happen\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that tower that castle if you will that wall that most has to be built around this nation to protect this constitution\nYou can get a few things done if you're not unified but I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified over the substance of of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm a very easy presumption of innocence right due process constitutional issues not defending somebody when you talk about those are all ... ... moral issues\nAnd that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they're able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty\nAnd get legislation passed that is extremely productive and conservative and hopefully give Trump a chance to win in twenty twenty against state\nYeah Camilla Harrison or a voter right by the way I remember after the Roy Moore last that's when they got the tax deal done that's when they got that legislation done they couldn't get it done before they lost that seat when they lost that seat

I think it is about the fact that you have the\n... as I've said why'd I think it was Washington Examiner said\nOr a quarter of Republicans are identified themselves as socialist a quarter and a half a Democrat but a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how wide the Republican Party is uh right now and this and the anger and the unity comes from the fact\nThat they've listened to a Democratic Party and the mainstream of the Democratic party who when you listen to it you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about the mainstream leadership those in the Senate Judiciary committee [noise]\nThat are talking insane mhm they're talking about things that are completely against fairness and constitutional issues\nThat are just so important to so many of us are presumption of ... of of of innocence yeah and it's just driving the Republicans crazy for video world log here's your forecast\nAs cleanup continues in the south after one of the most devastating storm systems to ever hit the U.S we are looking at again today for clear skies in the region\nThe Florida Panhandle the big band in fact ah the entire Gulf Coast from the tip of Texas all the way over to southern Florida looks to be dry today as a big pool of Canadian air\nHas now filtered in through that portion of the country we're going to pick up some rain showers for portions of the mid west especially southern Illinois and southern Indiana along the Ohio River\nBend as you move into Ohio we get a little break but\nThen in northern Ohio around Cleveland up through eerie PA and portions of northern Pennsylvania into upstate New York a chance of some slight showers today tropical storm surge you will bring some showers two portions of New Mexico and parts of western Texas today\nA tough pollen in the New York times today than that\nYou I Want to put something up Frank Bruni writes\nI Can't think of another Republican whose journey from anti Trump outraged approach from obscene ... was quite so illogical or half a sad end he suggests that you are auditioning for a play is Jeff Sessions as attorney general you're a sponsor\nA Frank you don't know what you're talking about in your world Frank is a noble cause to the store a judicial candidates whose conservative whether the Thomas ...

made you upset because I Would not want to generalize McCarthyism thing good and I think I can survive and South Carolina [noise]\nWell\nYou know the thing is is that uh I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning\nI'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from uh the uh the outrage that he delivered a there on Capitol Hill that day\nI think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election\nIt needs to be carried through in that attitude needs to be carried through\nA on important things that that ah that matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows what kind of her nomination process we may go through a while a Trump still president but uh you know making some very solid points\nUh the ... was going to you know they used to it when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right or Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president the left one or do you use that and\nAnd and and really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be the bipartisan willing to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was and in some ways he was [noise]\nBut of course you're demonized now you're Hitler because you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly so\nWell you know the thing is and reading Frank Bruni is coming to New York times that none of it relates to the actual case and what he was talking about there it's it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has a differences with Donald Trump right and you know in Trump is you know been in a ... has been meaning to him and called them names and things like that and\nThere's been an animosity between the two and therefore\n[laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking from side with Trump's candidate I mean it seems that really doesn't\nTwo and therefore [laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump's side with Trump's candidate I mean it it seems that really doesn't get what we said earlier\nThis whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump [noise]\nIt really wasn't a a burning doesn't get that and I don't know I I have to go back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump\nOr from Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham's or when he issued his concern that day or a week ago last Thursday [noise]\nIt was based on the lack of merits of the case and that and and on the larger a much to a larger extent are pretty much the treatment of Kavanaugh by\nThe Democrats and and not the not the liberals with the signs outside look through the Democrats on the committee Frank Bruni has nothing\nTo read the article he's got nothing well he's angry he's yeah they're they're their own as I've said we discuss this for the last two and a half weeks [noise]\nWe didn't have any one I have not seen any rational thought or critical thinking statement\nCome from the mainstream media or the Democrats to say that the position that I hold and you hold which wouldn't be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham yeah\nWhere is flawed at all except for rhetoric and bringing up other things that have nothing to do with this case with this nomination process\nWith the witnesses and the allegations that came forward every single point that we have made [noise]\n\nWhich are the same well I can see as Lindsey Graham are all legit and the oldest is going to drive the nuts and moral and correct and rice\nAnd you're wrong and reading Frank Bernie's column in the New York times you're a simple ten Mr Bruni [noise]\nTalk about the actual things that Lindsey Graham brought up go point by point and say any of the things that he said we're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be line that [noise]\n\nThey don't I mean it is again a the [noise]\nThey just lack the will to have the debate they don't have the debate you cannot the debate so they have to step out and ... what Lindsey Graham said on that day so they do what [noise] well they used to be for Trump now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right [noise]\n\nWell from their world absolute loyalty is expecting as we've said in the real world it's I like this candidate for this don't like him for this all the right over there that's a good nominate that's that's a good nomination pick over there I like that I don't like this\nReal people and critical thinking people and people with rational thought Mr Bernie can do that\nI can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed with Lindsey Graham and John might in the future\nYou are you running for attorney general right [laughter] I might add value to general what are you trying to get out of ... ... well that's it he's only doing this well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have as he was against\nYeah he's only doing this ... well again that's because you can't debate the points that he made the only point you have is he was against Trump and now he's\nFor Trump we we've said with the simple ten you know a an argument that will never\nAnd I called them simple and arguments because they never directly go after the the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always try to bring up side issues that aren't aren't even a pertinent to what you're discussing right\nAnd you read British telling me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing Trump's fought to become attorney general yeah\nYou know evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because he was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with Trump's you must always disagree with Trump which of course is aguaje\nYes [noise] that it it it is the insanity of the left and and again\nAh they the ... ... it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the side that had the greater intellect [laughter] I don't I don't try and tell you that they are no they don't but it is the ... they keep going for the low hanging fruit\nBand and the and and really the brunt of the argument right now is well he's just trying to get something out of Trump or he used to hate Trump and now he likes

... or ... or ... whatever his name is uh I think that men do some I think that may slogan\nUm maybe there's something there maybe there's the they've already heard from judge ... or ... or is lawyers but certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is factors that he would have a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but\nUm he would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was was was made public\nA through this was with the leak and everything else ah that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the leaked to the media and all of that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting you the names were brought out as a result of the leak\nFord as far as we know she didn't leak it\nSo if that if that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it because what responsibility do they have\nIn a case they're trying to ... by ... by mark judge and or his lawyers whoever leads to the media would also be partially responsible or for getting his name out\nThere and that you could see I think ... part of that and you have in any case there that was that was him yes you have any ... eliminate because it's likely to get the of the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yet right right\nRight the only possibility of backlash when I'm ... years he wouldn't want to put his good buddy ... they're already\nSee Ryan is yeah yeah you know got tempered problems and I wouldn't want them to think that there was a destroyed theirs in spite of yours was voted to do this for a spy and\n[noise] yeah well they you know it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out\nUh in every a predictable and even some are unpredictable ways we can we can try and come to use our imagination to come up with things and and thank you I'm ready for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question\nUh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process\nUh you you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination\nA as a captain Kavanaugh did and and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of a mark judge or that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden\nBut you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that that survived at all\nWas Dr forge claim and and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further [noise]\nSo that's why I and and I think can make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so she wasn't trying to link it to the ... a a media but in the ad in any case yeah\nTo me that would even be a ... and again I don't know who leaked and so I I don't know I'm just I'm On the doctor or right I'm just using right that that is a possible exception here right ah but with the other any case to me that's clear that what I mean it\nGoing going after Kavanaugh with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time right and there are public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm spiking drinks you know things like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out and print that right ... and say that about people right especially private citizens mhm\nThat says then you've got to make your case and say where's the probable cause while I think it might have happened\nThat's not good enough no no absolutely not so I I like to just to having any personally [noise]\nWell I mean well because [laughter]\nNo absolutely not so I I like to just do ... personally\nWell I mean well because I work the came the claims that were carried out and how he pursued this\nWhat role did he play in pursuing this in the media\nAll out we're not going to hell whoa whoa where's the perjury potty approved the perjury\n[noise] how do you prove the perjury prime well you know ... if you don't want to take that one how 'bout Dianne Feinstein\nWell okay well I Know how my ... well my point is legal point by point by what you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next and on if you're not going to charge for who's the next one [noise]\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with it would she has a spy on a at a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with a would share the spy on a as a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe\nThat yes of course right I I I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree\nWith you on that and I believe that I'm not in their problem is they're they're ... I Believe they are promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make that charge very kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\nOne that's Iran says I've followed that wasn't Republicans fault no\nThat was the only guy that was combing who clearly was politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats just stop doing any of\nThese you know with I don't know what it did get them but what does this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen massive loss\nIt is but because the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody in elected office would bring these up these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe've set about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with ah with Hillary or even back to lying about bin ... which was an intern of itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email or investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would uh prosecuted\nWe said well it what matters years the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November or twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call it is not always that that and not that she's above the law\nOr we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice\nHaving her in jail or is not as great as not having her in the White House\nYou know here's here's the uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding area and sparks Nevada was responding to\nWhen we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened\nBut he said she said a of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level\nOf perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness stating she's lying about it right uh you know or it was you know you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of wins you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm\nUh and and so my point was I I don't know the doctor Ford situation\nIs there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah or any things in the room because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can collaborate it so we don't know what she what she wants her it's proving it\nAnd and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen\nUh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't\nAh when the seats that they should be winning a in a first term of a president in the first midterm afterwards that almost always the party in power loses seats ... that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was\nAh was confirmed ... ah and United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always\nAh and United a pretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though are and Clinton as we explained Clinton was in the Republicans [noise]\nSo if you're angry that justice isn't always done [noise] all I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there that's that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged with because there's a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty would wander charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion [noise]\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted mhm [noise]\nAnd [noise] so the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary\n[noise] a worry we know um [noise]\nOf his bumping gossipy for example Susan Rice sure why we laugh when you said she said you know the ... that she would like to ... she would consider running against colon somebody gives me you're on the line item on big ... no it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line\nAbout a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone\nIn the United states knows its ally for everyone in the United states you could take them and you can show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you could read the law and and everybody would agreement that's what she did and they would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with that can't do anything about it the best\nThat we can hope for in any thing is that the truth is tolls and I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right [noise]\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption it's now and the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to relieve some of this information and ah so we're going to give it to Michael I have an eddy we went that doesn't make much ... we're going to give it to Michael Horowitz\nFrom I don't give it to my ... like they don't have the [laughter] whatever you do\nGive it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went Doug ... is it doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to\nOh wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption more improprieties oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story has been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not released it immediately\nAnd give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption [noise]\nAnd so we don't know what's gonna happen there but get us the truth and at the American people if they get the truth and still decided to do the wrong thing that's on them\nAnd that's that that's really what it comes down to is that ah we've been calling for transparency on on all of it [noise] the whole Russians scandal thing\nWe've set multiple times\nAs long as that is fully transparent and the process the American people can decide [noise] up because we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it [noise]\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really want an investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want\nFrom three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this is this will play out in the public\nOver and over and over for a

couple of days and then\nMoving up over south and North Carolina and then back out over water according to the current track and uh they just updated that a little while ago or so or they could it could have wins somewhere in the eighty mile an hour range of of the time it's a makes landfall there in Florida\nA year and a couple of days and then diminishing of overland as they always do they expect it could be a category too though but yeah it hits the well and and that's it it is right now the the forecast of course as they always do kind of change going back and forth and\nSo we'll follow it as in fact the John Will uh in our forecast is for on the trucks here's your national forecast\nCleanup continues in the south after one of the most devastating storm systems to ever hit the U.S we are looking at again today for clear skies in the region\nThe Florida Panhandle the big band in fact uh the entire Gulf Coast from the tip of Texas all the way over to southern Florida looks to

and southern Indiana along the Ohio River bend as you move into Ohio we get a little break but\nThen in northern Ohio around Cleveland up through eerie PA and portions of northern Pennsylvania into

should be motivating to every Republican I I Believe it is but I think\nUh in in hearing uh the Lindsey Graham talk about the the campaigning you'll do and some of those purple states over the next few weeks to remind people that kind of campaigning has\nTo be done not just leading up to the mid term but after the midterm and beyond the Republicans as we've been calling them out for many years on his program need to do a better job of spelling out exactly what the left is doing and reminding the public what the left is doing a ...\nYou don't have to ... you don't have to use the hyperbole your show exactly what they were doing you demonstrated as one caller said you know just ... just play some of you know their antics in their own words as we've been saying for years so that for a year yeah and and and and just demonstrate that\nOver and over and over again and how hurtful and destructive it is to this country or for about the last ... who I'm\nGoing to say six seven eight years you and I have been saying that it's never been easier to defend the conservative\nIdeology in our in our lifetime\nThey've been saying that it's never been easier to defend the conservative ideology in our in our lifetime because of where the left has gone I guess I can also say that it's never been it's never been easier\nTo run a negative ad campaign with\nWithout having to be crude or rude yourselves all you have to do is play the audio of your opposition and that accomplishes that in itself\nYou don't have to add on to anything from what we have seen\nThe last two weeks you don't have to be as a Republican you don't have to be caught in any on troops right all you have to do is point out the truth of where now and this is very very important [noise]\nWhere the main stream of the Democratic party is now not the fringe but the main stream and I think that one of the things that\nI have seen a and it's anecdotal evidence or to ... to to figure out what all the the the the polls mean and how it's going to apply in four weeks I don't know but the one thing that I've gotten from independence\nIs they look at the Democratic party right now and they say oh my God\nWhat in the world are these people about there is no sense of of fairness there is no sense of stability for they don't ... they don't care about you know are taking ... taking somebody and destroying their life and and\nI mean I've heard this from from independence on both sides and that they destroyed forests life by not keeping it secret then they went on to try to ... to destroy a cabinet all his life on both sides you said it\nSeems like the only thing that matters we don't care who's live we destroy we don't care what promises we break we don't care what we do we don't care whether we don't care about a presumption of innocence we don't care about giving you anonymity we just want to win\nAnd we will do anything to when we will demean we won't play fair and I do think\nThat there is something here that is even outside of the normal politics that we go through every day that this isn't going to be a discussion if this goes in favor of Republicans\nThat that which means you're going to get a lot of independents that that moved in the Republican you know direction\nIt's going to be not be because of ... okay we'll ... we'll gr search and cabinet do when it comes to regulations of the EPA\nNow it may matter to you but I don't think that's what's going to drive in I think it's going to drive it is the very clear drama that we have gone through over the last two weeks where people look at the Democratic party and say\nThese aren't fair people these are reasonable people\nRight and I think is you look at a cut to be honest with you the protesters may be driving the left but they're driving away mainstream America [noise]\nThe left or may think that they're winning because the protestors are out there getting the attention for them\nAnd that they're they're jumping on and in some cases they're bandwagon and their claims the fact of the matter is\nThat's not the case with middle America they see the behavior of the protest it's not to dismiss a claim it is in fact to do exactly what was done in this case and to properly vet a claim to the X.\nIt's in fact to do exactly what was done in this case and to properly\nVet a claim to the extent that the president came out and ordered a seven background checks and that Grassley gave Dr Ford her time on TV in front of the American people to make her case you know something\nYou just part of a good point there because I when when I was giving my explanation there I wasn't even talking about the protesters you brought up the protesters and I think the unique thing that we've gotten to the point now where there's no difference in in many of the public's mind between the protesters and the mainstream right politicians they're saying the exact same thing just\nThey're saying that it's it's not like you can sit there and say well those are just a crazy protesters now because the crazy protesters and the Democrat leadership of the Senate Judiciary committee or using the same argument\nYes they are they're basically ... the the arguments and and claims made by these protesters and their tactics I mean look at even before we got to Dr Ford hearing the doctor forty hearing
