the the entire ah\nThe entire story shows where\nThe law was broken so we'll get to that coming up here just a little bit students demand a professor be fired at three promotes due process under the law\nOr best headline of the day unless this one ... floods wildfires yet you candidates are running on climate change all of that one on Amazon to pay Fifteen bucks an hour that seem to be a big story yesterday went to that what happened to the price of documents story and a Russian collusion\nBecause that story just has been buried since I don't remember that one what was that throughout well it it's any and I said nobody has has covered it and ... and we did all I think about a week ago we we brought it up we said oh so Trump decided not to release it but\nHe didn't go to the he didn't go to his ... director of intelligence\nAbout the uh the information whether she'll be declassified he went to the inspector general we don't go to the inspector general for declared the class to buy something you go to the inspector general and give something because you perceived there might be corruption and what you have mhm recover electronics user forecast\nIt may not sound like much that an area could get six inches of rainfall and be under flash flood watches and warnings but that's what we have over the next couple of days in effect for multiple states including California Arizona Nevada\nUtah Colorado and Idaho where even six to ten inches of rain is enough to dislodge Sandy soil rocks and tree limbs and flood dry creek that all due to the remains from tropical storm Rosa\nYou'll need the wipers heavy rain on I've forty I ten I Seventeen from Phoenix up to a forty\nWe know what they used you know the the Pfizer warned and all that ... well so we wanted well wait a minute says make sense if you don't give it to the inspector general the inspector general only looks at corruption and\nA\nAnd by the way that's almost a replay of what happened I think maybe it was a ... a week ago Monday or writers down we brought it up yeah because there were just other things and we just started going over and we went we don't understand why would you give it to the inspector general the inspector general ... you know you get this information at some redacted you're looking at it\nAnd and and ah all of a sudden oh the light bulb goes off it would be an internal\nMatter which would be in a scenario like this if it is a fact that people\nAt the Justice Department are under and the Obama administration\nWere more working to get information and use that false information\nThat dust\nAh to get a warrant knowingly using it to get a fries award then that would be corruption that would be abuse of power that would be a massive\nWell it it leads to the the the claim a from Rudy Giuliani mhm that ah the he believes they committed perjury right yes that they that they they ... they sign documents stating that this information is intelligence\n... you know a opposition research and I was and they knew that it was an intelligence and they vouched for its up until ... often to study our credibility in and and you know again that's what Giuliani and said we don't know but it only goes to the inspector general\nIf they believe people there because I work with begins at ... that was what happened right then than it would start inside the Justice Department with American people reaching out to go in this case you know Christopher Steele or an impossible you know we don't know if there was anybody else involved we do know he was involved but\nBut if if you if you do the unwritten action and and they're saying well it's too sensitive well that would be again\nThe director of national intelligence your ah your attorney general in the head of the FBI or foreign powers and so you wouldn't be going in that particular direction and probably\nYou will be discussing it especially with my palm pale secretary of state former CIA director and say okay you need to talk to the British are because we need to get this a release you know what do they want to keep quiet and not that that may not be\nThat that could be being done right now we don't know or could have been done already\nBut to say I'm giving it to the inspector general to look at it look at why\nInspector general only looks and corruption right they look at corruption in the department he's looking for corruption in the department of justice that's what his job is his job is not to declassify it's not just job is not to look at\nA a document say wow I don't think you should declassify in and that was the impression that you got when the story first came out\nIt's like oh wait a minute he's inspector general under that right\nOh mhm\nSo after they earn redacted\nApparently someone in the administration looked at it and said this is corruption given to the inspector\nGeneral because that's because that's what you would look at it in the in the inspector general is basically a there to investigate what happened in in the Justice Department I mean that's the whole purpose of that position to do that essentially that internal\nAh investigation have the the inspector general's office really as internal affairs or you know to a large degree so when and\nAnd it when they saw that its I could see General Kelly looking at the president and saying Mr President\nIf you come out and point things out that's going to be purely political right so it only has you know there's we we have to build a political will to go after people if the inspector general\nComes out with an official report that's different not that the president and the end and uh the AG sessions couldn't go after people for this\nIt's that it would start in the political arena if you have this over to the inspector general who was appointed by Obama this is the process by the way if if you look at a you know the things that Trump has done\nNot talking about you know the things about uh the licensing for the NFL or or or licensing for the media the FCC licenses for the media or any of that not not the words not what he said but what he has done he's been very respectful of the process and this would be the process you would want to go through\nTo see that have the inspector general\nLook at it and say please take a look at this and and do your due diligence here to see if this is exactly if if it's what we see\nThen you noticed the media you know you had some what websites covered I didn't even see Fox\nIt's exactly if if it's what we see and then you'd notice the media you know you had some what websites covered I didn't even see Fox saying why the inspector general for how they somebody may have done it I've not seen it and I haven't seen it on their website right but I haven't seen really anything maybe a maybe a\nA you know National Review covered it the federalist I don't uh you know I Andrew McCarthy did I but I didn't see it right but it just the media went completely quiet on it but the other thing that I noticed was\nThat the new has like a couple of days after said I don't know why they didn't release it I don't know understand why I went to the inspector general and all of a sudden everything's gone quiet on that front to everything that you haven't heard from Jim Jordan you haven't heard from a ... noon as a in over a week on it saying well look we need to get this stuff released why\nBecause if it goes to the inspector general they're looking at corruption\nAnd what what would the corruption be if it's about the Pfizer warrant and the text messages and everything in the upper management of the FBI and the department of justice there's only one thing that it could be because that's what they were under adapting and that would be corruption inside of the department of justice\nAnd the FBI and maybe some of the intelligence agencies and and what they did but specifically for the inspector general it would be at the department of justice and the FBI corruption that's what it would be looking at this\nAnd so yeah one so we put two and two together a little over a week ago it was like oh\nAnd there's been nothing on this story and other media the media\nIs gone quiet on the ... higher Russian collusion narrative\n\nThink about it I mean I Know right now the focus cap and all but you know they're they're very capable of a walking and chewing gum at the same climate when it comes to going out at a drop\nThe New York times brought up his family tax yes exactly why not collusion oh where's that story\nBut that's a great point you made is you know he's going through the process and if you look at it and they ... somebody said look if you release this then they're just gonna say you're cherry picking and you're interpreting I don't know what you're saying you're interpreting something here that really doesn't exist here you go to the inspector general\nNobody's going to debate the inspector general no not even not even the the Democrats he was appointed by Obama right Michel Horwitz was right so you go to him and he then and he does it which is the proper process to do with it that way you take the political aspect out of it right\nAnd especially right now if you look at okay all the claims that well this would be a disruptive of the of the more investigation\nAnd you know the president that actually you know acknowledge those claims but\nAll of that's taken off the table when it's when horror which takes the investigation themselves all of those claims go away\nBecause Horwitz will you know even though you know the president want want this done a ... in an expedited manner Horwitz will\nDo his due diligence that's his job to go through this and determine if there was any corruption [noise] if you want to get and we do have a line open eight six six Ninety ride I\nThought you were told that it's a ... movie wrote a [noise]\nListen to

out on the boat talk and he remembered twenty seven years ago he put two and two together that I put him in jail for carrying an unlawful weapon he could remember that he decided he needed to leave the group and come back home\nThe man remembered that because that was a defining moment in his lap and all I'm trying to say is this woman if that had been such a defining moment in her life she she can remember that that was Kavanaugh one hundred percent on top of her\nShe cannot tell us how she got to the party how she got home\nAnd you know if it was such a defining moment in her life how did you get home where was this house\nThat would be things you would think a person would remember if it's such a defining moment and now all of a sudden it's his last move the goal post maybe she did maybe she didn't but this man has been nothing but exempt or his whole lives\nAnd for the presumption of innocence to be just thrown out the window by the Democrats are just crazy to me\nYeah I mean that's part of the the weakness as we said nobody is just credible or non credible let's see you have to take it you know based on the evidence that exist and their testimony and when the ... or whether the testimony that they give especially when it comes to these witnesses notice they were there ... and when those witnesses or act in the ass and say\nSorry we weren't there don't know about it at all and even one of her friends at that point your credibility starts falling apart and when do I don't know the where the win or the house\nOf everything surrounding it yet you are a hundred percent sure of the PRP or that at that point you have problems\nYes you do have credibility problems in any case they might not just this case in any case you would have complete and total credibility problems which is what the prosecutor said yes and this is what it comes down to is is uh can you put a case together based on\nAll of the evidence and and it does again it's not a criminal case so it doesn't rise to those standards\nBut it would be very different if there were a number of people let's say even two or three other people\nThat were at that party or had a\nFirst hand some kind of first hand knowledge of that event and their stories mimic what she was saying\nNow you still go through that process and you which is exactly what the FBI is doing has been doing since last friday\nOr Saturday but this is what you this is the process of building that case well who cases not even if you look at her claim it's not being backed up by anything except Democrats take it and run with it saying I Believe her and you see the goalposts moving now is that\nThat has to be brought up because just like the fact that\nWhen you used in say these are the witnesses these people witness it and they say no and then you say I took a polygraph a test will have you ever helped anybody else take a polygraph test you know and and you know trying to beat is what they're trying to say\nNo I never did well when you get a sworn witness dating nope I Know she I I you know I Know she did well then you want all relevant notes because she is using the she is using\nThe polygraph as\nCooperation that there is credibility tour accusation therefore she should be willing to give everything over to the Senate Judiciary committee so they can verify\nThat the lie detector test was done in a legit way right\nAnd and and that's again part of the process because if you believe it was legit you're promoting it as legitimate then you have no problem you're telling the truth right and the process\nWas done thoroughly\nThoughtfully and in order to get the results that it was always going to get because she was always telling the truth right\nHer attorneys on Tuesday in Florida the FBI to interview her and act on investigative leaves leads they have provided for its inquiry into sexual misconduct\nAllegations against Brett Kavanaugh quoted is inconceivable that the FBI would conduct a thorough investigation of Dr Ford's allegations without interviewing her\nJudge Kavanaugh or the witnesses we have identified in the letters to you attorneys are debris cats and Michael Brown which wrote to top the FBI officials and our letter obtained by political\nUh again it's not an investigation about this is the whole point in and look I even said that the other day I said well now that they're doing this you know they'll probably talked with the end\nAnd also ... wait a minute when I saw the story yesterday said wait a minute no they won't they well they if they don't I understand why they would not because it's not they're not investigating the crime they're doing\nOn Kavanaugh and so what they're doing is they're not going after they're not from they may not be going to her or Kavanaugh to get their statements because they have their statements\nBy the way there is they don't get to know the the the attorneys her attorneys\nDon't get to know who they're going to ... who the FBI interviews or who they don't\nIncluding people that they say they told the FBI they directed they say they directed the FBI to interview other people associated with is\nThe happy I may be doing that but the FBI doesn't have to contact her lawyers and confirmed that they're doing that right that this is not about her this is a background check on Capitol\nIt's about her claim\nBut she is not this is not about getting her any kind of justice she does there there is a no there is no right for them to be a part of the process\nIt for them to be included or directing the process\nI Know they think that because they were able to manipulate Capitol Hill into giving them their day in front of the camera but that's not how it works with a background check process you may we may not ever know\nThe American people may not know cabinet or may not know\nWho they talked to who they interview and and political here I'm renting from\nKeeps using investigation it's not an investigation it's a background\nCheck as a timeframe for completion of the inquiry draws near Ford's attorney ... call later Tuesday with beer officials to discuss the investigation\nYou don't get to do that and it's not an investigation it's a background check\nAnd it's not about her it's not about Dr Ford it's not about it's about the claim but she does not there is no there is nothing they're going to deliver she's not going to get another day in court this this is not a criminal legal process she doesn't get a copy of the background\nCheck up only the senators do that's right and uh as well while McConnell Bob and only centers will be able to look at the FBI's final\nUh findings ... minority leader Chuck Schumer pressed for the public release other redacted version of the report but Republicans are worried about breaking precedent by releasing such information they don't release information from a background\nWrite I write a which will be made public available to the Senate the before the Senate votes this week on Kavanaugh's nomination according to GOP leaders all one hundred senators will have access to the report\nAnd a secure studying for the FBI releases it as when he expects the report into multiple sexual misconduct claims against Kavanaugh to be completed he said I think it will be sooner than friday but I don't have\nA an exact date by the way we will find out what's in it because you'll have a Democrat Senator I'm almost positive release something or half or a partial part of the transcript that would be damning ... uh you know to a to a cabin on in the context of not the complete\nParagraph or sentence or whatever right uh and then it would force the Republicans to ah you know released the holding released the entire thing so um\n\nLet's see [noise]\n\nI think you're going to see likely are either because if the investigation as as the report came out late in the day on Tuesday that the investigation is winding down then by the way down ... ...\nCame out late in the day on Tuesday but the investigation is winding down\nThen by the way down to ... ... yes [laughter] thank you well know but we know but my point is white but they're the record right investigations are technically I was correct but yes as as the reports came out and that's that's exactly how everyone is raising it yes\nAnd he joined it's a criminal investigation and it's not it's ... ... because that's what they wanted they wanted the criminal investigation that was never going to happen it was never going to happen but keep in mind there they are they they were given a clear directive and and go on in terms of the timeline\nYou've got to get it done in seven days so of course\nIf it's done let's say the the interviews are done or the report still has to be written so imagine that the that that the interviews are are winding down now and and maybe only a few more to do on Wednesday than the paperwork has to be done to submit the report\nAnd that likely will take what I at least a day\nAnd they all were then we ... we we've been told that they can get it on early as today later on today yeah\nWell if you have multiple people talking about it there would be one person one lead likely at the FBI\nThat would compile all of what the different ages bound because it's not just one agent and it's not just in one town in fact that that they're doing these interviews so it's it's all over the country depending on where those subjects of those interviews are\nBut the point being is that that it's likely one lead that's going to compile all those and it's likely a series of reports of the interviews and that's it would be a it would probably just be transcripts of the interview\nAnd and then a summary on each other\nAnd then the the lead would be responsible for summarized in the entire report I guess I'm guessing if you want to get in lines are open now eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\n... radio sold for ...

Bush\nAnd they wanted to you know they wanted him to own it completely because everything was Bush's fault remember\nBut Robert ... started before that but then ... rhinos became the swamp yes but rhinos in the swamp was\nWhen ... were really came to the fruition especially when McConnell in pain or they were saying we're tough enough in the budget when you look at you know twenty twelve twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen the Republicans were furious and conservatives still had a solid hold of the Republican Party that's gone when that was it that ah that that that\nAh Paul Ryan proposed the balancing the budget and it would have taken until twenty thirty\nOh that that was a that would have been a pretty that out that well that right now it would have been the it was the the summer of the the whole camp it was the summer when\nYou know a of of ah twenty ... well okay it was the summer's springs ... so it was before this one and two of election right yeah All right so you have that scenario and he was called a radical\nYou know for wanting to balance the budget by twenty thirty right\nI mean that was oh no no no that's that's unacceptable now we give the president credit\nOr in fact I I think that falls on his shoulders the credit for getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one because you and I thought that was never going to have right based on the rhinos on Capitol Hill and the fact that they couldn't get it\nRight but but that tax cuts have never been the it's always been the spending ... rhino when the swamp had was always directed at the out of control spending in Washington not necessarily the belief in tax cuts and that was released\nAnger and created the rhino when the swamps the spending the spending ... from the the campaigning on twenty sixteen\n... no ... even earlier than that remember you know you and I sitting here late at night when painter came out and they were trying to shut down the government uh uh uh uh again in the shootout down the shutdowns of never been about tax cuts the shutdowns within about\nSpending and and when the Republicans wouldn't stand up to the Democrats you're right they were called ... recalled the swamp Trump was coming in to get rid of the swamp stop the spending to stop the sound and even\nGoing back to the the uh the school lunch program you know and the rhinos back then going oh no we can't cut anything\n... and so when you're that goes back he's so much for when you got twenty Fifteen\nAnd you know and and a banner was leaving and and Ryan was coming in debate or didn't like messy so he went to work for a tobacco company right and so Ryan came in and and ... remember that but the thing was the everybody expected Ryan Republicans\n... maybe it was unfair but it was what they expected of Brian was to redo the budget deal and when he said nope what's been done has done he\nWas automatically targeted oh yeah people were furious because ... they wanted him out of the speaker of these are the supporters of of the the the president back then\nFurious they wanted him out Trump's gotta Khamenei has got to clear the rhinos out the swamp out we've got to cut spending liquor we are today and so there's been a huge evolution of the Republican Party\nIn in just a you know roughly ah three years in his late ... remember\nLate go back to twenty twelve why was Paul Ryan brought onto the Romney ticket for conservative street cred\nRemember and the concern with Romney was that he was too much of a moderate it was our final question to ah the light of Andrew Breitbart\nYou know why should this if he's the nominee 'cause it was that was still early but it but if Romney's the nominee and it it looked at that point potentially he was going to you know that\nI think it it was pretty obvious by that point [noise] but he was going to become the nominee but if he is why why should you back on him and his answer basically was ... because Scott ... which by the way rings so true right now does today as thank you Andrew Breitbart for those words\nBut I think it's important but yeah I mean look at history and and see what Ryan when swamp was about it wasn't about tax cuts was everything on ... being a rhino and Vina but now it's changed mhm\nBut back three years ago yeah swamp of the state now but yeah a swamp as deep state a swamp is what's going on right now in the Senate Judiciary committee with the Democrats yeah it's sort of been moved over ... nobody's viewing McCotter right now\nAs part of the swamp well I don't know man he was a Republican leadership right as part of the swamp if they had done if they had spent and and agreed to a budget\nThat they did this year and last year\n[laughter] three years ago\nThese are Trump supporters would have been absolutely up in arms these guys gotta go not a peep right that shows you the evolution it's look I'm not making a judgment here this is just an observation of where the Republican Party has gone you know or you know were against the spending but this is not about opinion I'm not criticizing this is just the analysis of\nWhat those terms meant that three years ago\nAnd the fact that the definition has evolved completely inside the Republican Party inside the Republican mindset and this is a Republican voter\nI don't necessarily blame those in Congress and even the president\nYou know when they talked about your we're going to cut we're going to cut we're going to cut as to where they are today because they're simply reflecting where the Republican Party where the rank and file voter has gas\nIf there were pressure that there were pressure right now\nOn spending on Obamacare and all\nIf there were pressure at their pressure right now\nOn spending on Obamacare and all of it it would have been done\nAll of that would have been done it would've been a priority\nAnd the president's not wrong for focusing on national security and and border control\nBut it's part of the again where's the mindset of the voter that's the question the mindset of the voters that now we don't really want all of Obamacare to go away\nWe just want the penalty to go away\nAnd we should look at the ... look look at the polling from five years ago\nOr until they were discussing it last year and you could see the ... I mean you could see the difference overwhelming yeah they were against Obamacare and then when it came to getting rid of Obamacare was the we need to get rid of the taxes and the mandates not the benefits we like yes\nWell as long as as long as you're there you're never going to control spending ... ever and you're not going to control debt and that's where the mindset of the country is right now how you respond as a politician to that\nTo do the right thing and be fiscally responsible I don't think it's possible right now no\nBecause there was no ... there's no ... there's a small core as well what are we identified a senator and a half [laughter] yeah right that might be concerned about it and maybe twenty to thirty\nRepublicans in Congress outside of that you you there's no base to even start from now the conservatives don't control the party you know eight six six Ninety ride I\nThought we were told that ... maybe ...

have culture and then\nAnd then you move on to the vote you know two days later so it's not like you can uh you have closure and then all of a sudden you can instantly do a vote doesn't work that

puts it ah as early as\nFriday if it were to happen today\nOr as many of already said over ah the last few days that they could see a vote on the Senate for you know Saturday or even Sunday\nWhich would still give time ah to the president if if he is confirmed Kavanaugh's confirmed to uh uh to have him sworn in and and then said it on the bench on Monday having only missed the first week of

Ford's lawyer requesting more information specifically Grassley wants the therapist\nOr ... or the therapists notes all audio or video recordings produced during the course of the polygraph examination of Dr Ford\nAnd all written and the audio visual or any other documentation of talking to any other reporter or anyone else at any media organization\nHe's asked for that before my question is if the Senate committee officially asks\nHer for that because that really was that was presented as evidence\n\nExcept for they didn't get to scrutinize the methodology of it it was just the results right the results being presented as part of the evidence\nWill now that she has testified in front of the Senate because at first Grassley asked it before she testified buddies they're just the Senate have the power to subpoena those\nThose are those documents\nI mean is it binding legally I guess is my question now that she's testified because that's where the official claim\nIs made\nIn regards to the Senate committee and consideration for Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court justice\nSo would that not be part of the legal process are her lawyers legally bound to turn that over\n\nI don't know I I didn't see anybody right it that way I'm just asking a question but I Would think because it's part of the process and they presented the results as part of the evidence\nThan they would be compelled to turn that information over\nSo I don't know at at an interesting point I don't know I ... yeah I don't know that either\nI don't want to do it though because it's different before she testified and that's the first time you asked for I'm just talking about just the the lie detector test ... ah the audio or video any any audio or video related to it um\nBecause as as they as she officially basically and then under oath\nShe testified in and use that as part of the evidence he's still requesting it hasn't gotten and hasn't gotten it I\nWonder if they're just delaying or you know if they believe that they delayed long enough that the vote will get through this whole thing goes away I don't know that they're legally compelled to or not I'm not sure I'm just asking the

all the same or if it even a throws more suspicion at Dr Ford's testimony a at that point you have a boat this weekend and you move on from it now will they continue the investigation of find son I think they should as to whether she liked it because that's about Senate rules incentive protocol\nSo I I Believe that that will go on a will they\nUh you know if if they believed they could get\nA a a a Dr Ford on perjury or suspect that they could if they investigated more will they\nContinue that I don't know I I Would doubt it I think that if they get if they get the vote and he is you know they get to vote in he's in he's confirmed I think that's the end of it because to me I think that's Republicans review that as the the victory for I'm attracts here's your forecast\nIt may not sound

California Arizona Nevada Utah Colorado and Idaho where even six to ten inches of rain is enough to dislodge Sandy soil\nAnd that's how we could as anybody knows what you accuse me\nBecause you think about it the accusation\nActually as as Ben extent expanded because they're not just attempted assault but because she claim or that or I Can't think of the other man's name I'm\nMark judge was there that none of that's almost an attempt to gang rape isn't it right and then the game right Alex ... you know allegations came along so you sit there and you see a a cabin on as we talked\nAbout he was

senators\nIn the in the Judiciary Committee\nLooking at you and saying I Believe her which means they're accusing view of sexual assault\nAn allegation alone that's a personal attack on you as an individual but still that's all they have a boat it was on professional yeah 'cause you're running out\nOf any type of argument\nTo defend\nThe person that you were hoping\nCould ensure that cabinet members serves on the Supreme Court\nThe United states we know what it's about we know what is what it's always been about I just wonder what happens\nIf you get to the point where are we know I mean after the ... and I don't know is the FBI 'cause we we asked you know where's the FBI going with this background check are they going to talk to forge old boyfriend\nAnd forwards or old boyfriend identified a a forge a girl friend identified her by name\nA ... as saying she told this woman I'll help you with ... and show you how in I'll help you with a a a how to beat a lie detector test will they can find that woman\nAnd I said earlier she's alive the reason I said that as she can only be a witness who she's alive but if she's alive and they find her\nAnd she's willing to testify and she says yeah I mean under oath yeah she\nCharge everything falls apart it's already all of these cases are falling at every day another layer is being peeled from these allegations against Kavanaugh [noise] I I think right now and again\nYou know I don't know the answer the question I asked earlier about her lawyers being compelled to ah to forward that information and materials that\nAre Chuck Grassley a cold for bought assume that's not the case and they're not legally compelled to do so even still they would resist doing it uh I think they're going to resist whether they are legally compelled compelled or not but the\nThey're likely doing that why\nWell because if if she's telling the truth during the lie detector test which they say I mean that's the whole point of all I did check protest is that you passed it\nExcept there were different questions\nIf they asked a different question and she answered that question truthfully she would pass a\n\nVideo and audio the methodology of that test is important\n\nAnd so if you use that as part of the proof to cooperate that it did happen you weren't telling other people because it doesn't cooperate the crime no it just it it just and we can't even get to the point\nOf her the ... the the what she says his cooperation that she had been talking about this like she won't even let that evidence be seen all that evidence the scene which is\nSorry the therapists knows you brought it up you use that as evidence yeah so you've been talking about it like you said you said certain things but you have been released\nEverything that the therapist has sorry when you make the accusation and you say this is what backs up not the crime because you have nothing to cooperate the crime so you're you came in with your lawyers as the secondary\nA point you were going to make well maybe you know where that hoping that the witness was my cooperate you and they didn't\nSo your second point was but I've been talking about it for years and that should give me credibility and you won't release that evidence to the people who\nAre the judges in this case mhm well then you lose even more credibility and that's why when they say she's credible when the members of the Democrat Senate ... Judiciary Committee say she's credible or you can't make that case because on every single instance when you want to get to the credibility by getting more evidence that she actually has\nHer lawyers refused to hand it over\nBecause if she is telling the truth and has been all along why would he refused to hand it over in fact why would you not voluntarily handed over without being asked because here's the proof here's everything you need to know\nHere are my notes\nAre here the therapists notes here are here is the audio\nAnd or video\nFrom the lie detector test you would be out to prove that this happened isn't she out to prove it happened\nYeah well you you're going to hand over everything voluntarily why with her lawyers not encourage her to do that listen Dr Ford this is going to vindicate you this is going to show\nWhy would you not be doing that\nAt least it sets a at least it sets a pat\nWhat's the ... have it's it's the most evidence that you had that you even talking about it yes and you decided to use you and your large decided to use it as evidence yet you won't present all of the evidence it helps to build your case but it doesn't work that way right\nStarted to use it as evidence yet you won't present all of the evidence it helps to build your case but it doesn't work that way right you are a case to begin with that would give you a little path\nTo go down and you're saying no sorry you can't have that I mean you would have you would\nWant to provide everything that was within your control to provide\nWhat the other people say in terms of people corroborating her story or or or or not that's on them you can't can you can't compel them to a testify or you can't compel them a Dr Ford can't her lawyers can't compel them to talk to the FBI or any of that\nBut what they can do what is in within their control is turning over every piece of evidence that you have\nIn your control and why would you not do that that helps to build your case you write Gary doesn't prove anything but if your\nDoctor forced position you're looking to be vindicated and showed that this happened because you're\nBeing criticized and your credibility has been criticized all along the way you have not proven your case you would want to turn that over\nThere if you're telling the truth you would want to turn over everything that you have it's everything within your power and that's it that it's all you have but it would be your your best attempt at being believed here\nI I I really believe that uh that I well I think if I was a betting man that the odds that the reason that\nForged lawyers want her to talk to the FBI again is because she's going to remember people more witnesses here and and I think that we're ... too because we're ... said well we directed the FBI to more witnesses out there because the whole point is to extend\nYes yeah even like the witnesses okay right we can do it while you have to talk to those because on the up y'all come back and say well\nWe had to look let's come back right away to limitation we couldn't find these people well then we can vote on it until we find all these people to find out because they claim that I have additional witnesses and the whole thing is just keep extending this week in and week out again what get it\nOut and said on Sunday night on ... on sixty minutes forget what they said about we think this is fair the week you know the the FBI or what they called investigation is the one week we believe is fair\nYeah I I don't expect that position to hold if indeed you start it comes back and it does not a show anything different than what we already know right\nBut I Do think that that's what's going on is they want you know they're ... 'cause the remembers is or what we wanted them to some new witnesses out there and some new people to talk to and I bet you that's why Ford's lawyers want her to talk oh there are I I just remembered more witnesses to this whole thing this ... and then you have to start the investigation over again\nAnd then while the FBI needs to work on this another week and investigate these people or do a background check on these people to and you just keep extending it to look I Do not think that the goal post at all have been invented into any type of concrete that is going to settle in the next week right\nYeah I I just don't think we're going to see anything or change nothing is going to be there\nEight six six Ninety ... what's the difference between standard number two diesel and premium fuel run Justin is director of product management for cynics the makers of ... wrote master ... sell premium diesel fuel and he's still listen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "03"}
