I ... I was back in New York and went to church my parents so yeah just blew me away this whole thing as you and\nKnow what I watched a while we were on a break recently I've watched the movie a spotlight\nA that was the movie on the Boston Globe you know they have their their spotlight division for many years and they did the basically the expos they there are in in Boston and the the process of kind of following that you know through the years\nThe synagogue shooter was was talking on you know Fox News saying I didn't even have a new there was no clue that this guy was it was a white supremacist I I didn't know and I wish there was a way to\nYou know to tell I Wish there was a way how do you know what's even in a person's heart I mean maybe ... people close to them do um but\nThen beyond that how do you know\nHow do you change\nA and how do you predict whether or not because there are plenty of people filled with actual hate\nWhen we don't mean people on social media just talking you know negatively about someone we mean people filled with actual hate\nThat are potentially deadly well there are a number of laws we could pass to keep because\nUh you uh you know this guy was on a apparently a a social media site I'd never heard of a that was ... was a social media site for white supremacists\nOkay so your we could say that participation in such a site\nOr is against the law we could say that I'm speaking out with hatred in your heart real hatred for groups of people are based on their ethnicity or or or culture that's against the law we could pass a number of\nAscended I mean how do you change your freedom of speech ... part of the reasons that freedom of speech speech exist is so\nPeople do proclaim what they think so you know who they are you know exactly how they all you do by taking away their free speech rights as what you send them underground that's what you do and and when there's pressure\nYou know exactly how they all you do by taking away their free speech rights as what you send them underground as what you do\nAnd and when there's pressure from you know society because the reason I'm guessing the reason and I think it's a solid theory here that the neighbor wasn't aware of of this kind of you know hatred in this person's heart\nIn our society\nWe don't tolerate it morally speaking forget about the legality of it all forget about what can be done legally morally we don't tolerate that because the overwhelming majority of people don't have this kind of hatred and evil than there are no\nAnd you cannot ... and that's what it comes down to there's there's no way of knowing\nFor what ever reason whatever motivation\nI mean think of all of the reasons that might be stated a in terms of the motivation of of any\nMass killer\nIn our history\nWell the list is very long\n[noise] you know I I was just I was going through the headlines are just yesterday just in real clear politics and and it was a it was just really interesting a Donald Trump is a shameless liar\nThat's the headline of an article written by former president Barack Obama got his my witness or no one family Detroit News be honest we hate each other but the one I liked the most was Justin Fox Bloomberg's headline if you ignore the news America actually seems pretty nice\nIf you ignore the new view ignore the news it seems pretty nice well I I just I thought it was you know I didn't even read the article I just I saw it but I but it it's something that you and I talked about before where we've we've said\nA for and and I mentioned for example everything going on in the news and you walk into the voting booth everybody greet you how you doing what's going on you know you're voting location what's going on good to see a\nOh the weather is that Oh thanks for voting pick up your thing things you take care of everyone now has I mean everybody goes and it's very orderly very nice I don't think I've ever had a non pleasant time ever voting in my life right well that's actually the reality of it you know of of what goes on\nFor the vast majority tens of millions of people out there one thing we talk about you know the the news media\nAnd you and I have talked about this a lot\nThat they're always you know and and it just because it's it's it's the news the news is what's unusual that's one of the first things I learned in journalism class is news as the unusual right that's why that's why murders\nAre new system because for the most part they don't happen to the vast majority of people not to discount that murder isn't bad but the fact is the majority of people the majority of the time\nNever encounter\nA a a murder\nRight many ... some families do but the majority of families in this country do not when you look at the three hundred and roughly thirty million people in this country still mass shootings mass murders are quite low but when you look at the\nPsychopaths that exist out there\nUh when I was just watching and how many\nUh documentaries every watched on it but it was another one on on Ted Bundy yesterday ... and talk you know the going through the transcripts of his girlfriend at the time I'm telling you just haunting yeah she was trying to figure out\nIs he not named going through that progression of\nHer there's no it can't be and then\nIs he not and then go into that progression of her there's no it\nCan't be and then sent you know since he's brother ... the Ted 'cause the exact same thing shut the door on the FBI or you know how dare you this isn't this isn't my brother and then finally you know started thinking about it and said well okay I guess I have to deal with the reality and it's not that it gives any\nYou know um there was no owners or or or responsibility on the part of his\nBrother necessarily because it was as if you know he was learning it he really was learning about you know what his brother might be capable of doing or was capable it turned out of doing a A N and that's the case with any of them you know the neighbor here\nOf the shooter at the at the synagogue you know you think of that and\nI'm sure in in his mind is wondering wow is there something maybe that I should have paid attention to get a closer is there something that I could have done we all do this and by the way this is how we get to this point of saying there must be a solution because in our hearts\nThere should be one this in our hearts it doesn't make sense but we're trying to make sense of something that will ... the overwhelming majority of people will never be able to connect with\nIn our minds we don't think this way we don't have this kind of evil in our hearts we don't have this kind of hatred for people it's quite the opposite we have love and respect for people\nAnd we can talk about disagreements but I always put it like this it's like a family\nYou could sit around and and if you go spend you know enough time [laughter] with your family you can sit around and you can have debates you can have concerns and arguments and very passionate arguments on very important things\nBut the moments somebody else walks in that door and starts threatening interview and starts going after any of you that's when you stand up together and say wait a minute hold on here because\nWhen you put this all in perspective\nWe're always going to have very passionate discussions about American politics that's going to be the case in we should be the case when you talk about the the tactics right now being used\nDo away with the process do away with the constitution do away with the electoral college all of these things that are ultimately about giving individual's rights\nAnd and instead we're looking at more and more taking away those the people's rights the individual rights of Americans that becomes a real threat but it is not something\nThat is in most people's minds something you respond to with anything else but a vote or a debate\nIt's that simple and that's who we are everyone greens most good people grieve\nWhen when there's a loss of life that's who we are as humans that's who we are\nAs a society the the people the very few that have these arrange mines that are that have evil in their hearts\nWe'd like to be able to come up with a solution to try and predict it and try and stop it ahead of time and I I Wish there were way but as\nAs it stands right now it's just impossible as you mentioned Gary sometimes in a society it is going to happen [noise]\nWe can learn from it but it doesn't mean that will be able to predict the next one or\nIn a society it is going to happen\nWe can learn from it but it doesn't mean that will be able to predict the next one or stop or prevent the next one we look to

being a part of the country to get out and take a drive and see some of the beautiful fall foliage you're actually passed the peak season for many locations around the country\nThe upper Great Lakes including northern Wisconsin in northern Minnesota most of Pennsylvania and New York in the New England states are past week this week we're seeing the ... conditions throughout the Appalachians right through central Ohio and Indiana and to northern Illinois\nAnd portions of central Iowa and we'll have some rain to contend with in the mid west region I mentioned throughout Indiana Ohio portions of the lower Tennessee Valley today we'll see showers move through moving off to the east we'll see those rains for the mid Atlantic\nA little bit less and less than Obama did when it comes to his ... is the way over these talks about\nThe way he talks about it not want to see not what he wants to do not the ... people are against what he wants to do is that where you're trying to say\nOh I'm trying to say is that the teams to me a as someone who is your brother is your fellow American citizen and I love you don't have a ton of conservative friends Republican friends\nWe're all brothers we're all brothers what I'm saying is that\nIt seems to me that Trump and the way he characterizes\nPeople who are in need and if you were in their position if you were in their same position you want the best for your family you want you wouldn't want the best for your friends you would you would want the best for yourself you want the best slice it seems to me that\nYou're in an okay but law does not ... not bereft of that where gestures guilty okay well let me we're ... we're using language to characterize right right well here's not ... it here's the point he'll ugly right now that people are dying in my opinion Mozart okay are you all are dying with the result\nOf hatred and partisanship coming from both sides and I will tell you that the left as justice guilty\nOkay here's the saints here's a point that I Want to get too because you this is very important 'cause one of the things that that really gets to conservatives because conservatives have compassion and I believe and I believe that and I believe that that the the yanks when we're we've got some\nInterference or I I Believe the Trump is compassionate\nI Believe Trump's rhetoric at times goes over the top ... example [laughter] you know the example I'm going to give [laughter] keeping the conspiracy going the cruise Ted Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination so to me that was the high level anything since then has actually taken down a little bit because that's one heck of it\nWe understand that when it comes to hyperbole he\nCan go over the top\nBut don't you care about the substance\nIs it only the hyperbole then is that what you're claiming Democrats are Democrats only care\nAbout how you say it's not what you say\nAnd you also have to understand when it comes to the theory that exist in America\nBy a lot of people including Trump when you see\nThat Democrats wish to protect illegal immigrant criminals this is not\nUltra part is going to get people angry it is the reality of what exists today stayed in reality is not hate talk\nBut when you have the Democrats who prefer their preference is the safety and security\nOf illegal immigrant criminals over American citizens yeah you're going to get people angry including the president ...\nWhat's gonna happen um look and by the way the whole thing with the remember the president said the rapist thing and you know it's it's you know you and I for example we've said you could take quotes that we have said\nAnd and you know in the context of not knowing other things you could take it out of context as soon as that was said he goes no I mean the the bad people not the good ones and he said we know there are good people tried to come across\nThe border we can't do it so we clarified that a long long time ago in fact he clarified that right after it happened yes but again it was or what they did was they took it and they ran with it that that all are rapists\n... now you said all he said rape is\nWell and he didn't say they were all rape is won't him across it and and ... changed making the point\nThe very simple point that we have to that every single person that comes in this country that was the point he was making yes\nBecause does the most hardened criminals are the ones you don't want to hear\nVery simple or some data that you will point by point with our last caller to find out just how liberal you are\nBecause you have to understand where liberalism ... or ... you know again\nAnd you can tell at least he conceded he was conceding some points a by the way I did see over the weekend we need a third political party everything here proves that that would stand for what\n... what are you going to do that are going to let him out for about a third political parties stand for\nWell where's the center where's the center yeah\nWho's really a moderate right now\nI don't know what a moderate is right now you know we've been you know over the past few years especially over the past twenty four months we've been trying to define what a conservative as\nA I think we all know what the liberalism there are varying degrees of liberalism\nBut it starts\nPretty much on the far left and then goes to the extreme far left\nWell tell me what a moderate is\nForget about conservative or liberal tell me what a moderate is what do they stand for what are they promote\nAnd how do they vote and I've talked about how I uh\nTalked to a a relative by marriage who was a college professor and it was a liberal I mean I really never got into the conversation and did the shirt our family reunion and even though he's a liberal he rejects what's coming from the Democrats completely\nHe said about Trump he said 'cause look my dad loved Trump because Trump look his rhetoric has over the top but\nNot a racist he stopped him said come on is a New York city deals with everybody and this guy's a liberal professor who says I Can't stand being on the liberal campus as he said because they're not liberal

Republican ... ah but Greg Abbott absolutely dominating in the polls I mean there was one you can go back a couple of months you can't find one that's not double digits\nSo you've got a ton of people because if he only get six or seven wins by six seven eight points Ted Cruz and have it wins by twenty huge number of people we voted for Greg Abbott voted for better or voted for Greg Abbott and would not vote for Cruz why would be my question\nWell you know we have to point out and I don't know if this is a part of it or if this would be in in the you know part of the answer to that uh that you would get if you were to learn that\nBut we we talk about it was two years ago Ted Cruz being the demon oh I agree with you know and and you know I mean back when banner was was speaker of the house and and you know a ... there were people in the Republican Party we know that in the Senate and in the house\nThat hated bruised but I mean if you had any question you look at what happened at the our and see at the convention in the summer at twenty sixteen yeah bailed out stage but now he's beautiful ...\nYes right while because now he's useful but if you decided to challenge\nThe president appointed attitude in twenty twenty but isn't that politics though yeah of course a stranger and I was better than it was I didn't know she was able to me yeah that's and and it's nothing new but\nIt it is\nThe same thing is is that okay well but\nIn that setting it was about his lack of endorsement\nAnd now it's I think you could probably point to a number of people that say that still stuck with me\nEven though the president is with him and Houston I'm not\nI mean I I think you would probably again which some I Can't even measure that but I Know there are people that support the president right now support governor Abbott\nAnd are not going to support Ted Cruz for one reason or the other\nAnd it's it's likely because I'm I'm guessing a handful of them at least are saying it's because he did not get on board and twenty sixty\nI Would love to see those votes how many votes for Abbott but don't vote for Cruz at ... or ... just don't vote for Senate mhm\nNo there or you know if you if you look at that there there could be a number of them that aren't voting and the Senate or how many of them\nYou know are looking at the governor's race and and you know going well yeah that's it that's all great and wonderful but Lupe Valdez is not our ... there were a number of things that came up and her history as a share of that the left is considered the ... in fact\nValdez is not our candidate there were a number of things that came up and her history as a share of that the left is considered that in fact been more vocal about uh of course in the in the past few months that they're concerned with her actions as an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff department\nUnder her leadership so you look at that in the end and those that probably has some to do with it again you know you could put some of those answers in that category but\nWe'll see what where it comes together I guess on election day in and how many people actually did vote for Abbott wouldn't vote for Ted Cruz that's an interesting question and point eight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers conducting thorough pre trip inspections allows you to catch him in problems before heading out on the road post trip inspections give the shop time to react to any problems that were identified\nDuring her next pre or post trip inspection check to make sure your fifth wheel securely attached and free of any excess of where the trailer king pin must be watched\nProperly and the jobs of the fifth wheel also check to make sure your safety chains are attached properly th truck service understands the importance of these inspections if you find any issues during your own pre or post trip inspection stopped by a location near you have your vehicle looked at by one of our expert technicians\nThis maintenance tip is the surface of the aid truck service road squad if you break down we show up called eight hundred nine two four shot [noise]\nVoice box widow radio with a record ...

black Leadership Conference at the President Trump spoke to the other day and I saw one of the young people that was interviewed that said I'm finally off the plantation\nAnd when he said that I went wow that's going to drive liberals just crazy but to me and I'm not black but to me when he said that\nWhat it was was I I'm I'm Out of the I'm Out of the mindset of groups think that it ... it I'm involved in group think find being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin then my mind is still in the plantation\nAnd that and that's what I tried some other fish you you're you're\nPointing the finger at a a Republican plantation what I'm saying what what ... are you are on right now that one I allowed you to think as you really think\nBecause when when you talk to black folks\nAbout the the homosexual thing and the marriage thing or whatever that you're talking to the mission by issue is that lives up with more of a conservative mindset but because of their best so brave brainwashed into your thinking of all races and racism racism racism you know it clouds their their their their judgment\nYou know I I Wonder 'cause you know we've talked about the identity politics with a with the ... with the Democrats and the identity politics that are really I think come to the forefront because they're so radical is you know number one the transgender movement where if you're a\nAnd the identity politics that have really I think come to the forefront because there are so radical is you know number one the transgender movement where if you're a a man you can be a woman and the the country and laws must\nAh recognize you that way and then what we've got into now is transracial that if you're black you can be white and if you're white you can be black\nLegally and I started thinking about that and wonder how many cars we said this we said with the transgender it seemed that there was more acceptance and when they jumped to the trans racial\nI said I think you're going to get a lot of blowback from a lot of black leaders out there standing wait a minute so you can be whatever race you want whenever you want to be it and I thought that was really interesting I Wonder if people thought that that was\n... just a ... a lot of\nMinorities might have seen that and said okay maybe this time for me to get on a different mindset as to where the Democrats are going\nBecause it's a it's a challenge is so what does this fight for a way you looked at all in vain yeah right\nNo that's I I think that's the question that that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset from the the the the left right now that\nYou can be whatever you wish to be now that includes gender or race so there because there's transgender as there is also trans racial is them\nAnd they want you to believe well if you that's how you identify will hold on a second\nBecause if you look at a you know the the the civil rights act the protected groups created under the civil rights act\nIf there if you can belong if anyone can belong to any protected group\nThen there are just by saying so then there are no protected groups then the civil rights era and has done its it's over I I mean the the the civil rights act but everything that the civil rights era that happened there all that entire battle\nIs we're not\nAnd not only that the uh the civil war was for nothing and wouldn't you fight against other oppressive a governmental systems\nYou know why did we fight this to say about that we should have done that uh\nWe're we're on another different thought pass out I'm like no we are Americans this or the ... when I say there were as individual is better than anybody or any other country where say I have is a better than everybody else yes or any other country it's\nYes and I and and and and the goal would be to everybody to adapt the actual ideas in in in the constitution where they they don't always do so and the other thing is too I mean there's also this thing that the left throws at the conservatives in at the right that you don't you won't acknowledge racism come on and we all know what are\nHow horrendous racism and slavery and Jim Crow was\nAnd I don't know any conservative that which is to go back to that\nAnd my belief is the Democrats and I think about my grandfather my grandfather was the ... the Democratic chairman of the town that we grew up in and he was because he emigrated from Canada and he came to town and they were all Republican and he just said well you got to have two parties you can have a system with what he was he was much much more conservative\nBut he left the Democrat that well I I Believe\nMy father never had the official conversation with him about it and he died before I got to ask him but I said would ... be a Democrat today and he said no abortion\nLiberal politics or changed him but\nWhen you think of what they what the Republican but the Democrats\nUsed to claim in the seventies and eighties they cared about and then the identity politics where everything\nIs about race everything is about gender and the whole cabinet thing where you saw that you must believe a woman well that's ridiculous if you must believe the woman will it used to be it must leave the white man over the black you know over over the black person in a criminal justice in the black person you don't believe in the white person you believe you know you go by evidence\nAnd what I find in credit is what I find a credible is the bigotry and intolerance and the actual racism and sexism seems not to be coming from the Democrats\nWill go well I talk to black men about or that situation\nUm they fully understand\nThat the uh\n'cause I don't know to remember there was a white lady that was several years ago she ran away and a ship that a true black males as so every black widow that within the city and okay look under scrutiny and they came out that she just wanted to run away right oh so\nSo I'm like well you have to understand that that\nIf you go to that system would be fully aware of that what you're trying to fight against ... ... ...\nJames uh thank you so much ... than the ...\nYeah I mean you're not the first person who was called the show and said look I'm black pride being me and my conservative and live my life\nWell you know what's interesting too is that you go through the day to day experiences and we hear that from callers uh every so often\nAnd and I think of and then you mentioned the signs in the yard I have a a a a neighbor I spend my neighbor for almost Fifteen Years at the end of my street he's so he's at the corner he's got a corner lot right\nAnd one of the streets of that corner not not our street but the
