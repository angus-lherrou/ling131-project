why you're not being told the truth not being told the triple yes\nAh in an effort to create jak pots like this one lottery officials have not only made it harder to win but at the continued to lie to us about the benefits of the lottery\nAnd about half of Americans play the lottery according to the most recent survey compared to almost\nSeventy percent of people in the Nineteen eighties you know that doesn't make sense though because I often told the story in the Nineteen eighties I remember I was going to a party ... and\nI stopped by this liquor store to pick up a bottle of us are a Christmas Party and there was ... apparently some lottery going on but I didn't even know about ... ... that's not to to use a cliche the lotteries never even on my radar it really isn't right I'll pass\nBy it as I'm doing show prep for the show but it's something that's never been on my radar and all ... so there I was in the liquor store and I just immediately I as I got it for about a second I stood in the real long line of about twenty five people\nBut as soon as I got on the line I didn't even look to see what if they were holding bottles or whatever I just saw the long line ... twenty five people there and I just did it in the ... no no no you you appear why am I going to cut line goes no no no you're buying alcohol [noise]\nNobody in line for alcohol the liquor store everybody is in line for the lottery tickets yeah never forget that once I started thinking we're laced with alcohol you already know you're a loser but you know I might as well [laughter] well ... is that going to happen in the second I have an adventure early in the pot stores\nUm [laughter]\nJust looking at traffic\nOne wasn't a dog it was a coyote and it was just thinking to myself man it's crazy you know you've got all this wildlife like you said it's it's all spread out yeah and you know in this neighborhood here there's wild animals all the time you took a coyote whom you think it's a cat but it's kind of [laughter] we didn't do you work\nBut it's more like as as somebody when they came over to my house one time and they'd seen pictures of my cat that came over and they said\nThat's not a cat I submitted talking about the ... it's a panther so [laughter] I'm pretty sure that when he was hanging out [laughter]\nIt's like okay this is sixteen pounds yeah are coming up on the show today the latest poll on the tax plan what other issues could affect the outcome of the mid term elections and we'll talk just a little bit about John Banner because that story on the whole pot thing has a has come up will tell you about the new company that will help you move out of San Francisco\nAnd the Turkish president says cause show gays killing was premeditated and we'll take out the owners of a bakery will appeal to the U.S Supreme Court the EPA report on ethanol that came out we never got a chance to talk about it\nA lot of uh uh ... yesterday and just are are complete and total election coverage and everything that's going on and and I think it's important because we talked about the polls but I think it's more important to talk about the issues\nThat may be affecting what's going on in the stock market yesterday in the volatility of the stock market\nYou know caterpillar not worried why because they're building their parts more expensive why the terrorists we look at issues that could possibly affect\nAnd hurt the Republicans one of the things that we didn't talk about yesterday was the farmers farmers aren't happy because of the tariffs slug you may you may have destroyed family farms that have existed for a long time\nA big because you've taken away because of the terrorist taking away their supply chain yeah and as we told you in even though the president came out and said okay we're going to free up money for them they said that's not going to save us right because that doesn't that doesn't make up for the last is that right ... and the fact that we're not we're going to be shut out of the supply chain\nThat for ... and we don't know for how long I mean are they could lose their livelihood with farmers I mean this is for them if it is their livelihood so that that towers over Kavanaugh and the care of and and and and anything else that might influence votes and this is they could lose their lively\nAnd you've had a ton of small businesses out there that have been affected by the tariffs on steel and aluminum tariffs you think about that if I'm going to hit them any industry in any region right\nThe small businesses out there that have been affected by the tariffs on steel and aluminum tariffs you think about that in farming and put them\nIn any industry in any region right and in our region its its oil and gas but a farming ah as in the mid west\nThere are every ... every other business is essentially related to that economy the farming economy so it's not just the farmers but it's the other yet uh businesses in that area that are supported by the\nEnd and that's an unknown quantity right I don't know how you figure I don't know how a lot of these things I don't know how you figure it in and come up with a formula as to what's going to win in in two weeks all I can tell you is the issues\nThat have a great probability of affecting the election both on the Democrats' side as we spend a lot of time out and also the Republican

will be analyzing\nA you know everything that that has gone on I mean we're a ... you get every single day I mean I saw\nYou know that uh oh okay that looks like now that the Republicans are going to lose the house yesterday but then I saw other articles dating well no that's not the case and that's why we'll bring you the polls and will tell you what they say\nWe really don't make predictions what we will tell you is the issues\nAnd the events that we believe will affect the outcome of the election yeah uh I've always said for me it's very hard to figure out what people are going to do on election day for me just yeah I mean everything the pollsters may\n... you know believe in some of the pollsters do get a get a dump a pretty good especially in a presidential election but they've missed major elections as they did for example in Ninety or where they weren't even ...\nThe summer on a national poll the Democrats had ten point lead over the Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cobra electronics here's your forecast moisture\nThe great lakes region into New England\nWill bring snow showers for portions of northern Ohio up in through upstate New York so along the lake from Cleveland into buffalo on on Ninety look for some potential snow today more likely though as you get into northern New England where six to ten inches of snow is forecast for northern Maine\nVaries greatly yeah and then of course the value of the home yeah that influences the model now that I built my tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm a yeah my my tax rate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of\nPeople moving to it um but even aside from that if you've got a a a home that's worth more\nThan ... where's your your taxes are higher and lower rate\nRight so when when you see that and you see the number of of of ... and and remember ... ... ... the the the people that will be at that age uh aren't\nWe're not talking the super rich were I heartland about what is viewed in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters some who are in the middle to upper middle class\nAnd they're getting hit and they don't like it\nWhat's their only recourse\nThere's still a supporter of Trump but what's their records to send the mess\nWhat's their only recourse\nThere's still a supporter of Trump but what's their records to send the message my Republican congressman ... and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to then paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's vote\nIt has the potential of changing\nFive percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election\nSo that's that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing I'm\nJust the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan\nAnd this is the one thing that made by perch that is they're coming out bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes\nSo many of them are coming out now I'm going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes not we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax credit we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually admitting where they're going to raise taxes which could hurt that we've also talked about the care of it\nRather than ever in the Republican Party that's one\nI'm yesterday\nAuto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears that along expected decline is here now the economy overall [noise]\nMay not be an end and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election [noise] but it will change those small business people that are being affected [noise]\nA caterpillar a worse at the caterpillar story and then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are telling us write the steel and an autumn of the the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't the China thing\nIt's the United states and in Europe and and and Mexico that they're still in effect mhm and it's killing them it's raising their price as we said\nWhen the president came out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody is using the new name by the way [laughter] All right\nAnd and uh the his you know and the only success that that he claimed\nThe the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's an unbelievable but he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost of buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing\nOr there's a story last week about Ford grumbling going to be losing a billion dollars and they believe the terrorists are going to ... that are hurting them remember every supplier at every small business that deals with Ford in the United states knows that that's coming [noise]\nOr or or feeling it already and every dealership\nAnd every ... remember there's still terrorists really been affects that we're from China which has increased the cost from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were up ... percent by the time we got\nTo June of this year so you look at that you look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in price\nBecause of steel costs and now because of terror of cost and because of the new NAFTA\nOr and then the farmers as we mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about uh your your talk or if you're talking about a\nPeople would manufacturing jobs at a technical skills\nOr if you're talking about a\nManufacturing people would manufacturing jobs at a technical skills ton of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump country and you're talking about farmers that are stream Lee upset because it's not only their current profits\nBut it's a fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our present meeting you said I Wonder if that's\nWhy he went to you know even though was wishy washy ethanol plan I Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because by the internal polls are saying you're getting killed with the farmers right now at it as\nA couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt it it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa it's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry\nThe farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry are you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers\nAre and and you know in this region in this area in the state\nAnd I don't know what you do in terms of of ah of reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about\nOr they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a port trade with with Canada\nOr any nation that they're selling to\nThose farmers if they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff or a chair of the that went into place\nOr or any of that if they have to make arrangements a lot of time\nA lot of the time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this is why the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said look thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar a handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nRight it's still not making up for what our losses All right and we're ... we're we're\n... or out of the loop and the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in ... I took us deck I think one of the ... was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty as a killer this is what we saw after the recession\nThe problem with bailing out all the banks are are putting money into all the banks of the coffers of all the banks by the federal government or during the recession or in two thousand eight to ... end of two thousand eight and ... and into a two thousand nine\nThey there were three apparently large banks that were on the brain that we're a possible high risk\nBut they didn't want to run on those things so they put money in all of the coffers well then it made all the banks look risky\nAnd that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade\nTrade deals between nations that are set up\nUm you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up a bridge and believing you could rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that is going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty [noise]\nAnywhere in that than your former customers are going to stick with someone else a another nation in this case mhm and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nOur discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of what is going to be affecting this this ah election we talk\nThe the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this election we talked a lot yesterday about how the Republicans in so many ways\nWere set up in a way that you don't see a political party in a midterm election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are and a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now for the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is\nThe ... you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very were wary and a core constituency of the of of Trump supporters\nWhich are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking\nA you know the their particular economy and what's gonna happen to their livelihood so we think it's very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting the selection both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans just to give you a more realistic\nUh I think uh\nAnalysis of of the

time in in our history to see where this ah goes as I said you know you and I talked about this many many times before we don't make predictions we we looked at history of for example the midterms and then we look at the issues that we believe are driving it\nBecause I think it's very very hard you know you can look and you can look at the the the polls overall and you can give some credibility to it and we find the credibility of polls actually after an election and you and I've done that before we you know we have gotten calls we don't get as many\nBecause we have spent as a time especially after presidential elections looking at the polls that actually got it right\nAnd you know we we you know talked about the the the polls even for you know because we were getting the calls after Trump's victories and they said the polls were completely off they weren't because the polls measured the popular vote not the electoral vote right and on the popular vote you had two or three that were dead on\nAs to you know Hillary winning by what roughly two points I think it was ...\nAnd and so you know there are some polls that are that are dead on so people that say the polls are always wrong that is have wrong statement to make a lot of the polls are wrong and a lot of them the sample and that they use\nA you know distort the way that America feels but some polls actually get it right it's just the fact that we don't know which of the polls that get it right before an election\nWe have to wait till after so we can look at the issues that are that are affecting at a you know

and we go to Josh in Pennsylvania Josh welcome you're on ... Radio Welcome to the show Hi\n[noise] hello I called you a long time ago you guys are awesome bank wanted to point out\nSomething that you and many of the listeners probably do not think about or see ah the rhetoric side of it with ... or face and all the other things like that see younger people that are all round Eighteen a lot of them love that\nI talked to a ... like that or whether in\nThat are bad yeah yeah we we lost we lost about half of that and we've got about the reception there I I don't know about that I\nYou know that the bats anecdotal evidence\nAnd we're talking about influencing votes really we're talking about likely voters or the Eighteen year olds aren't in the likely voter category right now for this particular mid term they're certainly not\nSo there may be something they're on social media uh that's one thing but the the problem with it is again for people that you know we're looking at a certain issues and concerns\nUh they've got to know that uh you know and and they're\nUndecided during the center\nThey've got to know that they can you know that they can safely you know cast that boat and that's what you're trying to do it you know you don't want to you don't want to jump into something where again it's\nIt's unnecessary it's it's not a positive\nI've always uh yeah I've I've always been about getting every when you possibly can and once you have the when a accentuated in a positive about when which would have been nickel after Abbott Eddie\nA you get the you know come out with Harris plan you know this is what they want to do or the or or ... or or any of that you know there are promoting this but that's not going to work we're promoting this and look what's working you can demonstrate that your ideas are working\nAnd you can point out we're there's aren't going to work and that's something that is extremely rare in politics even with\nUh other affect the presidents of the past\nYou know you can show already a track record of getting things done\nThat are helping the economy you know and and that's it and and and by the way I I Do want to\nClarify you know we criticized the former President Obama speaking in Nevada ... on yesterday's show or when you know because he said don't forget who started this and I think he's right we should Donald Trump started this [laughter] good economy we shouldn't forget who started this all your writing\nMr Obama or so the the the whole thing\nYou have those positives stay on them because what is the rally\nWhat is a rally a rally is a a ton of positives and this map this massive group of euphoric people that are ready to take action\nYou know that's that's where ... if you think about it every day on social media should be that rally between now and November I mean it's not that you have to have positives you can go after Chuck Schumer\nWriting buddy ... because I I think it's very important to understand that in the real political world I mean you'll have the purest out there saying I'm against the negative advertising this ridiculous right of course you have to point out or nothing that you've got you've got to point out the negatives of your uh you know of your candidate you have to point out the negatives that\nThe government can't give you all the ... that somebody is lying to you when they tell you that they can make it a beautiful like the frustration that our last caller abs all solve crime may not related right well I'm telling you that that that it then that's why I started ... I started laughing because\n... you know that isn't going to happen you have to point out and and I believe in times you have to get blood is we've gotten London passionate about it during the cabin O'Hare instead it's unacceptable to us and we'd been blunt that you're not an American\nThat if you will if you don't believe in the mindset of due process even for cabinet or\nYou know they were and the Democrats are trying to we use a lot of that in every well it's it's not a quarter or it was a political court where people were put under oath and people were put under owed under threat of perjury if they lied and it was not a criminal court it was not a civil court but it was a political cord that had much\nOf the same enforcement mechanisms that a criminal court has when you testify right and and so a a a a person's reputation is at stake it was a political court and yes\nAmericans expect fairness and they expect due process Democrats said we don't believe in due process we believe it's very important to bring up the fact\nThat they don't believe in the first amendment they don't believe in the second amendment they now don't believe in due process under the law they don't believe a presumption of\nInnocence if you're not on their side the American civil liberties union has just shocked away\nAny pretense of carrying about Americans and our civil liberties and they just made it clear during the cabinet hearings we don't care we point out in a very passionate way as you can see I get passionate about this\nBecause I think it's very important to point out\nThat people say well you know it's it's offensive if you tell somebody without a patriot because they believe they're patriot well know there are some standards\nOf why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American I mean what makes you an American it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you reject the basic tenants of the constitution if you reject free speech if you were jak freedom of religion if you if you reject the second amendment if you reject\nA due process under the law if you were jak the electoral college if you reject the Senate\nAnd and you wish to change all of it then you don't believe in America I mean I don't know what else to say right it's it's not and people's about so shocking thing that you're saying\nNo it's not they're the ones that are shocking by claiming what do you believe in America or just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well that's what America is yes\nThat's that's it I'm you and what they're trying to say is a well it's like when they say no we believe in free speech or no you don't it's your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately\nThat's free speech\nOh no no no see your free speech as bigoted your freedom of religion as bigoted\nAnd and so no we believe me we believe in negative you know that this isn't about the fact that you know that you need to that you need not to point out in a very blunt manner [laughter]\nWhat the opposition is for and what they really stand for\nAnd the fact that you you know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them\nAnd you can proudly say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing is negative to this country mhm because they don't believe in the basic tenants of this country and so nobody's saying that you have to be nice to them all the time no no our point you know when you have\nThe when the ... move onto the next when well again I think we got to go in\nFor calling out a O'Rourke or a Schumer or any of them to me those those are positives when you're calling out what they're promoting and saying look what I've done look at look at what we've been able to do in such a short time and what we're doing right now with the economy\nAnd look what they want to do with it and then went back to and\nAnd the other end by the way and sometimes the name calling the the slogan name calling or the nickname calling is very effective [laughter]\nLiar Lanny I now I made that when I was I don't know I mean\nNot I'm not a I can usually the ones I I don't want to get a ...\nWas a ... was it\nI don't know when you when you when you start when you said sure I forgot what it was just\nYeah I'd I bought a use somebody's got those listed somewhere overlook names ... no ... we've said this though well now it's ... people in office it's paid running it's beautiful tired of that is not lying to any more [laughter]\nA\nBenefit as far as we know the president no longer believes that Mr Cruz's father [laughter] and father and they get us to have a cat [laughter] as far as we know

name of of of policy on one when I was writing an algebra and the other that was the best oh my gosh that's brilliant I mean that's something that works really is a big word but that's something that's\nThat it's effective they're not showing up they're not here at the party I'm trying to work with them they don't want to work with me it was a brilliant political moment yes\nIt because it's real simple it's it's brilliant and its simplicity that you're showing your demonstrating that you've invited them and they're they're not showing up that's what that represented\nKeep in mind the former president didn't invite members of his own party from Capitol Hill to come in and that that's not from us\nThat's from Chris Matthews he didn't like working with Democrats he didn't like because he he believed he could do a lot of it on his own by the way that was also rich we didn't pointed out of the comments he was making you know it's\nNot about one man for really [laughter]

I mean that's ...\nAnd their little dream in their mind of them winning the money and you got it and you're there relative a wait a minute I Want or or just somebody that that you know and sometimes it's not not even people view you know\nSome of those stories about the just the you know and then God Bless all the non profits but nonprofits non stop knocking at your door\nYou know and you want to give back I'm sure most people would\nBut you can you can give you know I mean you could pretty much give all of that a way if you fulfilled every request\nThere would've been much more exciting and when I was younger me winning the lottery these days it would be like what a hassle [laughter] well\nWould say it'll it'll take a lot about it would change my life too much I I thought about that kind of money\nBecause after taxes uh it's going to be somewhere around what five if you want the one time payout it's somewhere around a third or thirty five percent\nYou know of the overall prices at one point six billion so pair that down to about a ... you know somewhere around five hundred and fifty sixty or or six hundred million dollars\nThat's a ton of money you're richer than Mitt Romney already you went to bed poorer\nThan than a Joe Biden and you woke up richer\nYou know the story always goes there was one of the least rich guys in the Senate um and and you woke up richer than a minute [laughter] and and the whole thing is is that\nYou you ... what do you do [noise]\nI've always said like those really expensive cars really expensive sports cars you know if if I were you know the billionaire and I had that kind of money but still knowing myself where in the world would I drive that car I wouldn't be able to stop and park it anywhere [noise]\nKnow what I mean I mean where are you going to take that I wouldn't mind taking it out to any gossip just place in Texas anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time\nWith six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank\nIt would it would a ... then there's the bit disturbed there's\nYeah there's nothing I'm [noise]\nI'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] died out to be clear it would it would be a huge hassle mhm I like my life\nI don't want to change mhm and I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your\nLife I have a a a friend who a friend or family member who ah that were at one time was working for a multibillion it [noise] um [noise] and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps\nFour hours a day mhm [noise] and\nMy family member told me that this person was the exact same way [noise]\nOnly because there's not enough time of the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule is very busy not not a multi billionaire although well at least one listener thinks we are [noise] um but but the point was is there so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money\nUm but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth\nIs more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes\nOr you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody\nElse though to know I couldn't trust anyone that do that that would be the thing because you know people about what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance\nMyself from the money and saw is set up some kind of foundation [noise] you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kinda money you're not going to be able to keep your name private\nSo this ... it would be it would be hard demand that you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut [noise]\nIf you got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\n... exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money mhm 'cause I said you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of ... what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you've got to run the foundation so this jobs gone or I don't want to run my in laws\nThere are laws about raising the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members or their tax laws if you just write them a check and you got to pay the gift tax\nWell my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if you're going to give it all away that's what I made it still going to be a full time job is gonna be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh\nThis life I have is gone well I liked his life five right now it's like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah\nThis life I have is gone well I like this life fight right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah All right let's play out of it let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older and like my like when I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life\nWell yeah but ... you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life I I don't do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things and I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so\nUm [noise] I'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be\nGreatly excited about that mhm oh yeah 'cause I don't know I Would love to you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I miss this is one of them thought that goes through a mind but it's still a thought\nOh we're talking about is is that if I Won one point six billion mhm\nBecause every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't you and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other title oh we that we've ever done really I mean it's not I never think that\nOutside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up until today\nA little shocked we work in an older warehouse for those that don't yes where you're I mean we really ... it's almost like we've come to work at a warehouse that we have the end of the show we grab our lunch pills and go on to it that's what the feeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nOutside of being a machinist and so the mentality sort of the same for it\nSo I but the the the thought and and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and\nYou know a a just and financial decisions and everything else that become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business and personal life you've one point six billion\nAll that goes away and ... and I always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my way because I bought him one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter] right then I got all these other things that I can think about it basically keep that the thinking of debt at a distance well all those challenges in problems are taken away and all of a sudden I'm going to get all this money death [laughter]\nI was a you know I talked to one time about this uh there was a a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed a game and he sold it [noise]\nAh I I I don't know\nI'll I'll have to look it up but anyway the guy sold his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game for two billion dollars [noise]\nAnd his take on that was a you know roughly\nLike one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a rent just a series of tweets and he was talking about it was that this party and it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires [noise]\nAnd I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\n[noise]\nI did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy and he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem\nHe talked with a girl who you know work you know for a living at a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd it was what I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird are pleased to be in because I'm you know I'm not from money\nI'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's here's the problem\nUh like the the the person that my family member works for\nYou got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the other you're famously wealthy so you have security detail we talked about this with the president\nThe president has that security detail that is is parallel to you know the types of security detail or you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean\nAnd so you're going to have to be very careful because there are people there are threats against you all the\nPrize one of the that story that I read that you read that you mentioned earlier talked about the guy who won the big lottery right and I was actually what the uh kidnapped or some of his family was kidnapped or whatever right right right right when the money yeah\nYou know so you need at that point when you when that kind of money you probably need security so your whole life was destroyed once you of security once ... once you have a possibly what not I'm not a policy or are we learning Irish people are security why couldn't ...\nThis creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme

allow people to pour into the United states undetected fund documented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or does become immigrants in this

the time to challenge\nThe Democrat leadership and say you keep talking comprehensive immigration reform but you never tell us what you want I Believe and so to the American people that you want to open borders if you don't want to open borders well then come to the table and tell me specifically ...\nWhat type of enforcement you will put on the border if you want to plant\nAnd we've talked about the various plans everything from citizenship to amnesty which would be citizenship to\nLegal status without being able to vote right if you got that then what level of border enforcement would you guarantee the American public please be public and tell me\nWe are willing to keep the door open are you willing to talk or is it like we all believe that your party is the party of open borders and if you are the party of open borders have the guts\nTo sell that to the American people or attempt to sell back to the American people that's what I think the president should say to me he's

about why they think what they think now what they thought then well gee why why don't you ask them if they want to open\nBorder it's the same kind of positioning by the way I I Would do this during a debate of course the president's not going to be debating only went for a couple of years but I Would do this if I'm a candidate I Would do this on a debate stage with my opponent if I'm a Republican candidate I Would be doing this\nWith ah with with any of them I Would be I Would say you know what I I the two the moderator our view my time if I could just ask ask my opponent\nWhat they believe the level of enforcement of the borders should be [noise]\nTell me what level of enforcement do you believe in closing the borders\nAltogether sealing the borders\nAnd only letting a limited number of people and that's basically what we have now I mean it's not sealed we have porous borders but do you believe we should enforce the borders or not because there is no half measure in my opinion\nThere's no half measure so either you believe and open borders or you know enforce right and it's about time after Thirteen Years\nThirteen Years we were talking about a McCain Kennedy when that went down to defeat Thirteen Years ago and the Republicans still have not been able to back the Democrats into the corner to make them feel so uncomfortable to challenge him to dare them to tell

I didn't even care about the Halloween costume\nRight would go out and even when we got to be ten eleven twelve Thirteen we go we go out to uh we we we'd had Fifteen blocks I'd come home with grocery bags of candy even at that age and all I cared about was the candy costume couldn't care less yeah socializing could care less mhm get me the candy yeah\nSo of course that's my that's that's my penance now we used to take a ... now is you know the high blood sugar I've got to stay away from candy penance for being evil as\nWe would use pillow cases [laughter] and I met her when we were poor and because they were\nBigger [laughter] no they [laughter] they were stronger yeah they could hold [laughter] that's right yeah I never ...\nI was still do I don't have those on my bed I had a hello can build with candy it's much much\nIf that if ... if I didn't have that blood sugar sensitivity\nTell us something like that I had a hell of a field with candy it's much much\nBut if that if ... if I didn't have that blood sugar sensitivity and I'd be going out today I'd be going out yeah every Halloween [laughter] and have a bag huge back I that pillows and that's a good idea yeah\nIt's it's it's I remember one time when my son but it was right at the age where it was probably one of his last years so he was like twelve or Thirteen\nAnd he and his buddies or had a couple of them are we went out you know together and then I went with them and they we we came back and we went inside because they were it was warm is really warm\nAs it often is on Halloween Night and they wanted to go and get something to drink and said yeah yeah yeah and so they set their pillow case was pillow cases down in the driveway we're only about halfway through\nAnd we came out and they were gone I mean we weren't in there really sixty seconds at the most we went in to get a bottle of water and we came out and they were gone and the boys were just so disappointed so was my son and two buddies I said\nEnough of the games they said what I went in I got king size pillow cases and we didn't walk we drove us and we're taking a car we're going to hit every porch light that is on until you guys tell me\n[laughter] and all those other locations that night and it was one of the greatest nights ever uh that's why we had a very much like minded way yes well I I I was just you know of wondering now can you where\nIs it is it okay to where Trump mask because remember the bottom asks are out there that the George W masks route during that time well Iran resident there is a lot of them I mean you're probably still see Nixon mask yeah but I mean I'm not saying that Trump mess\nYou know with the one mask I I don't think I ever saw a Gerald Ford mask [noise] I don't think I ever ...\nSays there were Reagan mess you know that it was ... there was a quarter of it you know because of the big ... remember that\n[laughter] I don't think there was a general matter\n[noise] that's the scrimmage shouldn't ah why are we discriminating against a very mundane a long time ago now I Do remember the next ... everybody remembers the next ... oh yeah ...
