than\nThe Republicans are in fact the Republicans didn't know how to do it and two thousand eight [noise]\nAnd in two thousand twelve they beat Romney's team Romney was if you do and I were following the post debate polls the the polls that happened right after the debates between Mitt Romney and rock Obama President Obama at that time\nAnd the polls showed that Mitt Romney or on the issues landslide numbers even the exit polls yes and so massive massive numbers the difference was the organization guess what happened in twenty sixteen [noise]\nThey are and she had been working in the the DNC didn't see this because they were busy with you know the whole fusion GPS and you know 'cause we're still are Russians and all that\nAh but the are and see where they were putting their efforts was much like they in fact uh some say that as they designed it ah\nThat model of getting people to the polls that's what it's all about you can call it what you want but at the end of the day it is getting people to get out and vote and that's what happened with those stage that that Trump ended up winning that nobody saw\nAnd it was that you know boots on the ground type you know community organizing the organization you know that she's trying to speak of it it really doesn't apply internally I mean\nWhipping the votes is one thing\nThe Democrats\nThough have had a playbook for a long long time and will long after a Casio Cortez is gone you and I kind of touched on it the other day of kind of dismissing things being able to turn their head on a a Joe mansion\nYou know and and not you know the look the other way with a Joe mansion in certain cases and and not really worry about things like that when they can they know they can use Joe mansion for other things so [noise]\nThe\nThe entire equation is not going to change in fact\nI don't think the Democrats are the party would want it to change because on many issues or they'll do what they have done in the past which includes the kind of behavior we saw with Obamacare we need to pass it so you can see what's in it which includes lying to the American people about what's\nOh she was saying that we need to organize for the pressure's not within a you know the the the body which would mean the pressure doesn't come from you know whipping up the votes at the pressure comes from the outside electorate\nWill that happens all the time that that ... that that stating are nothing new the other thing is when\nNow you have the excuses no she's not a leader of the party she's not a leader of the party you well you may not believe that she is and she isn't right now\nBut the mainstream media believes that she is that's why she gets on precedent did television time from the mainstream media\nAs a a candidate for Congress ... who has one nothing yet who was a bartender a year ago\nToday because they said you know they basically are still a leader of the DNC is basically said she's the ... she's the future right I mean she may not she's not the leader of the party right now\nBut if she's the future that's what that's what the media is going to turn to the reason the media turns to that is because they see what's going on with the left by the way you know from the outside in\nWho who's leading the Democrats right now and has been leading the Democrats what force what movement is leading the Democrats well it's ... it's overall if you were to term it collectively it's the protester hits the extreme left\nBut what's the problem with that is that\nHow many different protests are they're the reason right now that they can dismiss someone tomorrow and they are a Beto O'Rourke does not need a a former president Barack Obama to campaign for I'm In Texas is because\nThey're so over you and it doesn't matter\nWho you are or you admitted though you know it's good to have an ... if\nIf overwork loses Obama's going to come out and say he should've used my endorsement well that's what he does he go party will say he reached shy he reached my endorsement shouldn't be rejecting right Obama's a endorsement but really I mean I'm I'm Glad you brought that up because that's something else from last week\nThat we really didn't get a chance to talk about but really that's unbelievable it shows you you know you and I you and I started working together Thirteen Years ago so you know we were we were together or three years when Obama first got elected right and and we remember every single moment of it and we remember\nThe the political I dollar tree that for president or an Obama remember his you know the the DNC speech from when they when they did it from the stadium with Greek columns and everything else and people were falling over him and it was\nAnd I look at it today now out of it now I ... yeah our our goal is to have the liberal takeover of a of a of Texas A M ... or ... nah we don't want right who years after he's out now we don't want 'em why\nBecause and and that's it what what a Casio Cortez doesn't include here is internally externally\nThe political pressure by the way it always comes from the outside\nA that's a good horse and and it's always the people on it like we said yesterday about Republicans have if the Republicans were jailed last year or as the president or a took office in January of twenty Seventeen like are they are now after capital\nThen we probably would see if they were ... out on the issue of health care we would see Obamacare gone completely\nBut that wasn't the case and so that that there is one example of political pressure being a precedent in in in one ear and then gone and the next\nWell with the left\nThe pressure is coming from every different\nSplinter group right it which moves in multiple directions tell me which direction you go in or you're going to be with the feminists are the trench genders because you can't on their boat right now they're fighting with each other ... as we predicted\nRight three or four years and and so that's the problem that they created they they basically over a couple of generations they were out a ... and indoctrinate in children and and and young people to believe that it was that it's white to wake up today\nAnd find a new oppressor\nFind a new reason to be a victim and that might include somebody with that was with you and part of your group yesterday\n[noise]\nPresident Obama or just not really into you any more\nI mean I Would have wanted was speaking engagements and that but that Iran take our but think about it shows\nYou how the political wins yes Ken Ken just blow\nThe one of the probably the biggest political idol of my lifetime\nAnd make it so he's not even relevant two years after he's out of office yeah ... years are running right from him saying that don't need an don't need us endorsement here and that's because and and you and I've talked about we thought this might happen because we saw some of the science\nBecause the less believes he truly was into liberal right that he truly he was he wasn't in it really for the cause he was and it just because of the gig\nRight but he really wasn't in to doing what needed to be done to move the political lover as far left as they thought\nThey did and worked with his own party as closely as as many thought he was going to eight six six Ninety road

the storm surge and the the flooding potential\nNot just there on the coastline but of course inland although down to you have the ... flood surge yeah so uh there's going to be obviously that affect a flooding uh extremely dangerous uh there's there's no doubt\nWill be the one of those storms that is an is right now they they know it was it comes ashore in his life threatening that is a life threatening storm you need to pay attention to the details and and the warnings and he'd those warnings\nAre and those calls by officials ah as as the issue those calls over the next few days\nAnd

well then they're out what is what is\nRussia collusion isn't an issue now the economy's not an issue except oil wealth of this year for Democrats [laughter] no no the ... you don't I didn't work the ... the ... the economy being bad you know not in an an issue right rises normally that's where you have the advantage what is bad mhm [noise]\nRight now yeah what's that\nWell um I don't know when you have an unemployment or at its lowest and\nFifty years I'm ... and people are a when you look at the did I not say bad yeah when you when you look at that I ... that's the problem when you when you go through it\nNow let me have unemployment the lowest citizen fifty years what else matters let me ask you about this because this has been talked about the premiums going up in Obamacare mhm but nobody seems to be talking about ... not even the media's not talking about what the what the economy is\nBad for Democrats politically [noise]\nIt is you cannot you can't spin a good economy to be a negative I guess I guess the point that I'm asking is\nIs in ... and ...\nIs\nThe Republicans are the majority one can the Democrats you that's that's my point why is that there was there to be a bright ought to garner but you got somebody that's bad for Democrats so what is their issue that they can use their point there is well what would there be how do you spend a good economy because what else matters to people [noise]\nWhat else matters if you're going to work every day you got a solid job and possibly even offers on the table\nImmigration is not an issue they could use I still believe that they can illegal immigration they can't right it's not an issue\nThey don't care about the credits\nThat's not something that helps them if the government forces a mandate and that's what was being proposed the even President Trump has talked about it in the past raising the mandate right to Fifteen Percent right\nWell if you do that that becomes a that becomes a big problem politically ... outside of Iowa\nCould I just I've read like three different articles on it and that's what I thought it was was okay you're trying to please both sides but you're not really pleased anybody well because you're not mandating it the oil companies aren't going to do it right it's not a mandate on it so you're simply saying I'm going to allow them I'm going to allow I'm going to allow the industry to do what the industry doesn't wish to do right and sell it\nYear round well I think you're probably going to see pushback ... first of all I guess we'd have to see what the participation rate is well once I was ... the the wife cities like Houston in LA they don't want more smog\nWhat gas stations going to be the first to put want to put a Fifteen in when you do as well as I Do on the Internet is going to be fine you can damage your car you know of of a faster\nYou could damage your lawn mower faster if you use the fifteenth mhm right that it should just be ... percent should be the max and putting Fifteen Percent is is just ridiculous so nobody's going to do it so it's just the way the president is trying to appease people without doing anything\nIt's trying to appease the farm [noise]\nBut you can't get there from here because\nThere is no great motivator there really is no incentive\nEven with changing how the credits work [noise]\nEven with changing because changing it to sell it year round\nHow does that that benefit those that are blending at well okay you could blend it year round and you wouldn't have to change up at the refinery level as often that does not that's not promising to them because ultimately it automatically comes back down\nTo the consumer right\nSo the mandate is on the blend\nIf the mandate is on the blunt right at ten percent\nBut the mandate isn't there for Fifteen Percent\nBut those companies the the the the oil companies that are putting it out let's say they responded to the incentive of changing the credits\nAnd we went to I don't know sixty Seventy percent of the ethanol or or the gasoline sold would would have a Fifteen Percent or\nEthanol concept [noise]\nWhat would happen with the consumer\nMany of the consumers would be driven to look for the ten percent shake out the temperature right when that happens and you have a glut of the eight Fifteen on the market then what happens then there's pushback from the retail is that's why the retailers don't want her to have the time this is why\nIt is destined to fail\nYou're handing you believe you're handing something to the farmers\nAnd the corn states\nBut it really doesn't fly without the mandate [noise]\nAnd he knows politically outside of Iowa you can't get any Fifteen mandate done right now\nI mean you might get ...

tomorrow yeah as a drunk driver I'm paying ...\nSorry Mr Trump we didn't mean to start that story for you but ah I just I mean I when I read it I'm thinking well this doesn't do anything and you're just a it's the eight Fifteen that his band in the summer months um they do have even a Fifteen out there there is some out there but as it is not it is not mandate\nWell the the question is is that [noise]\nIf the city's believe like Los Angeles or states like California who through the California air resources board\nI could see them coming in because you know a Houston and in Los Angeles compete for the number one or a spot in terms of the smog easiest city\nOr they don't want the eight Fifteen on the market they're not going to want to eat Fifteen on the market which is an interesting position to be [laughter] they can blame Al Gore by the way for this this whole thing um but the but [laughter] it part but the [noise]\nThe problem is ultimately\nThey won't want more smog they don't they will try and I'm or could try and move way ahead of it even if they don't believe it's going to fly they would probably want to get ahead of it legally\nBy going after the EPA or if the rule or exemption is but here's here's a difference and this president gonna come out tomorrow and say I'm doing this because of global warming [noise] well I don't know why you know he's not a lot to do this or they raise helping the farmers\nRight we're we're help we're helping they'll be selling them Chuck Grassley rats\n[laughter] yeah [laughter]\nBut they're not mandating that you buy Fifteen Percent they're all making it available where you could do it year round well there even though I don't ...

remembered that said the Trump Administration was complicit in front of that in ... in a in hurricane of of Florence\nA you know we talked about you know the rest of the president\nDoing something on that but all we're really not sure but allowing the the the increase to happening actually up and all was supposed to be about reducing global warming until they found out from farm to tank it actually produces more global warming gases\nBecause of what you have to do to actually make up and all and we just mentioned that the president doesn't bring up global warming is just a with the government needs to uh get involved in this in order to help the farm right um\nAnd then we have the United nations\nComing out and saying we're doomed\nBecause of global warming that we are uh you have a\nAl Gore traveling the United nations as well that we have twelve more years yes been twelve years now I I Know I Know you're we're already passed the first twelve years aren't we yeah yeah you never know what this twelve years they mean and so\nSo how do we solve it well the United nations special climate reports suggest a tax\nOn carbon dioxide emissions would be need to be as high as twenty seven thousand dollars per ton at the end of the century to effectively limit global warming ... that means you would have to have a two hundred and forty dollar per gallon tax on gasoline in that year\nHuh now should such a recommendation be adopted yeah in twenty thirty the report says a carbon tax would need to be as high as fifty five hundred dollars that's the equivalent of forty nine dollars per gallon\nGas tax by twenty thirty well then the experts we'll be right cars won't be on the Republican Party ... won't be anywhere I won't be able to get it on my desk but his little centrally be a paper wait a ...\nKnow and so all of a sudden we're back to you know global warming again as we said we're just a few weeks mhm uh you know before a mid term elections so the Democrats got to bring out the old standby\nJust ... we're we're waiting for the race card to be played a because the global warming card now is being played and as we talked about in all seriousness we talked

so\nUm [noise]\nI just you know interesting the actual politics of it but you know and and we will probably you know hear it again after a hurricane Michael ... a again the blaming of President Trump oh sure and that's why like I said during limburg if you want to check out his stuff\nOr he writes some great articles and he does believe again or he believes global warming is happening he believes humans are partly responsible for it but he believes that what the left is doing is completely wrong look to we have an interest act interesting prospect yeah do we have an impact of course we have an impact\nBut we're part of this life cycle here on this planet yes Ivo as people always ask what do you think and I said I don't own neither do you write and I don't think anybody really knows you can

morning guys our very good\nAll right well one of the reasons they started incorporating ethanol or allow all into the fuel was that they use cues what was called MTV that whole tribunal ethylene as an anti ... anti knocking right turns out it yeah it turns out it was a carcinogen being put out into the air so they started replace them with alcohol alcohol\nYou can't have two hundred proof alcohol it ... it absorbs moisture from the air so the most you're going to get it like maybe one Ninety five one Ninety something like that so it's great for the farmers to increase the percentage of alcohol and the fuel bland\nHowever alcohol doesn't hold the same amount of energy right around them as gasoline does yeah whoa you're mileage fuel mileage so which screwing the consumers ... doing\nWell look we we had no problem with the we we had no problem when which part\nConsumers ... doing yeah well look we we had no problem with the we we had no problem when we talked about this report without you know for\nUh the anti knocking capabilities that's not what the temperature studies is\nNo good ... percent mandate existed initially for global warming right yeah we didn't know but look we have no our problem is the fact that yeah it's great for the farmers will anything would be great if the government mandates that you must make something and the consumer must buy it it's always great for that industry to have that kind of\nMonopoly great government dictates All right you need to do this for the what's the reason well for global warming well what's the reason now to make sure you have a job ... for video robot here's your forecast\nHurricane Michael is a category one hurricane slashing Cuba and is now for cats to be a dangerous major hurricane when it smacks the U.S Gulf Coast tomorrow according to the national Hurricane Center\nThe forecast indicates Michael May be a category three hurricane with wins from between one hundred eleven to one hundred twenty nine miles an hour when it strikes\nLife threatening storm surge is almost imminent along most portions of the Florida coast in the Big Bend area we'd be looking at a well built framed homes incurring major damage trees can be snapped in these kind of wins\nAnd on the air this is going back ten or eleven days as you and I were discussing why were to go to the inspector general and all the sudden it was\nDoug that's the role of the inspector general is to do what is to investigate corruption there it's the you don't give it to the inspector general to save review this and tell me what I can release and what I can uh you know what I can under attack\nYou eat that for that you use\nYour a director of national intelligence ear CIA director and uh your your uh a secretary of state it was a former CIA director those are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director now but you know a secretary of defense those are the people you would go to\n... to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassify it or not and I say you're secretary of state former CIA director because they claimed that some allies\nOr didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was wait a minute what are their allies no they don't know what's in their right how how do they know that the and we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to ah the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nThey were they ... that it went whoa [noise]\nLook at this but yeah the conclusion we came to was that if you are looking if you're looking to get this to the inspector general of the apartment of justice\nThan you're basically asking him to do an investigation and to issue a report they said that acts but they asked for an expedited process here from Mr Horwitz and\nThe only reason you do that is because of the role of a Michael Horowitz the inspector general's office in in the overall is to do what\nTo look at possible fraud or misdeeds done within the ... of justice fraud or a rounding up to ... and all of that would be and if you think about it because I I'm thinking of a a a John Bolton in the room with the president and also or his chief of staff\nOr Kelly is well looking at that and saying\nIf you come out and make a conclusion or draw conclusions from this information or by de classifying it and we see the on redacted information here if we jumped to the conclusion well first of all\nThe executive branch is not really that there's no prosecutorial power there you would have to go through a a the the department of justice itself but where would you start at the department of justice if you believe that people that are either they're in place or were there before\nCommitted a you know a crime possibly or there was fraud or corruption or any of those items that would be on a plate of the inspector general's office for you would start with Michael Horowitz that's the only way because beyond that\nYou're looking at just a political move that's all the way it would be played it would be well the president saying this and\nThat's not what we think if you take that off the out of the political arena and that's exactly what you do hear [noise]\nThink about the fact that you're not sending it to the attorney general even\nThat could be seen as a political move because he's an appointee\nBy the president right while or are they are supposed to be a ton of us and you know ... or which is someone that's been in place since before he was appointed by Obama he was appointed by Obama but more importantly ... that's a key to opening the door and ending\nThe discussion about whether it's politically motivated\nMore importantly\nWhat the inspector general is designed to do in the ... report you might see from the inspector general's office when we went through the inspector general's report ah on the FBI there were a number of things in the uh the Hillary email investigation a number of things there that we found now\nThat you're taking this I guess otherwise mundane report and you're trying to basically build the narrative as to what was going on in this case of the other report of at the FBI under the direction of a then director James Comey\nAnd what was going on and and how the Hillary email investigation uh was handled into and then parlayed into the Russian investigation and all that\nNow you have here by the way I think that's part of it to\nYou already have an existing report that covers part of the timeline and Fox\nAre the most important part of the timeline that would be outlined in\nPotentially in this classified are now de classified information so now Horowitz having already done the investigation\nOn the FBI and how they handled the Hillary email investigation and then the Russia investigation now he has all of that work done the legwork done there to possibly lend support to this new investigation and um and it's I I think\nInteresting and I think very key that the president turned it over to Horwitz and basically washed his hands up and for now\nAnd I think it's important to remember Giuliani has been saying that he believes it perjury happen that right you had somebody in the FBI verify because that's his charge okay and and again we're just going on speculation by what\nPeople who claimed the familiar with the matter a believer in and he is a former prosecutor what he believes his that\nHe believes there is possible perjury in the fact that ah the Pfizer warrant and they supporting documents for the Pfizer warned that they swore were intelligence when they were opposition research and when the when everything was ... ah rejected excuse me on redacted\nWhen everything was opened up and declassified so everybody can see it\nBill how they got the Pfizer warrant application the surrounding documents the trio Jews and the communications between the higher ups of the FBI that somebody in the administration said\nDon't release this Mr President because if you release this it'll be viewed as political you solve with Adam Schiff said Adam Schiff said well he's only partially released in what they want to really solve it\nNote if you believe that you see the corruption and that's what we believed they believed 'cause you only give it to or with because you believe possible crimes have been committed ... either something extremely wrong or crimes have been committed\nAnd you give it to the inspector general because at that point he can come out with a complete report and not just use you know the the unproductive evidence that you have but he can go look from anything he wants in the department of justice and get it to help build his case he has access to the documents that the that the ...\nThe oversight committees could not get from the FBI there is no process that stops Horowitz from walking in and obtaining those documents that the the those oversight committees have been trying to get for a long time he has direct access to all of that information\nI Want to read a parts of this from John Solomon that adds to all of this he goes the department of justice and the FBI had tried to thwart President Trump on releasing evidence suggesting that will harm national security make allies less\nOf all the accusations that he's tried to obstruct the end of the Russia probe before you judge the arguments from the department of justice and the FBI which are similar to those offered to stop the release of information on the other major episodes in American history from the bay of pigs to nine eleven consider\nAny it does the the chapter on the house intelligence committee's report earlier this year on Russian interference\nIn the twenties sixteen presidential election until this past week the foot no really had garnered no public intrigue in part because the U.S intelligence community blacked out the vast majority of its verbiage in the name of national security before the report could be made public\nFrom the heavy redacted arguments all one could tell us at the FBI general counsel James Baker met with an unnamed person who provided some information in September twenty sixteen about Russia email hacking impossible linked to the Trump campaign\nKnock out a reporter or policymaker would have added an eyelash over such a revelation than last Wednesday I broke the story John Solomon that Baker admitted to Congress in a non classified setting repeat in an unclassified setting that\nHe had met with the top lawyer at the firm representing the DNC and received allegations from the lawyer about Russia Trump and possible hacking\nIt was the same DNC along with the Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign that funded the unverified salacious dossier Ga by the British intel operated Christopher Steele that became a central piece of evidence\nUsed to justify the FBI surveillance of the Trump campaign and the final days of the election he's been following this but what are you saying here's another example again at the FBI and the department of justice\nThese these things aren't top secret it's not about national defense you know it's about ... there are ... otherwise Baker wouldn't have been saying it in a non classified setting that was the point [noise]\nSo are there you go just a little bit of an update on here and we will keep we keep you updated on it because we believe it's the most important unreported story really in the mainstream media today and that's it and thanks to Sarah a quarter and Solomon and some others you

legitimacy of the Supreme Court is now gone ... of course that's ... right\nAh it it it isn't I mean that's the ... when when you're lost or anything else to say that's that's what you say\nThe only other thing as I've said I let it was yesterday showing and I and I do believe this was something the Republicans need to work out and I said maybe I was nitpicking after Republicans were celebrating their victory but\nUh when I heard a Mitch McConnell afterwards being asked a question about conservative justices he even use the term conservative justice\nAnd I said look we need to as conservatives we need to take that out of it it's not conservative versus political on the Supreme Court it's originalist versus liberal that's what it is if you want to be accurate as to what is actually going on it's\nThe liberals who wish to put on judges who passed legislation\nVersus not conservatives who wish to pass conservative legislation\nIts original list construction has also been they've been called but originally we want to stick to the original text of the constitution and say it's not our job to legislate now that may be a conservative idea but sane liberal versus conservative justices\nGives you the indication but it's all political and it's not\nFrom the point of view of a conservative the kind of judge we want is one who will protect the constitution not change it changing the constitution is up to a are changing the law or the constitution is up to the legislature or the constitutional amendment process ...\nAnd it's that simple and we need to as conservatives\nOr we need to and libertarians we need to promote that\nThat it is we the people who are elected representatives that need to be making the law and not abandoning the constitution and\nHaving a judge has become legislators and we haven't explained that it up and so when I hear even in the media on a consistent basis in once in a while I'll even split\nThe was it the the the Thursday or the ... the Thursday or friday when when Chuck Todd said you better not miss work tomorrow that had to be like what was\nThat ... right around Labor Day that was the friday how do I into Labor Day when and and that was because you know Mueller's going to let the investigation nobody's even talking about Russian collusion now it's gone on anybody's radar it seems like that was ten years ago\nAnd that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds and so when I woke up yesterday I started thinking\nWhat are Democrats thinking the issue is what's the issue that they can go after Trump out what's the issue that will even grab\nDemocrats right now to say oh yeah okay that's the issue you and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our annual we're doomed to update because of global warming\nAnd we're thinking of the Democrat's gonna jump on that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the Obama administration that and raised on a consistent basis\nAnd so I was looking at your earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting to start some time by the end of the week because it's been their old standbys just what they've always use now even though at the same time the American people have said they don't care\nWe don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations\nOr the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well are you folks in Washington may not and you people to belong to a certain groups or or you know or or may not but for the most part we get along and global warming well you haven't major case to the vast majority of America let me go get a burger\nYou know and we we actually stay to during the Obama administration I'll never forget it where we said are they doing this on purpose\nBecause I actually think that if we don't talk about the issues of the day if we don't talk about the economy 'cause remember the economy never had three percent growth the entire time of the Obama administration and you and I would talk about this all the time saying there seems to be no interest in talking about making the economy better\nNo it wasn't even at this story that was being discussed\nAnd and they just went back to global warming and and race\nSo I really find it interesting as to as we are now just a little under a month from uh from election time to watch what's the Democrats issue what are they actually going to use besides impeachment if they think that's going to work which brings me to this article Wall Street journal Bobby Jindal\nFormer a former governor of of\nAh Louisiana two thousand two thousand sixty Democrats try some self restraint now I I like Bobby Jindal but this may be a little bit delusional\n[laughter] without just right [laughter] uh it's\nNot certain the Democrats just want to read parts of it because I actually started laughing during it or it's not certain but that's okay he's trying to be an optimist mhm I'm being a complete and total sitting here at this moment but I think justifiable I can justify it it's not certain the Democrats will retake the house but if they do they will likely ignore\nTheir leaders preferences and pushed to impeach President Trump or perhaps\nJustice cabinet and the swap with Clinton era of positions Democrats now lecture the nation that
