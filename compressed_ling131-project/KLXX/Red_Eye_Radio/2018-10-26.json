wanting to wait for a very good and we got to release Lucy show for this or do we do extremely busy or just on the suspicious packages of questions so unfair or they log bombs were a lot it's really amazing\nGoing through the different news stories yesterday right from a you know you can go to war news story that will say all you know log bomb to go to another one so suspicious package or go to another one that's ...\nPotentially explosive or a packages you'll get the you know between from the ... that were you know training they use those potential you know potentially explosive devices and dangerous devices\nA Cheryl ackison formally uh you know CBS News she's been following it and her latest one is look nobody has said these were actually lied bombs that could have gone off a officially earlier she got a written the skulls by about seven hours ago issued written or the ...\nThat said that any of them are and then she uh clarified it a couple of hours ago and said now they're you know they're still calling them\nSuspicious packages and ... right potentially suspicious packages and I think it's important and I you know you just you just wonder I mean now we and we'll get into this year and a little bit now you know we know the trail they're down in Florida but I think another play you know looking at a New Jersey whatever you're getting all these leaks\nRight but nobody has leaked really one of the most important things which would ... would get would give or you you would think the media would want the opportunity to go down different paths like Frank and so my first question would be where they live bombs or not mhm where they were potentially explosive devices that doesn't tell me anything\nWell and and what I don't see here is is uh is is this an over abundance of\nOf of caution in a warning when we go back a several months to the Austin bombings you saw the uh the authorities in that area you know because they didn't know what they were dealing with right they were talking about how people in the Austin area\nShouldn't approach a any kind of package on their porch or even their own porch\nEspecially something they didn't order or anything else they had to be very careful about now there have been some you know a alerts out there but for something like what's going on right now if we were looking I think if you're looking at life bombs especially the fact that\nRight now you've got them all over you know it's not just in one location it's not just Enron area they're all over\nIf that's the case then you have carriers and you have a a number of people who might be handling such packages and also the unpredictable nature of someone who might be responsible for this that if these are alive than\nA that can be very dangerous to the public and what I'm not seeing as this uh this this great calling for you know the public to be extremely aware of this while they have been the media's been putting it out there\nKnow initially they weren't going to initially they weren't going to fire that wasn't in their plans are and what initially just for that for what you said they weren't going to do it as you

percent half\nAlmost half of that growth just under half mhm\nThe middle of last year or two right now of two point nine percent half\nAlmost half of that growth just under half ... uh is because of government increased government spending defense spending federal spending increased state and local spending you and I've talked about the flaws of the GDP\nRight you know and it's the only thing that you can go by so you go buy it and not that there wasn't government spending before but they looked at the acceleration of the increase in spending\nAll over the last year and said that is cause for half of it and the reason that it's important as you know we look at you know everything in an economy and what might affect it\nWe look at the good portions that we've seen mhm we've also looked at the things that can hurt the economy\nThe the terrorists increased because of that the increase in cost of of timber and steel and materials or the you know the the housing up or slow down over the the the last month a government\nAt times believes that they can and people believe the government can help the economy and at the same time manipulated into success by picking winners and losers and they can't\nLook not that there's anything wrong with increasing defense but I don't know there um but what we want to do is set that aside and look at\nWhere the growth is and isn't in the private

talking about what's at the tweet was a Donald Trump junior that\nPut it out earlier yeah Donald Trump junior making some a very good points on social media uh yesterday Thursday and and I think on Wednesday as well\nSaying well where was the call for civility when someone sent fake rice and to his residence and\nAnd it was you know that got ultimately close to to his wife it was intended for him Donald Trump junior and the same thing happened to his brother he was asking ah I forget who was he was asking\nUh in in that tweet or he was responding to somebody else's tweet um but that's that's the whole thing is that there was no call for civility when that happened I mean you see a number of things that happened\nUh that and with any president or presidential family but especially this well\nYou've had how much you know that has happened had been said um and we have to point out because Gary laid it out a and thank you my for the call\nA this was the last several months ago\nBut you're talking about when you call someone\nHitler what the threat is\nAnd then we were talking about civility then that was the setting yes and the media was you know talking about well civility and civility we'll wait a minute when you compare to someone to a arguably one of the worst\nMass murderers\nIn history pure evil you're saying the threat to someone is that guy is capable this person is just like Adolf Hitler and his capable of doing the same heinous thing and when you do that that becomes a threat\nThat that you're saying that this person\nIn this case the president is the same kind of threat that Hitler was\nAnd that's the ultimate\nThe call for civility and the media pretending like this is all on the president you got to give me a break rhetoric is one thing comparing him to a mass\nThis is all on the president's you got to give me a break rhetoric is one thing comparing him to a mass murderer ... one of the most evil people to ever exist on earth\nThat's very different [noise] uh not only Hitler but when they combine Hitler with fascist and the or Terry in mindset yeah Donald Trump which has to be a dictator as we've said nothing indicates set in anything that he has done in any of his executive orders anything that he has fought from the court's everything\nHas in in my opinion but let me All right let me say this Ninety nine point nine percent of what he has has of what he was promoted maybe somebody can find one percent and make an argument that that will be willing to listen to so I don't want to say one hundred percent ... so Ninety nine point nine percent of what Donald Trump is that is promoted\nOr his rhetoric may offend you\nOr his provocative nature may ah offend you but what does he actually does does he desert is it fair to relate him to one of the worst mass murderers\nGenocidal mass murderers in the history of the world right is that even close to any type of accurate portrayal no it's just pure demonization and inflammatory rhetoric and what is it designed to do\nIt is designed to create range in the people that will believe you fear and right it is not an attempt to have a discussion on the policies of the president\nWell let's look at this and is that too much government intervention no it's Hitler it's the same as the guy\nWho are committed a genocide of six million human beings in concentration camps that's what Donald Trump is\nHe's a fascist let's throw most selenium there to\nWell what you know while rabbits and let's combine Hitler was Mussolini and let's combine the worst\nBrutal evil people that have ever existed and say that as Donald Trump\nWell of course that's just the most bizarre and inflammatory things that you could possibly say and\nThe other point that we made over the last couple of days is after the Steve ... shooting\nA going after the the I Can't think of his name right now but the man who was a a you know a supporter of of a Bernie Sanders who attempted to assassinate members of Congress if it wasn't for the Capitol police you probably would have quite a few dead Republican Congress people right now ...\nAh they came to the defense and we're we're able to stop that that situation Steve skull east represented ...\nSeriously injured did that change the rhetorical nature\nThe inflammatory rhetorical nature of Democrats at all or have they ... it up to the point of as we saw with Kavanaugh hotter insanity over the last couple of months that reality is it's not going to stop [noise]\nWhy we live in a nation of free speech and people are are going to go to the limit of their of of of free speech they're going to go to the ... that's just what happens\nIn our society we may not like it people may view it as an civil but it's the reality of where we live and what is the thing that will temper that what will temper that is if they continue to lose elections Americans must reject\nIs if they continue to lose elections Americans must reject [noise]\nMust reject that and it gets to the it gets to that point and so you know we we have talked about you know also the morality the media\nAnd and this is that we think extremely important when you look at Donald Trump being accused of treason [noise]\nThe Russian collusion almost two years of it [noise] never ending pounding by the media [noise]\nAnd they sit there you know when Sarah Sanders defense and said look it's it's been ... the the law is against this president coming from the media had been never ending right\nThe source stories that have been inaccurate that you hide behind your sources say well this is what our sources told us well if you can if it's not true and you can't prove it's true you don't always believe your sources well it you\nKnow you have or the remember the indictments that came down with Papadopoulos and Manafort and the president tweeted a that day you know no collusion\nAnd then the New York times article that said he was tweeting that as they were proven collusion something to that\nEffect nope nope\nNo ... and that's false that that is a blatant lie or complete incompetence either you don't belong at any you don't belong on Twitter\nIf you're if you're putting that kind of if you're a reporter putting that kind of BS out\nMuch less a major newspaper\nBecause there was no proof\nNone still is done\nTo this day nothing and you have what a false narrative that has gone on and still goes on\nAnd no one knows\nBut more has in front of them\nThat may change\nWhat what has been changed I'll tell you right now\nIs the false narrative will think about this it was just a couple of months ago in front of the White House remember they were there for days ... because\nOf Russian collusion right and trees and the president now we have the midterms it's not even a topic of discussion right it's like okay we can't go anywhere with this lie that we have perpetuated for the last two years so let's move on to something something else\nAnd then they they attempt to walk away as if oh no we barren no responsibility for the\nInstability that happens today or the heightened inflammatory rhetoric that exist today were completely innocent were just reporting\nOn we're just we're really don't think it's a bunch of crap right the only thing we're doing is telling you that uh she got there illegally he came to power illegally and with the help of another major nation\nThat is the ah that that in terms of nukes is the only match really for the United states on the planet in terms of a threat\nAh he is he works for the Russians\nHe's friendly with the Russians he's a fascist and he's capable of killing as Hitler was\nRemember it was just a couple of months ago we had followed the survey for the last ... over a year and that showed that the majority of Democrats still believe that the Russians hacked into the election machines and twenty sixteen [noise]\nYeah and we have a um\nAn election coming up in what eleven

into the background and we were you and I talked about this when it first you know\nMost about a week ago mhm was first started that uh when we come back from vacation and\nWe saw the you know we saw social media and lot of Republicans were saying well this they're doing this in order to affect election day\nLook ins were saying well this they're doing this in order to affect election day\nAnd you and I came in and said wait a minute when you see how far away they are and how far they can walk in one day they're not going to get here to weigh after election day so really this is only to hurt them this is not going to\nHelp the the Democrats are and I saw the story that the president you know plans on sending you know eight hundred troops down to the border\nIsn't as big of a stories I thought it would be and I wonder that over the past week at the media has looked at this and said this isn't going to benefit us\nLet's bring it up after the the midterms fried we believe this is actually helping Trump right and so since this isn't really going to say this is only going to hurt us before the midterm that's sort of bury the story a little bit or not give it the emphasis that we were given it before\n[noise] yeah I mean it's it ... it is the the um\nThe the political tool at the moment right so if there is a greater political tool than you kind of jumped to that\nAnd we'll see where the story goes with the you know suspicious devices or whatever we're calling them now I'm over I suspect that if if they know\nWhere these things are being mailed from there it will only be a matter of time if if if not hours\nBefore they find out or at least know who the person might be\nUm and and and even apprehend them someone had said on Thursday morning was watching some of the coverage and a one law enforcement I'm\nA expert not not an unofficial or investigator in the case but an expert commenting said it's quite possible we could see somebody arrested are apprehended as early as today and that that's just just based on how quickly it works and how much physical evidence there is in this case\nYou get that and and we find out what the motivation is I guess of the person possibly\nI'm assuming that they are taken alive\nAnd it becomes again I'm that changes this narrative and and do you go back a few of the media or you're a an operative on the left\nYou go back to the caravan um the caravan thing it kind of paused because of so many I guess I'm concerns along the way now you had um you know the the department of homeland security saying look you know people will be apprehended\nThat's going to be the case\nThey it's it's like we said there's no way they can stand on the other side of the border and that's you know up to Mexico was as to you know where they put them or or or what they're going to tolerate in terms of behavior and protests but when they try and crossed into the U.S [noise]\nThere are some not all but there are some of the right that want to believe the rhetoric they want to believe the height\nYou know you and I and and that's why we you talked about dictator remember when uh we would sit here Obama's Muslim and we said where's the evidence right\nWell his father now where's the evidence that that's what he believes if you look at what he believes what does he believe he believes more in the church of Jeremiah Wright mhm\nWhich wasn't preaching you know Islam but was preaching hey [laughter] and not Christianity but was preaching a radical hate him or hate America or a [noise]\nMessage message just thank you very much and it's a friday or hate America message ... as we said come on\nIf you look at Obama certainly not religious when you think\nThat if somebody like Obama worships anybody else out there doing really really think that you really think he's a devoted that there is a got up there that tells him what to do ... please and so we had some fun with it but we said no the evidence doesn't show that at all evidence matters across the board and we've been pushed back because we've done that\nOr one of the biggest push backs we had\nWhen we made fun of jade helm\nFifteen remembering twenty Fifteen ... remember the number of people that called us and were furious at us\nBecause we were a mock and it was ridiculous oh the government's secret they're going to be in Texas and it's these a secret raids that are going on and and remember the tunnels and Walmart and everything else and people are jumping aboard this crap mhm and it's pure crap and you buy into it\nSeparate yourself from those idiots over their deal with the truth that's all you need to do is deal with the truth not being fantasy bizarro conspiracy theory world\nBecause everyone knows the tunnels were under target exactly [laughter]\nWell I mean we're we're just going to start\nWith I I never forget the I'll never forget that moment in a jade home\n... Fifteen when you know it was the\nWe were getting barrage of phone calls you guys just don't understand you don't understand where we know we know we know and that's always the argument from the conspiracy theorists oh you know something that you don't know there are more I feel special mhm because somebody else has told me in and and I know and this is when they were talking about how top secret was and we had to bring out\nOf the uh a press release that was done from the local chamber of commerce in one of the counties that you know you were going to have the special forces in that\nThat was done from the local chamber of commerce at one of the counties that you know you were going to have the special forces in that had already figured out the economic benefit to their county right by me\nDown somebody that was going to be spent on any of those things are going to be may be spent that's how secreted was right that the chamber of commerce had done it I mean they've spent over two million on the tunnels under Walmart alone [laughter] you know we we dealt with it and we we dealt with it after the nine eleven conspiracy thrives remember we had to go to\nWe actually had to go on the show to Popular Mechanics and these are people that listen to our show yes\nSo it's for us it's a constant fight and you know with the nine eleven conspiracy theories that people were buying into I remember we had to re portions of Popular Mechanics number Popular Mechanics said look\nI'm we do mechanics ... and so we weren't getting get involved in this and we realized wait a minute that's what we're here for\nThese things these theories about mechanics in physics are being put out there that's what we do like to see whether they're actually possible or not uh what was the other way we uh we dealt with it um\nWe dealt with it the night of the Saturday all brothers\nOh man so we go on it we had been getting a information coming in about what was going on what in Watertown uh uh about thirty minutes before we went on for about eleven thirty central that night\nAnd we started coverage route twelve thirty when we started getting confirmation of the of those reports 'cause there there was breaking news and we we continue that coverage or through the end of the show\nSomewhere in the middle of the show we started getting emails is the Boston bombing the other by bombing suspects and when they essentially went through water town and\nAnd uh that night that uh you know one of them died and the other one uh eventually was captured the later but when you look at the [noise]\nThe the ... about I don't know half way through the show when we looked at our email that was coming in and it was about well it's ... it and they gave us specific names [noise]\nThese are the people that they're chasing these are the people that there why are you saying this asking us\nAnd they were ... by the way they were to Middle Eastern names right\nAnd look we're not going to be\nI don't have any\nA desire to go out in the first\nI only have a desire and I believe responsibility to be accurate if we're because we often report on breaking news we don't I Do I Do not\nWant to be I don't want to put something out there I don't want to be a Brian Ross at ABC\nBecause here's what's different about specific names if we if the details do change on on breaking news stories we know that better than most people because we recover and we've covered some big stories over the years\nThe details do change\nBut we're talking about like numbers or maybe okay it was over on this block or it was in this town not this town what it is a specific name if those names belong to people who are innocent Brian Ross\nOr anyone else that might be reporting something\nThen you start saying that because Brian Ross at ABC after the Aurora shooting well right there's information that there is a man with that name that belongs to the Tea Party well\nHow do you know it's the same one you just put that on ABC TV and they got burned and and he got burned big time\nAnd it is our goal to be accurate but the thing is is that there were people just they just kept pounding as for the last half of our show because we weren't putting the name out in fact you and I it wasn't until about thirty minutes after the show was done when authorities announced who they were chasing them\nAnd that at least the sunny and we set it on the air we set it on the air that look there's a couple of names out there we just can't verify from any legit source that we believe that we have confidence in that it is that that is true and and as you mentioned thirty minutes after our show\nThat wasn't the people right and so\nAgain we were called every name in the book we're you know you name it we were called at for hiding the truth from the people\nSee that's the implication hiding something from the people were not looking to hide anything we're just looking to be accurate [noise]\nAnd so when I look at this week that's what we've been focusing on\nIs for the Republicans and the conservatives just focus on the truth\nThat so you can you can passionately attack the other side but don't play their game\nI've set up before they need to do it they don't have the substance of the issues they can't back up their points of view they need it it's out of desperation that they do it\nDesperate and whether whether\nWhether the side that I favor more wins an election or loses an election\nRight I have never felt the need\nTo use inflammatory rhetoric [noise]\nBecause I feel I have lost the substance of my argument\nTwo thousand two thousand they denied of election night uh you know uh the all the power goes to the Democrats\nAnd we got coals why aren't you guys angry [noise]\nLook it didn't go my way I'm disappointed\nHad my say in it well\nWe had been blunt\nUh I've a friend of mine yesterday posted wow you know the whole country's going much more conservative right now and I said look on social issues they aren't fiscal issues or not\nAnd explain it to him the debt ... the country is not going the way that I Want when it comes to debt Republicans don't care about the debt that we're putting on future generations right they've completely [noise]\nJust said let's not even pay attention to it right that doesn't matter anymore what we put on future generations doesn't matter anymore we don't care we think that's wrong for the Republican Party right we think that's immoral or the Republican Party to not be wearing that as a badge of honor every single day\nWe understand that's because they are following what the people are doing but yet the rank and file\nOf there and that's why we brought up that remember that the swamp\nJust three years ago the swamp was about Republicans who wouldn't be fiscally responsible mhm that's gone yeah I'd like that that swamp doesn't even exist anymore of fiscal responsibility and the Republican Party that drove\nIsm I'm looking at our cp right now the current makeup of the house it's a map of the United states read versus blue and it by and large is mostly it's mostly red

it it won't take it won't be long from there they're very good at what they do for video road log here is your forecast\nFinally a breaking the rains for Texas high pressure remains clear skies today over the state rain has moved to the east and we'll see it run today from I fifty five and I sixty five north and south\nAt a good part of the mid west and south will see showers today most device Seventy five will look to see rain later in the day it'll be clear in the northeast the desert southwest and dry in the nation's midsection\nAnd western parts of the country with the exception of coastal Washington and Oregon and the Northern Rockies\nDallas will be sunny today up to Seventy two degrees now that's up ten degrees from yesterday and Saturday even better eighty one in Dallas Chicago fifty two with rain showers today\nNow that are pretty simple run there through Sunday night high fifty three New York partly sunny today and fifty two with rain expected tomorrow\nAnd ran that would you run or campaign\nTo write whatever right you okay did did some man while you're sitting there I did it did did bill and Hillary completely changed any possibility right Chelsea ever having a ... which is why she would only agree to do it if she would be appointed if somebody stepped down a retired and she was appointed to that position imagine she\nRan in twenty twenty\nImagine that she just sweat\nThan I mean it was just in a while and I think and I I got her mom standing on background go and watch really my husband is my daughter [laughter]\nBut not me\n[laughter] [laughter] ah\n[laughter] it's okay you get to be first mom [noise]\nMm [laughter] [laughter] ah yeah\nWe'll we'll appoint you secretary of making pies\nYeah or is this a out yesterday senator district committee chairman Chuck Grassley announced\nThat he is referring Julie sweat Nick and her loyal a lawyer excuse me Michael ... to the Justice Department for potential criminal investigation as to whether they made false statements to Congress about Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and\nGrassley said that in addition to making false statements he is asking the Justice Department to look into whether the Tucson to obstruct his panels investigation of the allegations of Kavanaugh\nQuote the law prohibits such false statements to Congress\nAnd obstruction of congressional committee investigations for the law to work we can't just brushed aside potential violations I don't take lightly making a referral of this nature but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future Grassley set in a statement and\nHaving any quickly fired back in a tweet saying it was ironic that Senator Grassley has now interested in investigations\n[noise]\nThat would be interesting to see where a case like that would go\nYeah um you know you have a number of things there that\nHonestly [noise]\nThat that that warrants an investigation I think [noise]\nHere's here's the question what\nIf anything happens to it after the midterm\nAssuming like the house\nDoes it does an investigation like this\nIn happens to it after the midterm assuming like the house\nDoes it does an investigation like this go anywhere I guess [noise]\nBecause no reasonable prosecutor [laughter] what would pursue a a a a refer\nI I Would have to look at everything that Grassley has but here so he writes here in light of miss sweat Nixon Mr ... own statements to the media\nInformation obtained from committee interviews of her associates and publicly reported information about her and Mr ... it has become a parent that the statements Mr ... submitted to the Kennedy likely contain material false claims Grassley wrote in the letter\nGrasses across does not guaranteed Justice Department will open an investigation [noise]\nIs the last part of that\nAnd I'll send he sent a letter to attorney general Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray\nRight [noise] because\nIf the if the committee words to do I mean if they do an investigation then what what happened to that if they found that there was wrongdoing you essentially send the Senate you send a a referral to the Justice Department at that point I mean good for prosecutorial means\nIf you found that there was a wrong doing if you through the investigation your own investigation\nFrom I don't know everything that Grassley has yeah so I can so and I I can I can only speculate that if\nYou know she claimed the gang right mhm right right right\nAnd then but here's the thing\nYou the investigation doesn't go doesn't have to go too far because of the fact that she went on TV on a national television show on the today show and started to walk back some of the things in that sworn statement [noise]\nSo\nIt's not like you it's not like the uh the the\nThe house and their investigation into the Justice Department where you're looking at you know it's like pulling teeth and getting some of the evidence or documents\nYou have things in a sworn statement that are countered in a nationally televised interview\nThat are different by the same person\nAnd the question is you know what do you do with that I mean does the political climate change if a if the Democrats take the house or you know and does that kind of soften I guess the or or or steal from the the the desire\nTo pursue justice here oh that this will be the Senate's I Know I Know but it doesn't change anything about the sentiment because there has to be that well again it goes back to that political will I think again no one is above the law and if you go through the process and this this really focuses on\nThe the ... if the uh the\nTearing down and the ... of the actual process itself by the Democrats especially Ron that committee during that process we know that that was the you know the the hearings what we're about Dr Ford but this war was to add a this was adding to a an intended to influence\nThe the outcome of the vote on Kavanaugh the confirmation vote on Kavanaugh it was part of that entire you know process well it was a separate from Dr Ford part of the camp a confirmation process so\nWhen you talk about doing it doing away or trying to do away or or completely dilute\nOr shred the process\nThat in the cell just then then I don't know why you wouldn't at least pursue an event\nWell when we had the left come out and said look this isn't a trial this isn't a trial we said well no it is a political trial and\nThe trial which is you're under oath ... if you commit perjury mhm [noise] in you know if it is and that's what he believes you know making false statements perjury is\nYou know that is against the law that you are breaking a criminal law at that point right as we said it's different than a criminal trial but it is a political trial that has similarities you are put under oath\nAnd so the circus that we saw going on and I understand we're Grassley is going from if they if he believes and I don't know what evidence she has I don't know if anybody came forward after it I don't know who didn't testify or what information was not brought out the crash had that might you know that he might have now so I really don't know but if he believes\nThat he can make that case for making false statements base based on what she said based on the TV interview and based on\nWhat other people that might have come forward have come forward and a might have come forward since then have said to him absolutely he should go forward with that because it is a it is a legal process\nOr if somebody commits perjury or makes false statements they should be prosecuted we see what happens when we see what happens when somebody makes a false statement to an ... an FBI agent they go to jail\nMartha Stewart went to jail so should we said that when a political trial happens because that's what it was\nThat none of the law should be followed at all that people should be able to go in and make a circus other if you can prove they know you know that they lied and their lawyer lied and their lawyer put them up to line should you go after it I think\nThe majority of Americans if you ask them that generic question and kept the you know kept the case out of it the vast majority of Americans\nWould say yes because it is it was an attempt\nI think you can they would probably be able to prove through this investigation that the attempt the the the uh the the motive or what they were trying to do was disrupt the process\nAnd if you do that through false means ah well giving false testimony a sworn testimony to the Senate committee is against the law for reasons that that that's what that's about because that is a part of the process\nAnd if you if you can show that this was the the the clear intent here was to disrupt that process\nAnd you knowingly said things in that statement that sworn statement that were false\nWhy you wouldn't move Fort well that was whether they take the house or not this is now in the department of justice for just under the president so I don't see it stopping if they believe they actually have a castle ... because it does this really isn't at this point\nIsn't about political will\nBecause frankly the left doesn't care about sweat no\nOr have an addict [noise]\nSo you know my question on the on the house thing is that suffer from the political will it's not about political will\nEight six six Ninety red eye\n... radio sold for ... movie wrote a [noise]\nCheck out all the latest in news events trucking information jobs and podcasts at red

...\nIt's never been the most are accurate way we believe to truly a show the indication of economic growth\nBecause money being transferred back and forth or government spending is viewed the exact same way as private sector profits and sales and we believe that that distorts the actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent\nFrom democratic presidents to a Republican presidents well it's important to monitor the truth expansion of well\nYes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector not that we don't support an increase in defense spending no we're ... we're just talking about how we analyze how it applies to the economy is doing so without the increased in government spending\nOr you would have had a\n... a growth rate of of two point five six percent\nUp from the two point two percent from the Obama administration the point is how critical it is because you see the\nUp from the two point two percent from the Obama administration the point is how critical it is because you see the increase you see the increase in a huge increase why because of fossil fuels [noise]\nWhich drives the majority of\nThe private sector increase in GDP\nThat's still what's driving the majority increase in GDP in the private sector [noise]\nIt's still not as much as government spending\nSince April of of twenty Seventeen that's how much you know we have increased government spending\nOver the last\nYear and a half when that government spending goes away so does the GDP increase that's why we have been so concerned and we've taken a great deal of criticism\nFrom people who used to agree with us\nBut now disagree with us on the increased of increasing the cost of goods by terrorists and as we've stayed it doesn't matter who you are as a matter whether you call yourself a Republican or conservative or liberal a socialist a capitalist if you believe that an increased\nCost in goods in the marketplace benefits the economy\nThen you don't know what you're talking about is that simple\nAnd so that's why we have always been so concerned about trade\nAnd about artificially increasing the cost of goods and services\nWhen we've talked about the president and the new NAFTA [noise] the president's number one accomplishment on the new NAFTA has been what\nWhat he believes he has done to the car industry\nWhich will increase the cost of buying a car in the United states in Canada in Mexico and we'll make it harder to sell that product made in the United states overseas which was what the president claimed\nHe wanted on trade and we will continue to say this on tariffs the president is all over the place and when you're all over the place on a particular issue one has to ask do you have any idea what you're talking about well\nAnd as we are break down the GDP Growth and you look at it right now and the way that there's this long lead and then they point this out on his Wall Street journal article for items like aircraft carriers and things like this so we're likely to see as this money goes through the ... a Pentagon and then his actually spent and\nAnd and at through the contractors were likely to see some of this growth continue in terms of the defense spending growth\nA leading the way into twenty ... twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty so what's important here is that you kind of separate that from what the private sector is doing\nWe're the gross is in the private sector or where the lack of growth is\nIn the ... in the end of that you do yes you\nYou do have to separate the two because government spending even for\nA quip and even though there is a benefit for those companies doing it that's not why you do it right it's not ... it's not why you do it and but also that is\nThe majority of that money mhm of increase in that money is coming from borrowed money is coming from money that the that we are putting on future generations\nSo the economic impact overall may help now but down the line the burden of the debt is going to hurt one works against the other one the other thing is the multiplier effect\nIs not the same as in the private sector\nBecause a multiplier effect in the private sector\nWorks against the other one the other thing is the multiplier effect is not the same as in the private sector\nBecause the multiplier effect in the private sector is if you build something that makes somebody else else's life more efficient or makes their business more efficient they use it and it's the combination of building that good in service and the increased productivity along that private sector in line that really boost\nIt really is the true economic engine that that shows that you are having an economic growth think Tennessee in our society thinking of smartphone\nYes you know like it so that that is that that great demand because it's at that because it's\nCreates that efficiency and the society and in and productivity increased productivity and that's where you see again that multiplier ah the create that huge expansion and wealth and and ripple out you're not going to ... you're not going to see that with defense spending\nOn defense spending you will build the initial product ... but the initial product is used for what that's the cost of doing business\nMhm what your ... and so yeah we understand how that helps the GDP but you're creating something\nYou're using debt down the road it's where yes in the ... the funding ... write long term debt to to pay for it but then that actual good or service is not used in the private sector to improve the efficiency\nAnd productivity of other businesses down the line\nIt stays there and it becomes a a burden of the cost of doing business on an entire economy\nYes men that I mean the difference you could make a a very indirect or a link to it and say that it preserves capitalism in general you roll right but it but that does not have the same immediate effect that the private sector multiples are due and that's\nAnd that and that's why when you look and that's why when we bring up the terrorists and the cost of home building now and the cost of of of timber because those terrorists from what I Know ... until the deal is signed are still on with ah with with Canada the increase you you're talking about the two biggest drivers\nOf of when you talk about what were the consumer marketplace of drive the economy it's housing and cars boats have been targeted by terrorists [noise]\nWe haven't even talked about food yet and what a drag that might be down around the road and the big terrorist evident even hit yet and that's why we are we are so concerned with the direction of this White House when it comes to\nEconomics and I have no idea where has has the ...

term python you use explosive devices ... explosive materials\nAre we are we're following a Cheryl ackison formerly of CBS News or who was a on Twitter yesterday and and following it and apparently having the same kind of mindset that that we are we're finding all these this these things out about it yet the FBI won't be specific were these lied bombs and were they active\nRight because there's a difference in sending a message\nUm and and you know I mean they're the it could be that at first I guess the speculation is a and you have to include the idea of it being all of the above in terms of it being a threat in in terms of being a sending a political message or and and you know or a broader message I guess\nAnd when you start\nLooking at the terminology that the authorities are using\nWhat the I guess I look for first in some kind of public warning\nIf you're talking about a very sensitive package and a number of packages now that have been all over the country are not just in one city not just in one location but there have been a number of them in various locations\nThan you would think that the threat is still active knowing that it's happened now over a period of days are repeatedly\nAnd you would warn the public as to what to look for and we haven't seen that that huge warning in terms of these packages being a ultra sensitive and possibly going off simply is handled so\nA or at least have a description of the person\nThen after that assuming that the person is is a is captured and and and taken into custody alive it's quite possible we could learn a lot more about the motivation of the person even if they\nAren't taken alive if we learn the identity often you go to their social media page or something like this and you see a history of maybe comments that were made and you can see their political affiliation but if we learn that motivation\nI don't know what changes about the election right now because you look at the bigger things right um the the I think the Kavanaugh saying the the the caravan situation or immigration in general and and what's going on and\nWhere conservatives are\nI think with with ah with all of the above this is not the group that goes out and protest is not the grass roots people are screaming get out and vote get out and vote get out and vote [noise]\nIt is the silent type that has made up their mind they were

we talked about is you know states around the country wanting to legalize marijuana and all that for recreational purposes I was just telling you during the break we'll keep reading the story here that the city at the law I'm living in now is putting a petition in order to be able to sell hard liquor\nYeah we can't so hard liquor in our city and trying to make it so we can actually open up bars ... and if he got his private clubs instead of private clubs right because ah you know they they want you know they want more business it's not ... not making my city\nAre you know competitive with surrounding cities you know like Arlington, Texas and when he was\nYou know a huge city that can cut that can draw revenue when you're attached to them in a smaller city so I just find it interesting while other other municipalities around the country talking about marijuana we haven't even got to alcohol yet where I live yeah I don't even have a partition in my city to get the hard liquor\nNot yet right yeah so yeah we just got beer and wine to a couple of years to say I think we got it within probably the last twelve Thirteen Years yeah\nSo uh it's just a ... I didn't know my city my city is actually in four different counties yeah I didn't know that I thought we were in too I didn't know the great for and so there's different rules all over the place you know and I wonder I get\nMy city still has no dancing\nNot just on Saturdays you can't dance ever know dance jogging of live there's no dance a note card playing no dominoes um yeah\nFor on the track forecasts and finally a break in the rains for Texas high pressure remains clear skies today over the state rain has moved to the east and we'll see it run today from ... fifty five and I sixty five north and south\nBefore Democrats for a reason because it's likely get was it was said that way\nBy people they're concerned are going to vote right instead of left and they're trying to persuade them they're trying to influence them and and let them know that she's not one of the problem is is that it's likely\nIn part because of the capital of a thing and her vote in the cabin all thing and we said that\nYou don't have to be a you know someone else or who's on the committee you don't have to be a Kamala Harris or anyone else who did something you know that you consider to be crazy or your voters potentially consider to be crazy in order to feel the effect of it if you vote no\nThen you're going to essentially condone that kind of behavior and I think that's what she in part is facing right now in her state and that is\nYour vote was everything that they needed some of those independents needed\nA to make their decision and and could well this decide their vote on election day if it hasn't already an early voting\nYou will\nHave because I'm sure they'll be in some of the weekend shows you'll see some analysis of this as they do the analysis of a different commercials but I look at this is more than just affective ...\nOr Republican rhetoric I Do believe 'cause I'm trying to think of any ad where I've heard the Republicans said the crazy Democrats [noise]\nUh I I don't know a ... a ...\n... I don't know I don't know if it's if Trump is used data in a in a rally or not\nBut the fact is that ... this is in these independents that you're trying to convince in fact I was just thinking\nDuring the bottom of the hour break after our last segment I was thinking to myself 'cause we were talking about people that go out and vote\nThat I went out and voted the other day early voting I always go out and vote it's just a habit I always vote I voted before I was ever a talk show host you always went out and voted dad made sure when you got to be Eighteen he's brought up the newspaper everybody goes and vote she live in this house\nThere were two rules you didn't tell you who to vote for he'd give you his ideas of who he thinks you should vote for but you had to vote you would no choice you live in his house you voted\nAnd when you were sixteen you got your drivers permit to get your licence and you did not wait those are the two things you couldn't say wow I really don't you know couldn't be you know saying oh we don't know that wasn't happening in my family maybe my sisters but not my brother and I we wanted our licenses ASAP and so we were happy for that role\nAt Eighteen it was like huh okay but we had we had to vote so that was built inside of me I really don't understand the mentality\nWhich is why when we talk so much about independence this week we've got into arguments when people say well don't people don't react that way well you don't know and I don't know what we're saying is it's a possibility\nAnd when we say it's a possibility I've been getting the reaction back you know it's an absolute that nobody would react that way well you don't know that ... and that's why all these advertisements are going on because the politicians don't know that\nAnd so that's why they put out all these particular ads I don't know what it's like I don't know how to find somebody who only\nI'm undecided I don't know if I'm going to vote yet I might vote I might not vote but I'm undecided and all this massive advertising that is hounded my way I don't know what gets that person off there but as an undecided independent to go out and vote if they're still undecided at this point\nBecause think about it anybody listening right now isn't it very hard to imagine yourself as an independent not sure where you're going to vote in this election\n[noise] yeah this late in the process I don't know this this seems like one of those appeals especially using the words crazy Democrat it it it reeks of that almost desperate to peel or Hail Mary and it's it could be too little too late but you do it anyway\nBecause you believe that there's no risk in using but ...\nWhy is this what she decided to use them that desperate attempt because it's more than just Republicans that this was I guess my point it's more than just Republicans Colleen Democrats crazy that sticking\nIt's the fact that even if\nThey don't hear Republicans saying those crazy Democrats the appearance of Democrats\nIn the media is giving them this\nOpinion mhm for a Democrat to in a political ads for the Senate of the United states call her own party and I know people will say well she was into it it it was the actor no that's her doing it that's her ad she approves she assumed to it ripped she was saying they were crazy true that\nFor a senator and then cut in senator to say that\nMeans that sticking that is a worry\nRight now right with Democrats not just in the mid ... because it's not going away anytime soon\nThat's ... that is a worry right now right with Democrats not just in the mid term just because it's not going away anytime soon ... even if they get the house they still don't have the power\nI'm not sure that I Would even here I guess it depends on if the race were different with Joe Manchin if his race were different in terms of the numbers that were neck and neck if he would use that I don't know that he would use that what we've heard the the idea before you know over in the house side Tim right\nYou know trying to challenge a Nancy Pelosi\nOr you know back in the day but the fact that\nWere they saying the identity politics\nBut it's it that's that's gone\nFrom this at it's not about you know trying to ... it's\nInteresting because identity politics almost sounds like an old phrase\nRight [laughter] it full on craze that that's that's so right on the seven Jamie\nBecause you have to go straight to what people are saying and how do you connect with people in their own language\nThat's the difference is is what the people are clearly telling the McCaskill campaign and the feedback their internal are seeing that praise used repeatedly [noise]\nAnd that's why it was used in the ad\nAnd that's why it was our audio cut of the the week and I I burst out laughing when I saw the Claire McCaskill yesterday called for civility in the debate we need civility stability\nWhat do you mean you're calling your own party crazy [laughter] exactly how much do you really mean it if we look we can understand we understand them politics you call in the opposition party crazy throw your calling your own party crazy\nJust a crazy race isn't it [laughter] and and she really is who you're talking about being in the middle well she's a middle of a rock and a hard place that's where she's in the middle because you've ... she had to vote\nOn the Kavanaugh thing right I mean that action is there and it's lasting its recent enough at least and will be a through the election to make an impact and the behavior there it's remember they weren't referring to crazy Democrats the protestors on the street no\nNo this was the party they were talking about the party and we pointed that out during the Kavanaugh confirmation process you're not talking about fringe protestors on the street you're talking about people that were sitting on the committee these are these are leaders of the party\nAre you in and we were talking in reference to due process and present from the innocence this wasn't the radical protestors out there screaming you must always believe the woman this was coming from the mainstream of the Democrats and as we said most people look at that and we gave some of the credit to all the lawyer shows that have been on over the ... sixty years on television\nThat Americans may not know the constitution up and down but they do know the presumption of innocence and [laughter] and they do know the whole concept of due process because everybody has watch law and order or or one of the other many thousands of of of different TV episodes dealing with what goes on in courts\nAre in this country and they looked at that and they went this is crazy\nHirono white men need to shut up ... you look at that and you say that's crazy ... and it stuck mhm\nSo Claire McCaskill was forced in desperation to say I know this is the reality of what people now believe my party is I'm not a part of it
