that were uh\nUh uh you know are covering the landing of a of hurricane or Michael and I think in most of the you know the video that we saw in and I knew what when we when you know and I'm sure you do when we were watching it\nWe weren't seeing the major damage that was being done in some of those areas because for example in Mexico beach\n... nobody was there filming right because you you just couldn't be there they couldn't show that uh you know the the the conditions as a micro cameras were on uh with with\nRight because you you just couldn't be there and they couldn't show that um you know the the the conditions as a Michael came ashore on uh with with a a a very strong at a very strong category for\nA look at a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds and and just incredible I mean just look at the time span from last weekend up until\nA it the storm arrived\nOr the unpredictable nature of these storms and ... and how Michael a gain strength and was still gaining strength I ... if if the storm hadn't been moving as quickly as it as it was had it's slowed down at all over water\nI there's no telling I mean there's a I'm I'm confident this thing would have been a category five ... yeah I mean it was it came close to it anyway\nA mile a mile per hour away Riley yeah from from getting to that a a a point and I they did say later on you know the analysis of it they could you know\nA revisit it say that it was a fiber why lower for right ah I said when they when they get all the you know a data from all the instrumentation mhm uh they they could still update it but how uh\nHow terrifying it must be a whole blaming all I've seen so far still report I haven't checked in about twenty minutes but last time I checked only one death so far tribute to right and that was a

talking a you the cleanup is gonna it's gonna take weeks months I\nThere will be structures that will in some cases never be rebuilt a depending on their age and and and ownership\nThan others ... is this is ridiculous enough and as we've said when you when you think about it I I understand why they're going there because wherever else was there to go either you were going to make the decision as a party\nTo do what they said after twenty sixteen was look we've got to go to the mid west we've got to go to fly over country we have to start talking to people we have to find out what they you know what their needs are either you're ... you're going to go in that direction\nAnd talk about the economy and talk about those things or you were going to say our bases radical left\nAnd we need to go radical left and so this is obvious at you know that they're doing this this is obvious that the mainstream of the Democratic party have realized we can't beat this so we are also last week\nThere is no are you there is no road for them to turn around basically and come back reverse direction will you we'd said that two letters to get real well and and you know when we set it after the

that and every time they find a new place to go to because it's just now they're going to get in your ... not going to shout well what is what is beyond that right\nNow I Believe it's a terrible

I I I'm surprised we all saw him\nUm this morning he was actually streaming on our station in Panama City um and I believe is from Jacksonville television station um\nAnd um\nHe was in a parking garage yeah right it yes and and and his coverage or was seen worldwide people were picking them up\nOut um you know the TV station a that would be a W. J. H. G.\nOr which did streaming coverage um um basically when when we went off the air they started their streaming coverage\nAnd and continued until they lost more than just power they lost power at their transmitter sites and that was pretty much game over for them but they were only twenty feet above\nA sea level they were confident that their staff was going to be safe in that situation but they continue to keep an IT guy on board to make sure that they kept feeding that and so they set another sister station in our system through this gentleman in that garage I\nAppreciate his honesty because what he basically did\nWas documented where he was where he was standing yeah and and and and smartly I'm not going to go stand out there by the edge of the parking garage but what I found interesting was that that parking garage was also home for countless people in their cars yeah\nYeah I just the atrocity is his name and a lot of people were following him a Drudge Report actually even put up a lead a early Wednesday and\nUh and he had been during that time basically staging and showing you know the well a calm literally calm before the storm\nAnd and ah so he was he was broadcasting essentially a through periscope ah for periods of time thirty to forty minutes or even shorter times\nBut then as you mentioned are going live later and this is something that again it is too I think display the power of a storm for many of us that have never been through a storm and very few people relatively speaking\nHad been through a storm like this but when you're able to show people\nHow powerful this is what it does and he's just going to be there by the way he anticipated being there for up to a week or longer because he knows it's going to be next to impossible to get out of that parking garage the cause of the you know the damage left behind\nAnd that's what you hope to do you hope to show people that this damage and how powerful this storm is now hurricane Michael becomes tropical subtle undermined Michael or in the last hour or so but still when you look on the radar or Tom this thing right now Michael\nEveryone in the state of Georgia right now is feeling some effect of Michael as it's centered over a Georgia and moving toward the Carolinas what do we expect them next and the next twenty four to forty eight hours and beyond\nWell initially what we're going to expect in his life you know there there still is a life threatening storm surge going on [noise]\nUm to begin with a Panama City in along the coast there they still are anywhere from three to five feet or inundation going on right\nAnd so we haven't had a near the water to recede but we're also going to have tremendously heavy rainfall from Michael\nAnd that's going to be life threatening flash flooding and it's going to go across not just Georgia but the Carolinas and they don't need any more water right there still saturated and there are places that are going to become impassable it would not necessarily be out of the question\nTo to find some of the major roads Ninety five can I say Ninety five enough [noise] ah ... we're going to need to be aware of this is ... if if if you're if if you're working and your job is to drive somewhere bottom line is you're going to need to be alert\n... if if if you're if if you're working and your job is to drive somewhere bottom line is you're going to need to be alert to this [noise] uh the wins a high profile vehicles we're twelve hours from now still going to be looking now we've got a\nA Seventy mile an hour wind and within the next half hour they're going to update that with a with an advisory they were giving one hour advisories this was the last advisory at twelve o'clock eastern time\nThat we'll be moving on to ah just regular a three hour advisories\nAnd um and so it's going to accelerate and speed or as it becomes a little more entrenched in the mid level jet stream and so that'll picket speed up the I'm guessing\nA probably not by the time we're off the air but twenty three miles an hour a forward speed to the northeast and wins are still gonna be forty miles an hour\nForty to forty five miles an hour [noise] and so now above the surface where we don't have the friction of the earth five thousand feet winds have been already clocked I'm using Doppler radar\nOr at that level it eighty to eighty five miles an hour and so where there's a heavy cluster of thunderstorms in there is one currently ... crossing over highway six team which goes into making from savannah [noise] ah there's heavy rain there and\nThat thunderstorm translates those higher wins to the surface and so in those storms they could see gust to eighty miles or maybe even eighty five mile an hour gusts even though\nWe're looking at it a sustained speed of Seventy miles an hour so we're going to drop about in half\nAs we go over the next twenty four hours to around forty to forty five\nOf the speed of wins above the surface and and so right now as I said we're Seventy will be down to about forty five will still be in the tropical storm range and I believe that it will exit the United states or as we get up to friday morning out into the Atlantic\nAs a as a tropical storm ... wow\nSo we're not it's not it's not going to become a remnant it's not going to be just a cluster of storms that are moving their way off in a in a general direction John trout and great meteorologist or admire him a lot [noise]\nIndicated Ninety five court or and that's exactly what it's going to be following the court or although it will be on the west side of that court or and we've already learned that the west side of that court or\nHas some some some roots that are between Colombia and Ninety five and moving its way up toward Charlotte in Rockingham\nAnd so forth that are that have their own issues when it comes to a flooding and that includes going across Lumberton and Fayetteville and both of those areas um south of Raleigh which I think it'll scoot right past Raleigh\nThose areas are are we're going to have to be watching them as we go into today tonight and tomorrow or to see if we have more catastrophic flooding and damage we can probably we can probably say for the next time we talk about turning around and don't drown [laughter]\nRight right exactly and you have to you have to proceed with with caution and don't think you can get through it as you mentioned yesterday you don't know if that road has been washed away under the surface of the water you it's impossible to tell that so it's always best to turn around\nAnd certainly a we're going to keep people posted throughout the morning as meteorologists\nIt's impossible to tell that so it is always best to turn around and certainly

very noble profession you know the ... we were talking about it last hour would you like to do that [laughter] for some reason the song from the wizard of Oz if I only had a brain was going on ... mind I Can't figure out the connection but\nI'm sure I'll well\nI it's not I I could do it\nAt the thing is I ... now that I wouldn't want to do something like that mhm it's not a possibility it's not something I even ever thought of when I was young\nIt's like before though doing what they do on the weather channel or being a meteorologist like bad which isn't the average meteorologist out there let's be honest I mean what they are they're\nNot the vast majority of meteorologist but before that\nUh I I you know and as I got older I would've loved to be a geologist and I really would have loved to study volcanoes down I took I actually took geology geology course in college and I got a D in it and I had no interest in it at all not rise zero\nBenin talk radio twenty nine years and I believe right now\nFor is insane as it seems to be out there I Know the flag that I get is extremely light I think probably people who've taken it to social media but I really believe that the point is\nIs not that are that are arguments had changed any or had become stronger we may ... and I think it should be called talk show host you learn\nHow to debate better and put your points are for the better I think it's the fact that the opposition is completely and totally insane\nI mean right now they're just insane and so people you know they look and they say okay you know well what's what's Mac or saying today\nOkay I disagree with it but ah he's not insane like they are over there I really think it's worth of a [laughter] when were you know you if you're you're comparing and you're say okay what about ... what do I compare you too\nAnd when you see that the opposition\nIsn't articulating anything in any type of common sense or critical thinking fashion\nThat I think more people are just open then to or an ... an agreement just agreement to a an opinion that they might not even agree with one hundred percent but they see that there's rational thought and critical thinking to it mhm right\nWell and and they were and we do hear that from time to time but I don't agree with everything but I yeah I understand\nHow you get there a sense right mhm and we've had over the years we've had plenty of great discussions with Democrats liberals who call and want to have a saying discussion on the issues\nBut knowing\nThey're few and far between if they exist at All right now because I don't know what they're looking at their party\nAnd asking well how do we actually win something and then move forward you think about the word progressive\nThat's the whole idea right I'm taking the country to its next step that's a great point ... they're still using progressive don't thinks well you know that there's no way you can when they're saying get in your face and shot him out of the building that's progress\nThe answer is it's not that it's the opposite of progress\nThink the key is here is that it is the evidence the last couple of weeks and then what is just come to this week with the proclamation that we're not going to be civil anymore right until we you know to win a an until we win shows that they have come to the realization\nAnd that we're not going to be civil anymore right until we you know to win a an until we win shows that they have come to the realization that they cannot defend their own arguments on the substance of the ideas they are lost\nAnd it's just pure rage and emotion over what I don't know I Can't figure out a I tend to believe that we think in a in a in credit at a critical thinking way and they're just pure rage and emotion and I don't even have a debate right eight six six Ninety ...\nTips from Jay Jay Keller associates incorporated on customer service does your motor carrier provides uniforms for you to wear on the job does

A. or no pay off in two weeks you look at the\nTop ... the number of districts right now that are that are classified as toss ups are categorized as toss ups\nThirty two according to our sleepy and they're not doing they don't do polls on the house seats as often as they do for the Senate seats\nAnd I have to wonder what has changed after the cabin on hearing and confirmation vote and I have to wonder again in those districts keep in mind a number of those districts or the race is is on\nTo fill the seat that someone has is leaving a Republican stepping out\nAh what does that mean is the makeup of that district changing and we look at Texas thirty two uh that is uh the uh Pete Sessions or the the demographics in in his district are changing\nYou know um that's that's something that well changes politics\nAnd it's much of that district is uh I think in fact I think all of his Dallas County in Dallas County has gone balloon and well gosh going back to a Obama in two thousand eight so for a decade\nOr Hillary won in fact that district\nOr buy a point and a half I Believe it was\nA so we'll see what you know what that means for Pete Sessions as see right now is only a while and it was a poll in late September by one point\nBut he's been you know he's been somebody who has been a strong contender and years ago you would think well that's not going to change it does change in those districts when the demographics change\nI'm you know one of the things and and again you look for any type of barometer out there to see if you know the whole cabinet thing\nHad you know ... what kind of it it's going to have an impact it's what kind of an impact is going to have ... and and uh I look at Montana for example in Jon Tester and I I guess Charlie Cook came out the other day in and uh also has now said it's a toss up our see peace says it's a toss up\nTester's been up uh in July was up by three ... and early September he was up by two by late September he was up by four but that was the latest poll ended nine twenty to write a at a up over Matt Rosendale the Republican challenger what happens\nBy four but that was the latest poll ended nine twenty to write a at a up over Matt Rosendale the Republican challenger what happens in\nYou know that state as we get closer ah Jon Tester has never been over fifty percent in any of the the polling or a he is he is just over\nThe margin of error you know just slightly over in in his in his um\n[noise] a ... for example he was a plus for and that was a margin of three point seven margin of error and he was up by three that was march of two so he's over but now\nIt's a Senate race it listed as a toss up and the question is in a in a place like Montana\nWhere\nConservative politics still wins in the majority of Montana mhm\nAfter everything that we obscene and and not just cabinet but everything that's coming out now you know the Hillary videos getting played everywhere they you know it but we play down yesterday show the comments\nI'm of the former attorney general mhm are being played\nYou know a well if they go low will kept him from Eric Holder ... they're being\nPlayed or the you know CBS News story I mean even the mainstream media picking up that Democrats have said they're not going to take the high road instability now is there a politics of choice by the way had Sarah Palin said if they go low will kick 'em oh it would be the number one story\nAnd the mainstream eating right so you you see the strategy that they have which is not a strategy of expanding their base because it's not\nClaiming you're going to be you know on civil claiming that it claiming as we said during the whole cabinet thing 'cause this is what to me that was the big message it came out of it the ... the criticism that Democrats put on Republicans or anybody else\nThat didn't agree with them is if you if you believe the mindset of due process at a presumption of innocence\nUrine and ... ... you weren't able or a rape is that's what you do ...\nThat's the message that they set out I I ...\nIf that's a great selling point in America today than we certainly are doomed\nIf that if you believe that gives you an advantage and it does in an election then you're right we're heading down the wrong path that we we are doomed as we've always doing away with civility wins in America it will prove

Michael is now a tropical storm a latest update was so about an hour and a half ago or from the national Hurricane Center and a sixty mile an hour winds tropical storm now sixty mile an hour sustained winds\nAnd heading toward South Carolina yeah we'll hear from Tom uh his take on on uh the ... this historic storm as it came ashore but also what\nTo expect in the coming days ah is ah the people in Georgia right now are feeling the wrath of tropical storm Michael all the entire state basically covered by that storm massive massive footprint\nAlso coming up and say about uh apparently the or the FBI getting that man who was going to build a bomb for election day ... and detonated in Washington it looks like they went to his house and found two hundred pounds you know found some kind of explosive device or were like two hundred pounds you know uh\nYou you go back a day or two and listen to a Senator Rand Paul\nTalking about where the left is going and of course after his attack he knows all too well\nUh what people will do when they're politically motivated but talks about the greater potential love and and he said is concerned that there will be on the SAT there might be an assassination or in another attempted assassination\nOr we go back to the um uh the the the ball field is shooting\nYes no guy yeah wow yeah I did\nI just assumed by the time we got locked ... probably be cool down so I was surprised to hear that but the outer still warming up the up\nAnd all and and and that's why we're having these storms or you know the the normal hurricane season ends at the beginning of November right and so at this point there's a reason to that extent this is the fourth\nMajor hurricane that we've had in the month of October period and so yeah that's and that's simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October\nWhen you consider that there's been four of them total and and so and it'll last night something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said\nIt well is it going to kind of lose some power that comes into shore and and I and my immediate reaction was no no [laughter] yeah\nI don't yeah can you were right 'cause I I'd asked that question which brings into another question that is just to just personal interest to me\nAnd and that is when you get it from ... you know ... or tornadoes hurricanes get their energy from the warm water right yes All right so do does that mean\nThat a hurricane like this does it then does it as a result that it's taking the energy from the water does the water actually cool down\nA yeah actually it does because what it does this causes up boiling a which by the way is a very bad thing if you like oysters and uh\nSylvia does because what it does this causes up willing or which by the way has a very bad thing if you like oysters\nAnd ah ah just letting you know [laughter] might not be\nGood or Easter season right\nI hate that came in in Nineteen eighty five was the last storm that hit this area of Florida and and and Kate came in hold onto your hat\nAt Mexico beach wow the same place how and\nFor that entire year and I and I'm not sure it might have been longer than that it devastated the oyster crop of the Appalachian bay um you know ...\nRight area while while in terms of the life of Michael you know from the time that it was officially a tropical storm too you know looking at the forecast as you mentioned a back out over water in the Atlantic\nOr is this going to be one of the longest living storms in terms of the the life this band the time that Michael is acting\nUm no I don't think so you've you've stumped me on that one because we've got some that don't even make it here but for some reason they just spin around in the mid Atlantic right we're in the western Atlantic and so I've never I've never looked into that yeah yeah um it\nIt just seems that a ... and you mentioned this earlier talking about you know we always\nOften we'll talk about a storm the remnants of the remnants of it as you mentioned we this we're not going to get to that point in terms of it being overland here we're not going to talk about the remnants of Michael it will be still tropical storm Michael overland\nIt is to Charlotte to a rally in Norfolk yeah and that's where I Am concerned about a lot\nWhen it goes you know for that whole area up there the Hampton Roads area you know that area just floods [noise] yeah and and so I mean we didn't talk a lot about it a lot with Florence but it was flooding in Florence there was nothing compared to the flooding that was going on\nIn in in central North Carolina right and so it never really picked up any news [noise] but when this goes over there I think we're going to hear a lot more about the Virginia beach Norfolk\nAnd Hampton Roads area as it probably exits somewhere right in that area and heads out into the end of the ocean and you know we haven't even touched on power outages right a ... power outages there's there's a huge swath of it's gonna be\nFrom power outage outages from Columbia pretty much all the way up to the uh\nUh Virginia border to at least a pass Wilmington and and just where you start to get into the outer banks islands [noise]\nUm this is widespread power outages and then we also throw in here\nThe tornadoes now the tornadoes are kind of different they are normally super cells so where you see the large cluster of thunderstorms which currently are moving their way across interstate twenty are heading toward Colombia and going through Augusta\nWell that's not the likely place where you've got the heavy rain it's where the feeder bands that are probably fifty to a hundred miles further out where there's individual cells and as we start to get in the morning hours where we'll have an an up tick in the\nAh what's called the low level jet stream and wins and we get a little sunshine we're going to see some uh some some possible super cells\n... and I'm a John ... touchdown and he said when you get the friction of the land and you get this massive fast rotating storm and it hits the land\nOr it kind of dragged to the bottom it creates wind shear and so the the the ah tornadoes are typically week they're F zeroes an F ones\nAnd um and they're they're shallow they're short lived and um and they're commonly in the north east quadrant of the storm so if you cut the storm\nIn four pieces you've got your your northeast your southeast you've got your south west northwest well the the the one that is closest to the ocean\nAnd the further north than the ... where we see these individual cells and feed her band stringing their way and and so that's the other area where we're going to be watching now yesterday we had a three tornadoes reported two in Georgia one in Florida\nI'm along in near highway Seventy five as as the storm was moving its way through Panama City\nAnd northward toward Tallahassee inland and the main peninsula Florida that's where we saw those feeder bans coming in and we picked up the uh the the tornado activity but as as this entire system lose forward we've got these threats one\nOr the winds are going to topple trees trees are going to topple power lines a power lines means widespread power outages over the central sections of\nThe Carolinas and possibly into a southern Virginia than we have flooding and that flooding is going to be a along and through Fayetteville to the west as we get up into the hill country I call it\nA rally and so forth that area is is is perfect for flash flooding because there's all kinds of hills Kelly's ravines and so forth hollers and that all\nCreates its own issue the flash flooding and it doesn't take a lot of rain considering all the soaking it has had [noise]\nAnd and then beyond the tree toppling the power outages and the tornados that we have with this thing [noise] um you know it's a it's a pretty complete storm\nAnd it it has enough energy to maintain itself as a tropical storm until it gets outta here leaving Virginia Beach and heading for the uh [noise]\nHadn't for the other side of the pond wow\nWow just incredible energy behind this storm and of course uh just unbelievable devastation in the wake of Michael ... and a much of that will still have to be assessed as the sun starts rise or in what is now that that path that the that Michael took\nA and I\nWere just looking at at one website uh and and the power outages here reporting in the hundreds of thousands of course of costs seven hundred yeah are being affected here and they they said for some of them it could be weeks\nUh uh yeah I remember my ah my brother being affected they go to higher ground from their storm there on the Gulf Coast of Texas\nA and they went in they went inland but uh they couldn't go home for her it was a couple of weeks just for them and that storm was into the size and intensity that Michael was\nAnd so it could be weeks and weeks before some of these customers have a power again like coming up here and just a little while we're going to get back with you Tom\nWe appreciate your time and we'll talk more about what to expect from tropical storm Michael at the bottom of the next hour think Utah looking forward to it are meteorologist Tom hale with us this morning and he'll be with us\nAn hour just to kind of recap what ah what happened with Michael and again what to expect in the coming days eight six six Ninety right I\nAgree with what I told ... he wrote a [noise]\nShot thousands of trucking

hour on a on that [noise] ah now down to a tropical storm last update\nWas that one I Am a the a sixty mile an hour consistent wind speed\nIs what we had at that particular a point but it's still a well defined tropical storm over Georgia entering the south Carolina and will through the day go move up through North Carolina and parts of southeastern Virginia before it heads off or in the Atlantic\nLine and we'll through the day go move up through North Carolina and parts of the southeastern Virginia before it heads off\nOr in the Atlantic but ah as a Tom and both the John ... told us a earlier a ... and and they predicted this was a storm that was going to stay together it wasn't going to disperse and it looks like as we talk to Tom last hour he said all the way to Ireland\nUh yeah it's going to it's going to remain a that there's enough heat even in\nThe uh uh I guess central northern part of the Atlantic and there's still enough heat to keep that together all the way across the big pond which by the way it'll it'll reach you know near Ireland and Great Britain Sunday yeah\nThat that's a fast moving storm you know we'll have the latest update coming up here in a little bit the other big story a stock market down eight hundred and almost eight hundred and thirty two points and uh yesterday looking at ah the stocks are overnight everybody's taking a big hit\nA from a from Asia throughout Europe and uh also looks like ah that ah the opening looking at the Dow futures right now will be down you know maybe a couple of hundred points ... start to start the morning we'll start that will start down a variety of different things\nI it was interesting 'cause I was thinking to myself I'm not really surprised by this and I was reading the wall Street Journal is said investors really weren't surprised by this and I'm thinking okay well I don't put myself in their category\nBut just looking at everything that's that that has been going on things you know little signs out there that you and I've talked about when you see the bond yields and you see what you know treasury bills we just happened to be talking about that last night\nRight and and we were looking at at at how the the interest rate on treasury bills for the most part has doubled in a year\nThat's just in a year it has doubled that you know\nThat means there's more money that the government has to pay out just a for interest you've got the fed now are wanting to uh raise rates the story was out said did we do this on the air off the air about\nUh that uh because uh ... what we did it on their mortgages were going up and spend a lot of time on it but a a mortgage rates now up over five percent which means uh the price of housing\nThe forecast for that sky rocketed because of the rise in interest rates that was ultimately going to do those homeowners\nIt was clear well if they can't keep up right now\nWell then what it balloons out with even a higher rate to a higher rate than uh than they had expected and plan for well all bets are off it's just not going to happen and that's that's part of that was part of the dynamics in place well\nWhat you have here is you know ah the basically the fed going in and the the point Kramer was making is that\nIt was not Jim Kramer at CNBC in the street dot com was that he wants a more regimented and he wants them to do the homework on the economy he feels that the fed is not doing their homework and they should review the data because to his point\nWhat do we know about the fallout from terrorists what do we know about\nA long term effect uh you know you have the P G saying you know part of the the um the demand for from China has softened greatly and so part of their problem was not just the the the cost of materials\nAnd freight well oil but that that Senate admission from the administration that the economy isn't expanding as quickly as they ... as they're selling and therefore we can't raise the interest rates in a way that's politically that's an admission that it's not going as good as it should\nRight because if you are saying that you're raising interest rates um and it is regimented and and really has a you know a ... ... if your point is er and India than destruction that they should wait\nYou know Jim Kramer saying it is one thing but at the point is being made that the the feds don't need to raise rates right now well\nAre admitting you're saying that our policy is also affecting you have to admit that any policy by any governing entity\nIs affecting negatively right terrorists or whatever it might be might ... regulation and\nTaxes because that's what a tear ... as a matter whether you call it a terror for an income tax whatever if your tax if you're raising the cost of doing business is always going to her well and\nAnd I will see in the coming days where where the market rebounds if they believe this is long lived if they if we're going to be long lived if if they believe that the administration is going to do an about face on terrorists and and and the terrorists even in the situation with China because it's it's affecting negatively way too many producers here in the U. S.\nUh than than the market will adjust accordingly but if we start seeing that uh that fear become\nThe numbers than the market will also ... and the way of or if you see positive is coming out of leadership in Congress that we want to get this NAFTA thing done right yeah but I've heard nothing not yet nothing right eight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers conducting thorough pre trip inspections allows you to catch any problems before heading out on the road post trip inspections give the shop time to react to any problems that were identified\nDuring her next pre or post trip inspection check to make sure your fifth wheel securely attached and free of any excessive where the trailer king pin must be watched properly and the jobs of the fifth wheel also check to make sure your safety chains are attached\nProperly PA truck service understands the importance of these inspections if you find any issues during your own pre or post trip inspection stopped by a location near you to have your vehicle looked at by one of our expert technicians\nThis maintenance tip is the surface of the aid truck service road squad if you break down we show up called eight hundred nine two four shock\nWas gilly McNamara and regardless of what a radio [noise]\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday morning at one am central it's the freight minor runs smart our on red eye radio tuned in to help you run more efficiently brought you buy a freight line or drugs\nHow ... how do you like your coffee and we've got it the way you can at highland minds and nice and calm Martin hyping with great he thinks that's on the planet ...\nEvery now and ... topping ... he's the one now wonder it's called the ... and you want to leave that pilot fines and\nDownload them I Am happy ...\nDid you ever look at the ... and your coffee cup and then realized that's exactly what happens to your teeth\nParis swamps is the five minutes solution to get your teeth white without visiting the dentist this is John Green the c._e._o. of Paris walks into your teeth are staying from coffee tea or smoking all it takes is five minutes with power swabs in five minutes you'll see an average of two shades wider teeth and in seven days six shapes\nIts clinically proven to white natural teeth as well as caps Anthony here's the secret is it to the church and that was developed by Dr Martin ... that live stains off of your teeth best of all there is no matter the strip search trees that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just wanna be your teeth for five minutes and you're done to try and parents rubs risk free call one eight hundred\nSix seven eight nine ... nine six nine that's one eight hundred six seven nine o nine six night\nI guarantee you a bright white smile will have your friends talking about how great you look try which free today one eight hundred\nSix seven nine o nine six night that's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night\nMan have you heard about transportation nation dot com what's transportation nation dot com transportation eastern dot com it's looking for news and entertainment website like Netflix\nYou can watch brand new original trucking shows video with me just for us truckers and you won't find it anywhere else\nAll the transportation nation dot coms trucking shows and video on demand so you can watch whenever you want or you have to sign up and start watching plus it's free that's perfect I'm going to go check out transportation nation dot com right now to make sure you\nFiber optics move crazy amounts of data and even crazier speed and ... is the one hundred percent fiber optic network\nWith files that connection you'll get the fastest Internet available download speeds up to nine hundred and forty ...

I was asking you the question kind of put you on the spot last last hour but you\nYou actually answered it on the spot very well and and were corrected generally speaking talking about the longest lasting\nA hurricane and and I found a little data their weather dot com about ah this would be a hurricane John back in Nineteen Ninety four which had a a thirty day run a this thing traveled in nearly eighty two hundred miles and all out in the Pacific\nEffect of Hawaii but then kept going and but ah roughly a thirty day run but I mean if you look at and you mentioned this earlier and it it is something to remind folks that are still in the path of Michael that\nTypically and very often we see a that a storm or or hurricane starts to fall apart overland and then we we hear words like the remnants of but there are no remnants and again this is a well formed tropical storm a that is traveling uh right now headed for the Carolinas and wreaking havoc\nOn on Georgia and uh and then we'll go back out over the ocean ah we also\nWant to go you name it extra tropical once it goes out over the ocean\n... okay and and write is it's it's no longer in the it's no longer a tropical storm in the tropical zones or so forth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regain power and that regain power is considered extra tropical but it's\nIt it you're right in in nailing it here\nThe it it may not be the thirty days storm that meanders out there and because it's making a good time but it's definitely covering a lot of terrain\nWhile it really is traveling in the end and speaking of traveling up for those professional drivers out there and the high profile trucks I Know that uh that uh Jon Traub mentioned this earlier it bears repeating for those truck drivers that\nAre and they know their season driver they know a that those those are the those sustained wins a the ... whether it's hurricane force even tropical storm force\nCan turn one of those trucks over that can happen very easily and we're not even talking about the gusts or as you mentioned the the threat of the tornadoes there those sustained winds at forty forty five miles an hour or can wreak havoc on those high profile vehicles there along Ninety five\nAnd as you mentioned we're going to see kind of that route over the next day or so uh with with Michael it will the kind of hug I guess a Ninety five in a way a so those traveling on Ninety five need to be aware of that uh because that as a main quarter of course between a Florida and New York\nWell and um and then go ahead to some ... some degree they're going to have this stuff that they're back the wins and so that the the probably my biggest concern would be three eighty five and a twenty uh although right now it's moving across twenty with very heavy rain in Augusta\nAnd but there are a number of those roads forty as another one going up into Raleigh Durham Seventy four that comes out of Wilmington heads to Charlotte every one of those crossroads of why I don't have a number four but the one from Wilmington\nThat that goes into Seventy seven through Florence all of those east west roads are going to have crosswords\nRight yes Tom where does this go on the record books\nAh it goes in the record books as the number three a storm to hit the United states while or\nAnd it goes in the record books as the number three a storm to hit the United states while a and it it and it goes in the record book primarily because of intensity or low pressure at at nine Nineteen Miller bars\nUm just beyond that position number four and the record book happens to be Katrina\nSurprisingly enough and then behind that cat five Andrew is number five in the record book but what I found really intriguing and we talked about this yesterday about continuing to grow as it moved its way ensure mhm atmosphere was perfect not\nIn the last hour it dropped from nine twenty two to\nNine Nineteen and it was deep and

I mean if you look at the power outage or some uh over seven hundred thousand or customers affected ah which as a Tom hale pointed out earlier a means at least a million and a half or people that are affected right now\nUh you you're you're also talking about the debris\nAnd the need for the access to those areas\nAre by those uh crews that will be I'm taking that debris out of that area or the cleanup efforts are going to require you know or the end of the power restoration and everything else will require that that I'm\nA those roadways and and if I remember my brother here in Texas ah from one of our recent storms he went in ah he he traveled inland with his wife but it was a couple of weeks before they could go home because of the power\nAnd and so um they had a camera they could you know they had a security camera they knew\nA which which went out of course with the power or and so ah they they they were in contact with neighbors and and everything else that had gone back a few days before them and that's that's kind of how they knew a it was clear and and they were ready to go go back home uh\nUh I don't and we don't know about the the public schools in those areas but as you can imagine a they're likely going to be closed for a number of days or we don't know the damage of any of those schools are specifically\nBut certainly it is going to be tough to to get kids to school impossible to get kids to school in some cases so a number of things working against that idea of going back home I Can't imagine that um anxiety\nSo all of this is the the market assessing\nA what's happening there are there are things that are an adjustment as as an expansion of\nWell by the way the the the cost of oil whether you agree with that or or or not right and it's also based on on the government policy of ... of foreign policy of saying okay we need to put the sanctions on against Iran which does what means there's\nLess soil and again this isn't a judgment on whether you agree with it or not it's just the reality of supply and demand right of regulation of making things more expensive for whatever reason will hurt in an economy\nAlone and and I think the president was right to call out Saudi Arabia and and talk you out I Know what they have been able to because they basically are now that I mean they and they have been for a long time they are OPEC if you if you talk about the you know the controller inside the OPEC member nations the Saudis and so\nThe talking about them increasing you know and and uh or in their case they had been up to now decreasing their output 'em and they do that because they know the rising a production rate here in the U.S is threatening to them\nAnd so they want to ah basically slow production to control the costs they do that and the global costs start to rise by the way another benefit to greater domestic production because when when we get\nTo the point that we are producing as much as we consume every day as a nation\nThan you ... you will look at the dynamics of a market and the Saudis and Iran and anyone else but I don't have that behind it\nBut it's a story we brought you last week because of a President Trump ... are they are opening up the spigot\nYes and exactly in Saudi Arabia and which is what he wanted them to do and and and that's you know for right now because the way what we're producing and how much we're producing ah we're not at that rate of Eighteen to Nineteen billion barrels a day in production\nWhen we get there that's another case to be made for wrapping up that production and more on our way\nEven though in the last three weeks we become the ... the world's leading\nThe producer of crude oil right um but but at a vote that that didn't really get publicized

ever at one percent or below no it's just in in the in the\nFree market it's not going to work that way we're going to talk with Tom hill after the bottom of the hour get caught up on tropical storm Michael right now your forecast brought to you by on the trucks we\nWill see the devastating effects of what hurricane Michael brought to when the sun comes up today but the system is still moving throughout the forecast area of southwest Georgia\nMost of South Carolina and below country of North Carolina today as well as portions of the tide water and Delmarva Peninsula will experience rain over the next twenty four hours or so\nNear Fayette fill up the Raleigh up the Wilson that area that whole area from uh Florence up the Fayetteville is is low lying area and easily uh because of Florence itself could topple more trees more flooding\nAnd then the flash flooding is going to be more in line in line with Raleigh\nAnd um and back right where you're at the base of the foothills that that take you back up into the smoky and that's where you're going to have water that's falling and it's going to be coming down from Anderson and Greenwood Spartanburg\nUh Greenville North Carolina all of that's going to be draining down into those lower areas um between Raleigh in Fayetteville and that's that's the big concern that I have and and that's going to be a broad area\nNow inch rice a lot of areas are going to get\nA on the west side of Ninety five\nBack up to eighty five which comes out of Charlotte and around by forty that's up near term that area it could be picking up five\nInches of rain there'll be some isolated spots running up through Raleigh and so forth could pick up as much as eight inches of rain but we've already had a few places pick up two to four to five inches of rain Atlanta or you wouldn't think but the land is already over a two point eight inches of rain\nFrom this round so and they're they're out of the target zone and so when you start to come into to Charlotte\nAnd the the path of this storm what we're looking at\nIs going to take it from where it is now between Augusta and Colombia and by the time we make it to the middle of the day it'll be south of Charlotte and in between Charlotte and ah Wilmington ... then it'll be between Raleigh by afternoon\nCharlotte and in between Charlotte and ah Wilmington\nThen it'll be between Raleigh by afternoon and tonight this thing is going to be near a\nNorth folk and the Hamptons or Hampton Roads in Virginia Beach and uh as I pointed out before um\nHampton Roads is sea level or in some places below sea level ah it's kind of like the New Orleans of ah the east coast and and that area there's neighborhoods there that just\nAre borderline flooding all the time\nAnd so when this hits that area they're going to have some very serious flooding issues as well and so this is a this is a big storm I mean you can throw in on the side\nOr the the strong winds forty mile an hour winds let's say forty five mile an hour\nA wins sustained or go see the way that can be toppling trees because the ground is saturated you could throw in a few tornadoes just for fun and um\nWith even stronger isolated wins and um but this is a storm to be reckoned with or even including a sea rise along the outer banks not counting or a high tide of two to four feet right from okra coke the duck ...\nSo while it all points to flooding and power outages are the major two issues that we have to deal with with a few isolated scary moments from tornadoes right\nOr were they in high tide there in Florida uh as as Michael came ashore yesterday\n[noise] you know I'm not sure I didn't check that\nI heard that but I did not follow up on that someone had said that it it it makes it worse than it was in a way that it was high tide at that at that point but I I don't know about that timing is that how that was kind of early in the day and and I don't know I I'm not sure if that was the ...\nMy thought was a it was coming off high tide ... guy that had been and and if you if you noticed in the last two hours everything got real intense in the last hour yeah yeah actually the very last one hour like we talked about right\nEverything just went ... boy it's getting bad fast yeah\nI'm I noticed that a step in the Abrams a shout out to one great meteorologist I'm Stephanie was staying in a port St John\nAnd that's where her crew and our team was and and each one of the reporters is responsible for as cheap as the met over the team is responsible for their safety [noise] but she apparently they weren't staying at a hotel they were staying with some kind of family or maybe a bed and breakfast or something like that\nAnd they couldn't get them to evacuate\nWow and so and so you mentioned it was you mentioned it earlier in the beginning of the show that\nThat you know the ah can tore made the suggestion you don't get the heck out of here and ready to get where because we know where this is going to land and you also mentioned the guidance showed five days out that [noise] wow it it nailed it yeah\nYeah for half right yeah yeah the path that half of where it was going to where it was possibly going ahead at five days out\nAnd Florence was two miles off the target at five days out\nJust unheard of yeah yeah Florence and and and all of us meteorologist got goose bumps only heard this yeah\nAnd but there's there's there's some things that are going on in giant data processing when it comes to our models and our satellite imagery which has changed the way we forecast hurricanes water vapor imagery which allows us to see the exact\nAnd our satellite imagery which has changed the way we forecast hurricanes water vapor imagery which allows us to see the exact point where the center is of rotation and be able to see the wind flow at different levels\nAnd we have some computer models in the mid west that forecast\nOver in Eighteen hour period of time\nWhere there are going to be outbreaks of severe thunderstorms and potentially knowing the conditions we can tell if it's just going to be a thunderstorm if we have all the conditions favorable for tornadoes and and these models will pinpoint some things and I recall\nMay ninth two thousand sixteen it pinpointed\nA little area I'm up near Duncan, Oklahoma and sure enough a that was five or six hours out\nA thunderstorm developed right in that little area continue to grow and turned into what was a became what was called the when he would tornado or that came rolling across interstate thirty five right south appalls valley um and so the accuracy justice downs me\nHis guinea and like ... like over the last the egg received now compared to ten or Fifteen Years ago\nSeven ... seven all over the last ... last seven years off a the H H triple our model is what we call it\nThat was an experimental model and that was experimental seven years ago even five years ago but as we started to use it because they put it out and let all of his shoes it we realized and grew and confidence of that model being crushing only accurate\nAnd and so you see a lot of TV stations with a weather models that are called future cast and so forth muses a handful of private companies IBM included the owns the weather company\nOr not the weather channel and they actually have their own proprietary model accuweather has its own proprietary model\nEnterprise ah barons has its own proprietary models and then of course is the government models and\nAnd I don't know how much they they they steal from each other's data information to own it down to where it's at but we're getting ... very very accurate and being able to forecast little world tools and the atmosphere which creates circulation lift and the potential for storms from\nThat ... always of all of a thing and and just amazing to watch it happened but again we go back to you know the basis of\nOf why people do what they do and and why meteorologist or\nA ... like you mentioned earlier and yesterday talking about the you know the the idea of being able to warn people and if we can learn and the technology gets better than obviously in future storms there is a greater warning which means a greater survive ability\nOf those storms so Tom we just want to thank you so much thank 'em and you answered all my questions\nI got so many so many things you are yeah yeah it's all about us we don't really know what if you knew that coming into this one [laughter] oh they told you that [laughter] but uh you know hurricane\nFlorence and Irma and uh and and everything you've done a for re run I Am and the listeners out there really are working for the Republican and getting the word out and and really breaking down what these storms mean and the danger behind such storms\nOr it has definitely been a pleasure and I will just say this I Hope we don't talk to you for a long long time ago but I I Know I Know we will and uh and and we definitely will put your back to work here at red eye radio or any chance we get because we know the great value of the mind in ...\nThe end and we definitely will uh put your back to work here at red
