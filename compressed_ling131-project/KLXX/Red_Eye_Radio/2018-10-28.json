and I'm very McNamara eight six six Ninety read\nI welcome and a good morning I'm I just I just want to address an email that I got yesterday because um [laughter]\nIt was just too good because we we were talking about economic things yesterday and we're talking about uh the uh you know you know the ah corporate tax mhm and and as we said before I keep forgetting we always get new listeners but but uh I made the comment as we've made before that corporate taxes hurt the poor the most\nAnd this person just wrote me just completely baffled by what do you mean it doesn't give to corporations I had to explain to them\nNo or\nYou pay everything that a corporation is when you see is financed by the consumer yes everything right uh their their their profits are financed by you everything's financed by by private money to pay their taxes right the the taxes to corporate taxes are paid by the consumer\nYou the consumer pay for their expenses because if you if you if that's not the case they're gone right so a corporate tax is they dealt tax on the consumer you don't see it directly\nTherefore who does it hurt the most who has the least expendable income the poor for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nWeather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now\nOut of Canada providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes and that system will sweep as far back as the northern plains to provide showers from North Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan\nAt upstate New York the south Gobi drying out today the deep south as well as the southern plains Texas drive this weekend\nWe've seen heavy amounts of rain and the Lone Star state and lots of flooding there\nAnd will continue to see clear skies into tomorrow and unsettled pattern for the Pacific northwest as we get some onshore flow intensify today rain showers heavy along the coast of Washington and Oregon\nYou missed part of the conversation we're not talking about the people that are already on board we're talking about the people in the middle that win elections for you\nRight that's who you need to convince you've got to go sell the brand essentially\nTo put it in the president's ah you know we'll house to to new customers\nBy the by the way I don't know I I I answered the the one email from the one woman who wrote that the the the one that because it sounds\nLike that's when you're relating yeah mine was from a guy but but I'll go to my mind yet at the end and it was the same thing and and I answered you know and I answer back I said look I'm Talking about you arrive yeah this was going to change it I'm not talking about my\nBut right somebody else who told me who was a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm and move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well I Know that's not the point that it's not you're not\nYou're not part of that you're you're already in the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do and this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can't get their message across\nAnd if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get that out and they could they could gain more seats\nInstead of losing seats and this was back then not rise early now we're talking about getting a message across to people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced\nWe've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you're not part of that group\nThe the Republicans but more importantly the president\nRight now or they're capable together of getting real things done and they need to get our message out there but\nThere is this and and we continue to have to fight this all the time were where we get people to call well you guys think that you can convince everybody\nAnd we don't know [noise] ... that's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that look people [laughter] people\nEvolve every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population but people learn every day and\nA teacher's politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that are called the show and I said you know I used to think this way and then I started ... you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realize I change my mind completely ... people change their minds they're not trying to get everybody to change your mind you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday\nUndecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing in your face and never being satisfied with what you have always trying to\nGrow it and we believe if you promote\nFree markets conservative economics conservative principles and you explain it in a simple way a nation that\nLargely remains and we're not talking to you who is listening to the show you have sought us out you've sought out shows like this you've sought out information life is so we're not\nReferring to you you're already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time and you are able to introduce them to\nDifferent ideas there is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference in almost probably ... I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there that is the goal the goal is to win [noise]\nThat the goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate you use a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that and that's what I Love when people run if you guys don't understand the frustration out there\nYou're kidding me ... if you'd like to just would you like to sit in this chair for the last\nYears Mm [laughter] oh no it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here yeah right that's what it is a conservative radio talk show host for the last Thirty years yeah\nIt's really an calm [laughter] it's always a very old high scenario it's like doing constant yoga\nOh it's like sitting on a beach so like that just\nSitting there on a ... I I got friends in St Thomas sending their Virgin Islands St Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is day after\nDay here as pure as and\nAnd so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that hangs out every day at the other side that you disagree with that you believe is unfair and in some cases evil\nNo that's not our goal look after them on the issues go after them with with uh you know with everything you've got on the issues\nAnd spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric because it doesn't need to be the ... the point is is that you feel like there's this limited window and that the the the window is closing and it just might here within two weeks\nAnd so the point being is that because we've been doing good so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean massive doors just wide open for them [noise]\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person can be communicating ... that you can set the messages are\nAhead of time to automatically go out while you're sleeping you can you can communicate right now around the clock get the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins\nAnd you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already what frustrates\nMe is understanding that the left uses the heated heated rhetoric that they that they use they do that out of desperation they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand\nThat on you know the other side on on the the side that I'm most closely relate to that it gets frustrating because they're always just so angry and they were spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack back [noise]\n\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell mhm we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need that that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that they\nWell well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party there former leader was in Nevada and the other night and we've gone over the years from that speech at the DNC in two thousand six or two thousand for a to him becoming president in two thousand eight\nOn hope and change to just the other night Nevada bill ... who well I'm a well almost it was it because it became ... if you think about it it's not even a political tactic what would you what I Would have expected to hear from you know the great or raider\nRock Obama this big speech\nBuilt on principles and it was basically if you guys don't get out and vote they're going to win adapt well okay thanks kept an obvious we're already\nWho vote okay\nCan you can you can add to prevent you know and as we said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issue is that's the difference look\nAt you know we talked about how we don't like to political ideology on either side but I Do understand that because of political ideology on on the left is based purely on personality in on the right it's not I still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I dollar free we worship a candidate and get still always has bothered me but\nThe fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas\nRight [noise]\nThat are that are specific and work and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it but as you ... you saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging the other day from what you saw was\nThe shell of\nThe Democrat Party which is the other night which is no ideas just imagery and symbolism yeah [noise] well except for free stuff yeah yeah ... yes we had our eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nReally bug here for ... radio with a record ...

I don't remember us in any segment today saying what you claim we stayed it\nOr leave it get about maybe forty five minutes ago that you know this kind of revolution and you know they've got all the ... you got all the answers\nFilmmakers from you know John John John John slum we said that the president and the Republicans are making progress and they are and so what we want them to do is be able to focus on that message and keep the message going it's that simple\nYeah say and I made about long lasting or anything else like we didn't say anything but of course I could I could defeat you on that because I pointed out uh with you know Kevin and Gorsuch you have to construction yeah you're right on the\nKnowledge that right and and and when we want we we were the ... we were the first to say that in the executive branch will look at Obama most with Obama done has been dismantled\nBecause if you don't use the legislature if you used executive orders from uh in order to run your executive branch instead of trying to get legislation passed through by legislative branch yeah it's not going to be long term but the tax cuts could be long term well\n... and here's the thing to what did you have with the tax cuts in in the ah the while not retaliatory but the the response from the Democrats was was\nNot that we're gonna take it back to you know thirty five percent we're going to we're going to take it to one eighty five percent\nRemember I almost right away what we need to raise that we need to raise it to twenty five percent less I I I it was the ...

thing\nOf of being long lasting a good economy is not going to be defeated because the American people want to keep it going um [noise]\nThe last administration tried they tried everything they could to step in the way of private sector you didn't build that that was their attitude that was the attitude by the former administration but the the fact of the matter is is private sector built all of

some everything he does will not because presidents are limited in their power and we've often stated that button and I think you would the perfect answer a the the the fact of two Supreme Court justices construction as\n[noise] because [noise]\nThe problem is is with with if you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially at that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so [noise]\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah they don't sweat it was an oversight here in my opinion because that's not what the associated\nPress story all I can understand it because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here says the ... and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the scent\nWashington Post on there headline had it right there headline habit that the powder that was sent along with ... you know a along with the suspicious\nPackage was harmless and and so the the point being is that [noise]\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not pass that and you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now [noise]\nPeople are going by their trust of National Review [noise] you know\nOn the headlines which which National Review to me is extremely credible mode at the time I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm\nWhich National Review to me is extremely credible most the time I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm that's what I told us an earth are saying that the bomb was harmless but this was in our personal meaning not on the air [noise]\nAnd then realized oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence and Associated Press separate the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb not again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were\nActive bombs that could have gone off and could have gone off and would have\nGone on a ...\nYou know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever or were they set to go out and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point\nYou would look at it and the questions that you would ask as an investigator would be different [noise]\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare ... or they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent for a political statement would be the next question that you would ask for it [noise]\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we are when\nWe talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony [noise]\nThat they're saying the device of this must stop\nBut yet they create the maximum device of this\nBy blaming somebody for an incident where they don't have the facts they don't know we have no idea that the motivation behind the\nThe the little person or persons nobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against the advice of this and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on\nThe left doing that it's like [laughter] we're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing that right well and especially\nWithout knowing all the facts here [noise]\n\nYou know they're trying to put a puzzle together with without also pieces [noise]\nAh\nWe've got to it in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective\nAnd I know sources of so they believe it's the same you know right people are ... person or group of people based on the material which again that that the number of the number of of\nAh devices that you send out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm\n[noise]\nYeah if you look at the nature of or how this was sent a the the packaging the if you look at the um the the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN\nOr or you know the multiple stamps it went through us ts um each of these by the way [noise]\nDepending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know she doesn't open his own meals are usually people at that level don't open\nAll of that sort and there's a great deal of security um but\nBut of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service well actually as their own shorting that they do show the male doesn't doesn't it's not delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time and place\nBut but the point being is that they have a a great deal of resources that the secret service has a great deal of resources ended in in finding out you know and and putting together the puzzle\nThere's a there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days that they know it may be where the facility or facilities were at these were sent\nFrom oh and I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now what did these rely bombs or not they know they haven't said\nThat we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go on and could have been triggered\nBy a ... a phone or whatever I that would be the next question why not right [noise]\nWell because in in in Illinois is there a reason that I'm I'm I'm not throwing out of conspiracy and I'm saying there is there an investigating reason why you wouldn't do it well and if they were\nArmed or or or if they were at that at that point those were those devices were ready\nTo go off [noise] I'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city [noise]\nAh right there in the building to CNN building or the those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock some time that but they were allowed to go back in the building I'm ... and so does that tell us anything about\nThe threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices will find out in the coming days [noise]\nYou know because if they were armed and they were ready to go off then and you suspect that there might be more\nWould you allow people to go back in that building [noise] you know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have as ex presidents to a secret service detail and they're always going to have that a great level of security ah but\nIf it's if you're talking about you know the media you have to assume right that the if the threat is real and if that were at that device word dangerous or we're ready to go off that there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system somewhere um\nBut I don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on here we just know that you've got a [noise]\nUh the the you've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets were who they were sent to\nAnd and that's about it we ... we were seeing the pictures on\nOn uh on line and in the media as to what the packaging was at least with the CNN device\nBut again where the the the FBI and the and ah everyone that's involved in the uh of course the investigation here they're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was [noise]\nWe can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at [noise] even the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you what they're really looking at it looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about\n[noise] suspicious packages we don't know anything else

of the early voting sites for me\nRight it was pouring rain or just more ... and when it was funny 'cause I never even though this campus is only five miles from my house I really just\nNever been to never drove through this community college right or grow through what the science route front on them you know the that you could tell me okay this is early voting political science all over the place\nAnd so I started driving around trying to find the building saying I've no idea what building that's going to be in but when I but I Will know it when I see a political science will be all over the place right\nThe only thing is they didn't have any parking if you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college uh yeah yeah which and I just thought to myself\nBecause that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a courthouse fright or were you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little further couple of more miles\nAnd I was going to go there and I said that I Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been out of before so I had about a thousand foot ... pouring rain but when I got in there everybody

mean it was ... ... students are walking right by you couldn't miss the fact that this was the place to vote mhm right yeah so but it was a relatively relatively easy\n... number one I never felt that

yesterday was a ... of the day\nYeah yeah yeah down or over six hundred points\nSo ah ... the you know here's the other side of I guess and not a lot of media on on that obviously the media was on everything else that was going on uh with the suspicious packages and everything but\nYou were the administration and they're they're probably looking at this going okay as we go in and get what a you know again twelve days out from the mid term they need to build some momentum so they need to I guess return\nUh some of that a positive stuff to back to the market uh we'll see where it goes uh in terms of ah any kind of rebound later today or or maybe next week if that has to happen but you can bet they are watching this and a lot of it has to do with trade and terrorists\nSo the material costs especially with steel and aluminum right now you have and the retaliatory tariffs on\n... energy remember also the the I Believe the temperatures are still in effect from earlier this year on candidate timber coming until NAFTA is actually sign right or whatever it is the new the new now we're not calling now [laughter]\nUh but as far as I ... and so housing has gone up you know we look at it was an apartment complex behind us\nAnd and it's I how many units are in there maybe three or four hundred today it's it's pretty big issue ... uh and the rate of construction every time we kept its it's almost as if it's not moving along at all and you and I are totally asking\nWhy why is it going so slow isn't labor is a material I've never seen a building built so slow and this is a major mhm apartment developer or in North Dallas\n[noise] why are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration [noise] because they have not just about the attack that they are for open borders\nBingo we've been saying for years [noise]\nAnd this is what we said ... pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and the earlier this week as well they have to be positioned it very clearly the question has to be asked [noise]\nWhere do you stand on the border [noise] they must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do do support [noise]\n\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive [noise] exactly what do you support [noise] we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want [noise]\nHe said again I've argued elsewhere the parties should have been raised an immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat any from a democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we upset that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this was a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president\nTo back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nBut we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and [noise]\n\nAre you for that but you can't\nWe have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on the show together\nThe issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a was a like a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy ...\nWhich was the amnesty that was two thousand and five ... just ... they they made the decisions to a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right [noise]\nAnd so for Thirteen Years the Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration\nWhat would they do [noise] what what their plan be thinking about this and that by the way that say Republican failure mhm because of Republican should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration\nIt shouldn't be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said you make the accusation\nDemocrats wide open borders and when they cry you are a line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of\nDeal you would want done issue them the challenge and that's what I thought it was shown a saying here\nThat again they haven't had to answer they haven't had to they don't they\nSome of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you know get rid of ice you don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous\nThat the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats won border security they may have compassion for people that are here\n[noise]\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we have brought ... to your attention [noise] the demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country\nAre blacks and Hispanics ...\nWhen you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see that the numbers\n[noise] of of [noise]\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level of legal immigration that even Trump has never talked about ... [noise] it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat mhm [noise]\nNo the American people stand with the president on border enforcement [noise] they do [noise] he's winning that politically [noise] but\nThe other side of it is is that\nThe Democrats have not been forced to to say what they want [noise] at all you know the president wants [noise] you know with the Republicans\nAnd and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say and you have to you have to force him and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond\nSir backed them against the wall so they have no choice to either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the caravan saying we'll poll well we're going to pull aid from you ... but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you right [noise]\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people [noise]\n\nBut you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something yes [noise]\nBy the way also we when we talk about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunter and flag ... and all that and so people start question well why do you want to come here\nRight do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then\nYou know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to well what do we want from people who come over here\nAs citizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can you have a discussion when only one side\nHas said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side [noise]\nWon't go after they're part of the party than endorses open borders and just keeps quiet on it well silences your consent yes silences your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states\nSo why are you preaching that\nNow That's Douglas shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat\nWho are about to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage or isn't a crazy Democrat at\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person who votes Democrat and they want border control sure in fact the constituency that votes most Democrat most the time\nActually to get out of illegal immigration in the legal immigration is a demographic that once the least legal immigration into this country look\nYou have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time [noise]\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice\nProtest [noise] they they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders [noise] they should say [noise] they should be forced to say it\nBecause that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback [noise] if they're promoting border enforcement at any level [noise] tell me who [noise]\nAnd I mean the ... from the party that is actually saying that in promoting it is Chuck Schumer promoting that\nNancy Pelosi [noise] or they promoting that\nMay be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard of but we have you know there might be one or two maybe Clinton [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats\nBut where's the party saying this is what we want [noise]\nThat's the official political battle how can we have and how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would want what they want right [noise] except for those that are in the party that promote open borders and the elimination advice they want to\nWould ... what they want right except for those that are in the party that promote open borders and the elimination of bodies they won't even have the debate right right\n[noise]\nAnd that's what Republicans we Republicans Thirteen Years the pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that in that role of doing so right they have another opportunity to do it right now

ad\nIs what is said in it where there's you'll hear two men talking\nAnd they're talking about you know a Josh Hawley and the problems with him that uh the claim is he gets wind and works out during work hours which we found really interesting for a Senate race to be the main accusation in an ad that clearly is a\nDesperation at yeah they'd be big richest why not that he drinks ready why he purchased wind purchased wind and went to work out right and when you're an attorney general which probably your hours you're probably a salaried workers we just did you grow your own state a salaried employee yes uh yeah uh\nBut [laughter] but I Am thinking that that that's it but so do we know what will play coming up on it after falling the bottom of the hour yeah gets about admitted that I Want to play the whole thing and it's where they get into the two people talking and this is her campaign at ... or the way this is not some pack running the ad some other outside group this is her\nWhat am I I Will set it up with if if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most in that ad uh-huh uh it was terrorists yes and we've talked about the mid west it was something that we talked about yesterday ... that the the the the the farmer\nThat is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly out because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so it is something we we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats\nTo help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad\nIt was terrorists twice\nHere's the interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in\nMissouri [noise] if you went up to the average person in the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation where Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government dar\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the president's I guess in the state of the industry or the particular industry right and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it even if you're not a farmer or you\nKnow what to do ... yeah right wow you know\nThe farmers and they weren't very vocal about it if you're in that state even if you're not a former ah you know again depending on the impacts they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah\nWhich you know we'll see if if that point works or if any of this works er here within two weeks [noise]\nIt's [noise]\nIt I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it\nThat positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say it she approves this message this is her campaign that she's not saying the people that are protesters [noise]\nShe's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members of the party that she's referring to here [noise]\nIn terms of the word crazy\nThat's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know or you know with my my party in it ... approach or you write it again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation to say well she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme is you know in there that she doesn't she's it was the term\nAs you brought up an so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put in to that ad right where the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her\nThat's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember\nThis would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw or just what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right [noise] yeah I think what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that\nThey're there they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats my not part of the crazy Democrats for but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not\nA you know not radical not yet a extreme cause extreme if something is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream even if you will term word right\nAh but this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the cabinet thing [noise] is that it doesn't matter that you're not\nA Cory Booker [noise] it doesn't matter that you're not a ...\nA lizard with war and or just you know pick a number of them that are in the Senate [noise]\n\nAh that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times\nIt's because their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago\nMcGrath I think we have a couple of times\nIt's because their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago [noise] their actions\nGo outside of their state\nIn terms of the race right they will uh taint the races and other states but especially of course\nThose that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we so [noise]\nThat's the effect there is that come out one Harris or or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them [noise]\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and\nThose people in the ... the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going look or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with at some point Kamala Harris or you know\nInside with as young crazy Democrats she'd as she just as happy not just that [laughter]\nAnd which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote out but\nWhere does she go on this well she made a choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but it's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats than that doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats with that no votes she condones that behavioral\nLead and we saw during the cop Kevin I'm ... and and that's why I'm I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independence right you're undecided independent\nWho's looked at the cabinet thing and said they're crazy I mean they're they're really crazy and I can't vote for her\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the feedback coming back from that ad may be received by these people just say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote\nRight but you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the length of what you will go you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and\nWith that vote on Kavanaugh that was also condoning their behavior\nIs not you know all of that that's you know that she evidence to back up their opinion yup coming to that conclusion just have it all just prove that eight six six Ninety right I\nWas very much for them to record the radio [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accident free miles been registered and

in Texas Albert welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show I Albert\nHey good morning Eric uh Gary first time caller I was called let you know that the FBI is doing a very thorough investigation near and so it won't become a boot political issue they'll let us know till after the November election\n[laughter] we're real or not [laughter] think oversight committee yet you mentioned that won't happen so [laughter] yeah we'll have to declassify it uh yeah well\nThey now you know that the the things that are better at it and yet thanks that we just we we saw what you're going to say we we knew where you were ... we were going with it is\nA ... it's a it is fascinating though because it is something look at is not the number one question that you would want to ask is a reporter mhm that report them I'm sure they're gonna have a press conference today support is going to ask 'cause that was our were the bombs libre\nNot right where they you know word word could they have been a detonated by opening the package because the concern is not just a you know about you know the message being sent or the intent of the person or persons responsible\nBut also about the threat that is still or might still be out there in in the system because let's say that they were going or are going through stages where they're reaching out to these individuals' first and then there are others on their list\nWell the concern would be by you know the the package handlers and people that might even be walking on up up up to a porch and and they see something worth these devices ready to go walk could they have been detonated\nA rapidly either remotely or by opening a package I think that's information that\n[noise] ah just we got to bring this up quickly I I haven't checked the overnight markets you know I haven't I haven't checked but six hundred down down yesterday and the the doubt as some ... down I think was it four point four percent yesterday\nAnd yeah yeah uh the uh the Dow down over six hundred and and a lot of that had to do with earnings and and we're hearing more and more ah companies come out and say that their earnings are suffering as a result of what's going on uh the terrorists in retaliatory tariffs by trade partners is having an impact on on business\nOut overnight is is is up and which I which you might expect ... all the Asian markets are down one percent three the three percent right the Japanese market down three percent a Shanghai up a little bit ... above ... percent there uh Europe a mixture of over in Europe\nSo we'll see whether it's just a correction whether there's really worry\nWe know there is in the housing market and we know for example you know foreign coming down\nAnd and saying look thanks for all that thanks for all the help with the tax cuts but the terrorists are killing us\nAnd and it is something like what happened yesterday on the news playing out makes a lot of people nervous and and of course than the markets because one possibility up to consider is that it was a foreign enemy or that was that was involved are responsible\nFor these suspicious packages and and the the concern that it might not be over or something else might happen we it was a lot of uncertainty yesterday so some of that is built into that drop I mean you often see that if there is something that that is happening\nOr as as big of a news story as as you saw yesterday or that does make the the markets very nervous so uh we'll see where it\nWell and and that's something that was you know was was brought up the yesterday by you know some of the experts saying look you know there's there's three things that could be it could be somebody in their right it could be somebody and they left it could also be a foreign entity\nYeah just to disrupt the American you know an electoral process or it could be just terrorists yeah who have decided to do it and again which that's that's why we find it surprising that are so late into this because it's been three days since the ...\nA bomb initially that\nNobody has stated whether these were active lie bombs that would have gone off right if the if somebody would have touched it in a different way right apparently they were handled it didn't go off\nWell because I Would think that if there was a threat of these devices going off whether they could be set off\nA remotely or by the handling the package itself\nThat we would see that warning come out by authorities would we not yeah because if we learned that was the case and they didn't warn the public and there is still a possibility of such devices being in the mail system or being out there in in the public and it's still being a threat to the public\nBeyond that the intended recipient recipients over the past few days that they would want to get that message out and and we would be fearing that I Would think that and if we hear that that you know that they were armed and and they didn't say at the most someone's going to have to answer them for on attracts here's your forecast\nWeather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the northeast for this Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers hugging along the east coast\nAs well as a system out of Canada providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes and that system will sweep as far back as the northern plains to provide showers from North Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan and upstate New York the south will be drying out today the deep south\nThat's Texas dried this weekend\nWe've seen heavy amounts of rain and the Lone Star state and lots of flooding there\nOr not you're not surprised or shocked but very interested in the fact that the biggest issue it was mentioned twice\nWas the terrorists now I don't know why you take valuable time because if if you believe as a Democrat\nThat the terrorists that are on products that are hurting farmers in the mid west [noise]\nAnd you believe in and you you you mentioned that you know whites okay because you believe it's important you also know or you believe is we had we instead this way back when in springtime\nOr you know we'd set this when when the weight before that we said this when the Republicans passed the health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but has used against you in in the mid term elections and it has been ...\nSo you've got that and you've got the terrorists that you believe you mentioned it to whites in there because you believe that there's a significant number of people who might be attracted to that anti terror of message\nThat Trump has been so loud on ...
