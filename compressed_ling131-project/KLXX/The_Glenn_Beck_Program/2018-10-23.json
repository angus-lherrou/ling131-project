Seventy\nFormer speaker of the house Newt Gingrich is with us\nThey don't need silver didn't have a very good year in twenty sixteen but he had predicted both of Obama's victories I'm Scott Rasmussen was the closest pollster John McLaughlin was the other coast poster and twenty a sixteen and he says there's an eighty six percent chance the Democrats take over the house\nEighty two percent chance that Republicans picked up seats in the Senate I don't have a spiel on the house but I Do believe\nRepublicans could actually win Florida Tennessee\nMissouri Nevada Arizona pushed shore North Dakota for sure maybe Montana and if they didn't have a libertarian in Indiana they win that race for sure but they've got a good shot beating Joe Donnelly in Indiana if people don't vote libertarian I'm On the house side it's very hard to get a feel forty retirements doesn't make it any easier\nWhile this rush right but I think Haiti eighty percent way too high and a little surprised the silver\nOr for the second cycle rose going ... um you know the most recent survey indicates that in fact you have 'em in the very closely contested districts I think this was an NBC survey um that they actually are were within about two points when the generic ballot\nWell if if that's in the contest districts out we're losing the Democratic districts very badly world so not so much money and then we're not campaigning in them we're not making our case a but but in the swing seats that matter a we actually are basically tied other generic about\nAnd and all I can tell you is I I look at the issues that are going to matter should the two things happening you see this little bit with Stacey Abrams uh in in Georgia the candidate for\nIt into this more deeply because it's the two important where fourteen days out of an election two weeks from today you'll be boating and two weeks from tonight you'll be turning on your television sets and you're either going to have great news all the way round maybe it's going to be split decision or you're gonna have horrible news\nAnd they've never covered what Maxine Waters has been saying\nThey've never recovered a single thing of her saying you know create a crowd followed them in a grocery store is follow them in the department stores gas stations and you tell them then I Want to hear anywhere anymore or what's happened to Pam Bondi or secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders a Ted Cruz now Mitch McConnell and Henry Kissinger and\nYou know obviously this is the the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker nor can I say or or elaborate on any one issue or program they're offering\nThat will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what they're running on\nYou know I look I I well they do run on a government run health care for everybody which they can't defend which which when you examine it collapses\nBecause is totally unsustainable financially and would be a nightmare to try to implement that's the closest thing they've come to a big idea and it's a really bad big idea\nI agree totally alright um we'll be checking them regularly\nYou believe the admission by this Georgia gubernatorial candidate that she burned the state flag or is that going to change that race now [noise]\nWell I don't think that that doesn't change arrange for the totality of her being a radical the fact that the organization she headed up may have filed twenty three thousand falls voting registration for people who don't exist I mean I think the more we learn about her the more trouble she gets to be\nAll right but I appreciate it thank you so much a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich let's guitar phones here uh oh I got to say Hi to big time AJ Houston, Texas he was the star at the at the town hall I was in we had a wonderful time down in Texas I saw big time AJ I saw\nA Rick Perry I saw Ted Cruz and there was a Jay came up on stage with me and uh you know I I don't know why I had a

used an everybody in the crowd went nuts it was like you know I don't want you are running for office which by the way it may not be a bad idea at some point that you run\n... they're probably knock me out the bucks but it's funny you say that South Africa that China two guy in a Dallas yeah\nI saw you signing autographs it and I said I [laughter] I think crime signing autographs and then we brought Linda on the stage and she said I said Linda say\nNew York I said I think New York and she goes to New York and I said said talk talk and say single poor single poor um\nThat was pretty funny I was one of my lighter it\nOh she's so I was so glad to meet her or she is the author I filled out about it for her it it's all of which John\nI sit here on Sundays by the way it is not as sweet as every day\n[laughter] hey but they got to do a ... uh when I told him were picked a fight it may take it or wanting to go to Scott had any\nSo [laughter]\nAll I Need is this you always have this optimism this love of life this enthusiasm\nYou know I don't know I'm hoping two weeks from now maybe I'm maybe my ex the expectations are out of whack I'll deal with whatever the results are not a cry baby Weiner and like these liberals after they lost and twenty sixteen I sucked it up on Obama won two terms\nYou know we're survive whatever the country throws at us but wouldn't it be nice again to shock the world wouldn't that be nice to say that the Republicans not only are picking up houses in the seats in the Senate\nBut if we also prevent Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker how sweet would that be how great would that be thinking of the feeling you'll have on election night if you spend the time and you go out and your boat you do your job\nEspecially I put up on my website the top fifty races that this is where the balance of power would tipping point and someone handed ... dot com\nOh big time that you would say that what we are standing out yesterday and they own the big screen without the fans that are just twenty sixteen relax and have the ... sorry media faces\nOh oh they're desperate someday Donald Trump a liar trouble finding you know very fit Israel it's all over fake\nNews CNN and conspiracy TV MSNBC I big time I got to run my friend I Love your audience loves you thank you so much for coming the other day I had a great time ... you know we have four thousand people a moment in Texas in an airport airport hangar it was amazing um anyway thank you so much\nA robin's in Gainesville in Florida the next two important races down there on the census over Gillum God help Florida if you ever like Gillum your your business atmosphere will collapse in Florida\nAnd Rick Scott deserves to go to the U.S Senate he's been an amazing governor how are you what's going on Rob\nEd Sheeran thank you very much for taking the call I just wanted to say that uh [noise] you know the left I always like to paint the right as being a monsters or not\nA you know sympathizing with their poor the poor people that are coming from other countries that have horrific a\nOppression and those other countries and that very bad situations where we had the exact same stories for people who were on the list doing it legally with the exact same problems that I Do think it's a we should you know highlight those people's stories\nAnd you know get more exposure to those stories that are doing it the right way and say hey listen we draw the line everyone's got the same tragedies and where we were prior we won't um disrespect the people that are doing it the right way by just letting anyone come in and\nWhat did you know you cannot allow them to do this\nThey're not going to be allowed to create a mob at the border and rush the border and a violent and let me tell you something if we're the wall up it would be more safe and more secure for both sides let me tell you what I don't ever want to have happened\nAnd I have no doubt that many of the people not care of and they want a better life they're good people their government sucks there's no hope no opportunity and the government that gets so much aid from from us a lot of these governments that we give money to all around the world so many of them are corrupt\nAnd it doesn't ever get to the people where we wanted to get to\nBut the reality is is we cannot allow we are a sovereign nation we have our country that has built on a constitution and the rule of law this is the law the land we have a process designed\nTo taking people from other countries you've got to first follow the law if you want to be in America that's it and and I know the Democrats are silent on the issue but most Americans agree that you know they would be precipitating a showdown crisis where people are gonna get hurt I don't want anybody on either side to get hurt\nNobody wants innocent people hurt out we don't know we can't vouch for every person in that crowd we can't say that there are not people that are bad intentions that they want to bring into America\nMaybe it's just the tiniest the percentage what if it's five people out of fourteen thousand we cannot risk that and by the way if we allow them to Russia border bum rushed the border and get in and we were all reward that behavior will the next one's going to be\nAnd by the way if we allow them to Russia or border bone rushed the border and get in and we were all reward that behavior or the next one is going to be fifty thousand that we've got to be a hundred thousand and then we'll have what Democrats love open borders and then they'll call for amnesty when they think they have enough future generations of votes\nWe can't have it and it's got to be stopped at some point I urge Mexico to do the job now in turn these people around that's their job\nI listen I Want to remind you off year elections are really about one thing and that's you turning out showing up\nThis election is one of the most important we've seen in decades your tax savings that's on the ballot the economy is on the ballot America's comeback and continuing it is on the ballot jobs are on the ballot your kid's futures on the ballot your wages your retirement plans that's on the ballot if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd the other big issues on the ballot at ... you know who's going to be in charge of our future politicians or
