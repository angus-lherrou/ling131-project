let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nAnd I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measure I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nUh you you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he's the number two at the O. J. I can tell you got to people on the phone today Jim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein who you're not and bring him in and put them under oath\nYeah I mean and this is why that should happen and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoenaed than the case then most of the kitten was or what the New York times cited that said there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who set Rod Rosenstein was talking about recording to present a United States so we have the FBI\nCited that said there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who set Rod Rosenstein was talking about recording to present a United States so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council Jim Baker saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting\nThat Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country and we have in the Cape memos that reinforce that we've subpoenaed it became memos and we've asked Mr Rosenstein\nTo come in and answer our questions neither one of those things that happen\nSo that that you know Mr Rogers is leading that you played shot he talked about trend he he talked about facts and and the here and do this and how our our our ... our justice system works well one of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency show what the documents give us the Cape memos and more importantly come answer our questions that's what bothers both of us\nWell why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I can tell you that your committee has shown weak leadership and I'm I I hate to criticize anybody a but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house majority leader of the house\nA Jim Jordan and I with chairman Goodlatte in the room and and two or three other staffers we all agree that what we would do is move expeditiously to have him come into a transcribe interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in\nA than we would subpoena him and compel him to do that and I can tell you that ah it's it's more skew sues on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of\nSo we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and ... literally force him to come and testify under oath an answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme a plan now you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and now James Baker\nAll saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states in the hopes that it would provide materials that they could invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it and said sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm in that\nAnd they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... the guy who was in effect running dusters department\nShould not be joking with support it's about\nRecording the commander in chief of the United states that ... that even if it's a joke that's not something you do it particularly at the time that this was happening remember on this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on late night the president fires gym called me on may seventeenth Rod Rosenstein they lower the special counsel\nThat there is one of the huge already know what happened in between there\nRemember Lisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was little menial leaks strategy\nSo that they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of ... reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was the page and struck we're talking about and it seems we got our answer now\nWhere you're writing and I think not only are they leaking arid of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this\nYou know we're we've got actually a memos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there are a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet they knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media\nCould not be substantiated I I Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead in I'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein red defies application many side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony it is\nOf documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well\nDid they fail to read them do we know they failed to read the more they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here\nI'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed that out that the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warrants\nThat that they were literally committing fraud on the size of course they never substantiated they'd never verified they never corroborated any of the steel ... of this is Christopher ... deals\nYou know dot CA and as a result it was used as the bulk of information to attain the warrants and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they they that's correct that not even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given to Bruce or but here's the other problem\nIs is even Bruce or knew that some of the things that he was writing there or not accurate and and yet somehow they get put in\nA a three oh two and they get used as a justification to actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sick it truly is sick\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow under oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes\nOf of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte to do he indicated that he would do that so now's the time obviously to get that done and that sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there\nTo answer these important questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting fact between may ninth and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got to subpoena we've got to bring him in so we asked the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions
