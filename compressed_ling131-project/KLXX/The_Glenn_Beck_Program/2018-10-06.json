about the recent patch eighty on line but um don't do like uh if I just kept laid out the patch has been paws\nYeah you can't get it any more [laughter] so [laughter] it's a good question the question is uh\nAt this point well okay when's Microsoft it you know going to fix it and put it back on the line and\nThe truth is because it's a feature update it's not a security patch\nThis isn't a crisis or your\nMicrosoft takes their time to release these they test for months fact they're testing the next one they're they're calling it now or the uh first task twenty Nineteen so it's Nineteen one\nAnd they're testing it already in the insiders programs they test for months and so there's no rush to get this is just that a few new features and not even I think in this case anything to significant so you know we geeks like to get you know new stuff whenever\nPossible especially if it's free this case may be ... to be smart to to even after Microsoft puts it back out wait a little bit of I as I said I don't have any problem but um but some people did\nNo hurry and other whereas yup\nYeah [laughter] um but um I I'm not a law additional thing about a window\nOr before I really wanted to share\nA common question I'm ... I have a ...\nUm [noise] and so like my file not being able to say like I used to Asia and then there was like that's why we sit law well\nUm windows to bend a blog to Mike ... show oh I think a new trial to my dog can ads or in in my library is for this and uh I ...\nI'm 'cause I'm a video production hobby else and uh and I use\nThose kinds of South Wales just uh yeah that might be meeting\nAbout what the notification sad it it's like it says ... ... I had to have something like a piano ...\nThat's interesting well you're you're are you running as a limited use or a standard use standard user is a administrator [noise]\nUm our land and the owner like\n... yeah [noise] um where that is um\nYou know I could see if you were running as a a limited use or that it might say well you don't have permission to right here [noise] um it's it doesn't sound like it's it just says it's suspicious I think you know one thing you might want to do is a set up a um\nA a\nShort cut for temptation obey is to run his administrator you know when you write click on an application you can actually the pop up we'll give you at one of the officers runners administrator yeah\nAnd it may be that they're that those facts need more permission if they if they're running administrator I don't think defender would block defender would say oh well you know you have the rights to do this I haven't seen this problem but I don't use there'll be us or temptation that often\nI Would also check obviously the temptation obese forums and and see if anybody else is having a similar problem because if it's a common problem may also be configuration is you may have something to do with\nUm those programs are you know it's not unusual at all for filed permissions to get messed up you know\nAnd maybe those programs are trying to write their settings for instance a to a file that they should have access to but for some reason to file permissions have gotten messed up and you're not the owner anymore\nTry running as a ... you can you can simply a great click the uh the uh ... application I kind of run is administered just to see fit fixes it\nYou may have corrupted files you may have corrupted file system you may have a hard drive that has some issues and the software itself may be um ... maybe a damaged so it might be an interesting idea to re install or just to make sure it's not that so there's a there's a few things [laughter]\nA of a handful of things among the probably hundreds that could have gone wrong this is the problem we have these operating systems\nWe use today are so hideously complex\nThat things can go wrong in so many different places it's not always easy to figure out what's happening is a certain amount of I think there's a certain amount of intuition that\nGoes into solving problems like this and that intuition is built up over years of of solving problems like this\nI mean Microsoft's own issues I mean it seems to me maybe I'm a maybe I'm asking too much seems to me that if you make an operating system and uh and you're tested for six months with millions of\nPeople are you would you would not have a problem that it deletes hundreds of gigabytes of files when it gets updated you would catch that but that's\nThat's the problem stuff's so complicated windows runs on so many different kinds of hardware I'm very curious to find out what it is that caused this book I don't know if we'll ever know sometimes Microsoft's cagey about they don't like to talk about problems\nSo it may be that or maybe they won't mentioned but I'd like to know why would why would an installer upgrading an operating system just routinely go into your documents folder and delete stuff\nThat shouldn't happen [laughter] that\nShit an OB as should be able to write files in ...\nThat shouldn't happen that\nShit and opiates should be able to write files and camp teachers should be able to write files or you know they have in the past what's really weird is that\nYou said that it it doesn't work you try again and\nIt does or you re boot and it does that's really weird [noise] I almost always and I should probably be so way but I almost always suspect the hard drive in cases like that and the reason I Do and the reason I mentioned it is hard drives\nAre usually the first thing they have problems I was just [noise]\nAh because in in you know a lot of the older system that's moving part those drives you know they're spinning thousands of revolution submitted to get hot they get cold as it turned off and they get hot again which means they expand and contract it's actually amazing that hard drugs work at all [noise]\nSolid state drives people were very worried about the solid straight flash memory base drives that they wouldn't be as robust as spinning hard drives which now as if you think about it seems laughable\nBecause they're much more robust we just we just didn't know\nI remember the experience we're ... we're afraid they would wear out prematurely but uh I don't think that's the case so [noise] but other great fix\nFor this kind of thing is to replace that spinning drives that older spinning drive with a new solid state Dr used to be there were very very pricey\nPrices have gone down there not quite as inexpensive as spinning drives because prices are going to last about\nWe'll report the\n\nFiber optics move crazy amounts of data and even crazier
