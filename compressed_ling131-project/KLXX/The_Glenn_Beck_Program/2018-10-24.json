unconstitutionally guaranteed that right um but they're not guaranteed right sending bombs in the mail that's illegal\nI totally agree with you but you're right you got it but let me let me tell you what you let me tell you what we shouldn't have either um\nIf Sarah Sanders in her family want to sit down and eat dinner she's not working leave her alone it Pam\nWants to see a movie leave her alone if secretary Nielsen has them eating a private dinner and groups of people are running them out of the restaurant I don't want that either I don't want a secretary McConnell and his wife some guy

is that Mr Burgess out the tears Sean Hannity up getting if they're in their face this this is their rhetoric now interesting when the shooting happened to the ball field in ... Steve ... nearly lost his life\nUm and it was a Bernie Sanders supporters it turned out to be I went out of my way to say I don't blame Bernie Sanders because one not that supports him\nYou know decided to become violence is outrageous what they do they do this every time they've been their silence has been definite in recent months in days\nOr anyway Sean Spicer ... is with us senior advisors spokesmen for American first action and also former White House press secretary and the author of the book the briefing pilots\nFor the senior advisors spokesmen for American first action\nAnd also former White House press secretary and the author of the book the briefing politics the press the president Kris Kobach is back with us and uh he has penned a piece on them migraine caravan he is the elected secretary of state of Kansas an expert in immigration\nAnd uh by the way it's been very successful at what he's\nDoing and uh and uh I fully support your your victory there in Kansas who was a big win that you're pulled out in the primary and I hope the people of\nKansas are smart enough to put you in that position I Know your degree governor um look I I don't know if we're going to get to this point this caravans growing Mexico seems incapacitated unwilling to do the job of securing their own borders which they usually do a pretty good job of they either put people in jail or throw them out immediately\nUm but if they in four weeks or whatever make it to our southern border\nUm and if anybody is to cross that border or if they rush and across that border as in as one\nWe don't have any pro choice we will have to arrest them that will be a crisis precipitated by people not respecting our laws I don't want anybody to get hurt if we had a wall up right now Kris Kobach we wouldn't have a problem\nWe wouldn't have a problem and also if we had more states denying welfare benefits to illegal aliens so we give a hundred and thirty four billion dollars a year most of those are state public benefits to illegal aliens you know meanwhile you got governors\nOr like a Governor Brown out in California giving more than ... ... if if a federal and state response or the fed to build the wall and they have to stop panning out the goodies\nWhich gives the illegal aliens assurance that if they can get in that it can come in and start getting welfare benefits so you while they're looking for a job\nSean Spicer a U.S quite a lot of incendiary rhetoric throw it in your direction we'll get to that in a minute but let's talk about what the options are here I Would think that is the role of the Mexican government\nThat they should be turning these this caravan back they seem unwilling or incapable of doing so ah what should America's response be\nWell I think America's responses exactly what the president has talked about which is making sure that we protect our borders our sovereignty and our citizens and that means ensuring that we know who's coming into our country why they're coming in a and that they not coming in with either nefarious reasons\nOr to either harm us or the day you know but there's a variety in the bottom line is the number one job of any president of any elected elected official is to protect his people in the president's made very clear and the one thing I said that the other day to sell in China I Want to be clear your agree with me I Know Christ will agree as well\nTemp Donald Trump\nDon't temp temp because he's warning that can government is warned Guatemala he's told them that this is unacceptable they need to do their job stop this from happening um and I I guess I I think that if anything people have seen over the last year when he gives you a warning he means that there will be action afterwards if you don't reverse course\nLet me be very clear I I'm just going to assume I and I really believe that probably Ninety nine percent of the people in this caravan of good people people\nThat don't have a lot of opportunity and their own communities countries they want a better life for themselves and their families I Believe a lot of the age we give to many many countries is abused and it doesn't get to the people as it should\nUm with that said we have a legal process of doing so but on the other hand let's say it's only a small fraction of the many that are coming\nThat have nefarious intentions for this country we don't know there's not one person that can vouch for anybody in that care of him nobody can vouch for anybody and it would be unfair and a massive risk to the American people to allow\nNobody can vouch for anybody\nAnd it would be unfair and a massive risk to the American people\nTo allow people in on vetted no idea what their their point of view a world view happens to be whether or not they have good or bad intentions for the United states and I say that Kris Kobach assuming Ninety nine percent of of the people coming just want a better life\nWell and that's that's a very good point you know and the there's abundant evidence of terrorists using the traffic flow of illegal immigration across our southern border could get into the United states going all the way back to before nine eleven\nAh people from countries where al ... was active now countries where I suspect active have used this this flow this migrant flow to blend in there's no question that that will be the case again\nYou know the other thing Sean that I I wanted to point out is\nI think the Democrats have lost their grip on reality here there and the third stage of open borders psychosis just to follow this for a moment in the nineties\nThe Democrats were pro enforcement Bill Clinton signed the immigration reform act of ... of Nineteen Ninety six and they agreed with Republicans that we need to deport those here illegally then in the two thousands they became crow amnesty and\nThey no longer want it to deport they want to grant amnesty eleven million plus year\nNow they're taking the position that we were there cheering for illegal aliens before they even get here they want them to come in and be part of the American society it's it's gotten ridiculous fair churn people before they're even here to become unlawfully present to the United states\nAnd when you play what I played earlier it's amazing how all these politicians leaders of the Democratic party not not that long ago sounded a lot like Donald Trump\nYeah let me let me switch gears to these packages the president said um he spoke out about these despicable acts of terror he said no expense will be spared whoever's responsible for sending these packages that appears in some cases pipe bombs and powder\nThat they will be tracked down and the and the full force of the government will be coming down upon them which is the right thing to say and do 'em ... before that show and we've seen a lot leading up to this\nAnd wondering what have we seen we've been witnessing ... if I can\nGet one quick point we'll find they cause I think you're making an excellent point that one last thing it only takes one\nAnd that that leads into what we're talking about today you you can have Ninety nine point nine percent it'd be be be doing the right thing but it only takes one to do the wrong thing and I think that's what we need to remember to this whole process and we saw that today one person or however many we don't now is now frightening and terrorizing thousands and thousands of people [noise]\nUm and and you know I'm not taking any action but while I'm at the point that I'm making it it doesn't mean you can get Ninety nine point nine percent of the people through or safely but if we don't protect to get a hundred percent right people can be threatened or hurt and that's the thing that we have to make sure that we're clear on\nOur will and how do you when when the quake quake on this will come back on the other side and talk about the president's comments he will hunt down those people that have been sending these suspicious packages\nAnd powder and potential pipe bombs are two very politicians one to CNN or this is not new I've lived through this myself\nI had a one of my assistance at the time ... was in\nIsolation what was that the window what eight nine ten hours one day scared to death yeah it was horrible it was
