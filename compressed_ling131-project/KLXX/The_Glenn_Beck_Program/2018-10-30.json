today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever\nThey're not it's not mainstream it's a political group and they want to give them any attention and then anyway and it was so they invited a I guess and interviewed rabbi Jeffrey Myers he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful I mean how pastors in ... and\nYou know people the cloth are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know\nIt takes a very special anointed person to be that kind of person Donald Trump's my president the president of the United states is always welcome to visit you know my friend David shown on this program has been to the tree of life says rabbi Myers is an amazing man\nAnd um why wouldn't you want the\nPresident to come and comfort your congregation there's never been a more pro Israel president in my lifetime than this one it's just it's just the fact all these presidents promised that Jerusalem which is the rightful capital of Israel\nOwe that to move it from Tel Aviv Israel then they never do it because they never have the courage to do it or to Donald Trump is getting all these calls from other countries in the region\nAnd they said no I'm doing it I made a promise I'm keeping my word\nOh why don't we have a little bit more of that\nIs one thing that Donald Trump if he gives his word is going to he's fighting for it we see now happening on the immigration fight\nOr the president and Lindsey Graham of teamed up to and birthright citizenship in other words if you enter the country illegally and you happen to give birth to a child that child's instantly\nEven though you're in the country illegally interest in it initially is just automatically a U.S citizen doesn't matter that your parents are here illegally\nWell that is only to encouraging other illegal behavior we're asking people we support immigration legal immigration we now see caravan organizers loading in ... illegal migrants on

other things because we can't have what happened on the southern border with Guatemala Mexico Mexico southern border where people just rush across and Russia over the police you know we had apparently

public I don't know\nBut it does exist and I'm not going to go any further than that at this point so this type of thing does happen and I think like every other case\nI mean I'm not a fan of the team that Robert Mueller put together I you know I'm always torn 'cause I never want to credit you I'm I'm very fond of law enforcement I just hate the people that he hired in this witch hunt how we ever got off into things like\nYou know bank loan applications when it was supposed to be about Trump Russia collusion you know we're at a point in history where\nThis is how phony Democrats are they only

supporter Andrew Gillum just the way of background you did go to Harvard how many years did you serve the country\nI was active duty for five years in a U.S navy\nYou know I'm you know I I look at Florida they had a little bit of a red tide problem is not something that happens sickle ugly over long periods of time occasionally\nIt 'cause it's natural I think the issue we've had is\nWith Lake Okeechobee the Army Corps of engineers discharges feminist polluted water into the rivers and so it was the ... river goes into the area where you where you live in southwest Florida and I think what happened with some of those nutrients mixed with the red tide and exacerbated so we we got it bad apple is already got a really really bad\nSo I'm committed to making sure that we're batting that stopping the discharges that in order to do that you gotta work constructively what the Trump Administration because a lot of that state federal partnership I'll be able to do that Gillum wants to impeach track so I don't know how the hell is going to be able to work with them on any of that so I think any of those problems we had an eye on her\nThen what I understand it's gotten a lot better sense of it so I guess the early part of the spring and summer this year a lot of it's gone away right\nIt's just I mean quite frankly Michael washed I'm a bit\nUm you know out and so it's not as bad as it was for sure but it really yeah there was a two month stretch there in South Florida where people were just getting hammered and within that each that's ever fish kill it hurt our economy and tourism so are we didn't do whatever we can get a lot of it is your fault you know the federal government are discharging\nAre obviously he doesn't like Donald Trump\n[laughter] why I think that's probably the reason but he's also looking at districts that he thinks he can uh he can do something there uh this is\nThis has been a held by Republican for very long time and we're going to win the seat but ah yeah there's a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's coming in here it's it's gotten to a saturation point now when people are just so upset\nI think people getting wet up with it and they tune it out like I Do I mean they they're not going to listen to it any more\nThey go from their mailbox to the trash can and then they bring their if their bills and there are other male [noise] um and it's it's just so much out here right now you can't turn on your TV or in your mailbox or anything [noise]\nNow do you have enough money yourself to fight back on who you are\nYou know we're putting on our message we're putting on a message on what I've done and how we accomplished thanks for this district and people like that so that's that's what we're gonna continue to do and\nHow do you think about these other races Duncan Hunter Rohrabacher ISIS old seat the other you know Southern California districts that targeting how do you feel about those six because that could be the tipping point one week from today\nWell I tell people all the time you know Southern California is a is a hot spot right now and it's it's because uh you know the two people that are looking to be speaker or in the next session are from California\nAnd uh so they're looking at the seats but I I actually think we're going to do well I really do think he's doing well I think Dan is doing well [noise] um it's it's going to come down to the candidate though that's going to have to pull it through for themselves a lot of money is coming in and there's been a lot of help and I appreciate all the help\nWith the candidates really got to pull it through [laughter]\nAll right well we wish all the best in your race\nMoney is coming in and there's been a lot of help and I appreciate all the

the\nUh you know seamy valley area if you're in the Fresno area the Bakersfield area you know we've been out there a number of times those are all important seats and uh that could tip the balance of power in DC and that's why all that money is being flooded into their\nAh anyway we'll watch your race very closely or Steve night California's twenty fifth district thanks for being with us\nHave shown pressure\nI let's get to our busy phones eight hundred nine four one Sean our number you want to be a part of the program All right Andrew is in Albany New York WG why Andrew Hi how are you and by the way Albany is like a sewer unto its own in terms of\nEvery single high powered Albany politician or every friend of theirs ends up getting indicted I've never seen anything like it in my life\n[laughter] so corrupt Sean and Sean so corrupt\nThese calls and I'm looking at the New York times website or live polling I don't think that it fires I think that it's cute based on who's you know answering the phone don't want it to Pennsylvania one on a computer right now you know on the extreme in a district first of all\nThere is no one answer is no one else as all skew towards down close to Philadelphia I can put half acquaintance rapes [noise]\nI'm not sure exactly what you say explain that again do you think the holes are inaccurate I agree OK\nYeah and I think it's just based on who's going to cause a lot of the district for the first is a most Republican voters in the northern section or such right\nOn the border with New York right\nRight or those who want to answer the phone up there it's almost ... towards the bottom towards Philadelphia\nOh that's a big mistake I think on the Pennsylvania Republican parties part um we had a congressman on earlier this week from Lehigh Valley and you know look at every ... here's the bottom line it doesn't matter where you live\nI we are putting some importance on some of these New York races Minnesota raises California raises but the bottom line is all four hundred and thirty five members of Congress are up for reelection\nWell we need a majority but it doesn't have to be a big majority but if you can win the majority and pick up the Senate seats I think we can pick up hold the Senate seats that need to be held then it could be a very good night one week from now but I Am telling everybody gets in my opinion\nRight now Republicans have plus three for the Senate they add three senators but I also would say that in the house I'd\nSay it's probably on paper looking at poll paper and\nI'm hesitant to say this but those analyzing the races analyzing all of the new candidates you know forty five retirements in this time\nUm I Would say it's ... it's it's probably plus five maybe ten Democrat with a toss up because right now the Democrats have two hundred and five locked in races for the house the Republicans two hundred and\nNow the problem is the toss ups or almost all Republicans say you're going to have to run the table on those\nWe put all that information the most important in the top thirty that we picked then identified as easily you know\nYou can find that easily at ... dot com\nSo I don't know I'm looking at it I made like a toss up right now my computer I'm a toss up then I and I have it with a toss ups on Ninety three to locate one Ninety two but a lot [noise]\nSo right now Michael shit I'm a toss up that I mean I have it with a toss up on the street looking one Ninety two but a lot of all ... seats Shawn\nIt look let me give you one anecdotal piece of evidence we know one twenty sixteen at the exit polls show and all the polls leading up to the election showed Donald Trump wasn't going to win and the exit polls came out of five Fifteen and he said he lost everything Florida gun North Carolina gone Ohio Pennsylvania and Michigan\nOr Wisconsin gone and the same thing happened to two thousand and four five Fifteen the media was ready to declare John Kerry the next president thank God that didn't happen\nOr in a mid term if we go back twenty fourteen\nIt was for cast as a close Senate race but the G O P one nine Senate seats I mean they were wrong so I'm I say this with caution caution you know probably the best thing people can do is realize\nThat if you don't want to answer your pillow see speaker if you don't want Chuck Schumer to be the Senate majority leader then just go vote and do all you can do in your power\nAt the end of the day will deal with whatever mess if we get one that we're gonna have to deal with\nYou know there are three outcomes on Tuesday night one week from today one of those Republicans gained seats in the Senate hold the house that's the best case scenario one is a split decision they gained seats in the Senate they lose the house Nancy Pelosi speaker\nThe worst case scenario it's Speaker Pelosi Senate majority leader Schumer\nSo you know we have the power to make that not happen right now the ... they it all matters whether or not you're going to motivate your friends whether you're going to get to the polls whether you like the progress\nDo you think you're better off than you or two years ago all the important issues we talk about you know what it matters or going to have two years of endless investigations possible impeachment\nWe're going to have the rescinding of our tax cuts by the Democrats or we're going to have open borders sanctuary cities eliminate ice a and keep Obamacare every everybody as I mentioned earlier is running against running on healthcare on the Democratic side I'm like\nYou're the same people that ruin the health care system with three big wise keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less\nSo my advice is you know let's go out there and everybody fight hard if everybody does their part if everybody listening to my voice goes out and vote and if you understand the vote for any House Democrats to vote for ... below sea\nAny Democratic Senate voters a boat for Schumer\nThen we should have a pretty good night a week from now but the best part is that we live in a country where you get to decide that where every American now has the power to decide [noise] anyway um I Hope that's helpful eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program we're going to get a little into the whole issue\nOf what held
