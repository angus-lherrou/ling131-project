correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian collusion two people\nAre on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele the

now\nA second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing along computer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection\nAnd conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed they doubled down and they continue to spy on an associate of the Trump campaign and to launch a special counsel Bob Mueller\nTo drive Trump from office why haven't Andrew McCabe Z memos\nEvidence seen this soft coup attempt by Rod Rosenstein being given to Congress they've been given to of all people

differing Donald Trump\nGood title for a book I guess that's why it's number one on Solomon I Want you to weigh in on this and I'm sure miss some details here but I I'm given the best summary I can it sounds complicated but it's not\nIt's really not complicated and Greg does such a good job of cutting through all the blaster and BS in Washington and get right down to the point the FBI and the Justice Department were misused for a political opposition research project to a stop Donald Trump from becoming president and when that failed\nBase was saying I'm investigation that was designed to hamper his early presidency and that's what the overwhelming evidence now chosen and there's another important part that Baker divulge as in the middle of my story but I Want to fight the south because many times I've heard you and I've heard Greg say the media has been complicit in this well sky a\nBaker gave us an unbelievable anecdote of complicity in November right after the election right after ... when the reporter David Corn of Mother Jones\nGives a new version of the dossier gossipy copy it's different from the one the FBI has sort of steel and gives it to Baker and then Baker turns it on to the a counter intelligence people why is that important first off it's not a job of a reporter to be giving evidence the FBI where we're supposed to report facts not become snitches\nBut more importantly the timing of it is so important\nThe FBI just fired Christopher Steele for leaking um ah the existence of the investigation and all the dirty hat on Trump just before the election he gets fired they televise the court they're no longer using him and hear it becomes a backdoor a journalist becomes a backdoor\nTo continue to receive information for Christopher Steele this is not how the price of process is supposed to work and I think it's another key revelation I mean I I think they ... given several key revelations\nI Won the challenges the credibility of the same one that shows the media\nUh uh being complicit in in the effort to unseat Trump and three as a direct involvement of the Democratic National Committee lawyer and and turning on evidence pressuring the yeah yeah I\nThink of what happened in that time front Christopher Steele July fifth twenty sixteen walks into the FBI and Europe he gets turned down they don't act on them right away they they said that if they're not excited about it a few days later he goes to Bruce or the number four official in the Justice Department Bruce or puts pressure on the FBI department by reaching out and doing it\nA month later you've got a the the ... lawyer coming into the FBI again putting pressure\nOn to the system there was an enormous amount of political pressure to get the FBI\nTo find something on Trump before election day and I think when we look back at this we should all be alarmed take Donald Trump out of this any candidate any American who have been treated this way it really raises civil liberty concerns that really raises abuse of power concerns and we should all be concerned\nBy the body of evidence that our firms would read Jared has written in his book\nIs so scary that when you put it all together and now the pieces seemed to be that it literally it but for those that put puzzles together usually start on the outside and you get all the square parts on the outside and then you start feeling in the pieces of the puzzle then the next thing you have a tree then you have the grass and you have the sun\nAnd slowly but surely it seems like we now understand a lot more and that is\nThat we had a group of people\nThat literally set up an entire phony Russia investigation the very people that exonerated Hillary long before they investigated her the very people that literally signed off on warrants that are based on information she had provided\nThe courts and the very same people that after they lost had an insurance policy and now we know what the insurance policy is by any means necessary we're going to get Donald Trump and the way we're going to do it is\nA we're gonna eat secretly recorded and we're going to surreptitiously get him to say something that we think we could use against them on top of a phony investigation that they\nThey initiated through a media release strategy again of the ... you\nKnow one of the things that really ticked me off if there was a plot\nTo frame Donald Trump again the title of my book is\nI went through meticulously the FBI guidelines and the department of justice regulations on winning how you can launch a counterintelligence investigation of an American citizen\nAnd what I discovered is that the FBI violated every single solitary provision of their own guidelines they had no\nCredible evidence of crimes no plausible intelligence to justify a counter intelligence probe importantly they had no probable cause and yet on July thirty first two thousand and sixteen they officially a launch this investigation Peter Struck\nSigned the papers he had just finished meeting with Christopher Steele and in fact the same day that James Comey cleared Hillary Clinton twisting the long could tortilla and the facts his FBI was meeting for the first time in Europe in a building with Christopher Steele\nWho had compose this phony ... that the FBI was never able to verify and yet they ran with this
