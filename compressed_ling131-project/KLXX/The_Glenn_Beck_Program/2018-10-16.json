on Hannity tonight nine eastern on Fox News and if you got the other table add that to\nWhat you've been generous to share with us we really appreciate it could work sanction eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number one to talk about how corrupt the media in this country is you know it used to be stormy stormy stormy stormy loses in court or cases thrown out she has to pay legal fees but Donald Trump and you don't hear a word about it\nA first we're going to get into the issue of health care how bad has Obamacare which Democrats want to keep how bad as a band and what is the alternative\nIn terms of a solution will get to all of that listen all of us here on the Sean Hannity show we love the dollar shave club dot com\nSlash Hannity or you don't pay to be a member but it has everything you need everything I Need to look feel spell my best your best and when I Love even more is the fact you know what I I I hate going to stores I really do especially ... by a razor and it's like a\nYou know an an act of Fort Knox for crying out loud to find somebody with the right key to open up the shaver box that they have half the time dollar shave club will deliver everything you knew your door\nThe executive blade as far superior to any blade you'll ever buy in any store amber and it's about a third of the price delivered to your house they've got everything you need doesn't matter what you're getting ready for your hair they cover your head to toe your skin your face you name it they have a doctor Carver shaved butter\nBut it shows up right at your front door you only pay for what you order they even now have toothpaste and toothbrushes and then you order what you want\nWho choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big redistribution scheme\nNow if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors and we've talked about health savings accounts that we've also talked about atlas MD Dr Josh ...\nAnd Dr Lee s gross\nThis model now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all\nIf you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a a direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child\nThey negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction if you have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine\nAt a greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store it's actually it's now been implemented in his working in over five hundred practices around the country it was pioneered by my friend Dr Josh ... joins us now atlas MD and Dr Lee as gross president of doctors were patient care\nI'm I Am I pretty much explaining it right is there anything I'm missing and I would call this concierge care for every American\nI the only problem is Sean every time you talk about it at our phones will start bringing and we've got regular patients to\nTell you I have a lot of them too right\nWhere we have a you know a A R over and over there and yeah we're fulltime families additions but no you nailed it [noise]\nI mean so and you have all these pace now the bottom line is I think most people like me and I have friends of mine that are doctors or you know and friends of mine that will take care of me friends of mine that will take a call at three AM if I'm not feeling well\nMy life and these guys you know I I mean I pay them and they take my insurance does but they do it as a more of our friendship but this is something every American can have access to\nAbsolutely\nYeah attacks plane how you're making it work there and how it works for your team exactly\nOr you know I think this is like a lot of things um Silicon Valley style or Netflix or Amazon Prime of people are being be Hoover they they want a better product faster cheaper easier and and that's what Dr gross and I've done with our respective clinics\nIs just decrease the paperwork the headache the hassles the middleman so that now medicines are pity a pill now you can call ticks email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cell phone\nSo this is now implementing how many places did you get this finally up and running around the country I don't think you're explaining detail enough here explain exactly what this service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and\nIt's a flat membership rate based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits office visits it free tele medicine's so you can call tax email your doctor we have no co pays for anything any procedure we can do in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies joined injections ultrasound heart monitors lung monitors um and then wholesale medications and labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out and let their doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they supported and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist in say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\n[noise] yeah it's working everyone I think you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between you know\nThe Ford will correct I mean we want to go down there they are trying to take us down the path of socialized total government controlled health care you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decision was based upon their individual DNA we're going to take a one size fits all approach to health care it doesn't make any sense and\nYou know Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump any more than Republicans walk their healthcare chosen diagnose Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians in the health care with it that the government control health care system when you can have a better way through a direct primary care relationship\nAs we leave this is the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more\nAnd you get far in theory or care because it never really was about the patient really was always about redistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth in America you have the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income\nOne percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners\nPay Ninety seven percent so what they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young\nAnd generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying for one check up a year right out of their own pocket\nAnd also getting a catastrophic plan if God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or\nSince I had a heart attack right Dr amber yep this is a one size fits all model um it's too expensive for young healthy people\nAnd it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to\nEnsure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring you medicines that cost a penny a pill I can get a thousand ... blood pressure medicine for four dollars and Ninety cents\nSo the big box retailers will show you Ninety pills for ten dollars is highway robbery we knew cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases\nThe fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is\nCan compete on quality and and lower their price just like your Fifteen minutes we'll say Fifteen Percent on car insurance we need to get back to a competitive model for the patients are in control and cares affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nAnd where are you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do their the innovators in this upfront pricing lower costs no government mentally All right well that's true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know for example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would then would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nNow health care of local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear as the calorie is not coming from Washington to say now if we wait for ... from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other six cause problems themselves\nAnd that's exactly what this live in the movement does is to eliminate any asking\nFor permission from from Washington to take care of our fish\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but as it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the healthcare after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh number Dr Lee as gross the probably one of the defining issues that caused people make people think the Democrats are actually going to help them and it's not\nA we appreciate your time eight hundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone number if
