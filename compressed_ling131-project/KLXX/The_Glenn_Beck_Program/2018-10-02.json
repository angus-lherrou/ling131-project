the common man that does not have the knowledge that he has\nAnd it's called Jesus is risen poll in the early church and we ended up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and their bookstores everywhere a one quick thing I mean you do have that amazing talent because\nI look at myself as a guy not spent my life studying the Bible um I read it now more than I ever have and you you have made this a part of your life study\nYes I just when I I really wasn't a believer when I was a young adult and I\nKnow your car jumbled jerk like me [laughter] yeah like Brett Kavanaugh at a\n... no like rock Obama's it was part of the two gangs smoking pot and we'd and yeah and drinking in excess yeah\nYou go in and so I just I was always a seeker and I kept\nLooking for answers and and and finally I found the answers that that the I thought were intellectual obstacles and I don't really think they were ultimately but there are intellectual answers reasonable answers and we can give reasonable answers to why we believe and were encouraged by uh the Bible\nPeter that tells us that always be prepared to give the reader that you believe and there are rational reasons to believe in fate is beyond reason of course but it's consistent with rage and so I wanted to share with the game\nI got on fire for the Bible in theology so I've been reading it pretty heavy on and off for Twenty years and I have a passion to share what I've learned and help people accelerate their learning curve reduce their\nAnother was deceased and who are good answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already down his damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nSo let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed that these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case\nUm was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nAnd then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nOr the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that missile Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't short short herself a village Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News any more if they're going to put on somebody that they can't\nWho's changing her story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nOr even the Democrats um declined to fully embrace Julie sweat mixed or\nBut on the original story that Christine forward a story I think what we're going to find and what we're already finding is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like Peter Smith and mark judge amazingly enough\nThey're telling the FBI the same thing I told Judiciary Committee which they have no memory at all to support this\nNow I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections or you know remember a Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal of this party entry into Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two\nThirty six years in three months ago by the way\nI'm listening who is that the party and it didn't match up with a with Christine foreign ths account of this but they thought this was a big deal so let's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that I think there are three additional people calm burning and squeeze\nA who had not been interviewed earlier a and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about a Christine ports are allegations so uh I listen I\nI I don't think this FBI sing happy either ... is a bad thing I think that they will find out that there is no evidence to support this did find out actual real evidence to support us and I've changed my mind but I don't think it's fair\nWell if you go through I I thought it was really devastating to report by Rachel Mitchell um now he's the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes\nAnd she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be extremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so they brought in an independent prosecutor to to question professor Ford who showed incredible respect to her\nBut she pointed out that he said she said cases incredibly difficult to prove itself\nAnd then she goes on this cases even weaker than that and then she stopped to Fort identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues there was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault\nHappened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually the failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh as the assailant\nAre inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember the details\nTo invite it forward to the party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place how did you get home from the party um and and it goes on from there but every case is similar in as much as there is no corroboration their big holes in the stories\nAnd at some point when do we ask is this becoming a witch hunt we know that that birds cats as a friend sending out emails and she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly consistent on the issue of of sexual misconduct\nAnd they're sending out letters to the or so and so do you know anything please call us and do those letters went out\nI Know please some core operation you know the ... case right in the mirror at times they said they called they talk to thousands of people not to me that says twenty four people or more I mean that is a lot of people can look at\nYou know she was a lot of criticism of her and um I think that the the way she approached it was not a really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they always did she had to be interrupted every five minutes but she did\nIt listed a lot of information I was looking today at her questioning of a Ford about her therapist and the therapists notes and the white we even know about this because remember\nFord says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty thirty six years to two thousand twelve\nAnd she ... she says she's in marriage therapy with her husband and she tells the therapist about that and she later also tells an individual therapists about that as well and she checks the therapists notes and the therapists notes do not mention the name Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd she says as a matter of fact it's only her husband remembering that at the session she brought up Brett Kavanaugh's name\nThat is the only evidence\nThat it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the ... there are would be confidential but of course she gave them\nTo the Washington Post so they're probably no longer a confidential so even even her account of how she finally mentioned is to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have Judiciary Committee Democrats\nNow they're wanting to investigate the quote ice throwing incident in college you know this is what it's about a primary because\nYou're telling the truth because that's what they say well\nNow we have the the democratic hope uh Hawaii senator the one that said to men to just shut up and sit down on Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants that investigation into the ice throwing incident I'm\nAt a ball game and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity about was he truthful about is drinking he said he liked me or he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college in high school kids I drink too much fear\nBut they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um nobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said to somebody I blacked out correct\nSo does it look hula fishing expedition this is now a destroy cabin on expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him so here you know ... question ... go ahead we don't want to get out of\nThe things that he claims yeah I'm from an emphasis on the the sex misconduct allegations too was he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact that there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations\nAnd now they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking although mentioned many times in his testimony\nThat he did um in fact drink today rocks published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking\nCricket is mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nAre they going to let it go there thank you so much Byron York a widow sanctions on
