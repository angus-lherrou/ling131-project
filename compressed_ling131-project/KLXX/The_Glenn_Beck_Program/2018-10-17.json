would do she tried to catch the incident on video\nAnd then the assailant was having none of that cursing at are backing or into the street and tell her to go kill yourself didn't walk to a nearby BP presumably to stop stock up on\nYou know whatever Cheetos a mountain dew whatever it happens to be the go to source or whatever but Anderson gave chase in her car the man in charge there to her again

phenomenal and it's called the Trump the blue collar president\nAh I Know it's too early to talk about the book you tell some amazing stories about who really Donald Trump is where he came from and and his background and you know a whole story that the media is never told about him and I learned a lot rating and how are you my front\nUm you know Sean I'm doing great but you know you're you're you're mentioning a lot of very interesting things and one thing I always remember that the president he may hit hardest Sean a buddy always hits second any often hits last I've never seen him unilaterally come after anybody it's only after they attack him that\nHe doubles down and starts to counter punch you know so Elizabeth Warren attacking him he's ignoring her and then bam Pocahontas or a Republican candidate in the primary tacky and then he fires off the nickname\nSo the the the point being is that like he is actually a very civil guy until you start shooting at him and then once you start shooting at him he's gonna hit you with the full force there\nI just think it's a very important distinction between what's going on between the Democrats\nAnd let me tell you you know I mean it's so funny because I remember a conversation once I had with the president and and you were at the White House for a pretty short period of time and\nHe he talked about you which is very interesting to me and he talked about well this Harvard Anthony and then there's the kids in the street and he and a and I know both I mean\nSo you know he yelled at me he yelled at me after the cursing gotta remember like the the guy Ryan Lizz have legs are total liar he basically faded me into the call but then he's asking me to do a profile\nWith them and then that's when I responded with the exploit it but you know what it is what it is ... what the the president yelled at me he said hey man I Need less street Anthony and I need more Harvard Anthony but you know what John what makes you grade on the radio and and uh\nAnd the reason why we're so close that we both have a little bit of that in ... when you were a bus\nIn ... when I was washing dishes bussing tables I was a cook yeah that's right but you know something a little bit and I wouldn't trade that experience in life for anything or the years I spent in construction which was two decades of my life\nAnd I don't know I mean I I I think a lot of us in that are blessed and lucky and successful I met too many people that forget what they come from and I'm not going to forget where I came from and I just thought it was not in me [noise]\nWell that's the point though that's the point in the books on I really do try to explain\nThat your story or my story is a classical American story or a where we were in these aspirational working class families and our parents wanted us to do better and they were fully bought into as where our grandparents into the American dream\nAnd so uh what the president is trying to do what you try to do every day what I tried to do in my small way\nTo see if we can make that happen for people\nThat were similarly situated or currently similar similarly situated the way we were in the Nineteen sixties and seventies growing up and so that's one of the reasons why despite getting far from the White House I never broke ranks are never broke\nMy loyalty from the president because\nI really do believe this horse in the right place and I really believe that uh you know she is the right\nWithout throw rise in line the proof is in the ...
