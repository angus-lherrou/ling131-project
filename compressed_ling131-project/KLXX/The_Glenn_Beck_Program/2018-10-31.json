three to five\nBecause our kids took the message to their friends their college classmates\nAnd some of them ended up voting as well so I'm a couple of weeks ago I spent three hours on the road

I think Mr Speaker see if you agree with us\nYou know I think the Ninety nine percent of people that were in a caravan they see America as the land of milk and honey and opportunity which we kind of take for granted sometimes as Americans and I'm sure that Ninety nine point eight percent of them are probably good people just want a better life\nUm we can't vouch for any of those people in terms of other enemies of America that mix themselves into that group\nThe idea that we're going to have five seven fourteen thousand whatever the numbers are different estimates room everybody just get to
