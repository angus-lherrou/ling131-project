they discourage that\nYou know they want you to walk I admit I maybe spend a little time on my segue or bicycle play book and one girl but you can find in the apple these ... do you play poker among girls got us hooked on it is yeah\nOh ... what you all have you heard that that voice you hear that's Kim Schaffer she is our phone answering machine I hear\nYou have another name for me what is it it's been brought to my attention at one of the other shows you might have called me a serving Lynch well\nYou were when you go look what is it oh yum so\nI mentioned that uh during your off hours you work at an English pub in off hours which are most of them most of them when you only work here six hours a week okay\nA but during that time um you have to work in an English pub and you knew it was a Brit yes was very excited\nParents he stops by I've never seen\nIt was always like you said there's a one on the way home sort of ... your oh it is mine is for sure mine he's mentioned the it's the Mayflower but the Mayflower oh yeah\nSo I had a strange um Saturday Night shift last night and I a sacrifice my own nourishment and the guts used and sausage\nAlthough I Can't wait oh lord I Can't wait yeah they're they're sausages and their roles every good pastries on a\nSide or the way they would go better I\nSuppose they eat a in the ... they eat\nYeah [laughter] line through on that doesn't seem right thank you Kim hello and loyal to board the tech guy\nThank you so much I have no idea how this happened I was on a really intense call had it on speaker so it wasn't touching the phone I got interrupted three times you know when the phone puts the other person on hold and says you know do you want to take this call or whatever yeah\nThree different times and I yelled at them there that they were family in my cleaning lady and then told them I Can't talk now call me on the line or wait an hour or whatever I said [noise] yelling at them trying to\nGet a caller would pick it picked up the other the other so there's a button when you get a phone call an iPhone you you you get some choices you can either hang up the other call and take the new one or you could put the other one on hold and take the new one where you can ignore it and it's not you're not touching and then it's automatically putting another call on hold and picking up\nExactly ended and that would I don't understand is I when I look when I call these people that I had to eat crow because I'm Sorry they didn't call me my phone card\nAnd while I was on this other phone call on speaker I had the phone down I was making notes\nWell I don't know what happened it's never done this before you know developed a life of its\nOwn else in it as it happened again\nNo it just happened to those three calls on friday\nAnd Ira and you were on speaker phone yes and\nUh and uh so you weren't touching it it was just sitting on the counter\nRight and then the rain you know put the other person at one point it actually I tried to put the phone on hold her call back or something and it disconnected so I had to call the other one I Want it back\nBut it made three separate my phone call these people while I was on this phone call\nI've never heard of this happening before [noise] so that's the good news um [noise] I don't know how it might have happened in law has there is one possibility that something you're saying oh these triggering Siri now this has happened in fact you may remember\nA couple of months ago we had a story about a a couple who were having an argument and the argument was somehow by transcribed recorded by the Amazon Echo and sent to an employee of the husband who then called and said I don't I don't know why but I just got an email with a recording of you guys having a fight\n[laughter] and if it was a Amazon said yeah this happened but it's hard to have\nIt's a ... you know you have to say the trigger word and then you have to say in other words this call this person and is there any chance you mentioned any of these people's names in your ... no\nI did I did not and the Dickens is frequently I'll Try to ask theory for something and she just\nSaid of course money is you know it's the old story you can never can never find a\nPolice officer when you need one but the minute you go five miles over the speed limit there they are they're they are and it's the same thing Siri never works when you want it to work um I I don't probably isn't serious because that would be a really happened three times would be especially surprising you know you'd have to say something to do\nIt called one person twice and then it called another person\nYeah it does sound like it's a glitch in the phone there's something wrong with the phone\nOr should I take it to apple and see well\nThey're going to the problem with all of this stuff is unless you can make it happen again they're going to say well we don't know what's going on if you can make it happen in front of them they'll go well whatever that is it happened I Would say if it doesn't happen again just put\nOh my God if you can make it happen in front of him they'll go well whatever that is it happened you know I Would say if it doesn't happen again just put chalk it up to we're not willing weird Halloween Jew Jew but otherwise if it happens again yeah I I Would I Would bring it to apple and say it's happened a couple of times\nYou know one thing I really learning with all smartphones even the iPhone is occasionally restarting it every few days refreshing it by turning it all the way off and you know with the iPhone now it's complicated you have to press the on\nScreen on off button and the volume of button on the newer I for one year old I voted I see I think you can just press and hold the power off button for a while what okay yes lied to turn it off and then you can wait a second and immediately re booted\nThat just clears everything out of the memory uh and it's it's a computer and you know the computers when they're rebooting sometimes work a little bit better\nI mean that's not much of a solution for you but it just uh I I Can't imagine what it was that was happening it's a weird glitch yeah and look let's hope it doesn't happen again if it does do you take it to the ... go back a K yeah\nThank you so much I enjoy your show and learn all the time\nOr less you thank you so really listening and thank you hear well hang on that and if anybody has had that happen because maybe there is something I never heard\nOf that and it's just [noise]\nWe'll avoid the tech guy more

not exactly the same situation and then you weren't in the middle of a call I did that too or did that thing that was it an iPhone\nIt now it was an Android no three\nYeah [noise] so did you ever figure out why I was doing that\nI I finally moved on to another ... it did just that I couldn't handle it any more [laughter]\nYeah oh that's interesting I maybe it is maybe it's maybe it's more common than I thought\nWhen I was trying to find the answers to it there's it's not carrier specific and it's not\nPhone specific so I don't know I wanted to send it the father Robert and see if he
