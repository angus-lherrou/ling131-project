think it's going to be less than\nI actually think will be a blessing in disguise it will be a good thing\nIt may it may be but the Democrats are only using this as a device\nTo come up with new claims of racism and pedophilia and gay though accused him of being gay before they're done uh and uh it's about it's about stopping the nomination Lindsey Graham he's in a tizzy these days and he's\nTalking about and I like this investigating the Democrats and they're corrupt role in this whole process\nWas on a duo wholesale full scale investigation of what I was a despicable process to deter from happening and yeah\nThat is a really good idea and I'm a hundred percent in favor of that Tom Cotton is an American hero um it said it borrowed line but\nFor three months the Democrats have turned me advice and consent process into a search and destroy a mission Dianne Feinstein and her staff is going to face an investigation for why they leak that\nI think they are not that is going to I think they are Senator Bill Cassidy Republican\nAnd Democrats want to say that we need to kind of get to the bottom of it let's go to some folks who may have coordinated the lay of the new lay on the given a letter to the FBI for two months when it could have been investigated in accordance with Dr affords wishes confidential [noise]\nThe one running [laughter] no not at you and not a

to Richard ... he's leaving the ah the TV business I'm In the Senate and uh and [noise] they says he wouldn't have been able to undermine his own party if he had been staying\nAnd to couch tired of the Democrats but he's looking for a multimillion dollar job\nAnd that's that's\nHow this works I guess let's go to Matthew Miller Matthew Miller\nA is a an Obama administration official who is now employed by NBC News just like John Brennan who voted for communist for president of the United states and Matthew and he was on the television this morning at the circle fast with the pigeon sisters on MORNING joke\nAnd uh he's asked well what about the FBI investigation gosh and again he's an Obama administration official not pretending to be a journalist or a commentator or something like that\nAnd they pay 'em at NBC to so the Democrat Party line while pretending to be an object of something or other when they know perfectly well that he's not\nAnd the FBI investigation well it's not nearly brought it I Know we agreed on friday to one week and I have a scope surrounding what we're discussing Eric's but we just through all that out because we are really really dishonest\nThe FBI knows exactly what's going on here that they're being used by the White House one of the White House wants them to get like a good you know a good housekeeping staff approval and act you know the investigation being limited from the outset where it can only kind of produce a pre ordained outcome if you can't go look at everything\nWhat now there is no but everybody sits there nodding in agreement first of all it's a good housekeeping seal of approval not that good housekeeping stamp of approval I don't know what\nContinent you grew up on but this Obama administration official or is just uh we usually little hacked and he's kinda creepy he's like a vampire and you know this guy has got a bit creepy little man\nAnd he looks like a vampire and uh and and and the scope is exactly what the Democrats insisted upon it's precisely what it says to the front and now they're minions they're flying monkeys like this little monkey boy\nAnd so many other uh they uh they just changed the terms they just throw out the term so I Know what we agreed to\n... we were lying you know us we're relying at the time\nAnd we had no intention for a moment\nOf sitting by and letting this investigation just take a week this is about delaying about postponing this is about destroying a family and American family that worked hard kept their nose clean those to the grindstone you know squeaky life\nAnd that doesn't matter because we've got a storm of fecal contamination here that will destroy the world before we allow this to happen\nUh Matthew Miller he's a Democrat new show or the the White House didn't this is the one of the lies they invented and they just ... again\nThere ... Joseph ... Hitler's propagandist was a hiker compared to these people\nI mean that I'm not embellishing that's not sometimes I like to belly shouldn't exaggerate I'm not exaggerating I'm not [noise] that's how big allies are here gigantic the White House is using the FBI the FBI was asked by the Democrats to investigate but they needed White House approval\nBecause the FBI is an executive branch agency and doesn't work for the Congress the ...\nTo investigate but they needed White House approval\nBecause the FBI is an executive branch agency and doesn't work for the Congress the Congress is already investigating they know that\nAnd they lie about that being irrelevant because they live all the time and a and here's Matthew Miller and and it's yeah it's a they want the ah good he's keeping housekeeping um stamp of approval he says\nAnd this is so limited it's not limited\nThey're they're just they couldn't be more full of it\nAnd now they're starting conspiracy theories and this guy this Obama administration rancor\nMatthew Miller he worked at the Justice Department which was so corrupt during Obama\nUnder holder Michael Brown an officer Darren Wilson who's still in hiding because of the murderous threats of the Democrats and\nUh I you know the Justice Department under Brock Obama Loretta Lynch on me and a phony dossier and uh this guy I I just smell corruption is he smells like corruption all over the place\nSo he's got conspiracies peddling conspiracies now\nAnd uh the White House is using the FBI now again you do what the Democrats ask you to do you call for a White House investigation and then they accuse\nYou of using the FBI to rubber stamp your investigation [noise]\nYou can't deal with people like this in a normal rational fashion and that's why I'm concerned things are going to get really bad than when a Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court because they're smear Lynch job is not going to work because\nThe FBI is going to find out that there's just no they're they're\nOn they've got three Democrat accusations Dr Ford who the Democrats ginned up she she she popped up out of the would pile but then the Democrats held her and reserve and they abuse the hell out of her and\nAnd she's pixilated then they know it and they got or left wing activist lawyers and they got her the go fund me pages and they stood up this whole organization around her and uh that one has she can't remember any she's got the IRS\nAnd I can't remember stuff I'll say that I Can't remember stuff she's got the arrest or the women can't remember things from two months ago [noise]\nAnd you're going to hang somebody based on something she's remembering it's like a money python skit\nHer story is like I'm On a python skit and the Democrats they got everybody all whipped up across the country where they're opening their own vans and things that's completely nuts and there will be violence when he is or when he is confirmed that he will be ... and the left will become fighter pilot\nAll the time when they're sitting there being quiet and just in between violent episodes\nAnd then there's the Ronan Farrow story which the New York times uh tried their damn dust chicken from\nInterviewing more than thirty six people they said\nMany of whom said oh yeah we talked to her what sets Ramirez an Romero's called her friends last week and told her friends well I don't even remember if it was Kevin or not but somebody rag Darwinian my face\nWhen I was a freshman at Yale so I got to go to run and for the New Yorker and say it was capping off and that's how that went to I mean that really is it in a nutshell I'm not even being unfair I'm a I'm I'm ... citing what the New York times said and why they didn't go with the story\nAnd then of course there is the the industrial a judge or we'd style ISIS scale\nA drug gang with quail loads certain teenage girls in the punch bowl with quite loads and then pulling the train woo woo choo choo Charlie was an engineer and he went to Georgetown Prep and they're asking\nAnd ... with quite loads and then pulling the train woo woo choo choo Charlie was an engineer and he went to Georgetown Prep and they're asking you to believe this\nAnd and if you believe this year very dumb you're a very dumb person at the third one in particular I mean and that one specifically if you believe that was what what was going on at Georgetown Prep parties with Fifteen year olds\nBased on the testimony of a woman who was committing a series of felonies by being there [laughter]\nContributing delinquency of miners gang rapes ... uh the drugs the alcohol the sexual assaults a and there's a woman who was at that time of the age of majority there for a legal adult\nShe is guilty of a long list of felonies based on what she testified to in porn lawyers little deposition so uh this guy Matthew Miller listen to those she's gotten more conspiracies on again he was he worked at the very corrupt Loretta Lynch\nObama Justice department where there were leaking stuff and using the ... and all that stuff and he's predicting more bad things\nI don't think the FBI is going to take very kindly to being Donald Trump past the specially after this happened Eighteen months when he attacked him and undermine them so I\nI guarantee you will see more leaks from the bureau guaranteed what the limits are on this investigation\nAnd whether they can actually go get to the truth which is their job and ... which is what they would like to do\nYeah that like you guys um guarantee you will see more leaks you remembered Chuck Schumer is saying that the uh\nThe intelligence community will screw ya six ways to Sunday or something like that remember that a Alison Jim Rada pretends to be a journalist she is employed by the time Warner corporation\nAnd see an end the big guy and as they are very upset that the Democrats another just throughout the agreement on friday and they've started over again and the media are are there water carriers\nThe FBI is investigating the planes against that cabin al ... is it it will investigation\nHouse has a bureau hasn't rain to look into sexual misconduct allegations against his Supreme Court nominee but certainly is healthy and and the White House is narrowing the focus and controlling to do with the help of Senate Republicans\nThis morning that witnesses with stories to tell about Brett Kavanaugh has to have your are trying to reach the FBI but they are having trouble doing is they're", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Marilu Henner Show",
