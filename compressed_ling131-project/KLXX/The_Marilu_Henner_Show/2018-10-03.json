the tallest ... in the room\nOn the circle fest known this morning joke and really guys this morning and they were all talking to their kicking it around there already laying the ... they're they're shifting the ground this is really guys on MS DNC this morning on MORNING joke with a pigeon sisters\nI'm there he's telegraphing because these are the Democrats you don't have to wait for the Democrats on the hill these are the Democrats and what they're arguing now is well this FBI investigation will be declared inadequate\nAnd we will declare Nolan void and it will not affect our thinking or votes or rhetoric or anything else we're going to continue the blood drenched jihad against this innocent man there's good and decent man\nWho has been slime by the filthy us gang of gangsters line balls\nIn the history of American politics I think we'll I guess and this was in my best girl sitting there this morning and we were listening to it and I am a lean forward a little bit and I think my best girl said oh here it is here it is the ground is shifting here it comes to have you ever had\nPulled up the idea that investigation is Jeff Flake and Chris Coons and others teamed up was to give\nHer perhaps to Republicans and say look we looked into this but independent third party investigative body [noise]\nTo give them coverage of oh yeah they say they clear judge Kavanaugh

they're going to want to extend it until next year some time special counsel two and a half years later\nA it's not about getting to the truth I'm\nIt's just not about getting to the truth and all they have an interview cabin on Ford they're pretending it's over and they haven't done in the news media is insisting that the FBI do with the news media wants them to do otherwise the news media won't tell them that are they've done an adequate job\nNow it's a Lynch mob a and unfortunately Lindsey Graham is Atticus Finch willy ...\nThe whole week long pause was supposed to get some clarity to it yes it while I'm afraid by leaving out the two key witnesses although they did testify under oath before the Senate only cloud that further and make them more controversial when the vote finally comes up later this week\nNow they're talking about jumping the gun and uh you know little learning is a dangerous thing\nUm they declared I guess the FBI investigation to be over because they read something that said that it might have ended as soon as Tuesday Afternoon or Tuesday evening the FBI has not indicated that it's over and I'm ... and they're just saying what they're they're ... they're muddying\nThe FBI investigation ahead of time and that's what they're doing\nA Lindsey Graham let's go to Ellen ... they are\nThey are laying down the credit here to oppose whatever the FBI comes up with and to dismiss it and say well that doesn't change we need more investigation and more investigation and it is at that point that you will know that they are alive I mean if you haven't wised up yet you're probably hopeless\nBut at that point you should know that you're just being hoodwinked you're there fraudsters right number seven Lindsey Graham\nLindsey Graham yesterday he might
