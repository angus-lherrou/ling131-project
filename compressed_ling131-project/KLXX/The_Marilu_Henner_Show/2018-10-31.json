Trump is president said she said I went to lay awake at night with Trump's outrageous running through my head\nThat didn't want to grant full right so that's the purpose of the fact I and and then later and I'm really not to a hundred years later in the Nineteen sixties then when you start to expand the meaning the interpretation\nOf the language contained in the fourteenth amendment and now President Trump is causing us to take another look at the language\nAnd it will be sorted out and I would put to you that first of all legislation should be passed so you know liberals loved being in sync with European countries it would put us in sync with European countries to do away with our current\nBirthright citizenship status you know not a lot of people go to ... to take advantage of their birthright citizenship\nUh Ireland's done away with an England's center with France has done it with their journey has done or they've ah they've all done away with it all the places liberals go on vacation\nThey've done away with birthright citizenship Jonathan Turley well what did the authors of the fourteenth amendment\nIntend what were they talking about and I was reading earlier from some of the uh the language from\nFrom the the author of the actual amendment who was a Michigan Republican senator and he quite explicitly said in his writings what it was intended to include and what what is not intended to include\nSenator Jacob powered of Michigan uh every person born within the U.S on this subject jurisdiction this will not he said of course include persons born in the U.S\nWho are foreigners okay aliens or who belong to the families of ambassadors and that should give you a clue as to what the intent of the fourteenth amendment was Jonathan Turley\nSome of the draft or is of the fourteenth amendment indicated that they did not believe that this language was unlimited birthright protections are guaranteed a some of them actually are put in legislation a limiting a birthright citizenship to children are citizens or legal residents\nNow as a calm cool and collected scholarly type of person hey uh Jonathan Turley this morning he said I don't like the executive order approach that President Trump is taking but at the same time you know if you turn the channel look at CNN all this insanity and the rain\nThe border approach that President Trump is taking but at the same time you know if you turn the channel look at CNN all this insanity and the range they love the rage that's ridiculous to say there is a a reasonable measured legal scholar Jonathan Turley\nYeah I don't understand all the hyperbole and anger about this this has been a long standing debate there's good faith arguments on both sides the natural reading of this amendment which seem to support unlimited birthright citizenship but the history\nThe tax some of the drafter tend to go the other way and courts will view clauses like this is having meaning they don't just this tense them so the question is why was this clause put in what was it referencing and you can make a disease or certainly make a good faith argument that it limits\nBirth racism birthright citizenship the United states has something of an outlier there's only about thirty countries that recognize unlimited birthright citizenship and that doesn't mean that you can use the executive order you know I testified against President Obama using executive orders and I think it was wrong that I think it's wrong now\nYeah but it starts the conversation it gets the ball rolling a anyway a size and he said it's hilarious you go to CNN MSNBC the Washington Post that said Trump is outrageous lawyer enough fraud and are racist and ...\nAnd they said no other country has birthright citizenship when thirty or thirty three other countries have birthright citizenship yeah look at which countries first of all now the president may have gotten that wrong or misspoken or he may have\nA button and the news media is trying to make it sound like we're the outlier it truly use the word outlier there that were the outlier because there are thirty three other countries rather about two hundred countries in the world\nAnd of those approximately two hundred and countries and its approximate\nBecause it depends on whether you account and Dora and and the Vatican and the Palestinian territories and so different people count different ways about two hundred is a good and fair number and we're not the outlier in fact uh the thirty or so that have birthright citizenship\nThey're kind of the outliers at this point not the other way around also Jonathan Turley points out that Lindsey Graham is now proposing legislation in the Senate\nOr and he prefers that approach\nBut I think Lindsey Graham's proposal legislation or could have a stronger case to make in court\nNow and that's where the president's executive order a which hasn't happened yet but it's been suggested\n[noise] can he change\nThe fourteenth amendment with an executive order or I Would I based on my reading of this and the way I was brought up I Would say no\nYou can't change it but here's the question have we changed to the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment overtime to the point where the president wouldn't really be changing it he would be restoring the status quo ante restoring its in its original intent\nI'm John Burnett has the CNN a finger he's a finger on uh the cable news network in the morning he's a he's an angry little Democrats and he hates President Trump and and he is not a legal scholar or anything but they play one on TV\nIs also claimed that he can to fire the U.S constitution and birthright citizenship fires Republican lawyers they say no\nSay that they said they they go and Republican lawyers\nConstitutional scholars on Republican lawyers they said no I just had Jonathan Turley on a saying then so they say well there's universal agreement that's a lie he's a lion little second we're All right and I and he lives all the time because he hates Trump's so much now\nHe's a lion little second we're All right and I and he lives all the time because he hates Trump's so much now\nYou can debate it but these frauds these these fingers coming on here do fire the U.S constitution is not looking to defy the U.S constitution he's challenging the conventional wisdom on a\nOn the fourteenth amendment on birthright citizenship and by the way the words birthright citizenship do not appear in the fourteenth amendment\nSo in these people like Jennifer Rubin at the Washington Post pretend that this is settled because it's an shrine than the fourteenth amendment show me where it's been tried in the ... where it's not subject to where it hasn't been hotly debated over the years and then I just love this thing Maggie Haberman\nBit tired haggard the New York times typist for the\nDemocratic Party who doesn't know what sham poo is four she was on the television this morning and the short run this little thing just made me laugh it's about how exhausted that they are\nFrom President Trump they're they're just they're exhausted here's exhausted them that they they think they're in the fabric ... but they're not he has he has a defected from here's here's exhausted them they're completely worn down to knobs and she looks like it to\nAn attorney in politics in general let alone and the Trump era I feel like it here\n[laughter] I just like that part you know election day the midterm elections those way to get the electric the midterm elections are six days away it's like well is this going to play him to the mid term elections and she's like I have no idea there are six days away on and it's like dog years or something\nAnd turning politics in general let alone in the Trump era I feel like here's\nYeah well you know every day's a year to you a ... with the New York times or oh the caravan the president has made the caravan\nOf ... the media's all upset about this there are thousands of people stumbling toward our country carrying the flags of foreign nations and they have a list of demands and the news media it's like oh that's great isn't that wonderful that's the best thing ever\nBut they're upset the news media the New York times on ... on CNN that the president has successfully made the caravan into a political issue I think the Democrats created the caravan to some degree or another and then birthright citizenship\nI Will say there there's a difference in wind that will ... ... talking about birthright citizenship\nBaking mining American I'll I stepped on it I said she here is the care of and that is taking aim at migrants\nNot illegal not people looking to come to the country really just migrants and the birthright citizenship I Love this part I stepped on it I got to play it again is taking aim at Americans I won't\nSay there there's a difference in one of the caravan of ... talking about birthright citizenship that is taking aim at American\nTalking about birthright citizenship is taking aim at Americans\nI just don't know how one tortured mind arrives at that destination I just ... what what Americans ... and these idiots they sit there with their mouths hanging open there is dumb as me ... and and and they just don't know what to say\nHow is birthright citizenship ship taking aim at Americans how is that\nThe whole point is you have to be a foreigner to\nJump into the birthright citizenship thing it has nothing to do with Americans it has everything to do with foreigners obviously if you're an American you're in America you give birth to your you know your child is an American\nFear in American you're overseas you give birth your child is an American if you're a foreigner and you're in the United states and you give birth the question is should that child automatically have you\nHow ... how does that take aim at Americans Kellyanne Conway a from the White
