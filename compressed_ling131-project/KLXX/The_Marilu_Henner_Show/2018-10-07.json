F. L. and a killer [noise]\nNo I Love football but fortunately real nerds don't like support ball no they don't so all you ... list and you need to call yeah really adds that is your chance here's your here's your opportunity who should I if I didn't know\nWho should I talked to she just talked to mark [laughter] Okay Mark in Santa Ana okay how are you able to listen you Kelly online or you know hardly ... were on I found out the other day or something like two hundred eighty stations across the country you know not all of them are playing football\nPunching down this thing called the Internet\nWhere you ... you know you can hear the show anywhere in the world yes surely in Bulgaria and they're not playing NFL games I mean well anyway here we go mark hello mark from\nSanta Ana who's listening but he also calls we can sink camp songs together [laughter]\nMight hear crickets [laughter]\nAnyhow and by the way I'm betting you that Microsoft thing as a compiler\nA compiler air yeah think about what it basically it's I think is doing is just doing a ... a a a not an upgrade but you know how they have the advanced than the regular and one is wipe out all your stuff\nMaybe somebody pushed the wrong button there saying click click the wrong check mark\nEither that or you know it you've done enough uh programming to know that sometimes the compiler decides to do something unplanned\nYeah so what you would think I mean if that's the case wouldn't\nSome body have run it at least once before saying here have it everybody\nSomebody must have noticed that I Know I Know Microsoft has lots of testing that I just uh it's very hard to imagine what went wrong the real problem Microsoft has is that unlike apple where you know there's a handful of ... of machines run apple or all of the run ... macro as all of a made by apple so they know\nThe testings fairly easy with Microsoft there's thousands of PC manufacturers every machine has a some sort of different you know configuration of hardware and other programs running on it and you're installing a challenging thing which is to install a big upgrade on who they are in place operating system so\nThat is not an easy thing to do and I think what's happened probably more likely is it worked it worked for me it worked for most people but some people had some sort of odd thing oddball thing running that are somehow in Iraq\nAnd please it worked it worked for me were for most people some people had some sort of odd thing oddball thing around and that uh somehow interacted poorly with the installer I mean you're right the installer shouldn't have done that but\nIt's very slow as uncle you'll always says there's so many millions of combinations said problem and and anybody is two hundred or whatever gig data loss is big news\nWell it is but yeah that's right ... when you have a billion users if even one one thousand to one percent of them have problems is that thousands of people so\nYep [noise] um okay so my question is is got an Android two fifty six gig um essay and I would like to just download all my email on it and be able to search it nicely and the only problem is so far I've tried a couple of different email programs\nAnd about every twenty to thirty emails I gotta say download show more show more\nShow and that's not the email program are you using Gmail\n[noise] uh no this is actually a go daddy\nDaddy it's not the email programs fall it's something go daddy's doing a lot of email servers do this because they don't want you to hit the server real hard and say give me all fourteen gigabytes in my email now\nSo they ... and they say well you can have a certain number of messages at a time [noise] ah so that's I mean that's really all that's going on or it's not so you can try you know Android email program so you're blue in the face and a and you still have the same problem because it's not\nThe program itself it's it's go Debbie in the mail servers doing it\nOr how do you get around it I don't know I mean I Would I generally will first of all I'm map\nWhich is probably the protocol you're using yes\nA isn't really designed for downloading emails designed for cashing and what's on the server but the server is the definitive store and that's not on your phone or computer anything is on your premises it's on the uh the the ... ... email providers premises so\nThat is you ... you know I met president really designed for you to download anything it's just caches it\nSo if you really want to download and you should investigate with and I bet you this is the case that go daddy server will support pop three\nWhich is the old remember post office protocol\nThat allows you to download all the mail and find a a pop three or Android email program that will support pop three uh I don't know if canine will do it that's the most um [noise] that's the most powerful email that I Know of on Android K dash nine is open source\nIt probably support yes supports pop\nSo would you put it in ... do you use the pop server for go daddy instead of the IMF server\nAnd then you download it may still um say all you can only have twenty but tomorrow you can get twenty more tomorrow after after that day for that and over time you can gather all the mail basically that's what popped threes designed for pops three ... the older political was designed for you to log into your mail server clean it out\nAnd then uh and because that was because her dress bases expensive in ISPs didn't want to keep your mail nowadays because we have many devices the ISP keeps your mail and the devices are just a window into the server that makes sense\nYeah real quick thing yes if\nYou don't have any more callers one quick thing about football I was a a dinner for my wife's work and we're like five couples and I said I Can't watch football it's two Thirteen minutes compressed into two and a half to three hours my wife my take I have time to cut or\n[laughter] it's not merely engaging [laughter] you need an action movie if you want to avoid cuddling [laughter]\nNo that's true it is it's eleven to Thirteen minutes of action spread out over a three hour period it's kind of amazing I Do fortunately have more calls thank goodness so I appreciate it mark\nAnd spread out over a three hour period it's kind of amazing I Do fortunately have more calls thank goodness so I
