well one of the things that we had brought up on previous episodes of the show was ownership of vehicles by subscription\nRight you know Cadillac has been doing a an experiment and and\nThe ownership experiment okay and I'm not a lot of friends of mine that are in the industry\nAnd the concept is that you would pay a flat fee per month for your vehicle and you would be able to get your vehicle your maintenance your insurance you or\nNot not fuel or tires or breaks said basically rental car everything but gas yeah and you're and you're paying well yeah because the brakes and tires or whatever and they're actually I mean you have to and so that that has been saying in in in the case of the Cadillac model they even went so far on their high end package\nThat you could swap out in ... which vehicles during the course of your subscription yeah that's what I thought a number of times I think it was\nMade them up seven days yeah yeah I'm twenty forty times you could switch on and so you know this weekend I Want to drive a\nCPS mhm us than it make a CBS human need to call some different now right I I lost track of my cat like brand new somebody for yeah they've got some different other tourism but ah but Lincoln is saying that um\nThey sound revolutionary but they just haven't had as much interest as they thought they were ... so whether they didn't market quite in ... in general or the subscription sorry lurking fair question they got some neat looking cars 'cause everybody's been experimenting with this for the most part on the high end\nI write I write whatever I seen somebody come out and say hey for seven Ninety nine a month you can choose between a cruise and uh you know go down the line right but uh that'll be interesting to watch because I think that the vehicle manufactures there\nIs a group of their ownership somewhere that's got to be intrigued by the fact to say let's owned the car let's control the car right let's let's not get sued by a third party because they're they've got our car or it's our car and uh let's let's control of the stuff and\nI'm just going to really watch that real close because when you when you inject tell them addicts and in order ... ship experience which is basically a long term rental like rice said\nIt'll be interesting to see how the market adapts because there are a number of people that they've gotten so used to doing a lease that they are OK with never really owning their car mhm to them it's just part of their expenses of their life\nOr will they take it a step further and say you know what I'll do\nA lease like this or a or a\nSubscription you know and I and I get to switch cars they were going to try and raise the honey if I remember correctly I mean it was it was I Want to stay within the Fifteen hundred dollar range and the Cadillac deal per month and Porsche was doing it too they weren't like three or four majors that were that this is something to watch I I just think you're going to see a lot of conflicting opinions\nAnd it's all going to be on the probably the wherewithal to the that the management or leadership has to stick with it\nTo see if we can get to where it needs to get and what will the next generations of buyers will this be okay with it or they used to paying\nX amount of dollars for their cell phone and Hoover a lot of other services that they have in their life will they put their vehicle on that same list\nAnd the higher levels I remember they even had like a service like concierge service where you could say I want to switch today and when you went out from work the right car would be parked in your in your spot\nThat that was what I Would need I think to make that way because I Would I Would go oh I can switch anytime and I don't want to drive all the way over there to switch\nAnd they just said that they are in in California where they did their pilot they had little demand a mini that signed up canceled after one or two months and they have no plans to discontinue the programs says but they're gonna have to alter a little bit mhm uh they'd been surprised how few people are jealous\nShip Robert Parker Lincoln's director of marketing sales and service told automotive news in Lincoln ... if you'd asked me a year ago I would've said this is the next big thing a lot of people are struggling and make the math work\n[noise] it seems like for a while they're in it and maybe it's just in my selective memory of of a whole condensing a whole year into a smaller amount of time or something but\nThere was a while they were we were talking every week about subscriptions or this company is a driverless car this company's electric there doesn't seem to be that\nIs it because those are just started now and we're seeing what happens it just seems like that stuff is all driverless stuff or did my Facebook algorithm change what knowing that I had this\nI saw a drastic drop in the autonomous a ... type stuff which a lot of the electorate were autonomous stuff that we're kind of one hand and hand we saw big drop when the when the deaths occurred\nRemember the life cycle and the other part of it I just I I think a little bit I think a lot of it has to do with the political climate that's there's all kind of partner together all about the science into when\nHe was a political climate and and that just in general the narrative ... a few years ago was yeah I mean there's ... there's more of a push to say you know what let's get these auto manufactures a chance to develop something with the internal combustion engine let's you know let's look at the raw material differently and that in the news\nThe news changes so fast and we've got so much other garbage to be news stuff right now\nThere's you know that I mean just who cares about Tara do I want to do a story on autonomous cars we don't have time we're just doing breaking news this half hour yeah we're going to break new feeling alive but if you're good at eight six six five nine for for one five oh that's a number you can call twenty four hours a day\nI this is Joe and I listen in Redmond, Oregon\nI've got a two thousand three Ford have three fifty six liter power grows\nWhen I'm gone over forty five miles an hour and I'm just quoting the throttle at a certain position [noise] just the whole the laws just kinda falls on its face but as soon as I put my foot on it [noise]\nFix right off round real good [noise] wondering if you had any ideas on that\nIt could be a or there's tons of things that can do it but it it sounds like you may be one of the first places we'd start looking at her shop would be at the fuel system in that\nBecause if you've got a an issue where it can't provide proper fuel delivery whether it's the actual few flow or a problem with the fuel control like an injector or a masterful cents or something like that it can give you that lug at a real light\nThrottle but then when you hammer down on it it dumps it in and so it goes\nAnd feel flu is an important issue on any diesel and for a lot of folks that go into performance diesel that's one of the things they have to modify\nIs the fuel flowed they'll add a fuel proper raider or different things the fuel system to make sure that they always have\nA solid consistent non ... flow of fuel\nComing into the system and ah sometimes even a a crack in in a fuel filter housing or a can cause problems like this and it's a base issue that can have a result that might turn on some sort of a trouble later things like that but it's it's\nMore in the uh [noise] I guess the the the the general running of the engine and when it gets underneath that extra pressure and needs to push that air through and bring into fuel you start reaching the end of that are real quick and you need to make sure that fuel flows is proper that's that's where I Would start\nBut it might be worth of of Seventy five dollar flyer to see if it you know if you could buy if you could find a cover and buy it and just confirmed has that so annoyed on it at all\nParts are still on it that you might find a good one because it was just the electronic but it just happened to be a high failure rate item the coil fails inside\nBut you can go to Kurdish part try look it up a carburetor\nAnd believe it or not they still apart number for it and there is a hundred eighty five million pieces on there I'm going to guess that there might be someone out there that still has a carburetor or you might be able to look up maybe a an engine and see if somebody has an engine from that make model on the shelf and then call up and see if you could talk about buying the carburetor off of it\nThere surely not going to sell you the so annoyed for little or nothing unless you were willing to pay them yeah a a decent price to take that one part off\nBut that would be an idea because there's still a lot of these\nCars running around in the non rust belt areas of our country that are on the road in working shrines with these parts and they they it's it's kind of amazing when you look around you'll see Honda's from the seventies and stuff if the body didn't rushed out in the engine kept going they just have yup go have you tried ...\nYes I Am I okay I ... and I tried ... my local auto parts stores and all that kind of thing that I haven't had any luck in all I have thought about retrofitting whether that'll rock carburetor but the trouble there then I got to change my ah\nThat's the thing that I haven't had any luck in all I have thought about retrofitting it with a metal rock Harvard or but the trouble there then I got to change my a cake manifold who 'cause it's just the two barrel car\nRight and they do at a ... makes them two barrels but that that set up would be different\nSteven thanks very much for the call eight six six five now and for for one five oh when I talked to Dave in a second but let's give away a hoodie right now that we give away on

vehicle like this I Do the same thing we did back when we used to do a lot of stereo equipment accessories and stuff and cars\nI Would have not just the one battery but I'd have to batteries in that vehicle and I would use the gel a GM batteries in that since you've got a truck he's got more places to put it you can put the one battery under the hood and then you can have a battery\nIn the back of the vehicle as well and if you wanted to get real\nFancy with it you could contact a company that does a\nAfter market stereos and remote car stars and stuff and I have seen and I've done myself systems where you'll have the one battery in the front you have another battery like let's say you amount of the bed and you put a battery ice later in it and when it's isolated when the keys off it's drawing no power from that second battery\nAll the excesses are drawn off the one battery but then when you crank it you're\nBattery can go just to the starter so that you how you have your cranking

I point this out is that one of the theories is that the government said well you must denied this you have no choice this is classified information\nAnd you have to just say no you have to just lie\nNow these are these are very detailed lives from both apple and Amazon they go on and on and on never wrote Richard Reid and no no no\nI'm\nBecause but this is ... but this in here in this part I don't because elemental appliances are not designed to be exposed to the public Internet our customers are protected against this roller Billy by default is actually true\n\nAll right I'm going to stop on this one but it but it's it's uh you you chew on that Alex and see is there any way that that I guess it depends on the east coast but we put hours on the public Internet I hate to say we don't control it on the public Internet we have a private dashboard to it but that doesn't mean a chip the whole point\nBeing that if you put a chip on the mother board in here that then\nWent out on the public Internet and connected\nWith Chinese servers to download software modify the operating system that could absolutely happiness connected\nApple says we have never found malicious chips hardware manipulations vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server upper apple never had any contact with the FBI or any agency about such an incident we are not aware of any investigation by the FBI nor are contacts and law enforcement\n[noise] that's pretty complete denial [noise]\nSo how did what happened Bloomberg really get it wrong eighty eight eighty eight as clear as a mystery it's um I like mysteries that particularly about\nGetting hacked by the Chinese but [laughter] like mysteries Kim Schaeffer hello morning I'm just\nOne of the war and you you might have one of those super micro mother boards or somewhere in there because I think we purchased a few of them are time I want to find one that's not in service so we can look to take it apart just keep your eye peel around I guess we could take ourselves off line\nFor a little bit and be pretty hard here\n[laughter] when we wouldn't be unhappy [laughter]\nPlus I don't know who knows I don't know [noise] so so so you know start with your favorite favorite topics sure book\nSigning hiring in California and he has to be locked out of his and it's a wanting his two factor authentication and that he's saying he never turn that on a I don't know why he's locked out okay I'll tell them all\nRight thank you Kim Schaffer hello Tom ... to talk to you welcome\nTo talk to you listen to you every weekend and had an easy call until now\nWhile I'm Glad you called [laughter] so one week ago last friday\nYeah they got a\nWhile they admitted to having been hacked\nBy or somebody who figured out a clever way to steal people's accounts and that they stole their accounts by ... by basically stealing this little cookie this token that Facebook's you know when you log in Facebook you only have to log in for once and then it stays logged in\nFor the way that works is when you log into Facebook its stores this little piece of information your hard drive that's unique to you that says yeah\nThat's tough let's go Tom from cars to California letter man than this hack or allow bad guys to grab that little\nPiece of information and use it for themselves so what Facebook did when they found is is it the activated Ninety million users a week ago friday now is that about when you start were unable to log in\n... in actually it's my wife's account I can still log into my phone so she was one of the Ninety million you weren't yeah yeah yeah 'cause I was very judicious about every thing well I didn't\nHave anything to do with how do you do\nYeah like this is you could be perfectly good\nAnd still ah have your Facebook account stone and this and we believe that uh actually one of my producers had as a cow stolen or some months ago and now we believe that's how it happened so ah the way Facebook fixes it is by the activating that cookie and by the way that would also\nLog you out of anything you used Facebook to log into you know you can use face re log into a lot of other stuff so she probably noticed that as well [noise]\nWell yeah like me I'm each each think like Instagram and that sort of thing you know each one we don't log in from Facebook what do you use individual long\nThat's smart yeah turns out that was due are good that was a very smart thing to do because if they got that token and you could use that token the log into other sites fray they'd be able to log in to you now\nThey do you have to re log in and now you're they're saying hey we we what your second factor normally what that would be is a text message sent to your cell phone right or another Facebook instance that you could use the code from because there's a code generator into Facebook app\nFlight we we've been down that path um [noise] of course we can't get into her account she only logs in the face but for one thing yeah\nBut you know the truth is even if you have on the phone and it would have been logged out too so write write code generate isn't gonna help you\nKnow and I tried for mining generated a code but you know it's different yeah that's all I knew that but I Try it yeah\nNo of course you you we must use every outlet so does it at some point in their say well I don't have access I Know it does can't do it that way what else can you do and then at some point and say well we have a phone number on record for you or does it not\nWell she didn't need it at night but needless to say I ever gone in and put one in mind just\nLike any other way yeah by the way we've also learning the Facebook once you put that phone number in their uses it to sell ads against just so\nThank you Facebook what a nightmare Facebook has turned out to be yes but you have to use the word black males into this so it sounds to me like she's going to have to contact Facebook can extend say look I Can't and a number of\nPeople had to do this and it's [noise] they'll make you jump through hoops with Facebook and the only one [noise]\nFix this man\nGot work instance here I mean literally and we're going to
