Clint Clint you're on the end of the ... what can we do for ya\nI got a two thousand a Cadillac escalated what the six to all wheel drive whenever I turn or slow down and let off or a lot of drought on celery it again in ... and the only place I can find play isn't a transfer case\nAnd I was curious or how much play uh there should be is any sense it's all wheel drive and if just putting a new chain and what six it\nIt ... it might or you know there\nThere's going to be some play in there because that are just it has to split the torque between the front in the rear as needed while you're driving without binding and causing the vehicle to jump as you're turning a lot of them will jump when they're turning as the clutches failing them\nA lot of them will have that ... could come from the chain or the rear end or the front end of the vehicle the differential and the joints in between in the Bush ... in between also you know yeah um\nYou know without actually working on it physically it's hard to say I mean we we know by looking at it how much is too much and how much is\nI'm just right or or good as far as the number I'm sure there is a a number out there we just do for him it's kind of one of those things from experience over the years that we can just look at it and say okay it's about this much but\nUsually you can tell if you can turn one of those dry chefs and it turns you could feel it not doing anything at all for\nA quarter turn before it starts to have some kind of resistance you can feel where there'll be a resistance with with both ends of the transfer case\nAttach like they're supposed to inside you can move it you know kind of feel a little drag when there's like a slop like there's there's just nothing they're connected um you can tell it's kind of almost like when you turn it into\nThe hands on a clock to seven o'clock you can feel that there's some resistance going on in there as a posed to spin in a a a wheel on a skateboard you know there's ones got some kind of connection to something one doesn't [noise] it's just kind of an artist we learn\nSome great one I'd that makes sense that makes perfect sense if you get into ... left or right or slow speeds when you're turning\nIt doesn't matter what ... turn I guess it's just whenever a lead off and then I hit the gas again and I can I can feel a lot of play just having it up on my or it's like there I can probably move in a court churn\nJust in the front of ... author\nOr if I Move the front or drive shaft and then ah just watched the backpack and probably move it and they used to it\nOr return and that's a lot about in the back you can move with a whole quarter of a turn before\nSomething else moves that's usually it sounds like quite a bit and it could be more than a chain I mean you could have some ... or lines wearing and they're what a hundred miles around a\nHundred and twenty\nOne that's not how ... how did you say I was expecting you say like one eighty or two hundred with what you're describing it really was that uh but that is the better your I think you're looking at\nThe transfer case yet and inspected the fluid\nI\nI just called the check book and it's got good color and stop sparkly but didn't know if I should\nI have a new train for sitting in my shop ... waste my time and put it in or if I got other issues inside there and they do a full rebuild\nWell I Would pull the drain plug out and drain it all out into a container that you can see very well maybe something glass some things see really well some clean while at the fluid is great you can always put back in\nBut if the you know independence some of the flu is really expensive so you want to you know to save it but if you see things that'll give you an opportunity to see what's going on and there's many times where we dream fluid and put it back in if we have a question about a case\nUm sometimes we can check them on the top ... check on the other day and it was good when we checked the top plug went well it's not too bad smells good we pulled the bottom plug in once it all came out there was a lot of\n... is there something in that transportation for us that you know of and I'm just thinking about this that\nThe clutch pack for the for the all wheel drive can that create that same sort of a field versus the chain if it's worn out yeah because there's a viscous clutch in the middle on that all wheel drive system to send an oil bath that when it senses slippage has you know gets all the heat too and then it binds up again in ... and she ...\nWell before it to see what he's describing yeah he's got he's waited on ... between the two ends of the trade I slap and now if he turn that it felt like it was the same resistance all the way around it's turning the chain which is turning the clutches but if it's going ... clunk clunk it's the chain is just sloppy it what it sounds\nYeah it does Clinton thanks very much for the call good luck [laughter] sounds like a little more excited yeah it's good to talk through it and they're not even thinking I was thinking about a little bit but stuck to Dan Dan you're on the end of the show what can we do for you\nOh I got a question about a couple of old cars that I got a not terribly old but anyway I I I've got a fifty nine four and six to nine Oldsmobile and I'm looking for one of these\n[noise] carburetor replacement fuel injection a like a fast or a ... sniper or whatever it is\nMy six year old has or returning line already um\nFor the uh high pressure set up you know it has to have returned my and I guess right and a salad and all that so I'm kinda thinking that I'm probably going to put it on the sixty nine Oldsmobile or fifty five and uh but my question when it gets is are you guys from you if she's\nA set up so you you would you recommend or maybe didn't care to do that on the air and I\nDon't know ... Harley or the or the fast or whatever\nWell whoever's you use 'em there's there are a lot of really good ones out there and we're familiar with a majority of them from ... to ... to ... a lot of there's a lot of different ones and they have different features and options different tuning you can do with them\nDifferent controllers the way they're set up\nYou know some some will\nUm come as a basic unit that just feeds fuel in whatever rate you tell it to the better ones which are most of the ones who described are all going to come with an oxygen censor or to one for each bank that's the one you really want to look for is one that has an oxygen censor the going each exhaust pipe\nAnd a twenty four Camry that story problems we accelerate\nStalling problems when you accelerate that seems fad yeah I'm\nA lot of cars will develop but certain things that are inherent to them so when we see one that does this and one that does that if we know the model like that it leads us directions\nStalling when taking off in this model car there's been some issues with 'em as they age a little bit with if they're over sixty thousand miles we've seen some coil packs fell on so when you accelerate you get a flashing check engine like you get up to ... you know a ... as you accelerate\nAnd uh that is one of the things that can happen those quote pack so we went from\nSpark plug wires years ago to these in a separate coil to one ... per cylinder\nSo that they can supply more power to the spark plug for a cleaner burn as you can just stay recharge faster because one will spark\nAnd then uh as the other four or other three go than that one has time to fully recharge we're talking about thousands a lot easier for six people to do a tug of war than one yeah exactly and what the old one you had one coiled trying to hit every cylinders that went around so it would\nIt would not go with that is something to check first they need to check the state of to you need to have a mechanical that and see what the state of tuna that engineers do we have failing coils or do we have worn a spark plugs\nThen you get into more more technical things or whether or not when you smash and the throttle is it is it reading that correctly is there a problem with a\nFellow positioning censor I mean those are things that are gonna be a little more finite in their diagnosis put all those things really if if you're not getting a check in July you kind of got to fall back to that based system based fuel faces\nBut in a light on it something in that delivery system of either fuel or electrical and that's what you get into some other stuff uh that Russia is talking about\nEight six six five nine for for one final what's caught your attention and the automotive\nWorld well Toyota's is issued a recall is better if you've got an Eighteen or Nineteen tundra which is pretty new and yeah at this release we've been having some\nAirbag things going on and\nWhat's happening is is the car when you start to the truck when you start 'em up it's not reading all the sensors correctly and causing this thing to be the fault mode so you're airbags may not deploying a collision so if you've purchased and Eighteen Nineteen tundra and you don't know about it yet I don't know about this recall get\nGet get the facts\nContact your your deal your local dealer give them your vehicle identification number if you bought it from them they're going to have your name and the number on filed is telling her name there'll be a look it up for you\nAnd see if it's gotten the open recalls on him when cars coming our shop it tells us when there's an open recall and the majority of cars and we print it out and handed the customer and say look this means it's free it's a recall safety related\nTake this and get this performers it'll tell us parts available or were aware of the recall no parts available\nYou need to get that done because it's a it's definitely a safety things you don't want to hear back not worthy\nHeavily all become desensitized to airbag recalls I mean I think that we had our house because when we bring them up we will you will catch are still saying oh this one is not to Canada right this is not a regular airbag recall yeah\nUm [noise] you you got it and you need to monitor some things yourself to for instance you got I've got a car that if somebody sitting in the passenger seat about half the time they're sitting there it says passenger airbag on or not\nA lot of times it says off and there's somebody sitting in it and if you turn the car off and they get back in at the light comes on but it doesn't do it consistently enough to catch it and it has to be the right weight person and all that\nThose are things that are important too because while the stock in a set your warning light on the dash it's something you need to be aware of what I start my car does airbag like come on and blink a few times and then go off or when I started to car does that light never come on if you purchase a used car and you started up and you never see that everybody like come on you need to get in you\nNeed to have its eggs those systems do a self test when they start there may have been disabled by some butter talking out the modules saying\nCheck this check that out everything looks good full report tonight software to go and theoretically those lights that light up when it starts there I'm supposed to pay attention to those right there check like\nTell you and we see cars that come into our auto recycling facility and sometimes we look and go wow that was that was awesome wreck I Hope nobody was killed in it when you look in the window but wait a second fire all the airbags not blown it is obviously\nLooked like it hit a ... you know when the engines pushed back into the use of the passenger and apartment in the bags didn't go off you say\nWhy and it starts us to thinking and sometimes you never know but other times it could have been a recall that wasn't done\nWe're going to take a quick break you're listening to the end of the show with the motor medics standard which can be heard each week on great stations across the

the zoom\nKind of blew me away and that's always been a kind of a drawback too smart phone cameras is you know unlike a fancy camera they really don't zoom very well they do something called digital zoom which means basically they're blowing the picture up so it gets all funny and we call it pixilated and it doesn't look good\nUh although I see people doing that all the time all the time I see people doing the pinch while they're taking a picture I think you're going to regret that [laughter]\nYou're not going to you're not going to like that picture except on the pixel a three at the uh it does very well you know other cameras like the iPhone or\nSolve this problem by putting more lenses on but the Google's just said no no we don't we don't want more lenses we just want to one lens and

are so nice to see you again Layla port the tech guy Sam in the advocating ville North Carolina hello Sam\nPaleo welcome how you doing All right it's not arrive the a storm and all that [noise] most of them Yes sir hand what a mess of damage but we wish Robyn Powell I'm Glad to hear [noise] so what can I Do for you\nGot two quick questions but one main reason I'm calling is my mother is not doing great and um she is a week I got sick she can't get around very much but I've got a light switch with\nThe shoe lights on I ... and I've got a light outside it's about thirty feet up in the air that my dad can say when he's outside perfect doesn't up there with her [noise] um well\nShe's still a couple of times and I was wanting to find out um I Know the new apple watch has the child and says actually yeah yeah well I was going to find out if they have something like that that I can get either ... or a necklace or something that would fall that would turn he lied on a start linking it\nFor that sounds like a really great idea and a Philips which makes the Hugh\nDoes have something called the Philips lifeline let me see if it I mean given it's the same company you'd think they'd work together it's called auto alert and I'm In that it has in it excel\nAround butters and barometric sensors in a finely tuned algorithm that's what they say finally joined algorithm to detect Ninety five percent of many types of falls and trigger fewer false alarms that's part of the problem\nSo ah it the idea is it called a response center let me see if it ties to the human rights because that would be so awesome and I don't know why wouldn't it's the same company but you know Philips has a kind of a big company\nAnd uh I don't see any they have a medical\nAlert system now that's the first place I'd I'd I'd start home safe on alert\nUm [noise] yeah it seems like this is this is this whole question really\nOf home automation and it has been a a very uh um the satisfying sector for the last two decades [noise] um\nThere is there's a motion sensor which I use but that's not going to that's not going to help you that that turns the lights and I want to go in the room which I Love I don't I you know I I Would say I would look into this Philips lifeline technology\nIt seems as if it ought to since it does\nDoes detect falls and it would be a great start to that the question is this automation peace and this is why it's been such a disappointment is you got things to do things lots of them\nBut they don't they don't even talk to each other very well and apple and Google have both\nYou know push this idea of a hub you know the new Google a device is called\nThe the Google Home hub apples that the er I ... you know the the a pod the home pod the whole idea\nIs these have radios in them to communicate with these devices\nThat I think about you know Google's stuff as you can do is you know an apple stuff you can do scenarios you can say goodnight you know apple and then every delightful locked doors locked lights will turn down or off and all this stuff but I don't know if they get tired of the\nFall sensors your best bet is to is to is to look at the Philips since it's the same company right they bring in the chat room ebony X\nLike this warning light for your dad that the bombs falling\nRight basically where the light turns red and you know to go in and we got neighbors and stuff so if she follows the light would start flashing and we know\nOh somebody over there but she has to push a button or say supply\nAnd I've I've got a ah she's got a Google Home um but if she follows and is not knocked unconscious\nYeah she can't say anything or yeah and that's the idea of this is this a few rather Philips thing um I I don't know I ... off the top of my head I don't know I'm looking at it it seems like that\nWould be a clear used for this that Philips ought to support since it's all the same company and they make this\nVery and by the way the the the huge stuff the rather the motion sensor stuff or for falling as is considered quite good you know I'm so that's nice but if it doesn't you know the Philips life what I Would go\nTo a lifeline to Philips dot com look at their medical board systems\nAnd and I I'm looking at but I don't see immediately where it would tied at a hue and that puzzles me it seems like it ought to and if it's gonna that's gonna be the most direct route\nUm you could if you got er an apple watch and turned on fall detection and no I don't\nHave a lot of experience with ... with how accurate it is and and and of course false positives oh you probably don't care about false positives that can come running in and it can be everything is fine and you can go back out [noise]\nUm so I think maybe looking at an apple watch cars that you can definitely do a script with I Would bet that would then change the lights and if this and that script again I'm not to do some investigation\nSince it's a really interesting question scooter X is going to put a link and it showed up to hack\nA day project yeah oh yeah fall detector wearable for elderly and clinics this goes to an art you we know\nNow this if you really handy you could you could program that's for sure\nTo turn on the human rights so in fact I even\nSee the the heck a day has kind of that you can [noise]\nSo there's one way to do it if you if you don't mind building your own kids\nEverybody wants to help give me a ringleader report the tech oh\nThank\nOptics move crazy amounts of data at even crazier speeds and fighters by rising as the one

we don't know yet that's one of the problems you you know very well I'm sure that retailers hate having multiple versions of the movie you say or something for sale oh well if you have\nAn IMAX enhance system you can buy this one and it'll give you that advantage or there are other advantages to the system to their they've they've done a\nIMAX sound immersive sound as twelve channels including for overhead and so their their format it in such a way with special based management that that sense the information to the sub woofer that need to why they're\nIn a special receiver and has ended ... at most of this is something else yes no I'm afraid so ...\n[laughter] or however your standard at most speaker configuration will work just fine [noise] ah they they recommend having a seven channel around one at least one sub woofer and four channels overhead to make this work ideally so if you have an ...\nSet up that it'll work just fine you don't have to change anything there one problem I see is that most many uh aficionados enthusiasts movie enthusiast have a to point three five screen which is the aspect\nRatio of most movies and so when when an IMAX enhanced movie goes to sixteen by nine the image on your two point three five screen will actually be smaller [laughter]\nSomebody asked about that at one of the press conferences a CD or and and the guy said well yeah but the majority of people have sixteen by nine screens well yeah that's true but if you're looking for the most immersive experience you can get a ... a well the most cinematic\nExperience you can get you're going to go with a wider screen and this IMAX won't work with that but if you have a sixteen by nine screen as you and I both do on old led TVs and so on\nThen when these special scenes come up in a movie they will expand out upward and downward to fill the entire screen and presumably become\nScenes come up in a movie they will expand out upward and downward to fill the entire screen and presumably become more immersive [noise]\nInteresting ... so it's an interesting I sound like a gimmick to be honest but okay well yeah okay uh basically it's kind of like THX certification the IMAX indeed yes they're going to certify products\nTo meet certain performance ... as well as be able to do this uh aspect ratio expansion so it you know we'll we'll see how well it works it\nWas intriguing it was intriguing to me yeah yeah\nWell there are always and I get you know it's funny because there's this combat between the theaters that want to get you out of your ... as a theater in the home theater people want to get you into your fancy home theater [laughter]\nRight that's right uh always always a a can\nCause never going to be anything as good as going or what IMAX theater the problem is most people don't have one near him\nYou know ... that's exactly right yeah yeah sadly so badly\nThose who do you know it doesn't have as good black levels as adobe cinema but has expanded a dynamic\nRange or a ... aspect ratio height quadrant is a is really very compelling All right\nScott Wilkinson he's our home theater ... joined us each week this time to talk about home theater
