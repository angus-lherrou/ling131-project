is that something where I Would bring it to my local shop and they would be able do would you be able to go out and find out what kind of pump it needs and all that\nWe are you will you first step is

to no no I Know and it's just ridiculous I feel you know and conspicuous consumption but I'm not doing it because I Want to I'm doing it to review them and I don't like to um you know a lot most reviewers will just take loner phones from the company you know get a two week loner and a\nCouple of things I don't like about that one when you do that you're not really getting the experience of spending your actual money for a phone so you miss out on the fun of spreading vows in dollars yeah [laughter] well but I think that these phones are so expensive now it's important to feel that pain\nDo you think there's going to be um this is a personal question but do you think there's going to be any Black Friday deals on iPhones\nNever oh darn it feels they give you are so pathetic and it's good to get a two dollar our music or\nWell when I bought this three years ago Costco was doing a a two hundred and fifty dollar ... um card and that was on Black Friday thought that took like

pretty good turn a lot of the yeah I um well I don't know so I shouldn't say no we'll find out if we're getting close\nOr the other thing I Would reason I buy these phones is because you can't and two weeks really get a sense of what it's like to to use the problem is now I don't really want to carry four phones with me so I'm trying to figure out some rotational message for phone numbers or if I Do\nBut the limit is five because I use Google Voice and you can have a one Google Voice number call five different phones [laughter] so that's kind of what I Do and that way you ought to be in here when somebody\nCalls me all our phones\nRing and they all have different descendent ring tone yeah where they have to otherwise Yeah John will call you right now let's let's just there's no I've got 'em all new to talk of the other downside when I get to work I got a lot of work to do to mute all these phones yeah\nIt's just they all really looked exactly the same they're all just ... black last slabs huh I kept always think\nMusic is when it's when it's easy with the I have ... yeah thank goodness the apple still have a physical ... which\nWhich is really the right way to do it anyway and that's about my phone situation we have real telephones people can call a da da da da da and\nI like his Andrea Virginia thinks that one of her friends got Facebook hacked or maybe so she's not really sure\nOh dear to do what precautions you need to know what everybody from just a leading it like you I guess yeah thank you Ken Hi Cheryl Alexandria, Virginia welcome we'll report the tech guy\nThinks a whole lot listening this morning\nI got a Facebook Messenger message from somebody that I knew casual late on Facebook friends\nWith them and this was a first Facebook Messenger that I had ever gotten from them and I expected it started a little bit of conversation on that thing got suspicious and sadly this couple had built their retirement home in a New Bern in North Carolina they got flooded\nSo badly and or ... you know somebody trying to take advantage of that with money but\nWas it was it Facebook was hot\nShe has a very common name did somebody just K courting aiming agent can account and has has my phone learn about half catch my Facebook account like clean up their certainly had a sheet clean it up\nSo many questions so and I don't blame you for wearing these days we all know that Facebook uh was in fact vulnerable at least thirty million people got their Facebook account ... so\nThe there are a couple of ways people do this particular kind of thing you're the first one of the easiest one for them is to impersonate somebody and and that pace but makes it fairly easy I've had happened to me at least several times because if you have a Facebook page they can take\nYou know anything that's public and for most people that a lot the images the ban or your you know personal information\nAnd create a new account with a slight difference they can't use the exact same account name [noise] but they but since a lot of people don't assign a name to a Facebook account is pretty easy to do this so 'cause they can make it the same name you know the public name is just the the the Web pages has to be different you know the\nThe official link has to be different so if your name is Emily gene Johnson\nA ... there are maybe ten as you know there may be ten thousand Facebook pages for an Emily gee Johnson and and if it has the same pictures St profile picture it's almost impossible distinguish it so that's the most likely scenario\nUm the second most likely scenario is that they got hacked and as I said Facebook announced thirty million people were hacked due to a flawed Facebook\nThey reset all those accounts so even though they had been hacked unless somebody use that opportunity to take the account over uh it's it's you know not and it's hard to get your ... although\nYou know if you use a password like monkey one two three and easily guests password um that's also possible\nSo it might not be a bad idea to to contact or that person out of the band you know on a phone call her a message or email message and say hey just question do you know was this huge we have a conversation\nSounds like you know that it isn't so that's that's a case where you might say it's happened heck now have you been hacked unless you click the Lincoln downloaded something or or take into a\nKind of fraudulent page no just getting a message is harmless but to be careful about links in these messages because they can link [noise] you know the bad guy wants to run a program on\nYour system so they can link to\nMilitias pages are malicious programs and have you know we'll report\nThe\nOptics move crazy amounts of data at even crazier speeds and

in the state semi final Shiloh came in here and around new Salem thirty five to thirty [noise]\nYou'd have to say new Salem got some revenge a couple of weeks back in the last game of the regular season they really put it on Shiloh um they scored every time they have the ball and and want to fifty to twenty two silos just not used to having a team run over and I'm like that\nOh they're definitely not but um I Would imagine that the answer back the next two weeks you know going over North Star then going over mall I've actually come back here they're ready to go another way to get the the sound of game\nShadow comes in at nine and one is Josh mentioned the victory over mould all last week forty four to fourteen that was awfully impressed\nSome are definitely was after that or earlier in the season where they barely pulled off of one thirty six thirty four and then come back and really\nTeam that was awfully impressed them\nAre definitely was after that or early or mid season where they barely pulled out the wind thirty six thirty four\nAnd then come back and really look up and down a mohawk forty four to fourteen I was a big game profile at a lot of good a good shows there with a big touchdown run for kick off by a ... so a lot of good things we saw in that game and we're hoping childcare that over to this game and it really brings nurse to her Michelle\nMeanwhile the whole scenes of just had a dream season they are ranked number two in the state they come in at nine o and they defeated the surgery last week and they are playoff opener sixty three to six\nThis almost mind boggling new sailing average is fifty seven points a game and they allow giving up twelve it's almost like a video game with them\nOh yeah definitely that they they got this guy down the good team a lot of weapons to go to good outcomes aligned start that the whole package and another one of the better team in this region number two in the rankings maybe not by Thompson so but definitely team there to be good shows that come out of the outcome of the game and they got to hope for a little bit of luck their side\nHere's how the state quarterfinals look today in the west region where this game and the other Wes game will be St John visiting rain powers late\nNow or Shiloh where to advance they would go on the road to play the winner of that game if new Salem is the winter the whole teams would stay right here at new Salem\nAnd play the semi final game next week in the eastern bracket [noise]\nGood match up oaks will visit in the polling and then we have a top ranked Thompson\nAt home against the former champion Rockford shy and\nYou hit this close to a state championship Josh you went through this in your senior year two thousand Thirteen what's it like as you're getting closer to the Dakota bowl and knowing one last could end it but if you keep winning you got a chance to go all the way\nTo get more hungry you get more driven you may want to work harder push it a given that they're even more funny more that you didn't have an each game and she's pushing a strong getting better getting faster and you know it's a good feeling\nStuck to look at today's coaches for non Barker for Shiloh Christian school and his ninth season because overall record Seventy nine and twenty five consecutive trips to the states semi finals but that's on the line today\nOh yeah definitely there's this is a team that can easily knocked off that by the thought that long running tradition again to the semifinals fires in the mail and it's going to be a good game for shallow they're gonna have to really come out bringing a bring everything they've got and\nRunning things for new Salem out on going on a steep climb for twenty five years at new Salem twenty two years as a whole teams head coach his record one Twenty one in eighty two he led the ... to the Dakota bowl just two years ago they came up short\nAgainst Thompson so another great coach that Barker gets to play chess with today right Josh\nHow they definitely do they're going to be balanced out here today and I noticed is able to and they got a great group of guys here this is a team that could take it all the way and when the Dakota last year and they know that they don't want to miss an opportunity so I've had and they're going to be coming out coach it'd be doing everything they can

definitely is more than half of the job is one of those guys to ... minutes has graduate he'll be looking to fill the time fulltime is definitely good quarterback in now with him he's great quarterback he's doing the job very well\nWell you mentioned gene Mitt so he does have eleven hundred yards passing sixteenth touchdowns against one interception but what a team guy more than willingly to go up on the line or he's not a great job blocking he's caught some passes they occasionally put him back in a quarterback to throw it kinda does a little bit of everything right now\nOh he definitely does is one of those guys he's an athlete is Becky strongest fast\nYou got good arm you can put them anywhere and he's got the mentality of a team player he wants to when he wants to do it takes to win and that means going to play tightened it will play dead end but I imagine we'll see him bumped around tonight I Would expect against is a good sales team he's the one of those guys

outbreak you big runs getting the end zone you definitely keep ... both on opposite on defense coal\nWalls in eighty one yard kickoff return for touched down last week averaging thirty four yards a kick were turned Nineteen yard to return is going to be interesting to see if new Salem even kicks them today\nI don't imagine that well and I imagine there'll be just fine for shallow they're going to have not kicking him or guarantee shall some good feel position which hey that's a that's a willing to give a little better feel position then not risk ... better field additional help now they're often spoken about well\nAll right let's take a look at someone new Salem is players to watch possibly the best quarterback in the state senior editor hanky the big two hundred and forty pound and for the whole stains he's thrown for nearly Thirteen hundred yards\nAnd he has thirty five\nCombined touchdowns running and passing nobody better now\nOh definitely not I mean these guys to me is a big guy is really humble a a good armor quarterbacks bills run the ball well Charles got to condemn these number priority number one you got to contain him on a passing out in the running and taking ...
