Daniel I just wanted to say that of course it's possible for a crazy person to support Trump if you if not we're not\nWhat it said that of course it's possible for a crazy person to support Trump to if not we're not responsible for each individual because anyone who attacks can't hurt or killed people something wrong with that and the problem is that democratic leadership\nIs calling for filing\nAnd for a correction I'm Democrats are responding\nTo that will let their responsible for\nWhat you know there and and look I Would agree with you wholeheartedly and we've got James Hodgkinson the Bernie supporter and the news media to could care less about him where the\nThe the uh a white powder envelope sent to administration officials last year we had them sent a Eric Trump's house to

to the White House news media didn't really cover that certainly not this level of hysteria\nThe guy was arrested they didn't cover it that enough helicopter shots the guy was charged in court day before yesterday they didn't cover it\nBecause they don't consider those to be a terrorist attacks of course that and they and I I Know what they'll the response is Danielle their response is that Trump caused this by his rhetoric\nBut Democrats didn't cause that by their rhetoric\nYes but they're that way ... oh\nHere we had to make that state that they're fake\nWell but they they'll run the video on a loop of President Trump over the course of the last two years saying I'm a you know I I Want to punch him in the head you know you go and get them out her I'll pay your legal bills that's all there and they say sees encouraging violence and they latch onto those few soundbites from the last couple of years\nNow we've got Eric Holder about a week ago saying when they go low we can't come and Hillary saying there will be no civility this is just in the last weeks and the last couple of months at most\nAnd all that time of course Brock Obama going back years getting their face and that that the ... and here's the thing we don't have mobs smashing windows and burning cars and beating people with sticks we\nWe don't have that there was the Charlottesville thing that they loved to latch onto that crowd was full of left wing or as with a mask sever their faces in clubs in their hands when that lunatic crashed his car into the crowd within two seconds there were four left these bashing out his windows with clubs within two seconds\nAnd the news media always studious Lee edits just before that point now but I I I don't know about false flag I don't I don't ah I I'm an evidence person and I don't pre suppose anything I've been saying all along\nThat it's about a fifty fifty split on whether it's a righty or left to either way it's not I want them caught either way and if it's a righty then the news media is going to go crazy for days and weeks and they're going to\nCover the trial like it's the you know ... and\nAnd if it's a lefty now they're going to say oh well thank God it was just a false alarm and nothing actually happened here because that's how they work\nHe'll get the emotionally to if he's elected\nThat's well and that's the standard thing every time where you've got to jihadi they say well he's got and this guy's clearly I just buy the bumper stickers are those stickers all over his van\nHe's or not I mean I I I don't care which side
