autism that he was on the spectrum of autism and therefore it's okay that I tried to shoot Trump it really was no big deal they downplayed that story they downplay the story of states police being shot of a Bernie Sanders volunteer doing it\nThe fact that he met in the office with Bernie Sanders people it's worked on the campaign that he was a Rachel Maddow fanatic that he was the Southern
