most Communist Party supporting\nCIA director is an amazing\nAnd by the way the real CIA director received one of these packets with white powder earlier this month but the news media doesn't care about that\nDonald Trump too often has helped to incite a some of these feelings of anger and violence when he points to acts of violence or also talked about [noise] you know a swinging if somebody uh some of the press and the media\nAren't you the guy that um that has accused President Trump of treason and uh see all this crazy stuff you know I this this guy Brennan has been out there oh it's trees that have said you wanted to dance on the head of opinion about the difference between the word treason and trees and uh she's a nuts\nThat I said it was nothing short of treasonous [noise]\nI didn't mean that he committed treason admitted he committed inter I'm literally there's nothing short of treasonous he didn't mean that he committed treason ... there's nothing short of trees and that was the term that he is yeah\nIf we if we diagram a sentence nothing started changing that means that street in words\nWords have meetings and this is the Brennan who's out there saying he's guilty of
