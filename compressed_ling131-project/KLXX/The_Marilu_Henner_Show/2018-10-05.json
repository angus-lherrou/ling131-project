that would put them at fifty and then if\nFor some reason Lisa Murkowski the wishy washy Republican from Alaska who's being pressured by ...\nOr if she votes no then they still have fifty votes theoretically and um then the vice president Mike Pence can come in and bring up the fifty one and when the day\nIt's also possible that the Democrat from West Virginia Joe mansion who is not
