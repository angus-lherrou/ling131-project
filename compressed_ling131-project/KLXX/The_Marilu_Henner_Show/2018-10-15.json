Sunday the FBI and Justice Department had information that contradicts its own intelligence on Papadopoulos\nThe congressman said hypothetically if the department of justice and the FBI have another piece of evidence that directly refused that that directly contradicts that what you would expect is for the department of justice to present both sides of the coin\nTo the foreign intelligence surveillance court to evaluate the weight and sufficiency of that evidence Ratcliffe said\nAnd said what happened here was department of justice and FBI officials in the Obama administration in October of two thousand sixteen only presented the court the evidence that made the government's case to get a warrant to spy on Trump campaign associates\nSo once again excluding evidence corrupt

and for some reason you guys can't wrap your little tiny squarely brains\nAround the fact that the Russians aren't the only ones that messed with people all the comedies do all the left these do it's what the left these do hear 'em and here's President Trump throwing in her face a bit on the Russia thing\nPeriod I think I'd call Russia to help me with an election give me a break\nThey wouldn't be

them I'm ... now he's attacked for the child this is just wonderful this is great listen to this this clip\nA Leslie still but you separate children at the border\nFrom their parents like Obama did the same thing with the laws on the books the Democrats just don't want to enforce laws that the Democrats so uninformed they don't care what the law is they don't care whether it's the law that that
