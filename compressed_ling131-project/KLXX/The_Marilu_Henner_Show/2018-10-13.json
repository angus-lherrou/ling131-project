that October's fall car care month visit car care dot org learn how you can keep your vehicle safe dependable and on the road longer\nLet's talk to Steve Steve you're on the end of the show what can we do for ya\nA high a I've got an old nine Chevy work truck with a four point three basic fit it in every once in a while while I'm driving\nThe a temperature gauge goes to zero the indicator on a dare says the engine as hot and the atheist off a and I hear the AC fans come on\nAnd it'll run like that until the next time I shut it off and turn it on a gas and then temperature gauge works fine I've also had a scanner that I put on to read the temperature when that occurs and the temperature is normal\nWith the scanner reading and but I get zero reading on the actual gauge inside track\nAll right well we've had a few we've had a few of those that have had problems with that with two things we've had the um\nInstrument clusters fail in there so they're not getting the they're not deciphering the data from the\nEngine computer correctly it ... it reads that you're reading a scandal and you can see what it says whatever it says on that scandal was what should be transferred to that gauge we used to have separate sensors one for the gauge and one for the engine temp but now we just read one engine cool in Tempe censor\nPull that into the computer than the computer through the data bus like cable TV sends it out and it it reads it and\nI Would go to the instrument cluster data your stand to read that and see what it says because of your engine computer says we're at two hundred degrees that instrument cluster data should say two hundred degrees therefore if you're\nAs clusters is two hundred and fifty degrees and shut down engine hot reduce power a sea off and your engine computer says normal they've got something going on and that is from a cluster that's causing that to to do that and it's\nHundred percent get okay Fifteen little more\nWell Congress and the ... and all those guys at all or ... or it's going to evaporate faster so it's you know problem in the summer because we don't want it polluting the air\nLet's hold on let's not use that voice you know if we're going to try to hold off right we've got to be nonpolitical well the powers that be have determined that the hope still up there huh so it was determined that yes it evaporated a warmer it is the faster it evaporates so winter months where what you had\nHere's the here's the issue though\nAnd see if see if you guys are all in our radio lander are with me on this\nAll the science use the say safe for use in two thousand and one model vehicles in up that's the way it's being promoted so if used correctly it's going into your two thousand and one a vehicle or if they're worried about evaporation\nAll vehicles made two thousand and one up and quite a few of them that go over the net or one hundred percent sealed fuel systems there is no evaporation it's called an evaporative admission system which we talk about on this radio show all the time\n'cause they'll gets problematic from the time they don't want the gasoline evaporating in his ear because you will if your cars parked without a gas cap for a long enough period you're going to lose that which pollutes the air but also costs you money in your wallet red take a long time but still you leave a Gaskins sitting there were no cab it's gonna evaporate so they keep it in a sealed containers\nThey seal all this stuff up\nSo it's not a problem so\nNow with that said and so you kind of know how that works going to it year round\nI mean there's all sorts of stuff you can you worry yourself about how it affects the economy and stuff but as far as your car goes 'cause there's a lot of motor so\nIt's not unheard of thing it's not going to change anything for you as far as you know when you put it in your been put in ten and there for years and I got I'm going to crack another secret which I've been doing for a long time and some people still look at me and my shop like what when they asked\nIf you're ... eighty eight on it it's the Fifteen\nThat was the like the coach secret code word for the fifteenth so you may have been put that in your vehicle this whole time I talked to a gentleman earlier this week had no idea that he had been putting the Fifteen and his vehicle the whole time and he was and then when he checked he goes oh my gosh I really was I didn't know that didn't change a thing\nSo it is going to change and don't I wouldn't be surprised if in the next twenty Thirty years we see even more things with fuel\nSame cars were making in America are being sold in Brazil or where they have a mandate I Believe it's twenty seven or twenty nine percent in all the ...\nUh where they have a mandate I Believe it's twenty seven or twenty nine percent in all the fuel now and everything and most of their stuff is even higher than that but they've been doing it for a long time because there\nAnd then I don't think about foreign countries much but they got a lot of corn and stuff so they're ... that's where that comes from\nReally as consumers and there's an automotive show we want to know the consumer part we want to know was something hurt my car and how much is going to cost me and how much is it going to save me and as an automotive show we want your car to run good and we want you to save money\nAnd we want you to understand so don't worry frankly\nDon't worry and if you do if you get on the Internet and you're looking to find out the truth about whether it's an all or something else don't go to um one side of the coin you know the other which would be the ethanol industry or gasoline industry the oil companies\nGo to independent studies a lot of colleges have done lots of independent studies on everything from water to toothpaste to gasoline and that's and all\nThose studies are typically going to give you real facts to let you make decisions because you're smarter than those people that are trying to tell you what's there but\nI don't think it's going to be a I don't think anybody's going to see in in ten years from now people are gonna go what what has always used them\n[noise] eight six six five nine for for one five ... puts Dr Steve Steve you're on the end of the show what can we do for you\nYeah I ... say ... or ... thousand on on a access for the one for six leader for selling earn it in a fight speed and it has been getting me starting problems I can drive at some where\nOr I can go into a store or something will come back out and it'll turn over like crazy but it will fire 'em I wait maybe another hour come back in and start straight up no problem whatsoever\nI'm I have replaced the ... position censor the camp they censor the coil packs a plug wires and it still does it kind of wondering if you give me an idea what to try that why\nDid you replace the items that you did\nAh well I went online and just did a a a search for issues with starting and I I figured those are the places to start and they they weren't that expensive anyway so\nYou know and that you know what I I I didn't ask that opinion the quarter but that is a ... thing that happens where people will say you know what\nI Know I can do this this part's not that expensive\nI'll give it a try but what they haven't done yet at that point is spent any energy to find out what it wouldn't start what what was missing\nWhat what what you didn't have ... you didn't you didn't know whether you had a electrical for fuel problem at that point when you started putting those parts on correct that is correct so and when it's going to bring it back to ... is his site if if he saw the vehicle to service center\nAnd it was able to be duplicated like that which is always the tricky part though yeah you know if it's duplicating\nAt an old in the hour does it on ... yeah that I\nGot some day that'll do it and other days it was well we're just all of a sudden on a whim I decided that hey I don't want to go anywhere today\nWe're working on a money Carlo and one of our guys just found it after I had been there for three weeks and of course it's a it's a kids' car so he's bugging dead dead when they've had my car for three weeks we're kind of shot physicists like\nFood it doesn't do it every day for it doesn't matter their shots there should be able to figure it out like we don't want to just start throwing parts I mean you heard that I pictured attack going out and going\nThat's what I pictured and yet you know I mean and that's why\nThat's a myth perception it's like you can now if if I fix that car and I give it back to you Chris what's your car\nAnd you ... ... your car saying what happens if you tell your friends\nHey where's the carbon Chris or lifted up with to show up it's been there for three weeks for them to go to fix it or\nWhat are they gonna think but now if you tell them well you know what this is the car that remember used to lead me stranded and I I've been coming into work late for a month\nYeah what's your deal how can we can't show up to work on time well because my car about one side of every thirty starts or they won't crank\nSo it doesn't go so I took it to them and of course it did the same thing and they're not driving it every single day so it was really hard but finally they figured it out the ... that the shot found the problem whole different perception isn't it\nBut the same exact results well this ... found it he was working on it and finally we got to die and it did it a few times in a row so he fired it up again these starts touching wires real lightly moving around to see if there might be a short and he touches a computer and it dies\nStarts it up such as a computer again it dies for like a hot so we figure out it had a computer problem\nGetting figuring out what we've lost that's the that's the thing when this thing was losing sparked fuel everything was shut down because the computer is based so it wasn't any one thing you could pinpointed on no I mean it would just go wacky but it turned out to be a computer computer can do that fuel pumps can do that like Shane and said you got to find out what\nAre we losing are we losing spark are we losing fuel and that can be so tricky when they get to this I've had cars myself I've had to drive for a year or two before I found out what it was because it just wouldn't ACT UP enough for me\nTo find the cause and find out what was going on I had the problem with my diesel truck I said on the air before you let it go that long but it it wouldn't ACT UP just occasionally when I was tone it would do weird things and then fix that\nSteve thanks very much for the call good luck eight six six five nine for for one five oh let's talk to ... you're on the under the hood show what can we do for you\nYes I have a question for you or you're just talking about the shifting gas I've heard of any prior to two thousand they like an eighty eight grand freer and ADA Chevy Truck you cannot run that\nWell that's ... that that is not the here's the thing they're they have we tried to tried to come up with a generality to cover most vehicle because pretty much everything made\nFrom two thousand one up all the systems are sealed you're perfectly fine there were some trucks and stuff that we're not I'm completely sealed up admissions wise and stuff until that time so that's why they came up with that number but\nFor the most part or\nAnything that is a fuel inject multi port feeling jak yeah multi port fuel injected electronically control the ignition and fuel will work fine just so a a Ninety eight grand prix yeah no problem a Nineteen I'm\nEighty eight a Nineteen eighty seven throttle body injected a Chevrolet pickup would would have a system that's computer controlled if you have a question about\nYour ground if he got power ground do your vote was burned out which is unlikely to have every one of them all but one of the two will be gone either you're missing voltage at the switch\nOr somewhere in between 'cause he got a broken wires that use the ... circuit on the back like the Ford pickup she used to use yet actually the gauge yeah like a little printed printed circuit on the back and those can break you can have a little break in there were more the wire plugs into the back of that gauge I think that one's got the round plug with the pins but they back and breaking not connect\nGrounds can do it too in that dashed but um where the radio goes in that car make sure that that wire that goes that same color wire that goes to the back of the radio is not a\nShortage or in the ashtray that the ashtray light is not shorted and in cause and that thing to have a a bad circuit that'll do it to\nA couple of things to check it's\nA it was right other question was a key parts in the LA well does that mean the war or was\nIt sure does does it does matter\nOkay I go to war but we were out that's good\nOr bad no that's what it is thanks for calling thanks for the call al eight six six five nine for for one five oh what else was caught your attention in the automotive world\nNews happy news well let's say I have a news have you like Chevy Trucks and you like for cylinders well the twenty ninth team Silverado we gave me a little wind that it was going to be coming out with a four cylinder engine option\nWell yeah I don't know what do we got going on that four cylinder engine that makes me nervous when I hear that talking about an engine that's going to be twenty miles per gallon highway\nOr twenty miles per gallon city twenty three miles per gallon highway a eight speed automatic trends are going to get a lot more here so you can get this thing moving but\nA hundred horse power in this turbo charged engine now\nIn that particular news story that they do the same toying capacity or not\nNo they don't but we've also got a to point seven Pico boost\nAnd the Ford which is of the six ... six were just talking to an engine with you know a\nBigger displacement inside because we're putting to point seven leaders of displacement in a force owners compared to\nTo point seven and a six or eight what I mean you could make a to point Seventy eight you could make a to point seven one cylinder engine if you want it to I just have a huge ... held her big stroke yeah I mean\nSo you can do those things a lot of it has to do with heat this a patient in the block size and stuff like that the Ford is still going to get you a little more\nUh by means of talking and horse power not a whole lot more but still you're looking at three hundred and ten horsepower three hundred and forty eight foot pounds of torque out of a four cylinder\nIf we go back to a five\nThree engine or think about that I mean the five three not too long ago was like three hundred and Ninety five or yeah or rent or own feared horsepower yeah in a five three VA so we're talking a four cylinder with the same amount of power\nSo it is yet to be seen how well these hold up when people over told them because they get in them and say wow this things got a ton of power less poll like we always have and overdo it\nUm when you're when you're pushing a\nFive three V. eight hard and may run a little warmer and it just doesn't go real hard but when you're pushing a turbo charged engine really hard things get really hot turtle you generate a lot of heat oh yeah um I remember a buddy of mine with one of those four cylinder turbo lasers in uh\nNineteen eighty four five\nAnd push that thing heart and yeah it went like a V. eight trying to push it hard with super high rpm but the the turbo melted and pieces with the engine and destroyed it so\nThat's not good you know that was way overloaded everyday driving the thing would have been fine for at least thirty thousand miles right into a little worried about that a great guy had at fifty thousand metal that but he took that thing I'll while it was still under warranty\nYou know it's it's all in how you drive but I think it's neat the options that are coming out and what we are getting and just to see trucks that are getting into the you know\nPassing they want to live forever this'll be a great option for some fleets that need a full size pick up bad to be able to put light things for the job site in ... they're not pulling the construction trailer they're taking a few guys to work and they're and they're put something in the back and let's be honest a great thing for the guy who wants to pick up truck that really needs a mini van [laughter]\nI mean it or they are huge part of yeah that's a huge part of that pick up market now is people who just want to drive pickups they don't need to pick up they just like pick ups and they want to drive the curious to see what this is going to be available\nAnd they're showing the half done now but will it be available in a um know of other half ton Ford or long box truck\nUs

I think you'll find that all the apps almost all the apps that you use in Iowa are available on Android they're very you know in some cases are better\nOr because they Android is a little bit more open and so apps are allowed to do a little bit more and that brings us to the downside of Andrew security Android now to Andrew Andrew there's no downside to you\nUh [laughter] the downside of an Android is security um\nOn security is going to be much less of an issue because Google obviously update their phone faster than any other phone so it's getting the security patches every\nMonth right away so there's an advantage to that uh\nI I don't think security is really a big issue even though there are far more things to worry about on the Android or because you're not a target if I if you were a target you know of some nation state I'd worry that I wouldn't carry it I'd probably\nI'd probably carry and apple for when you go to hacker\nConventions because people don't bring an Android phone they bring their ...\nOr no phone which is for a Nokia candy bar phone which probably be the best uh\nBut I don't think a normal person is going to be at risk security wise ... you have to be targeted I think so I think in general it's going to be ...

the season but the ... has had an ending to their year they lost their last two games by a combined squirrels won sixteen to thirty six what do you think that might do to their confidence coming into

come out strong you know they're ready to get that a third of that a big ... tried to make some help that\nYou're familiar with this program that when you were a sophomore we went up there you can do

against the north star bear cats and\nThere's a couple of big story line before today's playoff game Shiloh would major changes on both sides of the ball\nGene mental who led the er at the school record last year in every five touchdown\nJamie ... who led the er at the school record last year and thirty five touchdown\nAnother great years actually not going to start a quarterback today\nOn Barker moving into the tight end spawn\nSophomore Josh cold when it's going to get started quarterback\nIs definitely a big move I mean I think it's safe to say jade mental is one of the best is not the best quarterback in the same class the football right now is definitely going to be probably all the quarterback even this year\nAnd it's a big move its biggest question more of a best selling me into a mall times to tell for this move here\nDue in part of the thinking was Shiloh as line was exposed against new Salem aren't that\nIt definitely works out new Salem was kind of all over there they're shutting down there on a game getting plenty of back and they were all all around disrupting styles place so I can see them move for wanting stronger white blood I'm just not sure if moving here all the quarter back to that position in the right\nMove on defense there's some shoveling as well ... ... moving from linebacker ... secondary Jane ... moved to the Mike linebacker spot and now my team is going to start to outside linebacker how do you see those changes\nThe those sound like good solver moves right there I mean you got a lot of athletes on the field so you're bringing in a bigger headed if someone ... all over the vigor and just to their heads and just getting to see I was moving around so you have more talent more things show when you go up against other schools like more hauling a sale that they give it to him to\nTake a look at today's player to watch we mentioned ... thousand yards passing Fifteen touchdowns he will still play quarterback\nSituations but will be the tight end and running situations\nTeam approach and he's handled this well\nIt was kind of an emotional week for their family but they use really quite a kid isn't he\nDefinitely is I mean it's one of those things were coached making a move and you don't always have that control of the most so you gotta you gotta take it in stride you got to take it as best you can because you're in playoff time destruction the team is not something you want to see those emotional reactions or it only hit the gym at this point so move like that you just got to take his ride go with them\nFor Josh calling and he's only attempted to passes talk about the pressure on him today\nHe's got big shoes to feel I mean ... ... and all of the quarterback is one of those you got to step up to now you've got to show that he's he's worthy of his father also we could see judgmental back there for us tonight\nRunning back pain and far between a senior thousand yards rushing nine yards per carry eleven touchdowns can be a lot of Canaan today as an\nOh definitely is he's always been the ... brothers team the the guy you get the football to to make the plays and uh I Would imagine to be no different tonight\nI Know we mentioned this young man a few times but ... really has done the job on defense he leads the team and tackling fifty five\nSix tackles for last one interception he's not a big kid but he loves the physical ...\nDefinitely does well defense of guys where you live to see a guy who won then they want they can make time looking shows me he's out there making every place is getting tackled and he's leading the team in taxes because of and the guy who has that kind of mentality really cares about medicine\nLet's take a look at some of the players to watch for the bear cats of North Star senior quarterback Peyton will bang\nFor over Fifteen hundred yards and twenty eight touchdowns channel wise and face many quarterbacks like\nHim oh definitely has Charles based teams on the ground and are things that they can easily managing secondary is a guy you want to watch out for you throw the ball in the middle so well so tell second there's got to be on the game\nAnd the two speed stirs for North star sophomore running back Jeremiah hill six hundred thirty one yards on the ground nine yards and carry fourteenth touchdowns\nOr the guy to watch Josh\nWide receiver Gavin Miller thirty seven ... seven hundred and Ninety two yards\nSixteen touchdowns Twenty one yards hurry sat\nOr be seven catches for seven hundred and Ninety two yards\nSixteen touchdowns Twenty one yards reception and I think Josh ... getting the assignment on Miller today that's quite an assignment do definitely\nSee the guy who could break just came over for North star says yeah you got along down you've got to keep them contained you gotta make sure he doesn't have the ball in his hands on sale well he doesn't that tonight\nThese Shiloh players who used to these playoffs are joins they've been through it for several years now how much does that help\nOh definitely doesn't get the experience of\nGuy most of these guys are the first rodeo they've been here several times before the younger guys they listed on the sidelines so this has nothing nothing new child is actually coming tradition come into the playoffs every year so it's not the butterflies will be a little bit less
