[laughter] I Know that we had lower there wasn't a lot about but we do have commercials 'cause you're\nYou can give your work away and just say I'm doing it for\nFun roast pot casters that's the case you can say I'm going to charge people for it and then there's no commercials and there's no commercials that I tried that at\nFirst it by pockets but people just really don't want to pay for stuff especially a podcast right you're used to getting Radio Free ... and I thought well rich people like radio and they and the ads supported why not try that and I've actually worked pretty well for\nOur you know ... something I guess network I started in thousand five have Thirteen Years ago still around still doing great yeah [noise] so uh I and I it's for me it's great because I Do the radio show on the weekends but I had to have something to do Monday through friday mhm no I I Love doing this\nBecause yeah I only um it's fun it's my only radio connection anymore sell off well our old mentor and bosses that\nI Know I uh I think between you and me sent a message or a dark grass friday that they have Francisco yeah the whole the whole of the subject was WTO yeah jak once and is a great guy hijack\nThis that and I actually day is the seven year anniversary of when they blew up the first time so radios funny that I I I waste today was his first date back yeah without the ladder at all\nI'd be curious that our news later I feel like they must have backed the brings trust got to get him back because I after getting blown out like that I don't think I was at the same company oh I beg jak about to cancel the show [laughter]\nYou know I'll give you a bobble head I am going to pay a visit various you know and it's really great to have him back yeah who should I talked to on the radio\nHere I Am going to go with Paul in Columbus ohio because I think he can help them spend some money and they know how much you like doing that I leave when they don't stick camera like oh man I spend way too much money does not make me a better photographer\nThat testing I keep hoping though\nHyde Park Columbus ohio we'll aboard the tech guy\nCome ... you're doing very well do you like we're having our graffiti your your hobby\nUnfortunately not so much a I'm a visually impaired talked to several times that forces it's my daughter's camera\nIn turn out like oh that's great yeah\nShe bought a um a Sunni for six thousand\nExcellent camera so when I gave my son for his high school graduation lo these many years ago\nIt came with two lenses yeah and she dropped the one of them are we going to\nTake one off or whatever and they got some scenes in it [noise] so she's actually tried to use the thing is clear in here the noise or whatever in isn't but\nSony by the way a ticket to a Sony repairs depots very common people often effect on a regular basis like every few years we'll get their lenses tuned up and they can they they'll literally take it apart cleaning out put it back together and and lubricating if it needs to be\nAble to one place she says she's in Denver and the police she sent it to a local impair the I don't think it's gonna suddenly\nIn Russia now do you want a hundred and forty one hour oh well that's true it probably is expensive yeah well the the thing is she can buy a new one on Amazon for a hundred and forty dollars a\nBrand new at the same kind of a different guy\nWell supposedly that's what I Want to ask you she says it's ... there's lifting their says it matches the camera and says it's a bulk package and it it's an international when I don't know what the heck they mean by international\nWhat it'll it so that this is a real issue in the camera world um when you buy a camera generally I Will say get it from a an authorized ... you know somebody Sony authorizes the same with lenses but in this case you might see what the difference is you're buying\nPromote an authorized re so you know somebody Sony authorizes same with lenses but in this case you ... what the difference is you're buying the same lands but it's going to be you know kind of gray market which means no warranty basically [noise]\nSo but nobody really uses warranties on these things anyway so yeah so ... know repairs no warranties I Would say with a camera don't because the body often you know that's the kind of thing like a computer you want to be able to get repaired\nOr lands maybe not so much how much difference in price it's\nStill it's virtually the same price and the ... the original and repair and she's only had it for you know like eight nine months so\nAs long as you feel like the sellers legit and I bought it the Amazon\n... but it's not Amazon so this is another big issue always look on Amazon because more than half of the stuff's all of Amazon has not sold by Amazon Amazon access of filming company for third parties and most of the stuff on Amazon has not sold by Amazon so look carefully to see if it's\nSold by Amazon and shipped by Amazon what both it won't be if it's if it's European with ... with no warranty almost certainly will not be from Amazon but check and but and then you'll see the vendors name is on the listing\nEither way Everytime you refresh listening it might change that's not unusual as well\nAnd navigating Amazon has gotten a little tricky because it's not all Amazon Sony cells for instance directly\nOn Amazon Amazon bills so understand when you look at the listing you're going to see who sold by that's who's actually selling it to you\nAnd who was built by sometimes sometimes not\nIs
