Christopher man that's then hunters of innocent and here's a bonus one there's a disclaimer at the end of the film that reads the\nJews opinions expressed like Christopher in the film that all men either burgers are slowly isn't do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions the Walt Disney company or the filmmakers that there was this episode of you think you know movies and make sure to subscribe like some of these ... ... followers on Twitter and get the latest movie and TV news on screen writing dot com [noise]\n\n\n\n\nHave you gotten to know [noise] I'll call\nShe I think Michael ... music just for you like you said you guys yeah they gave you the good much\nOh wait a minute oh now I can hear you yeah cut your ear while you read into that Gary Owens is not a great so so obviously Burke and John like you because they give you a fancy Mike oh\nAnd I've been coached already it's purple you know I saw that both my ... boom Mike [noise] uh\nHeather is the phone range into that she's going in for Kim we don't usually get Heather because you've got a real job now\n[noise] real job stinks [laughter]\nOr the fabulous the cage yo in San Francisco the the the great to station longtime great station in San Francisco used to work there myself many moons ago\nWe need you back well I'm On I'm On their sister station I suppose so that's good that's good he has got that [noise]\nAnd you do that [laughter] and you do the traffic in the afternoons now exactly PM traffic anchor\nA nice so if you're in the San Francisco bay area you know you need to know the traffic in San Francisco and the Heather will help you\nGet home and it's so brutal and every day I'm like oh look at these math is brutal yeah that's why uh I have a segue [noise]\nI can dip in and out amongst the cars have you seen now San Francisco a on Monday and I saw a bunch of 'em when I was there a\nFriday or are they are given permission now for a while I was kind of the wild west like Santa Monica where they were just a bunch of scooter companies right and the big scooter company in uh Santa Monica is or what is it Lyme or a no it's another ... it's\nA bird yeah think Bert birds so bird line which is owned by\n... which [laughter] sounds like a like a hardy boys mystery like it's a young adult fiction skipping school to everyone riled up and out drinking buddy ... could be different schools skipping school and the devil's triangle skipping school are so they're all around but Lyme is\nNot in line sued mine said wait a minute because it's owned by ... ... what do you mean and the court said no San Francisco has the right to do that as a reasonable a desire to keep the streets now I didn't see a ... I was a kind of surprised that weren't a whole lot of scooters around\nMaybe their role in and out still maybe number seeing one on Monday right away you know I felt like don't you think the city kind of gave it to line because they came first and didn't ask for permission yeah like we're going to show yeah\nWe'll show you maybe maybe maybe that's what happened to I don't I think it's a great idea but I Am too old to rice scooter or not I don't know do you feel comfortable with or you have you hopped on a ...\nYou know I haven't yet and I said because you know just for kicks and try it a\nMirror you're tempted to ... you have as a cue our code on him and his smartphone you pull out your smartphone you scan it and then they charge you it's not I don't think it can be very expensive you hop on the scooter and the and the point of all of this is you hop on you ride to wherever you want and then you leave it\nThere is such a great idea except for the fact that there's scooters littering everywhere as\nWe have the Ford bike stacking stations outside at the radio\nOr use those well yeah a lot that was very the community by saying you know I like that ... years ago but those have to go back into their docking stations\nRight so maybe they need that for the U.S scooters as well just to sort of keep it under control\nYeah I Do now and I don't know I mean I think this year well honestly driving in San Francisco is a nightmare\nAs as it probably isn't any big city you just there's no not enough parking they don't it's not as some of the car friendly city they'll give you a ticket at the drop of a hat and the tickets are expensive and so maybe we could you know maybe this is this down the road I here's my vision I Hope it happens in the next you know in my lifetime next twenty or Thirty years\nThat some of the big cities in the world just ban cars entirely they have parking lots on the outskirts and they have either\nEither scooters or segue or self driving vehicles maybe they just have way Mose\nAnd that and there's just there's no congestion as such a pedestrian these much more friendly\nHer credit for that strange right\nThere is a little town in Italy beautiful little a medieval town called ... it's much like CNN which is very more famous in as a famous\nWith all the towers but see it allows traffic in the score that send Gemini on or does not and it's such a pleasure to wander around and just park on the outskirts as quieter I'm sure the residents market except for grocery day\nOkay I don't know what lies in the San Francisco listen that what if everybody parks on Treasure Island they yeah to yeah and uh and I think that I think\nHonestly that's why companies like Hoover our value movers valued at over a hundred billion dollars is because not because of ... day but because of ... in the future when their self driving vehicles and they and they dominate\nRight when you get it all figured out you know what I'm saying though is that I hear so commonly as people are like oh my God I Can't believe that they just stopping to rein in front of me and they mess up traffic for blocks but if we had lanes for with a poll and say\nIf you just didn't have other cars all over because then they they all self driving vehicles 'cause then they crash they talk to each other they don't hit pedestrians right they just will maybe they do because there was a working out the ... works out of the games\nBut maybe less so maybe there's room for bicyclists now all of a sudden Hoover by the way is planning to go public early\nThey think they're going to ask the markets for one hundred twenty billion dollars [noise]\nOne hundred that's ... and it's not because there are alternative to taxis that's not the future of the company the future the company's self driving vehicles ... should I go work for work and they seem to know a lot about track you seem to be an expert [laughter]\nYou know I hear that all the traffic reporters in every city you're going to be hired by ... self driving car division [noise]\nIt'll be it'll be Heather ... is our is Charlotte that's what it's called what it is no way I'm Sorry the way most Google a mile away most Google that's their self driving cars way will you could take away Moe in an Arizona though oh\nReally yeah I Love uh I think a Phoenix disgusted I Can't remember what towns but the idea is just one of the things they have you do\nYou call ahead to the grocery store and you say a here's my grocery order they they they put it in bags then this is the weird part ... comes and gets you get in the way mode drive to the grocery store pick up the bags and drive back why they don't just wait and I'll get my gross why I get in the ... just bring me the groceries I don't think\nThat's a little odd use of a way\nI think it's more to introduce people to the way most\nWell Heather we've wasted enough time we actually don't have time to take any calls so steak everybody know\nWe're going to take calls when we come back you've been answering the phone we have lots of people on the line and ah that segment we kill the entire sorry oh I'm so happy to see you I don't get to see that he will be next when we get back from Palmdale okay thank you Heather on the ... [laughter]\nI'm wonderful at this ... wasting time talking about Wilbur I just think it would be so much better to be a huge cities if there were cars now you'd have to have a way to get in but self driving vehicles or\nMaybe the scooters oh community cars and I don't know it seems like there there's got to\nBe a better way eighty eight eighty eight asked me Oh yes I Will be taking calls\nWhen we return we'll report the that guy [noise]\nNeed help\nOptics move crazy amounts of data at even crazier speeds and fighters by rising as the one hundred percent fiber optic network\nProbably was getting a bit connection you'll get the fastest Internet available download speeds up to nine hundred and forty ...\nTV phone end until your price guarantee offer Seventy nine Ninety nine per month with a two year agreement\nPlush get two hundred dollars toward a range of Google and that's smart um devices and a one hundred dollar visa prepaid card when you order on line\nPretty good anyway the other day you know for the Internet forever the other day woke up\nAnd no Internet connection do you do you go to a browser and wanted to activate right look at the table right if you\nWill not after it I have an air is us a surfboard sixty one forty one box was three\nIs that is that yours or that won the Comcast provided you have your own yes it's my job I like those Eris so here's what here's the way this all works or the cable company sends us say say they sent a little signal down to the modem to activated\nA and you can I think you found that there is a website where you press a button and supposedly it does that yeah but if that\nDoesn't work then you need to call the service rep and say hey it's not activating and they can do some things now I've had a number of different things come up that make a difference it's funny 'cause it was working right\nWas working at now they say well we went through two little tests and said we have to send somebody up\nNow I Will get on the modem and check the statistics on the modem yeah it shows\nConnected all the numbers ... says no stray signal to noise all that's correct on the router itself a can a release the theater wrestling contest with ... he addressed and when you go through the activation of process you're using the Internet to collect a contest\nRight yeah the Internet [laughter] that shows you capture you know you have to allow him in the city you with tax that's on the Internet\nI Know [laughter] so what they I I think this is all anti piracy measures you know why people stealing cable so\nThey register the Mac address the FCC address which is a unique number assigned to your router and then the cable modem every everything on the on a on a network has a Mac unique back address and they have all\nThe yeah a theory I mean if it was work in Iraq address was registered but\nWho knows what has happened since the fact that they want to roll attract what Comcast does not want to send somebody out of that costs money the fact they want to roll a truck tells me they think and this may be the case there's something wrong with a physical connection [noise]\nTV Works great\nYeah but the Internet's different and it may be that it's not even a connection to your house it\nMight be the ... the up on the poll or if you have an underground cable or I've had I've had Comcast come out and I had the guy come out and test across the street because we have underground\nAnd the poll or if you have an underground cable I've had I've had Comcast come out and I had the guy come out and test across the street 'cause we have underground cables you lift the hatch you went in there and said oh yeah that's a low signal that said that the cables gotten a little afraid or whatever\nIt may be re slice it and so it's that's what they're going to do something like that and it's I think\nYou just let 'em roll a truck is probably not something I don't know that you've come out and try to at least in ...\nNo no no no they won't they they're fine with that I've never had to push me to get their modem\nAnd just say no I mean you're you're better off it's not your modem I don't think it's a it's probably the wiring either to your house what you hope is is not the wiring in your house 'cause that that they're not going to\n... that's got to be on [noise]\nBut something something has slipped
