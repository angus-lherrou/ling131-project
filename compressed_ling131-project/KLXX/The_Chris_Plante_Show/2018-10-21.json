hello\nHello my question is like grand twenty four year old granddaughter is scheduled surgery or endometriosis apparently it rather than the family that just one day when his I can suggest for her\nOkay the first thing that you have to do it but I treated hundreds of cases a vendor matriarchal says and what she has to do and she has to quit using uh these\nHygiene ... a ... a products that go inside of her uh can't think of the name of them right now but they're ...\nTampons that's it ah if she's using those that as a fast path to enter matriarchal says\nAnd once you start using pads and I know that the young girls young women do not like to do this because they think well then there's going to be some older and I'll have to hassle and it'll be in my underwear may show I get that but\nWhen you do it are tampax or anything else it's stuck inside the vegetable canal that causes this just that'd be like sticking a plug\nUp your but your rear end to not have diarrhea that won't work either and that will cause cramping of your ball because you're going against the flow wanting to get out\nSo the number one cause of injure matriarchal societies tampax number one and once I've had so many women who changed over to the pads and their ... overtime got better that's number one number two\nThese same women who have any major roses usually have some pretty heavy nutritional deficiencies that they suffer from that include the vitamins\nAnd usually if you look at what they're doing in their lifestyle they're eating a lot of junk food a lot of sugar they're ... they're down at Starbucks getting ten twelve teaspoons of sugar in their latte\nOr they're deficient in these nutrients and they don't take in their diet the right kind of oils there on all these inflammatory fats\nThat they're eating because they're eating a at the fast food places and getting all these inflammatory fast which just add to the inflammation that they're having that's helping to drive the ... so we got to get them away from the good\nGet them on the good fats like the omega fats and prim rose oil and away from all the other fads like safflower sunflower canola oil those kinds of fats they use these things and dust really in the fast food industry and it just throws out of balance our own\nUh essential fatty acids and creates us inflammatory response and there's a ton of herbs Sally like ... why and chase bury that we have used for women who have menstrual cramps because Mr cramps are really the heart of this problem\nAnd once you solved the menstrual cramped problem by solving the nutritional problem the lifestyle issue you teach them that uh they can go to an acupuncture is to get relief for ... says acupuncture is highly effective for enemies ...\nAnd if she continues to go down the medical path they're going to talk her out of her uterus they're going to take her uterus and while they're in there that will take her ovaries and she will be from that point forward wrecked\nFrom my sexual standpoint because we know that the uterus is or gas Mick just ask women who have had a hysterectomy and ask them what's your sex life like now that you've lost your uterus well\nIf they admitted to you they'll tell you there's just not like it was before so this is a very slippery path to go down in the medical pathway they do not know how to treat ... says and it's one of the worst places to be if a woman has ... under the care of medical uh therapies [noise]\nEven though that there is something that may be growing out side of the uterus\nAloe yeah that's that's what that's what ... is the tissue eventually invades the abdominal cavity and once you take that once you get rid of the reason it all starts shrinking back in coming back to normal\nThat's how they motivating scare women all you know all these issues it's just a you know it's like a it's like a parasite growing inside you well let's just take it all out that doesn't solve the reason for the ... so she's still going to have problems if he continues to use the tampax and has all these nutritional imbalances [noise]\nGreat but again it's her choice if she wants if she wants to go in and have the whole thing shelled out let her have it\nIt's not going to solve a problem or hormone problems not going to go away they'll just manifest themselves in another way later on breast slumps a ovarian cyst is I mean it's just going to just continue down that path way because nothing is being solved [noise]\n\nView their Sally I Am writing and writing down\nWill have her go back and listen to the pod cast of this\nUh it'll be in the pod cast library on demand a as a Wednesday and if she has a good sense about her and with your love and care are encouraging her to get a second and third opinion not just a rehash of the first\nUh then maybe she can save her uterus and not have to have invasive surgery which involves a general anesthesia by the way and general anesthesia\nWill generate a risk of one in Fifteen hundred people dying in another itself not to mention the complications the scar tissue I mean we you know I'm not here to scare you or her I'm here to tell you that my experience teaches me as a doctor that's been a doctor for over forty years and have seen\nMany cases ... can be handled in almost every case there's always going to be that road case it's got you know so much tissue that's a migrated outside the abdomen\nThat you know they're so far gone yeah maybe there's that that case but in hers why not try it conservative approach first before going out and holding and shelling out the whole system\nYeah I Know you tell the truth\nWell that's the way I Believe you know that's what the show is about and I I you know again I I respect doctors who do these surgeries but most of them are unnecessary but it it but unless you have another option people are going to go down that slippery slope she's got plenty of options in it her young age\nThis should be able to be turned around or Sally there was very nice of you to call on her behalf alright next step we say hello to Carol she's going in from Little Rock looks carols gone\nA so let's go
