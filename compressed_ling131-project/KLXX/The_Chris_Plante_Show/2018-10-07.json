like articles that we just can't squeeze into the show because we don't have enough time\nAll right we're going to turn our attention to another topic here\nWe are fast approaching it already in it in many instances the season where people more often than not get ill we're talking about the common cold or talking about the flu we're talking about just issues big time\nWith all the holiday seasons right around the corner you need to know about how to protect yourself you need to know how to recover you need to know what you need to do on your side of the equation to avoid a lot of the bullets sickness bullets so they're going to be coming your way both internally and external factors that can impact\nYour immune system both positive and negative and we've recruited a special guest to talk about that her name is Marty wit can\nShe's a board certified clinical nutritionist and author of the best selling book\nNatural alternatives to next him and other acid blockers her new book entitled the pro by Arctic sure both of those you should have part of your health library by the way I Do\nMarty is the host of a long running syndicated radio talk show at our website healthy by nature show dot com enter free newsletter are great health resources\nMarty joins us today to discuss what I said how to help yourself out internally and externally with factors affecting your immune system with that let us welcome back to the show a Marty weight again and good day to you Marty\nWell a good day to you Dr Bob Pfizer great pleasure to be with you\nThanks for joining us let's jump right into this topic I mean we are like people are now getting hammered\nBy the uh call to action for getting the flu shot based on the fact that\nIt was a complete bust last year and in years past\nAnd they're being told that if they don't get the flu shot they are going to die if they don't do something they're going to die and uh so I Want to help people to better understand how to better take care of themselves let's begin there our topic today is the immune system immune health\nSo how do people protect themselves and their families this fall and winter season Marty\n[noise] well we had a debate until the cows come home about um [noise] oh good the vaccines are whether or not they have the risks that we don't want to tolerate but there should not be any argument about\nThe things that we can do to improve your chances I mean a lot of people who don't have the flu vaccine are suppose the flu and don't get it why is that they have a stronger immune system so [noise] I I get frustrated that we don't have\nAnd the publicity about those things that we can do internally and externally sometimes you'll here's some advice that it brings true wash your hands a cough into your sleeve I'm no question can't hurt to do those things\nDrew a wash your hands a cough into your sleeve I'm no question can't hurt to do those things but uh things to do with a with nutrition and I'm always [laughter]\nJust and I'm sure you are to amazed that and nobody seemed as in the media or um the diet ... so I don't don't say oh\nWell you know the flu season colds colds and flu season is also the season when we don't get so much sun could there be a connection\nWith vitamin D as just one example\nExactly exactly well that and people don't talk about the you know the relevance of\nThe host immune defense in other words those people who are most prone to get sick will get sick and the goal should be to help bolster or harden their immune system so that when it does come their way they're going to be less likely to get it into if they do get it there'll be more likely to\nBe able to get through it with ease and be better off as a result of it\n[noise] well exactly and the\nCurious thing again nobody seems to comment on that you can is that they always say\nOh well the flu is the hardest on really young people and really old people will coincidentally those are the same people who\nDo not respond well to the vaccine but could use a lot of help getting their immune systems struck function better\nAnd um that's that's what we're here to talk about today\nRight do not respond well or did not respond at all and I do though when they're taking the flu shots what they will get one hundred percent guaranteed is a\nMajor dose of toxic mercury and aluminum in the in the vaccines themselves because all of them had no money or what is the number one natural hair be that you recommend for enhancing immune system let's say internally\n[noise] well I'm ...\n[laughter] vitamin D day already mentioned uh that so just in the study is directly related to immune response and uh a lot of controversy is hold another show about what the proper blood levels are and\nHow much you have to take to meet those blood levels and I know you've discussed it um but at another huge areas that are not paid any attention to it as our got health because our immune system\nStarts\nA really early on and you sent me kindly sent me a lot of my article the other day about\nHow if you're taking acid blocking drugs the kinds of things I explain a the dangers of in my book natural attorneys an accent\nThat you are many times like three times more likely to come down with serious infections\nA because stomach acid is supposed to be there to dissolve these critters and then if you go a little further in the in the rest of the digestive tract that's where up to eighty percent of our immune function as and ... we're not paying attention and I know you're going to talk later about\nArtificial sweeteners and one of the effects of those in a lot of the chemicals we take in is to damage our gut bacteria and we're just cutting our\nOur chances of fighting off\nAs you say in a surviving these diseases\nSo what is your what is your recommendations somebody just passing through we just have a minute to break what is your best recommendation for to optimize that\n[noise] well I'd like to talk about supplement but the most important thing is to be the ones you've got already well they don't like vegetables and fibers and not kill them off with drugs if you can avoid it\nWe can talk about how to supplement but start with the basics pay them well and we help them thrive\nYeah uses supply them with the raw materials they need to flourish so they can crowd out the bad guys and try to get in there or those that tried to assault them and we'll get into the specifics of that because people do want to know that\nSystem whether you're talking about the immune system like we are today or the her lungs or kidneys or brain whatever\nOr I just for those people already who are going to be moving in and out of this conversation today I Want to give them the opportunity to know how and
