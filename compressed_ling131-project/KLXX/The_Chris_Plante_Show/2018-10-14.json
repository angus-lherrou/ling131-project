I'm going to just have you go right through and I sent you three separate\nArticles ... sauce tonight overload you only give you have you give or take the opportunity to give us some nation of what these researchers are doing in the ... area of ... and when we finished with that I Want to have you tell the audience one is a tell them are and how is it important to human health\nSure sure yeah you said some interesting articles that one of them is about the losing a father a with boys in this case I'm sure the impacts girls as well\nAnd are we know that stress is a very very powerful factor and shortly telomeres which is really short and you'll live spirit and your health food\nIn fact Dr Elisabeth Blackburn won the Nobel Prize for her research um tell them is it her book she devotes a lot of time to stress\nSo it's not surprising if a young boy loses his father whether the father dies or he leaves a it really is a tragic a deeply emotional experience for a boy that are not only affects them in his youth but the rest of his life\nAnd so it's not surprising that these boys would have shorter telomeres are it's it's a void of all\nAnd and it also dramatically shorten the tell nurse by\nAnd nine years of age in other words a you know let's say the child has a a loss of a father at a young age it can shorten that person's life span in you know so it it does it goes back to stress okay that's article number on what's the second one that I sent you\nWell there's another one that the links are the shortening of telomeres with a\nHeart disease or this is something that's very clear in the literature uh all the various aspects of heart disease for example hypertension a blood pressure uh the inflammation or the vascular health\nUh everything a ... there's a link\nAnd the health of your cardiovascular system and uh it's quite clear quite traumatic in fact the I'll tell you later you can go to my website I've done videos on various aspects of of telomeres are not only with heart disease but with all the ah major areas of health concern that we have\nAnd uh so uh when you realize that telomeres are foundational to our basic cellular structure well then you begin to get the picture of how important they are\nAll right in last just a you know a line or two of\nThe statements ... related to lifestyle and how that impacts longevity\nYeah what's very clear a diet lack of exercise uh the bad stuff smoking drinking too much or you name it uh it's really common sense\nA bad lifestyle habits are going to impact you at a cellular level\nNow conversely a good good lifestyle habits you know keeping a a good body weight I mean that's huge huge and you know that there's not any disease system that we have for condition that's not deleterious Lee affected by obesity\nAnd that's just goes right down to our cells are you in young people if they are they're obese\nOr they're going to have the the cellular a structure of someone who sixty or Seventy years old or so lifestyle is very very important and uh also keep in mind\nWhen you're fifty sixty Seventy years or more\nYou have accumulated a lot of cellular damage now it's great to go on a good diet and exercise or what have you but we have nutritional things a neutral pseudo fickle technologies now\nWhere you can really help your body reversed that process of of cellular aging\nAnd you you mentioned stress and of course who hasn't undergone stress a horse hard these related to this a problem with a tele Merce and of course lifestyle so let's get to this round you explain to the audience want to tell them reason why it's important to human health\nOkay ah everyone's heard the word chromosome on the tips of our chromosomes we have these DNA strands there little caps and we always said that compare them to the uh tips shoelaces and very much like that\nOr as they break down and shortening crack just like those plastic tips on the ... just a\nIt's the same thing here but instead of the ... not working the cell doesn't work and eventually dies I mean there's no two ways about it they become ... and that leads to another problem when you have an accumulation of ... cells in your body\nThat puts a tremendous burden\nCellular burden on you and and and your your your health profile\nSo those those telomeres get shorter as your cells divide over time when you're young you're twenty five thirty years old those telling me as a long and strong and your cells replicate clearly\nA you know I Would like to talk about the copy machine right when you put a copy in there by the
