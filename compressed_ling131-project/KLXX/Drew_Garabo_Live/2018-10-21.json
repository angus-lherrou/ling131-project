I've had for about a year and where are our trip last yesterday morning and while they were streaming music proud that screen for others that are and\nI couldn't get to do anything to try to reset it by holding that she died but he is and um the little circles started and then in the middle\nAnd at the start our own Moe will\nBe approaching Las Vegas it had an apple store so we thought the apple store and they showed me how to do a heartbeat that\nSo he is the volume up button and the uh screen off button right you hold those that right yeah\nRight but the problem is that this morning out while they're traveling I had it you that fight\nOh yeah it's time to time to you so they didn't they didn't offer to fix that for you\nKnow they they buy we told them they were traveling so I\nI ... yeah so that there is something that's clearly something's wrong with it the one\nThing you're going to want to do and are usually it's not too big a deal is to refresh the phone\nTo bring it back to the factory a state you know like it like when it just came from the factory it's about the only thing you can do to be honest with you\nOK yeah if you were at home I Would say before you do that back it up and then refresh it restored you could actually do that through a two inch directly you can a race it restored what I\nTried my I had one of the time but I Would call it that wasn't a big deal but as for traveling of course that ... that but at my\nNot an ideal thing if you are I Would wait and well Chris is not working so it doesn't really matter but uh nowadays I back up to the ICC\nWe do that fairly quickly but the key is you go in you know you go into settings you're gonna need your iCloud password\nYou go into settings and you're just a race it you know bring it back to factory uh expects that may or may not fix it if there's nothing wrong with the hardware it's not going to fix it\nBut it would be something that the apple store would ask you to do or they would do any way that before they fix that they're going to say well maybe it's just a you know 'cause it's a computer and it's got a ... it's got storage in the operating system sits on the flash drive just like everything else does and if it gets corrupted somehow then that could be causing this\nSo you know you you know you just go to the general settings and you could call the way down where says reset and you're gonna say race all content settings and that's going to centrally bring it back to where it was when he got home\nThat okay yeah and I can do that and I might be able to do that on that trip also because I Do back it up and have a\nGood if you back up to the cloud it'll be fairly straightforward just that on cellular it's going to either won't do it because it says well I'm not gonna you know kill your cell bill or it'll be very very slow will do it\nWhat what would be that Kansas I have a magnetic lounge it's certainly better than my car what would be that ... ...\n... that's the good news is a magnets don't harm smartphones and [noise] so uh it's you know it's\nLook it's a computer and er they make lots of them and selling percentage of them are going to have problems unfortunately it's out of warranty if you bought it right away when it first came out\nOf debt and that's why I thought it might be something else because I didn't hear it and that's not had a problem they\nDon't plan it that way [laughter] sometimes it feels like that that the day after the warranty whereas out things break but I don't think apple especially I don't think they planted that way and\nUh it should it should last several years at least if it could it could just let's hope it just something went wrong it can happen to any computer the operating system one of the key files could be damaged and that's why it's rebooting periodically we're freezing periodically\nAnd then when you were race it and start over you're going to start off it I truthfully the best way to do that he's with the computer at home because it will read download the software the from where for it you won't be able to do in the car\nBut when you get home before you throw the phone out or throw it out of apple guy could we do the full restore using I tunes and they will actually download replacement for him where which is known as the good and that that's the best\nAnd killed a lot of the multiple heart rate that are probably any issue it\nSaid no it doesn't hurt to know it doesn't hurt at all yeah a ...\nYou know it could be adapt its bad uh that's one of the reasons the reset might work because you don't ... don't reinstalled all the apps justice offices you need them because maybe there's some\nYou know\nAnd then you have any anything on Amazon Music ways and that music app\nTry that I use those all the time yeah should cause a problem yeah those are\nActually somebody saying that I forgot to say I felt ten was delayed the announced it in September but then come out till

[laughter] well out of ten year old love Minecraft interest rate pie is a great device for Minecraft not so hot for Fortnite that's that takes a little bit more horsepower I'm afraid\nFor ... he's going through the Minecraft phase now he's on the fourth time\nDarn it or we should have caught him when he was still in the mind crap they [laughter] yeah for night is all the rage is easily\nThe

a you know plenty of choices and it is a super demanding in order to get that work in a for instance on an iPhone and I had a I think they've yeah they've released the Android version now it doesn't ... you can play it on on pretty low in hardware\nSo um you don't need to spend more than say five hundred dollars on a laptop to play for a ...\nI'm pretty sure a ten year old laptop is going to get a computer in fact with all kinds of\nOh he is guaranteed yeah yeah and unfortunately you can't play Fortnite on a a chrome book which would be the safest option for them or\nThey might you know Apple's got an event coming up in the thirtieth they might announce new Mac laptops maybe the rumor is and I think is strong indication that they're one of them will be a lot less expensive for schools between someone thousand dollars but Mack stuff is still\nReally really expensive um right so you you know your best bet is uh inexpensive windows device\nOr you could almost certainly um lock

so Fortnite launches when he turns on the machine [laughter] nothing else does ah I don't think you need to go that\nFar minimum uh for Fortnite you need it will actually running a core I\nThree processor ah I Would suggest my five for best results eight gigs of ram or it's nice you can read it on and tell graphics but if you can get a inexpensive and video or a empty radio and card in there\nIt will make a big difference it doesn't have to be a fancy one can be a ... six sixty something like that I think four five six hundred bucks you get a pretty nice PC that would be more than adequate for Fortnite\nBut he had he had and they take him to Best Buy at least once\nA week ago we [laughter] we go back to the gaming laptop a gaming computers which is you know twelve Thirteen hundred dollars and I said Jackson there's no way in the world than Thirteen hundred dollars on the computer no hope\nFor you to play for an eye on the other hand\nYou definitely want to encourage a ten year old to continue with his interest in computers as well because you know and sometimes people say he's just gaming he's not doing anything creative\nYeah but that's how we all started that's how we all started um gaming\nIs you know the gateway drug tell I got started out you know and I got more and more interest eventually one of the right software that makes it a big difference I was just reading\nA a guy named Paul Booth ... who wrote\nGmail you worked at ... employees thirty two at Google he's very wealthy today\nAnd uh 'cause he sold his start up friends feed to Facebook and he started because he was playing a role playing game and he couldn't get an item in the game and made a mad so he figured out a way to hack the database to get the item and then realizing but any item he wanted and\nAnd they'll turn him into a programmer\nSo there's nothing wrong with the kids wanted to play or night\nBut I Do stand by this recommendation of a raspberry pies thirty five dollars it will get him into you couldn't get him into programming through it the one of the things if you if you've caught him with Minecraft there is a version of Minecraft on here that's programmable by a python\nAnd ... and if a kid's still in the Minecraft er and I bet he has some still vis digital interest to tell him well you know what you could do with Minecraft you can build a dynamite bridge and then blow it up or you can have a one button house that you build these designing python the programming language and then you just say built my house because\nThere's so many fun things you can do in fact there's a wonderful book from no starch press on a computer programming with Minecraft that is a great book he's a ... you know it's really and\nProbably more to twelve or Thirteen year old but I

certainly this time next year will be\nOh yeah all you need is a you know at twelve dollar doo Hickey and she can play for it and I\nBecause your claim it on the server the down side will be of course is why Microsoft Google and\nOther companies are interested in it is you'll have to pay a monthly subscription fee everybody wants to move to the subscription fee\nThat is every company in technology now like prefers to get and that's a shame but it's the way it is the first to get that monthly annuity and ... as opposed to one big chunk of payment actually if if they could they get a

Would I Would do is get a lawyer letter over to them and if it turns out\nThat they don't have any proof that you owed them money is just hey you always the money I Am because there was a letter or someplace there's some indication we have no backup what you're doing is a illegally interfering with my ability to get ... ah and ah there's some there's some liability they're\n... than that in the meantime though the locked in rates are going to\nCome here there's no question now rates are are are exploding oh there was no issue about it at all so I you want to work with your lender although the lender is going to do everything now that interest rates are so high would love to get you out of a locked in rate or maybe I they still want your business who the hell knows at this point\nAnd that because I don't know the anticipated the rates going up as quickly as they have been going on in the last few weeks and so you work with them\nBut this is where I I think you have to threaten or the banks saying you're holding up uh my rate which is locked in interest rates are now higher there is some damages there and you just you can't do that without proof\nWhile we don't have the records well then how do I know their money well because you do how do you do it\nSo that's why I got a letter from a lawyer and making a couple of demands would help\nIt would there be any advantage to waiting until the next September when the bankruptcy discharges to get us just a standard a of a conventional\nWell he ... on that well it's put your interest rates me what are they are two points higher [noise] yeah\nYou have to you don't want to wave your rights on this one goal forget the letter a and nail the bank if you can wow I I've ever heard of that happening uh and and it just\nThat we're always money\nThe bank maybe there's a letter there there's no proof problem this is handling the law\n[noise]\n\n\nNothing small not your [noise] your passion your hours your reputation all huge\nYour partner said even\nWith down small business technology advisors and you'll get the ... and ... and the one on one partnership to help your business ground because of the reliable data bases

it's\nHave the right to say no war or they have the right to say if you put one in ... that in violation of the CBC in ours or they can say ...\nAnd you take it out until you are and and then here's your fine and uh we're going to keep on charging however they made it untenable for you to on the other side is that you wanted to put it in ... they made it impossible for you to even uh even make an application\nAnd there it is and there and that by the way that there is a court case okay uh you have to ... ... when I Do have a conversation with\nThe attorney that represents the board and every every board of directors a H every actually has an attorney who represents a that represents them and just have a conversation and say hey you know the board made it impossible to management company wouldn't call me back\nWhat am I supposed to do well what you're supposed to do is just keep on trying and trying\nThe board made it impossible the management company wouldn't call me back\nWhat am I supposed to do well what you're supposed to do is just keep on trying and trying and trying and at some point I'll tell you legally what should happen even though it's the biggest pain in the ass you go to the point where they make it untenable and then you get\nA court order allowing you to do that\nBecause they made it untenable but that's way down the line so you've caught it early on now it's a question of a what a pain in the asked the board is they're going to say hey we set up\nBy the time or we set up a date you could've called us and found out it was eight o'clock or eight o'clock AM PM and you're going to say I tried yeah you never responded here's my phone call the management company and what you guys do where ... year playing chicken with each other\nSo it's a it's a problem\nAny attorney for the board we're sitting right next to me at a board meeting or one of the border ms ... around ... ... what the window for putting solar panels ... kicked the window out while a trip to Spokane\nThat incidentally uh if anybody else will uh will state that\nWho was in the room now he doesn't have a right to do that by the way that's not a legal decision okay that's that's a board decision but that adds to your argument that says a decent argument really is it's a tough one God everybody has problems today that I don't so that works out hello Dennis Hi
