[noise] eighty eight eighty eight at play over the phone number Steven's\nOn the line from the most wired city America Tacoma, Washington Hi Steven\nOh I ... I had a problem with my PC oh I Want to see a longtime listener first time caller thank you well you see so does he carry days are out so so\nYeah my windows Kimball update and we ... we have some three or ... you know free\nYes my it's my turn\nThree or ... you know free yes my guess is what my current version is yes and you just want to update it won't do it now\nSo there are two kinds of updates Microsoft as two windows there's the feature updates Eighteen oh three was the spring feature update we are about to get [laughter]\nIf everything goes well Eighteen and I and the fall feature if they pushed it out a week ago and it turned out of the leading some customers data\nMicrosoft said no that's okay only one one hundredth of one percent of\nCustomers had their data delete it oh my God that's a that's a show stopper so they they they pause the update they've they've tried to fix his anyway Eighteen now come up with important thing to understand is these feature updates are not critical updates that's the second cut up they these are bug fixes and security updates\nThose you want now if a blocked Eighteen oh three is keeping you from getting hot fixes after age you know three you got to fix it but as long as you're getting security updates every month on patch Tuesday did you get updates last pastors patch Tuesday\nOr is this is um your devices in this important security\nOkay that's bad news that means that the failure of Eighteen oh three screwed up everything and you do and I you know while I don't think it's important\nTo get feature updates its absolutely vital to get the security patches by the way Microsoft with windows ... is not going to let you ... you know if you don't get a do you know three and then ate tonight eventually they're\nGoing to get mad [laughter] have really it's part of the deal that you got to get the updates even the feature updates\nSo we've got to figure out why your updates or block Microsoft has a troubleshooter a four block to updates usually you know if you think about it updating an operating system like\nThis is you know in place as his working is kind of like I don't know rebuilding a jet engine one flight it's it's it's crazy [laughter] so it works most of the time but if it fails ... you got problems\nSo slowly chili is it called a techie Achilles set up or something\nUm it's a registry a that well first thing they do is is go look for the windows update troubleshooter and that's on Microsoft's I don't use anybody else's okay so I'm a they're a lot of people have\nYou know information about this and you can read information but never get a file from anybody but Microsoft yeah yeah yeah so there are a lot of the reason I say this instead of saying oh here's what you do is there a lot of reasons that can fail\nUnfortunately and ah when it fails um if it's if it's sticking if the rest of the updates are caused because of it you really gotta you really got to fix it so\nIf you Google windows update troubleshooter\nAnd you get to support that Microsoft dot com or you can you can run that it is it is a trouble shooting tool to fix this common problems won't fix all of them but it fixes common problems will put a link to it in the show notes or it's it's it don't get it\nFrom somebody else get it from Microsoft\nBy hand I handle this era I go all the air and gives me an Arab ... zero you know X A hundred ... whatever and then and then I I Do that yeah I mean the little um a wiki page\nOkay [noise] and then he gave me um [noise] they gave me a this um the chili kept utilities shut up\nYeah I'd be nervous about that yeah yeah and maybe it is all you need but if if there is something like that didn't get it from Microsoft there are lots of that out yeah there are lots of little things that can go wrong and it could very well be that some nice person has written a tool the problem\nProgram from a site unknown\nOr even if that wikis legit which I'm sure it is somebody it's a wiki somebody could go in there and say hey I'm just going to change that link and to my credit hacking tool so you really don't want to do that get it from Microsoft or are they ... if you as I said if you Google the troubleshooter they have\nA registry fix troubleshooter and then they do have a program that will run but get it fixed and it maybe sometimes it may be you know you got to do something more draconian like reinstall windows I most cases you don't\nBut it is if it does in fact require that it's worth it because you're really at risk if you're going on the Internet with on patch version of windows these days is just too dangerous\nThe issue is of course you know in order for a bad guy to get on your system has got to get you to run a program he's got to get you to agree to some things are and that's hard you know what I mean it's maybe not as far as it ought to be but it takes a\nYou know you have to scare somebody a trick somebody to do it\nBut there is a little loophole\nHere bad guys are always looking for\nFlaws security issues not just with the operating system but with browsers and anything that goes on line [noise] things like the adobe reader this or do we flash these are well known issues so in the past they've all been patched but if you're not doing the patches you might still be vulnerable those\nIn the past adobe flash had a bug that if you uh\n[noise] you know had a ... actually this is only the W. reader instead because you see PBS all the time right and you needed there'll be reader read PBS and so it's natural habit there'll be reader on your system\nBut it turns out they're bad guys are discovered multiple flaws in a dove e reader\nThat allows them to create a special PDF normally a PDF can't hurt you it's not a program but this special PDF can\nBecause it takes advantage of the flaw in the reader to execute a program oh sneaky now how do they get you to do that well they don't have to get you to do that they just put that PDF on a Web page you go to most browsers will automatically\nLoad the PDF automatically call it there'll be reader to display the PDF in boom you're infected pick completely without any intervention on your\nPart you don't want that you want a bad guy to have to trick you at least to make it as hard as possible\nSo you've got to have pet everything that goes on line you're operating system your browser adobe reader do before anything that goes on line\nHas to be patched has to be fixed because the minute the patches\nPut out bad guys go aha there's a flaw let's see if we can fight it and you're much more likely to get bit and they can put these they could put these exploits they call them these these these these flaws on a website you might even go to they can imbedded in an ad or they can hack the\nWebsite websites can act on time put it there and you just go to this you're going to perfectly benign website it in the background without any intervention or visible display on the screen it loads a PDF in your hacked you don't want that you need to be patched they up to date that's the number one rule and security\nSo of course we always say don't click on links you know don't fall for stuff don't download files from wikis\nBut all of that all those bets are off if you don't keep your stuff patched we'll report\n...\nAre you prepared to

there\nKnow that are free oh they offer you free why fine\nFor unlimited device\nNice that's I is it from who's it from say curiosities it from the company that the rent you the building or\nYou know why it at that company puts it in the contract and stuff\nSo that might be all you need it depends on how fast it is there are things to be considering\nOkay we have an inside office or not I'm On an outer\nWall what does that mean as far as well\nMaybe maybe not you should go in there with a phone or laptop and just see what you get and how fast it is go to a you know go to DSL reports dot com on

getting now report a calm there many speed test you also go to speed test that that might be good to go to two of them and then tested on your laptop\nAnd then ... good idea to test it during the hours you'd want to use the office of going in the morning lunchtime afternoon and see if it's fast enough for you if that's free and it's fast enough for you I say use it here's the one thing to keep in mind your Internet service right or whoever provides that service and I would find out\nDoes have you know like any other service provider can see what you're doing so it's got to be somebody you trust it maybe who knows it might be the city that's doing it it might be who knows I don't know who it is it's interesting that so they do offer you free why unlimited free why as crap\nUnlimited by says she ... well that's you know when you've got to have talent they have an F ...\nYeah unlimited devices is nice I'd like to know if there's a band with limit like if after you download live gigabytes they say sorry no more 'cause that'd be kind of put a crimping your style\nOK okay sell out at any given point there maybe two people in around ... found now than with can you tell me about that really place like watched what ...\nWhat you should ask whoever's providing that free why five what their speeds are still always tell you max\nWhich doesn't mean they're guaranteeing that speed that's that's the max usually with less than that right 'cause you know everybody lies\nAnd us and nobody's gonna nobody's ever to say well typically you're going to get twelve megabits they're going to save up to forty megabits\nSo it's not that's not very helpful that's why I tell you get the speed test in there and see what you're actually getting not what they told you you're getting ... there are any bandwidth caps if ... if they for instance as phone companies do if they slow it down after you use a certain amount and the months if they say no unlimited bandwidth unlimited devices\nThat's good um maybe you don't need to buy a Internet access\nBut you'll have to test test that you know you can I mean look this is the cost of doing business has Internet access these\nDays so ah you know
