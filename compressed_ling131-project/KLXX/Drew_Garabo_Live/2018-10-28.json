T. M. I. into your computer\nThe wire cast software captures the video and then has to compress it and turn it into a format that the site will accept whether it's YouTube or Facebook or I mean they go on and on many many companies we do this with a variety of different companies [noise]\nSo you need to have in the format that they will say oh yeah that's fine that works with our live stream and then they'll accept it so the the software is capturing it converting it and uploading it all and real\nLike it's some capturing footage to final cut\nDrove kind of er chews up to their the differences is done in live in real time right it's done live the only one that's available the Wildcats\nOh no there's ... of these is it okay there's a very popular area but first thing I Would suggest you do is figure out where you were on the Internet you want this to appear\nBefore a temple service so I imagine probably Facebook\nFacebook's a good start everybody has to have a Facebook account YouTube is maybe a little bit more accessible because uh you don't need to count to view it as long as you can get online you can view it YouTube\nLive um [noise] you know I I\nYou know I'd recommend in the past this might be an interesting way to do it it is there a budget or you're just getting the job because you have cameras\nAh well yeah that's inquired they asked me and then I said well I really don't\nKnow what I mean look into it to get ...\nYeah smart man so I've used a thing called them and I mentioned this on our last show somebody was asking a similar question\nA chemical me vote any video at get me vote dot com this is kind of an all in one solution\nIt does stream via a wife fight to your iPhone or eye pad or Android phones you then use that and it's cool because it's a single camera about five hundred bucks but it's shooting for K. shooting a much higher\nResolution image than you stream and you can move around within that larger image to zoom in on people even do it automatically when somebody talks it'll zoom in on them when they move it will follow them it's really interesting technology and that's streams two of the meal live stream which is the company that makes it\nA Facebook Live YouTube Live periscope Twitter uh so you know there are a lot of different places you could put this my suggestion if it's temple service you want you know you don't you don't want to say oh you have to be a Facebook member to see this I put it on YouTube I think that's the most is the most accessible\nAnd this will stream right to YouTube you basically hook up the camera or it it will capture the Senate has a good a re Mike so you don't even need a separate Michael though you could if you want it to\nHim out or is it does not have a huge TMI out it it goes uh I think he goes I'm trying to remember I have this thing and I don't use it that often I think it was wirelessly telling me leave me\nVote any V.

mentioned is obviously next week will know but\nThis would be today would be a bad time to go out and buy an eye pad a Mac book air or a Mac many consensus is pretty good and and and mark Herman who's the king of apple leakers he doesn't work it out but he works at Bloomberg Businessweek but he has great resources inside of apple\nSays that there will be two new I pads and that by the way this is the tired [noise] apple watching community seems to come to a consensus on this ... pet Prozac\nAnd Lebanon Churchill replaced the ten and a half inch so it because these are going to be vessel is much like the new are newer iPhones there'll be able to be in the ... there'll be in the same size Hi Pat as the current ten point five but the screen all be all all of it almost eleven inches 'cause it'll go to the edge\nFace i._d. that will work in sideways for upright\nSo working portrait or horizontal landscape mowed the current face id does not do that\nNo more home button and it will be the same user interfaces the iPhone tan and tennis the swipe interface that apple is going to put on all it's Iowa stuff there will be also a larger I pet pro and now there's some question about this ...

eighty eight eighty eight ass Leo are getting ready for Halloween John in Utica New York's next to John Lee a report detect guy\nOh lay o clock I may show thank you for listening\nEar welcome a earlier you were talking about ice on an Android\nYeah in case of emergency\nYeah [noise] I have an Android try here that runs lollipop version of that's quite old now yeah [noise] well I've done ... is there is a option under settings\nThat you can put if the phone is lost have your phone number perfect shows up on the lot screen perfect yeah solid actually holds forty five ...\nOh good so you can write some of it like if you just put I see first responders know what that means in case of emergency right so if you just put I C e at a phone number first responders immediately know what that is and as I had mentioned uh what I've been told by first responders that's the single most important piece of information\nRight now so I did it as I left my phone number that if the phone is last good\nSo I put like last last number yeah and then I was able to pay ... to ... to contact that's great\nSets and yeah I think it's so important to do that and first responders now go right for the phone they they know that many phones had that ice information if you have an iPhone it's in the health that\nA more modern Android phones actually have an entry for it in the end about this phone in the settings or in an older phones that's a great way to put it on the screen is a ... message\nChats next best thing yeah so if I let you know\nYou John I appreciate it here welcome people listening thank you yeah we're going to make that the tip of the week of the website ...\nThat guy labs dot com because I everybody needs to do that\nVery valuable thing you can do put that in case of emergency information on your phone and in in every\nCase to the phones to support it it's it's accessible before you unlock it so they they don't need to unlock your phone to find that information and on iPhones it's not just in case of emergency call this number and it's also your blood type your allergies medications\nYou know anything that they knew they need to know in the worst case if you're an

it\nCorrect and that's the problem so you have to know how does that work you have to find out where in line\nI'd go back to the dealer and say here's a recall and I'm assuming it's an airbag correct I'm guessing yeah yeah he took it and I don't maybe want I contacted to knocking people I Would contact lawyers involved with those people\nAnd I would go back to the dealer and said is there a time is there an estimated time when uh I my car will be be able to be fixed and they can say talk has never been told us when it is we do we ever recall we know they said they're replacing the bags\nBut again Kelly there's five million people that have your problem\nOkay they actually told her there was no solution lady then\nNo no no no that's not true they can replace the airbag oh that's ...

and so\nThe house [noise] one of the house burned down in the fires they did have insurance I was listed as as the additionally insured\nAre right now it's up to my surprise which I found interesting being concerns company says they're going to issue one shack for the total loss\nIn both my name and the homebuyer young the insured name [noise] and it's up to us to to fight it out now I agree that I'm not going to side of the check over to them and they've agreed they're not going to signing the check over to me so it leaves me in a rather precarious position\nWell and I I don't know if it does or not it probably leaves them in a precarious position 'cause they have to live someplace and you're still okay and so you you can do a couple of things on this one\nOr you can ask for a mediator\nWere you guys pay for a mediator to work this out in a mediator who has experience in construction law\nMediators are generally attorneys\nWho specialize in his field and then just sit down and work it out over a few hours that's one if it turns out that they're not willing to really sit down and then what you do is you file a lawsuit for the money and then you do ... you actually enter plead the money with the court\n[noise] so here's a lawsuit to the court hears that check now let's go to work and the judge will make that decision\nAnd the judge will issue in order and effectively the judge will sign the check on your behalf pursuant to a court order\n[noise] so it's either a noun a mediator or a lawsuit [noise]\nOkay [noise] and ... and looking in the mirror my friend and saying why the hell that I hold back and take paper [noise]\nTelling me about it okay let me do it again you look in the mirror and you say why held at night just get my money out of that and let them make payments to me okay so we've done ... go ahead [noise]\nBut first of all let's start with I don't know why would you marry someone who is such an auditor flake that he has been filed taxes for ten years\nWhile he pays taxes haven't filed attacks\nHow he'll wait a second just write the check to the IRS now I don't\nKnow I mean taxes come out of the tax nothing like that he does all that\nHe just had an filed that's at yeah he's probably entitled to some big refunds actually if you think we know made\nMe but I'm just wondering if I marry him and my response though\nA hell you're only responsible for being stupid and home and you know well that's a given but I Know I mentioned Carson I Love you and I'm not stick to see the will lessons well we can have that\nConversation can we are because I did we talk about your boyfriend now or soon to be husband you're not responsible or a perfect once you have to be a little careful when you marry someone who has financial issues\nYou just keep everything separate everything separate and I and in in what I mean separate is everybody has totally separate bank accounts and you have a shared bank account that then you write household checks out of Vietnam\nEverybody has totally separate bank accounts and you have a shared bank account that then you write household checked out of the mortgage or a gardeners or utility bills or whatever and so that is the clean his weight now as far as he is concerned\nHaving pay the taxes and not filing a tax return now that is a violation but it really isn't a big deal the IRS\nDoesn't really carry just file their taxes and you may be entitled to you may be entitled to refinance so why even though this violation\nAnd it's one of those and not paying taxes they get very upset yeah you know he paid and then you're fine\nAnd then just say hey I didn't file their taxes that memory lapse for ten years and I don't remember and I woke up and I have a long beard and rip van Lincoln wanted for whatever\nBut uh I haven't gone to an accountant file their taxes damage and I get a refund okay I'm often now okay now you're an idiot primary dialing [noise]\nAh Michael hello Michael a welcome to handle on the law\n[noise] probably about five months ago we had water damage or capture a result can lead to fill a record that came out to remove the damaged areas in the front anymore\nBut it took about ... percent of the counter tops all the cat or dog maybe ... percent of the cabinet about\nHalf the drywall linkage came out with a settlement ... some of the contractor we've been able to find a come out and do the work to restore the kitchen to the way it was a contractor keeps pushing off you know we gotta keep\nThey got to keep quiet yeah it's all you can do\nSo I just wanted to make sure of it is yeah this is Barry insurance company is going to low ball\nUsually not to that extent it depends on the insurance company it really does or some ... the insurance companies run all the way from miserable and horrible to really terrific where they go out of their way to the adjuster to not only help as much as possible but then called back\nAnd say is everything okay I'm Mr handle I'd had a couple of those ah you clearly don't have one of those\nOn a trucker disappeared for three weeks Carlisle uber on leave yeah you've got you've got an insurance\nCompany you have to deal with all you can do is fight it I Am a ... at the end you may end up having to to even take your own insurance company to ah to court and all you can do is go to a supervisor level and scream and rant and you can screen bad faith uh but that's that's the tough one and so you're you're sitting there without\nA without a kitchen correct for five months\nFor five months I either while they're negotiating while they're doing all that that's part of the lawsuit I think that's very good fat that's a bad faith all over the place so either you have a couple of choices first thing I Would do is contact a a bad\nFaith attorney in in a civil attorney who deals with insurance companies and see if I Do read the policy to see if you have anything they're they're all kinds of exceptions to mold or in many cases insurance companies will not do mold abatement you're sort of on your own on that one uh it's it's a question of your policy it's a question of a B adjuster\nIt's a question of the company that you're dealing with and uh of finding a lawyer that can look at it and then we started threatening I mean that the only good news here or is it to you and not me\nA ...
