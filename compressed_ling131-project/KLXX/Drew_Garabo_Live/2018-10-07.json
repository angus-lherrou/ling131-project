would say if you were here we were talking earlier with a dad and wants to buy his a fourteen year old daughter first serious cameras she's joining interest in photography and we talked about all the

for practically nothing because\nLots of people have these or more likely inherit the [noise] uh and don't and don't want him John shaking his head but John ... is the ... film shooter like me\nBuild a little darker him for ... shoot you black and white try acts and develop it printed herself I think that's a great discipline first of all it's expensive each ... each picture costs you or something\nAnd as a result you think about it a little bit more with digital photography and I know there's a problem for me I take too many pictures 'cause wind up\nTheir free so you take twenty shots at the same thing just because you want that perfect shot that's fine that's that's a you know modern way of thinking about photography but I did learn with an icon FM all manual film\nCamera and it's so expensive to pay for processing a film and the printing it that I did it myself because it was just way too expensive so I Would roll my own like a a try ex film you by Kodak try ex was just there and they still make it beautiful\nFour hundred I uh so black and white films little grainy but it's just a classic feel kind of contrast the U.S just a classic look you've seen many try ex photos\nEspecially photo journalists because it's a fast easy film to develop in print by and big roles in your in your you get a bag [laughter] a big\nBlack nylon bags that you can with to arm holds you can stick your arm holes in here because he can't let any light\nAny light strike this film and you roll up little roles role reveals a film giving it a little thing that does that little roller\nAnd make your own film canisters that saves your money get down to about a penny or a photo now and then you print it yourself you have to get up and then larger\nAgain this is all a lot cheaper than it used to be because there's a lot of use gear on the market because nobody wants to do this anymore except it's a great discipline I Do know some photography schools a lot of photography schools even in high schools are are are are teaching kids film photography first\nOh you got to do it the old way old fashioned way back when photographers are photographers learn the answer all items zones system things like that\nI think it does make you better photographer though because you have to think about it each each image images aren't disposable anymore that's one of the problems with modern photography [noise] you know it's so easy and cheap they're disposable when you have to pay a penny ... picture\nAnd it's really it's not just the penny is all the time he spent rolling at the time you're going to spend in in a red ... you know dark rooms with toxic chemicals developing it\nAnd then of course the the the artistic process of printing and which is really fun because you don't have photo shop [laughter]\nYou don't you can't you you dodge and burn in real time using light [noise]\n\nThose chemicals probably are very good anymore and they're not good for you\nI think it's it's kind of fun to craft maybe a little too crafty for fourteen year old ...\nJust the thought it was just a thought eighty eight eighty eight ... already is on the line from ...

I'm not worried if I lose my documents folder because it's backed up and sing to my mask but uh yeah there's a gigabyte in there there's some there's some data in there yeah\n'cause mine said to one driving on some of that I'm I'm noticing lately there thinking even the desktop to wander off which I actually don't like I've turned that off because my sisters don't have exactly the same program\nYou have the time and you don't want that I don't lead yeah I don't need short cuts to things that aren't ... into another that's just a pain in the neck\nBut it has to customize it for your usage and that's a perfect example of that yeah you know you wouldn't want that sing\nBut one thing I have to say is there a giving up some of the screen readers are run for the money because I'm totally blind user and are you of course you've seen narrator or heard of it\nYup that comes with windows yeah\nOh yeah and they've since this last version of narrative that I noticed I saw it on the inside a preview and I said well let's see if it comes on the Eighteen oh nine one that did\nThe narrator program actually gives you a brief tutorial when you start it so that's a big help to get you up and running because Android and it gives you a tutorial on their screen reader and so now you got one on the [noise]\nThe writer screen reader so you have to get an idea of keystrokes and things like that that's right\nYeah and the new feature which is coming soon of having your Android screen echoed on windows is going to be interesting too I Wonder if that'll work with narrator as well\n[noise] I don't look for it to just because I have a feeling it's graphics\nBy yeah might just be an image have yeah yeah\nYeah but that's not a big deal for me at this point of fact uh the computer I'm working on the screens messed up I think my nephew stomped on backs [laughter]\nSo it\nDoes it still thinks there's a screen there but you can't see it\nOh dang ... it doesn't bother was going to say that probably is fine right\nI yeah I got to like that the screens don't work but the computer thinks they do crazy as it works for me\nThat's awesome ... give it to uncle Joe because he won't notice [laughter] yeah there you go of\nIt is not something I noticed I haven't looked today I'm going to go look a lot I went and you've probably seen this thing from and I don't know how to pronounce it high Dakar hate hate hate he doc dot net the in the windows eyes do download or I don't know if you've ever seen that are not\nNo it's not from Microsoft is from somebody else\nWell uh but it does to Microsoft is H. E. I. D. O. C. dot net or give it a quick\nGlutamate look I I Would generally say don't go there\nJust get it directly from Microsoft there's always a concern when you're getting windows from a third party that they can be modifying it\nAnd then I tell you a radically the nice thing is Microsoft offers the meat they call it now the the media in you know installer immediate ... ... and ... and it makes a USB key does everything I ... what is high doc do that Microsoft doesn't\nI I guess the only thing it does is it gives you the actual image from Microsoft and actually one reason I can tell that it's coming from Microsoft as it says copy you can actually you could download it with the tool but I prefer to hit the ...\nStop the like for six years a little bit and it copies to your clipboard to link to to download and uh I've looked at very carefully and verify that you know yes it does indeed come from Microsoft\nRight that's good do you want to make sure\nI don't know Microsoft too careful in in the open source world\nWhen you download the software they do something called the passion empty five hash that you can see you next to the Arab and then you could verify it because if the if the download has been modified in any way the hash will be different\nAnd so in in the open source world we say because you really is that this has happened happened recently oh you are and it's really an issue because if a bad guy can get a\nYou know his own software on your system it might look like windows it might in fact the windows with a little bit of extra that's a real privately I don't know I think Microsoft does now offer\nWay to validate that download this looks like a nice to have one of its written by yawn Krohn published a couple of years ago probably because the Microsoft media creation to wasn't available yet\nBut it does do one thing it looks like the media creation doesn't tool doesn't do it will add office to the download so if you're one of those people who wants to install office at the same time I mean it's all windows that would be convenient but again I\nHave been very careful especially says now you can get an ice so directly for hikers soft and the media creation to turn it into a USB Buddha ball you asked me I Would I Would prefer to do it that way\nThe other and that's probably the best way sometimes I'll even if I Want the image directly sometimes I'll even downloaded from Linux because if you do until the Microsoft website from the limits it will not uh it it doesn't offer you the media creation to eat right\nAnd I guess the ISIS from Michael issues just get the ... so that's just if people are comfortable with Linux it's\nVery easy to take a any any I sew and make us a beautiful USB from it so um that is that's a I often do that as myself that's a ... you know for me I'm I'm familiar with uncomfortable with the DVD\nTools ... yeah yeah\nWell have you got the old computers or the screens busted on on\nThe opposite of the when I Do not yet I I don't have any nephews to sit on them unfortunate fortunately there you go [laughter] my nephews are all on the east coast I have to worry about that [laughter] and my Fifteen year old has a sitting on my gear hey it's great to talk to Joe and thanks\nSo much for the call [noise] yeah no but if I Do I'll I'll let you know does it yeah perfect use I never even thought about that but yeah

you're serious photographer and I know you're just getting into this the ah my recommendation\nIs the adobe creative cloud for photographers\nWhat you get from this is the top of the line tools for photographers there'll be late rum and there'll be photo shop and you've heard those names those are normally very expensive program but it's only ten dollars a month and I think that that's a pretty darn good deal under twenty dollars a year\nYou can certainly get other things that are less in fact I Would look at it now these are a number of apps that are both eye pad and back now finished the photo is a good one pixel major is another good one but the cream of the crop in photo editing is light from what I use when\nMost pros use\nAn apple used to make one that they gave away for\nFree which is called aperture or not I guess it was eighty bucks wasn't it wasn't very expensive but they kill the late ... lives a result light room became the king of the hill [noise] but there are other goods\nPhoto editors and maybe if you're just starting apples photos is enough it does quite a bit of editing finally\nI Would probably say a ...\nThere is a great company that makes a really
