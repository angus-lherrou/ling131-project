[noise] so I guess the question is what do I deal with this money to city\nWhere do you do have the option just leaving it and were those big companies small we're in between that you were with before\nOkay so the one with the Eighteen thousand is on I'm most concerned with the smaller company and I'm worried that they go out of business what happens to that money\nFor the money would be okay and the four oh one K. but if it's a small business there's a different issue and that small businesses tend to have very high cost for one case right so I was scared that all that money out\nQuickly and move it to one of the low cost providers and have an IRA with one of them the three big low cost providers for having IRAs are vanguard Charles Schwab infidelity investments\nOkay than we have found and let me tell you something do not call\nThe administrator of the four oh one K. and say hey I Want to um move this money out and do an iron they'll say great what address you want to send you a check never take a check 'cause what they do is they would subtract thirty six hundred dollars from the check they send you\n... and send it to the IRS says withholding and you have to make up that thirty six hundred in the next sixty days for you end up paying massive tax for not being able to make that up so what you do with whoever you would go with\nIs they'll do paperwork that will move the money directly from the old employer's plan straight into wherever you're going to have the IRA\nOkay and then you recommend an IRA or the Roth IRA\n... I just I hear you talk about now that it's\nRight so the story is you can't take money there was in a traditional four one K.\nHaving a big tax bill does all that money they don't end was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. without money not a Roth IRA\nOkay and you can over time migrate the money\nFrom the traditional to her office you could afford to pay tax on money each year or you just know you got money that they are that's going to grow over the years that you're gonna have to pay tax on Sunday so let's talk about the other one the seven thousand his down in a big employers plan or small\nA it's a very large employer or their trail the stock exchange\nSo it was a big employer the odds favor that that will be posing extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA\nOkay so are the only exception to that would be if they have that money administered by an insurance company for them the four one K. or buy a bank\nIt's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nDollars and you could just leave that seven behind it move the Eighteen\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that then then you're able to contribute straight to the IRA versus trying to go through that\nIran or last year new great question so let's say let's keep this simple I in fact let me let me really think about this who is the company that administers the plan for the big publicly traded company used to work for its vanguard\nSo if you wanted to keep it simple\nUm move both of them demand guard and an IRA\nAnd just be done with the old employers for one case 'cause it was with vanguard the costs will be low enough as an individual anyway and then you've got the simplification of just having an IRA there and then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions\nTo you if the twenty five to grow in the vanguard IRA\nAnd then you open a new account with vanguard for Ross in any current or future contributions he may go into the raw\nOkay and then those can be so just so I'm Sorry I I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these days that Iraq is post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're already going to have twenty five grand that center pre tax account you want to have money in a post tax accounting or raw truly great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the Ross\nThis will be a way for you to do it you simplify your life you just have an IRA vanguard a Roth IRA vanguard old money and the IRA new money and the Roth IRA and that would be a good way for you to build up money going forward\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nHey Clark thanks for taking my call\nI'm sure you've got a puzzle you want to see if I can find the pieces for\nHis or a wife and I were looking at twenty Nineteen health plans are currently we're we're all on a family plan under my health insurance however the like many starts search hurting a surcharge for a spouse that's able to get health insurance through their employer\n'em and using round numbers it's roughly fourteen hundred dollars a year\nSo if I cut her live dependence and myself the premiums would be nine hundred versus including her which would be Eighteen hundred on top of that fourteen hundred dollar surcharge annually\nSo she's nine hundred extra month plus an additional fourteen hundred dollar surcharge a year correct\nShe's ten eight a lemonade twelve twelve thousand something ...\nCoverage through your existing employer ... how much is it for her if she goes on her employer's plan\nIt would be a hundred a year [noise]\nEleven hundred a year versus twelve thousand a year\nOr a versus about twelve hundred additional on top of that for the family plan I'm from the nice thing too is if we both cake\nIt only takes a minute to find out if you may have pre diabetes and you can do it and do I have pre diabetes that or if you're probably not going to argue kids were listening to the radio you're busy which is great because busy people can't get pre diabetes mine I read that wrong [laughter]\nThey can warn my classes so visit and do I have pre diabetes that Oregon take a short time\nBecause pre diabetes can be reverse\nTalking about the I Can't ...

even a chance in hell not not a snowball's chance\nAnd then he lives he lives about the definition I go to the second one a sex a sense of national consciousness exalted one nation above all others I think that the president United States should put the U.S first I think that's perfectly reasonable\nPlacing primary emphasis on promotion of its culture and interests not abroad but just a primary emphasis on our cultural and interest now he's enraged by the U.S that the president would suggest that he's like this\nAll right and and first of all you know you got socialist all over the place Hitler was a socialist\nHitler murdered all those people the other socialist like Chairman Mao tse ... murder and fifty million people or the star witness that lead into style with his Marxist and the Soviet Union they murdered what thirty or forty million people\nAnd the national socialist German Workers Party murdered eleven million and death camps and then murdered all those people in the war in

up itself is not necessarily controversial in certain context yeah but they're going to make a controversial and every context\nThe Senate known as civic nationalism is routinely expressed by politicians of both parties it means Democrats say that and it's okay when Democrats say that that makes it okay\nYou know maybe it would have said that if that's what he meant let's go ahead you know

he's not not see American\nBecause he slaughters babies by the millions and rips out their guts and he lost his with them now now I could add words to all kinds of speeches that Hillary Clinton has made over the years\nAnd then he says and then Greg search him because he knows I'm tapping my right temple with my index finger this is these left ... they can see people on TV and they know what they mean like just like George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin Trayvon Martin was an angel nevermind a burglary tools the women's jewelry in his backpack to\nFight club stuff from his brother hanging

is and she was in isolation she was alone we couldn't talk to her even it was just horrible for her\nAnd she was cordoned off we went to the hospital they wouldn't let us and we couldn't see her because they didn't know if it was anthrax right than what was that if it was just\nI mean as with all my heart I Can't stand CNN is reporting I think it's fake news but I I feel sorry for the people

been arrested\nOr shows up at your house or spit on you or threaten view or follows you I have had all the above\nAnd it's just very very very difficult and how many times if I said keep Obama said
