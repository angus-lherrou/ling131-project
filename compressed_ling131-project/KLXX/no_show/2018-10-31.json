they know who hasn't turned one even think about that\nAnd think about how somebody could decide well we have to lay somebody off and the department and you know Jim didn't seem very happy from that

people\nWhile you're trying to say that thank you how can I help you\nSo I was going to get your um push bake to about a tiny homes\nAnd is it will or is it a little on to live in a tiny home for a little bit to shave so he can build you know a pressure on only pay for it a tree [noise]\nYeah so what is the tiny home movement has lost a lot of steam and the last couple of years you know it was it was really really in a few years ago but people have found it difficult to live in less than four hundred square feet\nUp so now people are when they talk about living in a smaller home generally it seems to settle down to around a six seven hundred square feet which gives you just don't know more\nRoom to live without an enormous increase and the cost of construction or any of the other expenses because with a tiny home if you're living in something under four hundred square feet\nYou have so many of the same cost as you would in a larger home you've got to run utility used to it which is a big expense you may have permitting costs and the rest now sometimes with a tiny home\nIt will be on wheels so that it avoids some of the expenses he would have otherwise we're exactly are you what are you thinking of in your own mind like how long a period of time and how many square feet are you thinking\n[noise] uh so little in Florida [noise] or they know they're not very common here and I was thinking maybe like six hundred [noise]\nSix hundred and eight ... which would not truly qualify as a tiny home movie a smaller home but one thing is you got to think about resale so you're thinking of doing this from the ground up\nIs in the middle east and uh [noise] I Know somebody that can ...\nWow that's cheap yeah so\nAnd you got to check out a zoning requirements and the county in central Florida you'd want to build where they permit a dwelling of that size and what other things are they going to require but if if I were thinking of building something really affordable\nI Would also like you to think about a potential for resale in nine hundred square feet which is\nFifty percent larger than you're thinking about you can within an efficient building design you can build a three bedroom or one or one and a half bat home\nAnd then you have something that when it's no longer where you want to live you have something that has a much likely or market value to sell to someone else or as an ideal size for a rental property\nIt will go with the idea is that what you're saying\nI Would not go as small as six hundreds okay but if it were me I Would try to go a little larger even if it meant thirty thousand becomes\nA forty five thousand or to the side of the time you\nKnow it would not would not fit the definition of a tiny home but six hundred doesn't really either\nYeah it's ... and it will be on wheels rate\nIt would not be on wheels are you thinking staying on wheels that six hundred\n[noise] thinking about it yes\nI said that's a different kind of decision and uh you know I may be wrong on this\nBut I think that for the long haul if this is something you want to not just be money you spend on something but money you invest in something that hopefully will hold and maybe increase value I Would like you to think more permanent\nAnd a little larger doesn't have to necessarily make it more expensive if somebody you can build

right I got a crazy thing for you\nTo you know there are now the monitor is being sold that are geared specially marketed towards families with young children where the monitor hooks up to the

temperatures by by by at for fourteen it was this and now at eight oh two it's Bob la\nAnd that's the kind of thing I can tell you as a parent of three Raul past that stage now I Wish something like that it existed\nWhen my kids were young and you'd call the pediatricians office and say well I took it I don't remember it was that this morning when I take that temperature so having the ability to\nHave the Internet be your record keeper and be able to track\nAs often is your advice to take temperature of a kid who's not feeling well having those records instantly your fingertips seems like a great idea\nBut listen to this creep out thing so one of the the monitors that is always connected to the Internet is the cancer\nAnd so this one now is in half a million houses New York times reports that cancer is taking the data\nOn all the people having their temperatures taken at all times around the country and then supposedly\nTaking it down to an a anonymous data that's tracked by

up having to wait for a big tax refund each year\nYes All right so there is no a science to as more art and the easiest way to do it unless you suddenly have gotten a big pay raise at work is I did actually oh congratulations [noise] so\nYou're a payroll office will tell you with your normal exemptions what you're going to end up with this check eat in that check each pay period you increase your withholding so less money will be held back\nSo is it better to do that do exist myself altogether and take that a percentage\nOh back okay so is it better than the two big zip myself altogether and take the percentage that savings account\nSo how do you work for a big company that has a human resources department or payroll department is a tiny employer\nThis big big\nSort of is a big employer you can go to a human resources and say here's what I wanted to do I want to reduce my withholding each pay period by X number of dollars\nHundred two hundred or whatever and they'll just help you do that they'll help you change the will tell you fill out a new uh W. for\nIt and they'll reduce what you're having withheld and then you won't get that refund\nAnd that's what I recommend

there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean and what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa shots\nAnd correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages\nFrom Nancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's acted to cut that and then lying about their ... they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we had those protections for layers of it in our Republican health care bill\n... a lot of pent listen lying is just a part of it the playbook that the Democrats as always the same I even think it's gotten worse\nIn a look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting that took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and what is the media but now they're blaming Donald Trump port and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his strong support\nFor Israel including moving the capital to Jerusalem wearable along so well it's interesting I was so what is your take I mean how are people reacting I'm I assume you're getting a fortune of negative ads thrown at you and how are the people of Iowa reacting to it\nOh yeah I'm getting out and about four to one from my opponent and Nancy Pelosi and the superPACs out there so it's message versus money my opponent all her money is coming from from the east and the left the and the west coast a message over money and results right\nResults look what we have done with this economy on the national international stage as well or with the president and when it comes to sitting down with North Korea editing for nuclear is Asian or we would help or making sure that yeah we did move that\nEmbassy from Tel Aviv Israel prompts has kept and being a shining light on the hill or where there's a lot of dark is for a long time still is but the shining brighter we lead in the world others will follow\nA more prosperity and peace\nUm you'd want to go backwards that's how important this election is right now\nThink it's not a lot of things to get our voter look I take a vote for any Democrat and any district for four hundred and thirty five house seats up for grabs it was a vote for ... because your opponent will vote for Nancy Pelosi and vote with her I'm sure Ninety eight percent of the time just like in the Senate if you vote for any Democrat you're voting for sure\nUm to me a lot of it is you know look at the limitation of due process presumption of innocence during the Kavanaugh hearings\nYou end up Democrats is it's it's out there they want their crumbs back because they want the taxes the tax cuts that are putting a lot of money in the pockets of middle class Americans they want it back they want to eliminate eyes open borders they want to keep Obamacare and how they're running on health care is just\nThe definition of just or dash city considering they ... how many there are counties I read in Iowa that is seen two hundred percent increases in their premiums people lost their doctors and plans and they have one health care option that's it one provider that\nSaid yeah and and those that are paying it are paying twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year or their premiums their deductibles are so high\nThey can't even if they just risk and don't even go to a doctor but you're exactly right my opponent we had three opportunities to distance herself from Nancy Pelosi\nAnd she said she couldn't think of a an issue where they could be separated so what's that mean she's a rubber stamp for hopefully not a Speaker Pelosi but increasing taxes open borders doubling down on government run health care\nAnd of course what they've tried to keep under the rug shot and you know this and our listeners now this impeachment\nMhm now that an endless investigation but not into the deep state\nUm which of course you know we've seen massive abuses of power not rank and file FBI agents not rank and file a Justice Department and intelligence people but they do their job every day but just a few abusing power at the highest levels the upper echelon\nWell listen this is an important race it's on our top thirty we have the top Seventy races if you want to go to our interactive map at ... dot com and the most important house races that will tip the balance of power six days from now\nAnd one week from today we'll be talking about those results certainly David Young Iowa's third district is one of those important races we wish you the best in this race\nWe can't take anything for granted go to David Young for Iowa dot com to volunteer and help us make sure we keep the majority thank you Sean for all you do you\nBet welcome a ball the best to you and six days ah it's tough out there nobody can predict what certain say but I Will tell you they don't I I just there's something about um some things not clicking with me and I never\nYou never really have a feel for how the house is going to go twenty ten might be an exception\nWhere I mean it was a massive landslide and you could see it coming same thing I Would argue when Bill Clinton became president Nineteen Ninety four remember Republicans had been out of power for forty years that Newt Gingrich became the speaker of the house\nAnd also if you look at history and this is what Republicans are up against that forty five retirement and a headwind of history that usually the party in power loses a lot of seats in the first midterm but then like in the case of Bill Clinton it was Newt Gingrich in many ways Newt saving\nOf Clinton because things got better because Newt Gingrich forced Clinton into what led to balance budgets and and serious reforms in Washington\nAnd I think the same thing you know you go to a bomb I mean it was just a white powder and twenty to an app specially after Obamacare and ... you know the fact that Democrats are that that's their main talking point now I'm this is really fascinating to me this a brass meals some poll out today I had to go back and double check it\nShowing that African American support for the president has now hit an all time high of\nForty percent [noise] I mean that's a five hundred percent improvement\nIf you go back to election day twenty sixteen when he got eight percent of the African American\nPay Trump's approval ratings they is at its highest at this point in the fifty percent plus range\nAnd I think the highest level of support for any Republican going back to at least Dwight Eisenhower if not before and\nYou know the media likes to go after asked me to ... I don't know why is a great guy smart poster but\nYou know they say oh he's a right wing polling operation but I Do remind you that rats museum was the most accurate polling twenty sixteen [noise]\nSo if that is even close to forty percent that could have a profound impact on the midterm elections but again it's all up to now the interesting developments as relates to the issue of the caravan\nUm and I think some people have been over the top and what they've been saying about it it's a lot of distance between here and where they started at the southern border of Mexico\nAnd uh now you have and I look there's only see most people that come into this country illegally I think that most people come here because we are a land of milk and honey hope an opportunity and the American dream\nAnd when you live in poverty and countries that have little to zero opportunity and freedom it's very appealing to come to America now we're only asking that you do it legally only asking that you respect our laws are sovereignty our borders\nAnd I'd venture a guess that Ninety nine point eight percent of the people in that caravan want a better life and that they've been told that they're going to be able to get into America that's not going to happen [noise] the president's been very clear\nUm the left this meteor pushing a narrative that the thousands of of migrants\nAnd from Central America and elsewhere are fleeing violence in their homeland but in an interview with National Public radio on Monday the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some of the people some probably a tiny tiny percentage maybe clip point two percent\nOr you know last source our quarter reporting a cheap identified MS Thirteen members because of their tattoos that would give that'd be a give away\nUm but actually the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some I'm sure a tiny percentage is very violent now nobody can vouch for any one person that wants to cross the border\nWe're asking the people come here legally if we had a border wall we wouldn't have a risk of thousands of people at once coming across the border the president has sent fifty two hundred troops down there\nAnd he's not going to let them in North Canton he 'cause there'll be thousands and thousands behind them we don't have room to take it everybody we have a right as a country we have sovereignty\nOr nation built on a on a constitutional republic system the rule of law\nAnd we have border laws and we asked people respect our borders and our sovereignty and just come in legally and we have an opportunity to vet them and make sure that they are coming for the right reasons they can sustain themselves and they don't want to bring harm to our citizens that are already here\nI'm nearly according to one border officials telling the Washington Examiner three quarters of the caravan\nOr that is traveling through Mexico to the u._s. or adult man according to a senior border patrol officer telling the examiner families and unaccompanied children make up about twenty percent twenty to thirty percent of the caravan\nRoy of ... is the deputy chief patrol agent for the border patrol San Diego sector arrested that as a single adult males he goes on to say", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "31"}
