here\nOr loved the book Robert sure some of your background from where did your love of animals in research comes from\nI grew up with dogs and everything as a kid we had to always seem to have one so I've had a love of animals my whole life and horses are really also love never owned a horse but horses always carried a special place in my heart\nAnd to find these wonderful animals it has just been a fabulous fabulous journey my first book was on Sargent reckless\nThe great Korean War horse that served with the marine corps in Korea\nWhen I discovered her story and did her book I was actually able to get a medal for reckless called the ticking metal turns out that's the Victoria Cross for animals it's the greatest metal an animal can receive for gallon tree and bravery and so when I was discovering and doing the history and everything about metal I discovered all of these\nPhenomenal animals that received this metal in World War two\nAnd I just fell in love with their stories\nI really just hunker down and there's over Seventy animals in the book and to get their histories and stories and everything it was really quite fascinating and wonderful journey for me to learn so much great stuff that I had forgotten or never knew about from World war two\n... ... you know what you don't know [laughter] that's so true\nAnd you know what this down to me were truly was not only were the lord birds the Hitchens so her ... there's no way to account for the number of lives these animals said let their heroes but I guarantee you and I'm sure you can attest to any you'll never think of a pigeon as a rat with wings again\nAfter reading the book [laughter] from what\nI what I found fascinating with World War two was that we didn't have a war dog program at that time and so people

with US West point grad in front of my freedom contributor\nMatt Hayes about the nature of warriors are going to continue this conversation now hey welcome back Matt thanks very it's a pleasure to be you give us a quick review your timing mother army\nWow okay I started out kind of sneaking in under the wire at West point in the bombing summer of Nineteen eighty one I say to you know the wire because a lot of my classmates got their ... appointment through a congressman or senator and I sort of had an at large entry into the or the military academy but you know was able to uh\nFend for myself pretty well they're helping my classmates and I was able to get an armored slot was what I wanted so I ended up going to Germany for my first assignment to the ah three twelve cab which was uh divisional cavalry squad and the third Armored Division really enjoyed my time there\nBe a lot of good friends came back to the advanced course Fort Knox and then went straight down to Fort Stewart with a unit in ... and was deployed for the Gulf War and early summer of Ninety Ninety spent the next ten months in the tropical paradise of ah the middle east so\nAnd after that I came back I got out and went into explored the are the jobs scenario out outside the army you wanted to hang out with those civilian people there was a number of reasons for that but we'll get into that later but uh I think it was it was a good step\nFrom the gods must love civilians you made so many are struggling okay we're talking about warriors as we discussed last week with autumn sort of lawyers at every level of society and and as you pointed out a couple of times you out to be committed and focused as as you are to be a warrior we'll talk mostly military and again I don't want to ...\nThere certainly are first cousins and valor they put their lives on the line every day for people that don't even know many of them don't even like him so please don't take that as an exclusive but we're talking about people in uniform right everybody puts on the uniform better be prepared to become a warrior is that a fair statement\nYou know any of that is exactly what I was thinking as funny you should say that because to be a warrior you need to train to be a warrior I think inside a lot of us think of ourselves as warriors\nBut the men and women that are going into battle\nThey need to train every single day as closely as they can to replicate combat conditions because you never really know how you're going to react so the closer you can get to replicate those conditions and training day in and day out to be a\nWarrior and to know your enemy no the order of that all the more that you know the more you trust the people around you the better you're going to fight and I think that is true in any scenario in life whether you're in business or whether you were in sports\nBut especially when you're a warrior you have to train and you've got to know your equipment you got to know your friends\nAnd you got to know the enemy preparation is what you said and that is one of the keys to being a warrior I think\nWell and in business you and I could read competing for a contract and you were in it and I don't that's competition but it's not like a shot writes nonetheless it's no less the same thing and the people who joined the military may be they never deployed maybe there in the guard reserves are never activated\nBut they still have decided for whatever reason usually a multitude of reasons with our lives available to send the combat\nYou might be a medic or you might be a mechanic or you might be a finance clerk or you might be have a drummer you might be anywhere but in the military you ask what you want to take what you get and\nMy dad's best friend who served in World War two as a replacement guy in Europe said you come in and you're a mechanic\nWhen suddenly we need fifty to tank drivers you're now a tank driver [laughter]\nAh that might be how you were trained but here's what we need you the arms of limits for that the officer and so therefore if you put the uniform on you better be ready to be a warrior\nRegardless of what you're currently assigned does and that's I think a key issue this is going to let a Gilman front lines of freedom and we're discussing the nature of warriors with Matt ... then there are those who suddenly find themselves in a combat zone whether it's in a combat role or not\nI suspect that would appear motivation\nI Would hope so yeah I mean in in ... and that's a that's a bad place to be the it's a bad place to be in a combat zone but a non combat essentially non combat personnel and find yourself in a convoy that gets attacked I think unfortunately\nMany people don't feel they're ever going to be in close combat situation but if your deployed to a\nCombat theater operations you need to sort of get your mind wrapped around that warrior spirit and say we can be attacked at any time perhaps even by civilians for whatever reason so you always have to be on top of your game and uh the again\nPreparation and I think the mindset of being a combat or your that's the biggest thing to be prepared for anything\nYeah I think the Marines have a sort of a model or something that says everybody's whenever I don't care what you are your primary thing is you're also an advertisement that attitude would carry then there are those who conduct combat artillery\nFighter pilots those kind of people who attacked the enemy but don't do it personally [noise]\nAnd then there are the people were close combat people's infantry armor special ops type people who potentially go face to face with the enemy those are sort of different levels\nBut all of them need that warrior mindset and all of them sort of need to be prepared to be anywhere\nOf different levels but all of them need that warrior mindset and all of them sort of need to be prepared to be anywhere in that spectrum right\nYeah I Love the or the marine mindset is that they train everybody to be a fighter and then after that okay you can go and be an electrician or a cooker because they need everything but all those and all that says they all know how to fight\nVery similar to the Israelis everybody has to be good script into the army men and women so they teach everybody how\nTo be in uniform how to be a soldier and how to fight and protect the country and then you can go back to civilian life and be an accountant or a salesperson or an inventor or whatever but everybody has a taste of what it's like to surf and to be in the military and to protect the country to important\nYeah it's really important for us it's more likely to motivate you to do that if you have seen your school get attacked by a rocket or something like that then you're in the United states given that the warriors spirits a warrior attitude is something that everybody in our military needs\nIs something that needs to be appreciated understood and even replicated by we citizens because none of us protect we want to be victims either so that's something that is transferable to the civilian world though not only aggressive sense right\nYeah I think it's important for civilians to recognize the level of commitment and the level in the intensity and sometimes violence that the military has\nBut they need to also understand that we are just people just like they are we're not different kinds of people we're just dedicated ourselves to a life of protecting the country and to do that you have to be willing not only to sacrifice physically\nBut also to be prepared to be very violent and that takes a toll on people you see all the pie TST coming back from the latest wars in Afghanistan and Iraq\nAnd I think there are people in our society they think that we love the violence and we're out there just to kill people and stuff that's the farthest thing from the truth I mean we come back damage from what we have to go through and what we have to do and I think it's so important to realize that war especially close combat takes a toll on everyone that's involved we talked about the difference between men and women last week\nI think one of the key things about men for better or for worse is that we were able to sort of compartmentalize things yes and in the middle of a battle your body gets shot you do not have time degree not even a second you know the guy that pick him off got his crosshairs right on you so what are you going to do to get out of this position and make things right\nAnd you know it might be weeks or even months later before that comes back into your mind and all of a sudden you find yourself breathing so there's\nThere's an intense emotional toll that it takes on a person to be in combat but that whole has got to be later it can't be in a moment\nAnd that's all part of the nature of the warrior right there is a lot more to discuss about this and folks aren't going to have an Matt back on regularly as we pursue the definition of the idea of a warrior\nMatt thank you for taking time to join us today thank you for your service to our country thanks for being part of the front lines of

said oh that's not good for the car um you know at one point I drove straight through leaving Orlando at about eleven o'clock at night [noise]\nEnded up in New Jersey and about three o'clock four o'clock in the afternoon and my girlfriend's father said that's really not good for the engine said wait really why he said well the oil that that's not good for the oil at all\nAnd this has been plaguing me for probably twenty five years now does the oil he he implied that maybe the oil needed some kind of arresting period\nThat deriving for Seventeen hours with the ... the oil so you should

spot went back there\nYou know thirty minutes forty minutes later and it just wouldn't start it would spin but it just didn't seem like it was getting spark so I\nGet under the hood I'm I'm pretty uh mechanically inclined so I tested out the coil I thought it was bad I replaced it replace a spark plugs and wires out there that some other things to think still one star so I took a thrift shop just the kind of helped me out the guys at the shop came back with a\nA estimate that said five now the thirty dollars and Seventy\nThey yeah they were basically replacing the entire\nEngine or [laughter]\nYeah ... and they they told me that it was just a really nice and you know whenever he disagrees he had compression\nValues that he gave me and stuff like that well here's the funny part so as I'm going out to take the\nCar I'm actually brought a trailer it again I truly that they're bringing a trailer to pick a ... I'm just looking at them with\nKey and I said hey let's just get one one good luck shot here\nGo there like starts up like it\nFor a while and they had problems with the meeting surfaces between the head gas gets in the heads there was a cracked block that would occur and oil leak in and it was that was something that was pretty well known on those but it wasn't it wouldn't lead to what you're having happen and yeah it does now\nWhat's funny is that about five days and it's rod in every single time I've been using the car you know not taking it on a trip this thing is\nRight and like it did before and you know there's there's always been a little league cotton this car I Would say maybe five little drops a quarter of a teaspoon night you know kind of thing but not nothing\nBig and yeah it's been running so like I said I replace the oil and the whole distributor family there and it's been running you know like a\n... I I started to stand on well any\n... Ross let's assume for a second this repair shop was not completely trying to rip them off yeah I just didn't start and when it didn't start like he's been having trouble with maybe it finally got her annual it got full fuel to where it was just washed out and the compression was off so they said hey you're gotta you gotta compression issue is engine\nNeeds to be replaced it's going to cost five thousand bucks well that sounds realistic\nIn that case I Would have said there's no way I'm spending that much money on this older car I'm going to go the Kurdish part dot com and pick up a used ... ... if you wanted to keep the car going that'd be a great thing to do that so what do you do it or if you wanted to keep it going but now that it started I'm going to say well\nHey it starts in runs perfect there's no way I had a compression problem and then now I don't I think we've got an electrical thing going on where we are not well obviously we're firing you inject or is that we've gotten a few in the flooded out and make it ... you know spin like that without compression\nPistons assuming somebody was not completely trying to rip them off for that position was vegetable that I've actually got a new story that\nYou don't want to hear that will make you very angry ... small for some people out there that do that kind of stuff and they get so hard for everybody trying to do it right and I I just I don't know of any personally that I've seen it over a decade federal while so that I just want to read the news story while okay I'll do\nBut I think it's got an electrical thing we're going to find it the next time it doesn't fire we're\nGoing to find out do we have spark do we have fuel I'm almost that and we're going to find we don't have sparked and it's going to have to be diagnosed and even if you replace the whole distributor assembly which is a huge problem on those cars\nAre we went through you remember that one car which and we went through like five three ... three at least at least three distributors before we got a good one new ones brand new that we're supposed to be quality parts so they fail and they have repeat failures often you gotta make sure you got a good quality\nI Would for fun district just because I'd be got curious person may be on this deal\nHas the right of compression test on it now that it's running yeah yeah yeah yeah and just confirmed that the engineers healthy\n'cause a hundred and Seventy thousand miles and that's the big engine is not and done and you know what right I'm betting that shop that got that look on their face that uh if you still you know given the benefit of the doubt they might actually do a free compression test for it just to see 'cause I knew in ... I mean I Would if somebody went like that is you know I Can't believe I missed that I Want to see why they pick is\nYeah we're human things having to wait that vehicle wanted our vehicles that are out a recycling\nFacility that will start and they've gotten to Russia service Centre and we found out just the opposite that they had gotten flushed with fuel\nAnd it doesn't happen a lot but they'd gotten such people ran through um they just they they just had no compression left and so they were able to drain everything out and let it sit with the plugs out for a little bit and turn it over and and she came back to life\nRemember when I parked on a on a friday and a Memorial Day weekend and it had no compression the plugs we're out nice\nShe came back to life I can remember when I parked on a on a friday and a Memorial Day weekend and it had no compression the plugs route nice stuck him back in and I said we're going to push it outside because it it's going to be junk it's going back to our recycling center\nWhere just check it out it was wrecked a car and uh the tectonics started up because what was wrong with this new one\nOh one [laughter] and we checked it and ... pretty rough this isn't a will to how this thing without which we see that as well a long time ago we check to begin with a so key ... that we need to really look at this so\nEd thanks very much for the call good luck eight six six five nine for for one five oh let's talk to Jeff Jeff you're on the end of the ... what can we do for you\nOr ... or ... or do it in a radio in the car you know think quit a couple of years ago and\nA few look I didn't know if there's any other additional here beside the radio is that makes them think or I mean if it were my friends are complaining I don't ever ready to go\nTwo thousand and eight Ford super duty I Believe the radio circuit only has the one few is okay and some of the GM cars they run an accessory fuse that does one part and then they run another fused does another part on some of the GM vehicles but\nThe rest of doing that thinking look too if you can think of any else is there on the Ford is there anything else on the radio circuits well the ... circuit could come into play\nI'm for my first thought is I'm going with the [noise] the radio piece of it I'm going with the\nGM thing where we've got two circuits and you'll Ford's yes but we're seeing more and more vehicles now that you were correction and they have one\nPower circuit just like your home computer has one power plug now if you don't get it will keep its software in there because it does have a built in power supply backing it up a lot of these radios are going to hard drives and different things but yes you can disconnect them for like two years before they'll lose all their memory\nSo yeah a lot of them just have the one circuit in their benefits losing memory I have seen some radios that we have had to replace in the last couple of years now in about seven or eight right in there when they switched to the started putting newer design radios in some with\nMore features they're not feature radio or whether it's each the radio or my linked with the GM and Ford Scott sink and things like that and those radios\nYeah there you turn the key if they're like I if I turn the key for two days I lose all my stations but if I just drive it every day is fine and that's and in the radio you have\nGiven that it's completely dead I mean that's how ... how do you know there was an hour and a lot I mean I Know a couple of years here friends you care about yeah I Know I'm a big heart and\nTell them to bring their tell them to bring their own radio and just you know headphones and tune in because you wouldn't want free radios going at the same time\nOh sure yeah I'd say fuck I\nThanks very much for the call you can just be like my kids in where headphones all the time the constantly or what have headphones on in the car and you're listening debt not me it's not safe so we we got a when they're sitting in I don't mean when they're dry oh I mean I'm driving a narrow\nWe've got a a customer that I said hey you're radios bad it's just raining your battery in it and you're as recalls for bad as like you you you're going to replace these things as unless you just don't care about the radio and we just won't put it in we'll just\nWouldn't be a rotation on and I and I'm Glad you said that rotational thing because in my head\nI I get that I'm I'm I can feel in my head rotational clunk versus\nJust a clump of like a golf ball hitting the back of the cab big and and they're different sounds if you listen to the vehicle we have these things that we call by the order and the orders are you know first or second or third order when you're going down the road your\nYou know your engine is turning at let's say two thousand rpm\nAnd if it's in direct drive your dry shaft is turning it two thousand rpm\nThat doesn't mean you're wheels are turning at that speed because if you've got a\nFour like say a four to one rear end you know you're turning around the dry chef four times for every one time of the wheels so if you're click as you move forward goes click\nClick click and that's equal to one two three revolutions of a tire that'd be like a first order slick if it's going click click click click so four times for every one time that we all goes around you know what's in your\nDrive line and we listened for those kinds of things in a a trained mechanic over the years will start to pick that up and they'll say that's a CD chef click that is not a tire shift or are tired noise or ... you know drive shaft or whatever it is they can pick those things up very interesting\nGlenn thanks very much for the call good luck eight six six five nine for for one five ... let's talk to Bruce\nVery interesting Glenn thanks very much for the call good luck eight six six five nine for for one final let's talk to Bruce Bruce you're on the end of the show what can we do for you\n[laughter] [noise]\nSix Chevrolet [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] right [noise] [noise] [laughter]\n\n[noise]\nYeah well the the way that said we use the computer just said that you need to plug it scanned tool in and it'll say um\nIt'll say distributor offset and it's zero degrees on those so it's there's the computer handles everything so you want to zero so what you do as you started up unless they it says plus Thirteen that's enough to turn to check ins and lay down so what you'll do at that point is you'll move the distributor the direction needed to go back toward zero\nMove it there then tightening down start the vehicle up read the scanner again and if it says plus to shut it back off move the distributor just to hear more\nTightened it up fired up until the the\nEngine read zero you don't need the disconnect and then you just do that until the offset says\nZero if you have advanced or retarded a little bit they actually call that now instead of a distributor high voltage switch it's just really which plug it goes to if it's off a little the engine may run really well but it'll burn a distributor capping Roeder up quickly so that's why they want that\nPerfectly zero so that's how you set it you need a of a scandal\nDon't have to be scared of that scandal thing it doesn't have to be a really fancy one that can be one picked up at your local auto parts store\nThey can be picked up for as little as fifty two hundred bucks for some of the basic ones that just read basically will be
