you wanted to buy tickets to most anything in the United states you have to go through the ticket master monopoly and with the added on has no relationship at all to the cost of the infrastructure\nIs

plans are Seventy five to Ninety five dollars a month so visible is only forty dollars a month taxes and fees included again\nOnly for iPhones right now they say they're going to bring availability for androids but only for iPhones for horizon name as not anywhere to be found\nAround visible they don't want anybody to know that it's them not it is that is that it's their network and so it's at forty to one gotcha with their forty a month\nIs that the speeds that you'll have when you're on high speed data will not be as fast as they are on parent ...\nThat's true uh and I've been reading some accounts and people on line they say that it hasn't been too much of an issue for them they're still able to watch Youtube videos without buffer ring and still able to get around the Internet pretty quickly\nBut there is that is a a compromise with this plan and also with some of the other ones you might be slowed down a little bit so you want to read through the fine print to know that you are paying less but you may be getting a little bit slower\nService and the biggest difference between the horizon visible and cricket and a metro buy T Mobile and the booze is how many stores is the invisible and\nAll they really are invisible there's no stores it's all done through an app\nThat's right you download the app you'd sign up for the service there you pay through that everything and that's really much more how cell phone service has done elsewhere in the world with\nFor the service there you pay three that everything and that's really much more how cell phone service is done elsewhere in the world without a relying on a big network or stores or cricket\nIs suddenly a Eighteen tease second tier brand has now been exposed that they weren't up to the standards of the others so they made some changes yeah\nUh what cricket did cricket has to unlimited plans\nAnd there really hasn't been much of a change to the cheaper one it does restrict your speeds and that's a compromise that they think a lot of people might not be comfortable with but it's a really great type price point or fifty dollars a month for one line but for for lines it's a hundred dollars a month so that's still a really good deal and it was you know John ... says no it's all included\nAre now they're\nMore expensive plan they used to have a limitation on speed as well but that's now been removed so four fifty five dollars a month with auto pay you're getting really fast unlimited plan on Eighteenth T's network\nAnd the reason it's fifty five is there is a grudge match of hate\nBetween a TNT and John ledger the guy from T Mobile bay hate each other teams he tried to have him arrested in Las Vegas a few years ago at CBS they I mean it is like a blood feud like Hatfield McCoys so\nThe mobile came out with the metro buy T Mobile it sixty so then cricket said well we're going to go fifty five exactly so the competitions great and you've got all this explain were charts and all that\nWe've got it all laid out so all the all these plans you can read side by side and then you can go and also compare them to the big four forest plans to see is saving that extra twenty dollars a month or so is going to be worth it for you and you can deal with some of the the gotcha has that come with all of these unlimited plant\nAnd now we moved to a marketplace where there are now three tiers of service\nThere's the second tier companies we've talked about and now there's a third tier of ultra cheap companies that come with a lot of things you've got to be willing to work with and we have those laid out for you at Clark dot com as well with those plans starting at as little as ten dollars a month\nFor bona fide real cell phone service with I'm not a huge amount of data but\nSome data yeah\nWell thank you and I appreciate how you stay on top of this because is there ever a week that goes by that cell phone ... plans don't change\nNo they're changing multiple times a week and we're staying on top of it all its own clock dot com\nThank you very much John joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi John\nHi color [laughter] ... how are you do talk to you great to have you\nGuys doing well I'm an avid listener and glad to be on um\nHad a question for you though which is it seems like you're favoring one of your children are vanguard you continue to call them the the lowest cost provider the low cost provider um\nWell actually I Am I have favorite children and so it's hard to pick you know it's like a parent's arrest you know you got\nYou got these these four kids which twins really your favorite why don't have any favors [laughter] now you're you're doing that to me with investing so tell me who it is you feel like I'm dissing\nFidelity you've mentioned on your show they have to you know widely diversified funds mutual funds that have come out they have a ton of really low cost\nI have to you know widely diversified funds mutual funds that have come out of\nA ton of really low cost no transaction fee each yes or no minimum account minimum to start um they've really kind of blazed the trail of lowest cost in my opinion\nYeah zero's that has such a brilliant marketing campaign around the fidelity zeroes which have no commission and no ongoing fees that they absorb all the fees\nI think this is absolutely great fidelity is done fidelity let me tell you why this came about fidelity had found itself steadily losing market share\nTo uh not just vanguard but also to the bigger player out there that most of the United states don't pay a lot of attention to black rock\nAnd so the two of them were taking all the market share their was out there\nSo fidelity coming up with the new product development zero has set down a marker that no one can say they're not the cheapest because obviously fidelity at no cost is offering a better deal than anybody else\nAnd so they have the total stock market index which is thousands of U.S companies\nAll in one investment at no fees at all and then the international index fund which just thousands of international stocks of free so\nA fidelity is in the game solid you know what else they've done\nWhat's that\nSo fidelity used to have relatively high cost target retirement funds\nAnd now they have two flavors up them they have an extremely low cost series of a target retirement funds and then they have their old one that still has very high costs will not high costs but a higher than a low cost companies should be offering\nSo they have become much more aggressive on the front and so do you invest with fidelity and you wonder why always talking about vanguard or were you trying to figure between the two\nSo I've invested with Fidel itty and just kind of comparing costs and I also kind of was invested in their ecosystem through the two percent cash back card\nGood for you explain that because a lot of people don't know that fidelity offers one of the two best credit cards and America\nYeah they two percent cash back on every every purchase you run through some I think it's underwritten by a separate bank but um you get two percent cash back deposited into any of your identity account\nSo that he has managed that kind of a cow or they're going to be an IRA right or a college savings plans exactly yeah\nSo so you want to know why do I always talk vanguard vanguard vanguard when Fidel and he's doing all this good stuff\nExactly on a number of calls it seemed like people were you know asking which way to go and you kind of lean towards telling them vanguard and I was just struck by that\nAnd so ah I should not be offending\nFidelity 'cause they do a great job a Schwab does a great job I mean these companies are huge companies and they've all become lower costs but vanguard really set\nThe pattern and set the tone and took the market share and that's why they are the ones that created the pressure in the marketplace\nMaybe that's a sentimental thing but I ... you're probably right I should be talking about that fidelity is well now offers a series of ultra cheap choices for investing\nThanks for bringing it to my attention you're listening to the Clark

right now that's that's how I Do it yeah\nHow did you guys pick you know health and because you've had isn't Ideas Festival essentially\nDid you settle on health and happiness and talking about death and yeah ocean and I'm kind\nOf it it's such a weird way how we ended up where we are whatever we think we're going to do at the beginning of the years and never what happens at the end\nUh we kinda we do pull at the end of each Ideas Festival and say what's the big thing that keeps you up at night what are you really want to talk about so that's you know last year we did criminal justice North Dakota's kind of at the forefront of of changing how we look at that type of stuff um of course we did a Pulitzer Prize with like fake news that's been in the [noise]\nThe mindset of the country a lot um and so I think people are just like we have to talk about health care and happiness and so while you know we can't really you know sitting and talking about health care policy isn't fun but we can do the humanities portion or or like let's talk about the big questions\nThat you might not necessarily like start off with when you you know going to the bar and you're having a drink we like to do our thinking drinks but\nSometimes we want to pick something that's like a really big scary scope but then we we bring in people like Caitlin doty\nAnd um she has like a great Web series called ask him where titian and she's really good at taking something scary and making it a little bit fun if you can if you can do\nThat asked more to shiny yeah follow her on Facebook and they think are Facebook pages on\nA order like a good death yeah so she started this whole kind of movement where I mean they're not like yes All right that's right but just kind of embracing\nUm her big thing is you know and for a lot of us in North Dakota when the pioneers didn't have you know a funeral home to go to when somebody passed on and so\nYou know we had a lot of rituals that we used to do ourselves I mean even my mom was saying the people who started the farm all their kids are and varied and the tree road like and you know nothing formal like it is now so\nShe really wants people to kind of started thinking about how do we have bring back some of these very close to\n... to kind of it's a it's a much more personal yeah I'm not in a way yeah and to keep it from being so um [noise]\nClosed off it I guess because of that like I wouldn't mind asking him more titian some question I mean I really thought about it but I'm like hey what happens when freight something and and you know super open about it so someone will type\nAnd it'd be like hey my grandmother had a hip replacement and then the cremated or what happened\nAnd then she'll like show you what it looks like I mean so some people it ends up in like bottom great kind yeah yeah so it might be like a little creepy to some people but she's really like it we shouldn't be like mystified by this because it's at one very scientific and then it's also very emotional so she kind of try to find that balance\nFinally an soda it's yeah I mean especially it's October in the mood I wear my Halloween shirt today LA
