blah blah because I saw it it's going to do all these miraculous things and suddenly I'm going to look like those people on the TV and addition to curing white males me\nAnd so the perspective I've gotten from physicians is that we're the problem\nMore than anything else and we're allowing ourselves to be to influence by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but it's also it's important to remember that at this point\nIn the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic patients in healthcare terms which means they've got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said I Want drug X Y Z and I'm not gonna take no for an answer [noise]\nA lot of doctors will simply write the script\nJust to get things moving along and that's\nKinda why the drug industry now puts more money into marketing than it does into research because they know what's the effective and they don't need to get everybody demanding a prescription med or a brand name at what they need to get it's just a a significant\nNumber to make it defensible and justifiable and keep you in the brand name fold and that's where part of the problem is\nAnd let's also underlined disappoint Clark and that is there are only two nations in the entire world that allows so called direct to consumer advertising a prescription drugs in that house\nAnd New Zealand and that's it\nEvery other country especially developed countries like us have looked at that practice and said no we see that is doing more harm than good because let's face it these decisions are meant to be made by trained license to health care professionals and not\nAmateurs like you and me and everybody listening and therefore it doesn't serve the public interest to do that\nThey're professionals and not amateurs like you and me and everybody listening and therefore it doesn't serve the public interest to do that in fact\nThe American Medical Association has called for an editor this practice because they said it's just inflating drug prices and hearing people into expensive treatment regimens there would be much cheaper alternatives for\nSo is it best what you and I can do is we can't change that a momentum\nWe're not that powerful sorry\nChanged that momentum so we've got to draw back to basics and that is at the core most of us are going to do just fine with the generic mad that already exists for a condition that ails us\nI think that's absolutely true I think also people need to be more open minded to the idea that their doctor when they come back at you with\nA idea that well there is a generic or there was an alternative drug you might want to explore this cheaper or covered by your insurance you certainly want to listen because this is somebody who's read all of the academic papers and on all of the research that you haven't done so yeah you want to listen to that person\nAnd I would also encourage people to wait till they were elected representatives because indeed if we do want to try to bring the drug industry focused once again on curing ailments as opposed to moving product\nGetting rid of these direct to consumer ads would be a big step in the right direction because that's\nBillions of dollars that would therefore be redirected backing to Laurie useful endeavors such as basic research and wouldn't require me to explain to my son what he he is one or watching sports together on TV [laughter]\nFast\nThing you said was that [laughter] was gosh I Can't get pass you never knew explain that to your side anyway the best\nThing you said is that there are now spending more money on this marketing than they're spending on are indeed to actually make drugs that will improve people's lives and that is a real miss direction a national wealth\nTo have all that money going to the ads and so don't mind them change your mind don't make those ads influence what you are going to consult with your doctor about\nIn fact even pay attention to those ads because let's face it they are not imparting a sufficient amount of information for you to make an informed decision and therefore they're not worth your time\nFor David Lazarus from the Los Angeles times thank you so much for joining us and you keep that passion and by the way how did you explain

situation\nThat cause us to take a look at our auto insurance because we ah we added another car we'd had really looked at it in a while\nTo kind of realize we might be paying too much for auto insurance and we started looking at our policy and we're kind of trying to figure out where we can save money with where everything's set out as far as our coverage so are we are going to be adding a six sixteen and Seventeen year old son onto the policy within the next six months\nSo we're going to be adding a six sixteen and Seventeen year old son under the policy within the next six months\nOh oh oh oh I\nJust add your wallet just take that not even stab your wallet a lot you know 'cause that's what happens when you get a teen driver on your insurance\nYes yeah we're lucky enough though that we didn't have to buy the car\nTrue so or saving money there\nAny of the cars you have old enough that you can avoid taking a coalition and comprehensive on that vehicle\nYes and that's a matter of trying to sell that to my wife but that was the one of the first officer had along with um raising our deductibles\nYeah well I'm a ... fan and raising the doctor both okay and try to raise those to a thousand that's usually if you're going to have any vehicle you have has alone that may be the max here allowed to raise it to\nOkay with that helps and you were five hundred now so\nThe I sort of raise it to the thousand because you don't want to make a five hundred a claim on something between five hundred thousand dollars anyway because the insurer will just eat you up on premiums so you want to avoid that and then how old are your vehicles\nAre our oldest vehicle as a ... for\nYeah you only want to have liability on that one\nYeah that's okay I thought so I was thinking too or the other two are newer I we have a two thousand Fifteen in the car we just got his uh two thousand and four seats so\nYour teenager needs to be driving they owe for if your wife or permit that\nYes I don't know how much longer we're going to have the ... but yes that's going to be the one that is going to spend the most timing for sure\nSo as you are in this case there may be an advantage in talking with an independent agent\nOkay that you know something people really don't do any more but there are ... agents that are like free agents and they quote various insurance companies\nAnd they'd been there done that for a long time most of them are older because a lot of young people have no interest in becoming\nAn insurance agent and they're very experience and can tell you based on how rates are set in your state and situations they've done with the new drivers were teenagers what's gonna be the thing that will get you the best overall total premium okay great\nSometimes depending on the state and how rates tend to be set in the state it may be a advantageous to have\nYour son is the owner of that vehicle over there and be on a separate policy and then in other places it may be better for him to only be named an additional driver with no specific vehicle assigned to him\nPerfect that have ads where the independent agent becomes so valuable because they know\nHow best to quote it and they can quote from many different companies\nThere are some winner known as direct writer companies the ones that you probably see pretty heavily advertised on TV they will not commission and independent agent and so the agent will not be able to quote those but they'll have enough\nDifferent companies they can quote to you that they'll be able to guide you best\nPerfect perfect yeah we've got some numbers already from friends that are on down that path that it seems like it'd be very helpful to have somebody specific a self us\nYou've got to make sure they're not what they called a captive agent for example State Farm and all state the agents that right for them or what are known as captives they only ran for those companies\nFor example State Farm and all state the agents that right for them or what are known as captives they only write for those companies and independent agent is not assigned to a specific company and they can quote many different

what are we going to do for winter weather houses\nWells I'm going to be here once a quarter next time is going to be in January and by that time were already going to be knee deep in it\nYeah it'd be too late to talk about what to do to prevent it that's right that's right so if you have a question for Mike if you have questions three twelve Seventy six six three twelve sudden if you have a question for you ... minutes this dude no system a few does don't go in and asked him a question\nWell I don't know what topics you'll take like besides causing but\nWell you know I've been to England specter for nine years and I've seen the good the bad and the ugly so if I'm\nNot talking about me when he talks about the ugly I'm just\nSo as you close to me [laughter]\nAnd uh you know the thing is is that um winters always kind of a stressful time on a on a property you know I'm due to temperature and ice yeah it's really hard to do anything out or when it's actually hitting yeah so I think one of the things that we shouldn't\nAbout here is just preparing for the winter and of course everybody take off your host\nAt a buy a new rules yeah I'm a ... a ... that's what happens is that that freezes down into that um\nLine within that wall so then when you actually turn on the water to sprinkle your flowers than it floods out your whole basement and that's kind of a you know bad sprints fries\nFights or if I don't have a boss free frost free shave fs are denied off frost free five ... who are on my home what do I do\nOptions they do have um phone covers that can be a put over the top of your faucet um they it cat attaches to the handle and then the\nThe phone will go into place and then there's that little slider that will hold it into place and some houses actually have a a water shut off to actually shut off that water be able to dream that off I'm kind of depending on the age of the property and and that kind of history you\n... if I turn it off open themselves up outside during and after all go back to him off but again I don't know I I kind of leave it open a little just a little bit so if there's anything in there it would come up but that that works\nAt a and one of the things that I have also come across is a fast it's that don't fully closed settled drip and of course one of the things that that in the winter um it freezes up and then it'll still ... your ... so I'm\nGoing to ... make sure that what you're turning off inside the house is all the way off ... y you open on the outside\nFor what what you see if it keeps draining\nYou haven't turned it off when you can monitor it and see if there's any issues and and such a case so occasionally you see someone who will get like a\nA plastic uh on one side insulation you know like you rap a mobile home water line with um middle wrapped around their faucet gang what do you think of that\nI you know um [noise]\nI guess it's okay you know if as long as you're you're keeping the heat from the house\nHelping to where I met up there is you know he tape which you know in mobile homes that's one of the things that we want to kind of keeping in mind he tape is only good for you know eight\nYears so we want to make sure that we are are going through checking the heat tape a lot of heat tape has a thermostat on it that will turn on at fifty degrees so when you're calling underneath and then you have to wait until it's colder\nAnd then just put your hand on it and and feel it and you should feel that uh he tape from Wyoming your hand\nAnother way that you can tell whether or not he tape is working and the property is when you turn on the cold water\nIt should be warm um\nThat would tell you that the water supply is again warm um when it gets cold then of course that's one of those things I'm In the house so if we have a really strong cold front that comes through really cold winter um\nWinds and stuff on the outside walls if you're concerned about your pipes freezing underneath there and didn't open up your cabinets\nAnd help get that room air warming up your your um blinds energy just sinks and be a good way of of maintaining that and then also if you're concerned about five pipes freezing in a trailer than just let the water drip\nThrough your faucets because that will move that water from the ground to keep the the pipes open\nSwim one time when the dripping faucet as a good idea [laughter] that's true [laughter] [noise] very well\nSo then I'm also when we start getting into a called we have servants that are frozen up I don't know if anyone spending that's a\nIssue you know if you think back and you've gotten a ... that the ice cap on the sewer event right one of the ways of fixing that is to go ahead and take a a copper pipe I'm about an inch and then a measure that\nPut that down in your your sewer event until the first band and then lifted up about six inches mark\nThat caught it and then\nUh you can put a tea on top of that with an extension on the hands so then it'll actually hang in that serve and that copper will heat with the um the heat of the addict and keep a servant to open up the river trick yeah yeah\nSo I kind of keep that in mind if you're not comfortable sweat soldering than um the hardware stores do have a where you don't have to to live at the salt and a soccer or anything like that it's just ready to go you just hit it with the torch it melts that that side are in place so it's really easy to work with\nOr you could talk to a local contractor to us is that if you're if you're not a reformer yeah we had a\nGreat uh another good so good to have not heard them for Oh thank you know excellent\nYeah and then um you know we can also talk about you know while you're up very clean the gutters\nYou know that's one of the things that that can really cause issues with ice damage and stuff like that and now here's an interesting conversation\nI found that the um the leaf guards that you put on top of your gutters although it's great for leaves unfortunately is not very good for ice damning because it holds water freezes and then it'll start working its way underneath their shingles\nSo in the last couple of years they've come out with uh the requirement that you have to put ice shelves down for the first two feet of your\nOf your a shingles when you put on your rough [noise]\nIf you're rough is older than that then ice damning can be a a real issue for you\nNow one of the things that you can do is just take you know nylons or socks or whatever like that or if you have aluminum gutters not what galvanize both women um factors\nGo ahead and put a little bit of rock salt in there and then put that in the gutter and then that will melt the ah the face or you see a nice feeling for no right you do it in that spot put that in there and then you'll be able to make sure that that's clear or if you wanted to be more\nProactive which you can do is they do see how he court anywhere between twenty feet ... feet and you can run that in the gutter a on a zigzag pattern on your shingles that way a dead heat will melt that uh ice damage kind of keeping\nThe wrong idea seems better it's cheaper yeah the gutter cord really works well and uh this perfect time of course to hang your Christmas lights because it's still warm\nThat's a good idea grid and if you're thinking you might want to do the good record will do that while you're in your lights and the way you go when it's warm and fuzzy Earl are fascinating and other\nAnother good use for that got record is in valleys or where you have like an ice build up and such like that where it's not moving through just ... get to that valley and that'll help keep them\nYou do you know um that is a good general idea of what radon levels are near property inside of that envelope is a piece of charcoal um and then when you uh\nExpose it to air for forty eight hours you seal it up it's inside of a lead based a bad line down the slope you stand that in and then they put that in a Geiger counter and then they'll give you an overall average of what your house was\nProfessionals have a raid on a monitor which will take two samples per half hour for forty eight hours so we're able to tell the movement of Iran on and tell whether or not it's a low pressure system that suggesting it or not\nI'm a ... and in my field for real estate transactions I'd also test for temperature barometric pressure and humidity\nThe benefit of that not only can I tell whether or not as low pressure system that's come through I can also tell whether or not the property has been tampered with if the windows got opened so I'm evacuating the rate on levels it's it's one of those things\nAnd that's why it's best to test in the wintertime because you do have a house that sealed up for the most part other than normal\nAnd I've got a correct yeah you're not opening up the windows to air it out and and and such and again that whole theory of of the ground freezing and your house turned into a big huge tax bill will traditionally raise rates\nSo and also while we are talking about safety and health um carbon monoxide\nIs one of those big dogs that we need to kind of talk about here in the winter\nI strongly suggest having carbon monoxide detector is no matter what the age of your furnace carbon monoxide is lighter than air but not as hot air so I strongly suggest having a carbon monoxide detector in your sleeping areas in the hallway about a foot from the ceiling\nSo that way it goes that room or for the hot air to kind of settling there\nI'm kitty doesn't nice battery operated one that has a monitor on it that will show you at twenty parts per million an alert you at Seventy parts per million that way and no you know if you're getting a little fuzzy headed if it's a killer the carbon monoxide and\nOne of his or her level of carbon monoxide everybody sells\nTraditionally not should not be there shouldn't be so so if you see one of those and you see a reading on it mhm you you should ever checked out should\nYou should wait for it to get you to start falling out [laughter] that's just a few suspect you have carbon monoxide who tests but how can you find out for sure\nWell I you know the fire department would be able to help you with that and you can contact you know me I Do have professional carbon monoxide detector or heating and cooling professional would be able to come through and and check out your your furnace um\nTo see what kind of condition that's in one of the ways of of kind of\nGathering information on your own as when you're furnaces running go ahead and take off the cover um there'll be like the top cover such where you can actually see the combustion chamber and you should see mostly blue flame\nIf you see a lot of orange flame then that's an indicator that the furnace needs to be cleaned\n'em carbon monoxide comes from the um that's incorrect combustion in your furnace from ... heat exchange or where that is a metal partition intact a separate the combustion area from the room here moving through your property\nTractor through there and then it actually

I've had enough this is insane\nThat rhetoric the left wing rhetoric be attacks verbal attacks calling for basically violets your Eric Holder the former attorney general the United states\nCalling for

real devices I'm ... and if that's true um were a lot better off nobody's going to get hurt but I find it really suspicious\nThat you've had eight or nine that these things so far and usually the trigger mechanism for these devices is the actual opening of the package well there's been several open and none of them have detonated which tells me\nThere is some sort of problem so I'm hoping they're not real um and I hope and the the authorities find them sooner than later I think\nThe ... billion we had to go search go because they have so much now forensic evidence here I'm assuming you know we we talked about this yesterday that none of this is easy but I'm I'm assuming by now they probably have their eyes on somebody\nAbsolutely absolutely I said yesterday you'll have you know probably twenty four to Seventy two hours a day in and I stand by that ... there's an ... month some enormous amount of evidence\nThat they've been able to capture because these things did not detonate and I think we'll see something so All right Dr ... word today\nThe bottom line is we run these people to ground we released the plot how we throw the book of them but it doesn't matter what side you're on the the responsibility for the normalization of violence\nAs started on the left when you have an a former attorney general who worked for President Obama say when they're down you kick them when you have Hillary Clinton say we're going to be civil off the we win the election nobody on the rise says that it's a less responsibility for the normalization of five and I want to\nIn Gorka congrats by the way our new new bestseller why don't you fight the feeding America is a enemies with no apologies and over and YPG commissioner Bernie Carrick you also wrote the grave above\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are and I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's\nReally strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate\nAnd so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today are meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with them when they count so you know I don't like to count on naming of post offices a procedural vote\nAnd I'm not ... well let's talk about the votes where he Donald Trump really could have you on his boat health care being one\nWell that's right so Joe mansion said no to getting rid of Obamacare and having\nGo to ... vote healthcare being one well that's right so Joe mansion said no to getting rid of Obamacare and having a really high quality affordable health\nCare options in the mountains state Sean in West Virginia premiums have risen over a hundred and sixty percent in four years and mansion said no to fixing getting rid of Obamacare\nAnd I think the west Virginians didn't like that they also didn't like the fact that Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts that are really giving a big lift to our state providing economic opportunity better jobs\nJoe mansion how to side with Chuck Schumer the leadership on every issue when it matters\nMansion says no one even on ... where people say oh he ended up voting for Kavanaugh the reality is he waited he actually left the Senate of voting chamber and waited until Susan Collins cast a vote and then and only then to Joe Manchin step out because he knew if he didn't do that he was politically death\nIs toe so I you know I kind of used a lot of those votes as you know election conversion your votes and that's the point is you have over the tax cuts um and you know maybe not as extreme as the as everyone else in his party but the reality is is that he's going to vote for Chuck Schumer to be the majority leader\nAnd I don't think Chuck Schumer can get ... votes in West Virginia which makes mansion out of touch with the people in West Virginia and it was actually on important issues like tax cuts regulation energy those are three main fundamental issues that that affect an impact\nThe economy in West Virginia also I Know West Virginia like a lot of places have struggled with the oil opioid issues and\nWe got on with the president did yesterday and what he's been doing since he became president\nWell that's one of the big issues in this race that Joanne since first vote will be for Chuck Schumer\nAnd Chuck Schumer has made no bones about the fact that she's going to head out the obstruction resistance impeachment caucus and if you're part of that Schumer leadership team and Joe Manchin is and you're empowering these liberals the folks that really created all the rock destroying the capital hearings\nThen you're part of the problem so that's why people were so focused on Joe mansion first vote because they know he's not going to be with West Virginia and he's going to be part of a team that's tearing down the president\nWest Virginians don't want that and that's why we're gaining so much momentum in our campaign\nHow much money is the Democratic party putting into West Virginia to try and keep in other words how much you're Schumer and company and below seeing company or are they investing in the negative ads about you\nWell they've put a fortune and I think by a well by all accounts they are going to probably be up over twenty four twenty five million dollars and this is West Virginia this is not New York California or Florida they'll probably end up spending about ... million more\nWe're going to look at the final count and that's what happens on you mentioned earlier\nYou know if you get pounded for months on end of that and you can't respond it makes it difficult but now the president came back twice he's actually our side we think is going to come back again and we start to come back twelve to ten eight six to for that to you know to even\nAnd that's because President Trump has made this a top priority\nWhen does early voting began and wait for her junior and started your\nEarly yeah early voting started yesterday\nAnd so we're starting to look at the numbers one thing we see is that the Republicans have a lot of energy and people know that the future of the Senate to really be at stake what this election and that there's a clear choice so uh we're feeling good about it we're not talking but we're going to work Joe mansion\nIt with this election and that there's a clear choice so uh we're feeling good about it we're not talking but we're going to work Joe mansion and people are gonna know on the conservative fighter will help the President Joe mansion he's a dishonest Washington liberal and he's never there when you need them\nOr I was watching the race now put this in the ... column a where we once thought it was a leaning Democrat now the state of West Virginia and play attorney general Patrick Morrisey would support the president's agenda versus Joe Manchin sadly would vote for Chuck Schumer said\nAnyway it's a deadline and race at this point and uh with early voting a there is a very good shot that that could change

I think it is organized gangs\nAnd that's a big difference in a mob mob or people that may or may not have the same interests that gather a to do a certain thing but in this case\nThese people have organization they don't just show up somewhere or a ... once these people show up again and again and again that's a very important thing that we need to look at um\n[noise] uh it is to the the way the conversation is going over the past couple of days though I I Want Sean I think everybody needs to look at one thing or all that rhetoric that you played at the beginning of this was very specific about violence very specific about\nAh all that rhetoric that you played at the beginning of this was very specific about violence very specific about who to target\nAnd when I look at the at at the response which you had and which are seen from other people are when bronco bomber was an office I'm In the case of the shooter that shot a\nUm the Mr squeeze 'em what you saw where people not blaming Bernie Sanders but what you see here and I find that is so hard is that uh these devices have been put out there that somebody went the distance to to put these things together to ah to\nCarry out a plan covertly to put the things in place all at once\nAnd none of them went off and immediately the rhetoric starts in a way that is organized\nAnd now I'm not saying they have something to do with whoever put these out there but the organization of their rhetoric is so disgusting to lead a low on the political chain that it it does make one pause and ask 'em was this rhetoric prepared\nIt's a it's a very alarming thing\nWas that I got Daniel [noise] you know I just I just want to make it really clear I'm not blaming the printed and today I think that there is playing the light across\nThe entire political state trend and what I think regular people like me see if\nI go out and the world I deal with people who don't necessarily agree with that I get my job down I said I I ... hot and somehow I can manage to get around the world around this country to get around my city\nI without inflaming tensions in people around me and I just don't understand what is wrong with politicians that I cannot get their job is done without the kind of rhetoric\nJonathan the way I look at it as this is now gone on two years of vitriol hatred lies conspiracy theories on a level we've never seen before and what's worse is you know when the president says the fake news\nA lot of it has been fake news it's not even news all of his political commentary clogged up as news and it's not news at all there are these are not news channels these are opinion channels\nYou know I don't see much real reporting from fake news CNN or or even NBC ABC or CBS anymore they're all run by liberal activists George Stephanopoulos has an agenda\nHe's a he's been Clinton threw him through his entire life\nAnd he hasn't changed one bit and it's not any different on CBS or NBC or any of the two cable channels\nAnd you know it's interesting I say I'm a talk show host part of my job is to give opinion but I also report straight news we do investigative reporting we've been doing it for example but we've added Obama when no one else would we've invented the deep state more deeply than anybody else in the media\nAnd so that's part of what we do giving opinion is part of what we do well like the whole newspaper they say they're only the news part of the newspaper but they're really the opinion part\nYou know Sean I I've been on your TV show on the radio show I've been around you for five years now\nAnd one thing that can truly say whether it be you or anybody else on Fox News and and a lot of these other networks out there is that\nWhen ... when something like this happens and all these Democrats are having these devices delivered to them you're not going to see what else on NBC today where they have the the ah down below where they have the headline a bullet with a reporter and it says that Trump opposition\nIs getting devices delivered to their to their addresses Trump proposition that that's the way that they're they're playing this other automatic\nIs getting devices delivered to their to their addresses Trump proposition that that's the way that they're they're playing this other automatically\nPutting suspect on Trump just by the way that they are labeled the lower half of the screen I mean it it is it's it's it's such political um\nDistasteful rhetoric that when you couple that with the things like McDonald's said\nWith the things that are these politicians are are instigating people to go out and carry out these things Trump never it never has said anything that inflammatory and by and large\nThe reason his words are so ah inflamed is not because of him it's because of CNN and MSNBC and these leftist politician that go out and pump it up to something that he never meant it to be\nWe're going to have to leave it there uh Jonathon Gillum
