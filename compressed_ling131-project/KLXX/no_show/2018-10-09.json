years ago [noise] think about that\nAnd the reason is the nature of work has changed so much men historically a lot of men who earn a living based on Broadway\nYou know and doing physical labor of some kind and factory work has automated so heavily while those jobs in the factory that paid well we're really dangerous but a lot of those jobs\nAre now replaced by robotics and machinery or various forms of automation and ...\nAnd for the field of work they go into him seen incomes rise over that time period men on the other hand who are not well represented in education generally have seen and comes to climb on average not everybody\nIt doesn't mean a college education\nBut getting a trade or skill or that's something that gives you what's referred to as a skilled trade plumber electrician

service especially if you are someone who's been with a TNT or of horizon for a long long time\nEven with them almost certainly plans have gotten cheaper and better than what you signed up on years ago and you just keep paying the bill month after month and never forget\nThe second tier brands that are owned by the major carriers themselves or a captive beside them\nFor a TNT that's cricket for T Mobile is metro PCS and for sprint it's boost mobile\nFor horizon they have a captive called total wireless\nIf you want to reduce the prices and still remain in the house of the major carrier you can potentially save yourself a ton of money going to their discount brand of one of the majors instead of the\nParent brand if you will and the only thing the only difference you face is paying less money [noise]\nAnd I have a call now from I don't know what\nYour name is I mean I like to introduce yourself Hi what's your name or this is Rob\nHi Rob it's great to have you here on the car coward show and Rob you want to talk about how I always trash for oh three B plans\nThat strike Clark and at first I just want to say I'm I'm completely did he talking I've been listening to you for decades and uh have followed your life and also myself than interested in personal finance and investments for you know since I was a teenager a lot like you so\nWell right yes so forestry these um as you've talked about there for nonprofits\nI'm In some of them are still pretty lousy but my wife and I worked in a a number of uh organizations with for three days that have been excellent and I work in health care and she works for a think tank\nAnd we've never had anything but fantastic for us release with\nSome of your favorite companies and very low expense ratio does um so I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of that not all for freebies are bad and ah when callers call and asking about their plans making sure they they look under the hood at what they really got\nWell that is a great thing you said 'cause you know when I talk in such stark terms about four or thirty bees\nI'm trying to really shake people up and get them to do something they don't even know they can do and that is find out what they're paying for the foreign three be the problem and the foreign three B. industry is so often even if somebody has\nA fines offered to them from a low cost ... or find house they may still be paying very high charges for administration to an insurance company that manages the four three be there at and so\nThat's ... go ahead that's right I I think especially um teachers have traditionally\nBeen exposed to a pretty lousy plans through their school districts and and whatever plans they've they've worked out um but\nYeah and isn't it the ... teachers get beaten up every possible way not physically but I mean\nYou know the teachers have trouble getting enough respect they have trouble getting enough pay for the hard work they do and then on top of it that generally school districts whack the capability in house to pick\nGood for three B plans and so they just can't say oh why don't you handle that whoever you are you going to handle that for it's handled by a teacher's union that also lacks\nThe expertise to pick these plans and the teachers ended up getting socked with the expenses that are so high that often a teacher will end up with less money at the end of a year and they started with at the beginning because the fees are so dry norm us\nThat's in the last ... financial term by the way John enormous not really a\nHousing teacher plans with three percent ... expense ratio is and as an example my plan and my wife's plan has expense ratio is a total expenses down around ... point ... percent so\nAnd that's fantastic so where you and your wife are is in the range of what a good for three four one K. would be also\nYeah well thanks clerked for everything you do appreciate it\nAnd I and keep saving that money more you save the better off you're going to be and we're speaking now with tied tied welcome to the Clark Howard show\nType clerk it's a nice to talk to you thank you for taking my call\nCertainly Todd how can I be of service\nWell my wife and I have an emergency funds I'm just at a local bank and but it's not it's in just a regular checking account and it's not getting any kind of like return on it\nUm and so really I was just kind of wondering if you had any advice to maybe moving it I have a local credit union maybe in our area that I've seen maybe two or three percent\nWondering if he had any advice to may be moving at a local credit union maybe in our area that I've seen maybe two or three percent for a checking account um this one that kind of get your thoughts on that\nSo that the two percent checking accounts usually two or three or ten years ago there were five percent checking accounts the way those work is you and your wife would have to do so many debit card transactions than a month\nAnd clear them as credit card transactions you know how would the debit card you'll use it somewhere or any car and they'll say debit or credit\nAnd with a debit card you can choose to say credit even though it's a debit card and then the merchant has to pay much higher fees than they would if it clears as a debit card\nSo when a credit union or a bank is offering higher interest rates on checking accounts were those accounts usually they're limited to paying the interest on our balance up to like twenty or twenty five thousand dollars\nAnd you're required to do usually I think it's like a twelve to twenty depending on the bank or credit union debit card transactions a month cleared as credit and that's where the money comes from to pay the interest is from what they earn on those merchant fees\n[noise] okay so you would most likely those kind of keep it where it's at now and just click land or I'm\nNo sign up for an answer although\nUm you can link your existing account to one of the online banks that are paying now lots of them are paying around two percent even some a little more than two percent on simple savings\nAnd the money can be moved on two days' notice you know emergency usually two days will be quick enough you can move it back to your regular bank [noise]\nAnd then you earn and two percent that's going to go higher over the next six months [noise]\nGotcha and that is just simply linking the account to an online bank or is that moving it\nThat's exactly right what you do is you open an account with an online bank and you will link it to your existing bank or credit union account\nAnd then the money can be moved back and forth pretty easily and I'm working right now there's a website that has a pretty good list of the online banks I'm looking at a bank re dot com and the highest rates available today or to point two five percent\nOn simple savings\nAnd so that's that's where things are headed by the end of the year we may have the highest rates of people are offering around two point five or ... percent\nReally simple to just wink your account and no you're going to get a better deal so give it a try you're listening to the

in school [noise] is it a contract they have with the school system\nI I just find it very serious and the reason that sort of comes up is because I listen to talk radio it's mostly all on my car radio on and I ... my son around all its practices and all this stuff most of the time he has his headphones\nSo I'm taking them to practice the other day and he didn't have an headphones and and he says to me a side are you on with this whole cabinet things and I looked at him and I just saw\nThat on how how how old is he he is fourteen okay\nAnd I looked at him I was just shocked and somewhat impressed Matt he knew about it mhm and so I gave him I told him while I was on cabin outside and let me explain why\nWent through all the things about evidence and you know it's really an allegation

the case for many years\nAnd and certainly sort of Trump came along they're suffering from Pete GST as we know ah but but that's kind of the perception and if you're at a run a gymnasium or a bar or restaurant or something\nThe perception is that if you put on CNN it's kind of in the middle even if it leans lab but it's kind of in the middle and if you're a left or you don't you think it's very much centrist CNN is very much\nCentrist that you'll admit that MSNBC is liberal if you're allowed to you know even though they're like Maoist lunatics and you'll think about Fox News has been as horrible right wing thing but you don't know what channel it's on I was telling you is that I was talking to somebody the last couple of days\nThat was what dinner at the Trump Hotel the other somebody has a friend or whatever their friends' house they have the child to block on Fox News on the cable\nYou have to punch in a code to get the Fox News Good the cable system yeah because they
