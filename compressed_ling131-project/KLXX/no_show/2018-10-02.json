wanted to shop for auto insurance or\nYou wanted to apply for a loan or whatever so you had to thaw get a new credit card you had to thaw your file\nSo you'd go onto the website of the credit bureau

Halloween costumes each year ... [noise] yeah\nYou guys always have a big Halloween party too don't you\nWe do tossed around the idea we want to do on this year just because of lots of stuff going on work and personal um but I think our friends would be really decided if we didn't send it out so well suddenly invite out and hopefully we generate some interest otherwise I guess we'll be celebrating with ourselves maybe our pets\n[laughter] go and you've also been at United Way almost one year and I had over as well while you're at\nIt has been a educational in learning opportunity but a wonderful experience um so yeah next week will mark a year and it really has been I'm just a wonderful learning opportunity there's so many things that I thought\nI knew about United Way before working there and it really has opened my eyes to just\nSome of the knees and the community and some of the resources that um United Way on our partner agencies and other agencies in the community provide that I really just had no idea about and so it's been nice to kind of get that on my radar and hopefully we can educate\nEveryone else listening to about some of those things that are going on and\nI've also learned that non profit is we have a really small office and it takes\nIt takes a lot of work for a small team to operate and we do have to rely on volunteers and we could not do the work we do without the amazing community and I volunteer stepping up to help us\nThat's very true you know when we talk to people and they want to get involved we couldn't be more excited because we have so many things that we have on our list of things that we want to get done at United Way\nBut like amount of said we have such a small staff and so do several other non profits that you just need that extra support to really get and everything completed and when you started\nWe're just getting into fall and winter and knowing that the emergency shelter was going to be closing or had closed and so really had to take that on when you started at the office and now in August our emergency shelter\nOn down on sunrise if you're not familiar with where it is\nWe only have a a small piece of that building\nBut we have been open and sheltering men women and children there since March first so it's been really a great learning curve for a lot of the staff at United Way because this isn't something that we've done before we haven't done direct service for homeless clients in our community and really be that place where our community comes to\nA community resource for a nonprofit um and we provide services for survivors of violence all kinds of violence domestic violence sexual assault um stocking human trafficking elder abuse\nAnd how long have you been in Bismarck in the region um what we have been around as a service since the seventies so well and just\nAs one home and have just continued to grow because when did you ask the hulk too you know Embry\nOh boy I'm not sure it's been around for a while I Know that for sure\nYeah we just wrapped up our little black dress campaign and the one thing we love to do at the end of that campaign is to donate all of the dresses that the women\nI'm bored during that week and those all go to their career closet at\nSeeds the hope and so for those that are listening and are maybe trying to get back on your feet or or want to get a new job or get a promotion they have\nOutfits there after her closet and let me tell you some of these women that donated from the little black dress campaign they still have the tags on them and so I always another resource for getting you know step up in your career and get you started\nOr in your community but as I mentioned in the opening October is\nA national domestic violence awareness might tell us a little bit about what a air sea is doing a during the month of October to create awareness\nYeah absolutely um we have one of my favorite events coming up it's called take back the night it's on October eighth which is next Monday\nI'm In ten of some of the history behind take back the night it started in the Nineteen sixties I'm In England when the women started protesting the fact that they didn't feel safe walking on the streets at night\nSo that event um it's really it's a peaceful protest um about how you know us as women we want we want safety at night and on the streets [noise] um and it's really about taking back at night and you know just raising awareness of this violence is happening and in supporting those survivors\nWhat does the um event kind of timeline look like ... to operate because he said it's some kind of a friendly protest about taking back the night what is exactly that look like\nYeah so we're going to start at five Fifteen and we're going to have 'em in\nWell in the south lawn um Oregon I just pulled up kind of some different science about facts about domestic violence um different forms of violence\nUm and then at five forty five were going to have a ceremony of remembrance um you know where to all that kind of gather together we're going to you know take part in ...\nUm and then at six o'clock we're going to head over to McCabe church right across the right across the street there from the capital\nI'm and we're going to do some different things there to honor victims and survivors um it's definitely it's an emotional nights it's definitely a night just to honor survivors um and then after that all concludes we're going to just kind of have some different refreshments\nSounds like a a great opportunity to learn a lot more about what a RC is all about and some of the stories of individuals that have come to you or is there a fee or anything like that or how do people register for the event yeah so\nPeople can just show up if they would like you know at the beginning or at any part\nUm and yeah it doesn't cost anything you don't have to register or just just if you're interested and want to be a part of it just it just show up and family friendly mhm yeah absolutely we usually have little children there and they hold up the signs it's really really cute we take pictures of it than awesome\nAnd then we encourage everyone to get more informed attend take back the night again that is October eighth and I think one of the things that we get asked\nA lot of United ways you know I think my friend maybe going through something and it may not be full fledged domestic violence but it could be verbal it may not be abusive yet and so what is your advice to those individuals or to family members\nThat feel like they have a friend or a loved one going through some kind of abuse\nYeah absolutely absolutely that's definitely something really common that we see it\nUm we are available twenty four seven we have a crisis line it's confidential people can call in and they can just talk to an advocate\nAbout these concerns that they're having\n'em and you know we can they can even just be anonymous if they want to or you know we like to kind of take down some different information kind of you know start putting some of that in our system um and we can\nYou know help them learn and understand how they can be supportive in what way is um and maybe even come up with a plan of how we could get the person that might be being abused you know to call us or to come in and just look at some different options with\nThem and so what would be the number for your guys is twenty four hour crisis lines suggest that number\n[noise]\nIs one eight six six three for one seven zero zero nine\nSo again the twenty four hour crisis line at a air sea is one eight six six\nThree for one seven zero zero nine and so sometimes you'll see family members are are individuals that have been you know be used in the past and and now they become an advocate or volunteer and how can people in our community looked to volunteer with the peace in our Research Center\nHad absolutely um they can call in you know to our office at any time they can speak with emily's shoes are volunteer coordinator\nUm I Know that we can always use help with you know different events that we do throughout the year um we also definitely appreciate different donations there's lots of ways people can get involved and help lift their interests that [noise]\nUm so do you guys ever I'm sure you have a lot of clients that um\nI maybe there's a lot of individuals that are out there listening that are just too scared to come forward and the ... do you have any advice for those individuals that are listening um\nAnd maybe there's a lot of individuals that are out there listening that are just too scared to come forward and the ... do you have any advice for those individuals that are listening I'm the first step to kind of coming to you guys and making that easier because I think sometimes they'll have a stigma I Believe that like it's\nTheir fault or something else is wrong and they don't want to admit to that so do you have any advice for individuals listening that are just scared to to come forward but should\nYeah absolutely I mean I Would definitely just want them to know you know that we were completely confidential um and like I said they can be anonymous if they want 'em and you know I Would really just encourage them to to give us you know find a safe time to give us a call or come in\nUm and I think it's really important for them to know that we are we're going to judge them we're going to tell them what to do I mean we're just going to listen or going to understand we're going to be there for them um and we're just going to show them some different like auctions and different avenues that they could take\n'em and sometimes you know people just aren't there just aren't there yet they're ready and that's okay and we might just help um safety plan about how they can they as safe as they can be in the home\nUm yeah I mean just all a lot of options and it's just it's such a big thing to you know to keep inside and deal with all by yourself and we just we want to be able to talk with you about it even if that's even if that's all you're meeting at this point\nAnd it's so important that everybody um is that very different stages and those programs and services\nAre available to follow that entire spectrum at the ... Research Center so if somebody um calls what does the intake process looked like do they do it over to the phones do they come into the shelter what does that steps in all in town\nYeah so I mean it's really about kind of whatever is going to work best for that we definitely we take calls all the time and do and takes in that format or if they prefer to command that's okay too [noise]\nUm and I mean we try and do you know just gather information about what's going on because the more we can understand about\nAbout the violence and all the different dynamics like just the better we'll be able to make referrals and you know safety plan and all of those pieces um but it's definitely whatever whatever they feel comfortable sharing we aren't going to pressure on them to tell us anything that they aren't comfortable with\nAnd we've been talking a lot about mostly domestic violence but you also are the human trafficking coordinator so tell us a little bit about air sees role in human trafficking mhm\nSo we partner with youth works I'm there actually are um the grant holder and so we partner with them I provide services for twenty three and older and then they do the younger population\nUm see I mean we have we have some separate funding for that we have a whole slew of really specific services for survivors of human trafficking\nAnd I think a lot of people within our community see it on national news that human trafficking is around the U.S and and not necessarily thinking that that's happening here but it truly is absolutely absolutely\nWell if you are listening make sure you get involved with the abuse that our Research Center like ... said they are always looking for donations whether it's supplies for at the shelter but also\nMark your calendar October eighth or take back the night there'll be meeting at five Fifteen to start off at the Capitol around six o'clock moving over to McCabe church\nLike get involved be a advocate for domestic violence and get involved in and do your part but when we get back to continue to stay tuned to United way's community tack we are going to also be talking about mental health the segment so stay tuned and we will talk to you soon\nUm you know to a certain mental health disorder doesn't mean it well then just stopped protesters there\nUm but it's just really varies I think I think what else you know a toddler years you can kind of maybe start to notice some of those early symptoms you know such as [noise] increase temper tantrums with or without aggression not irritability may be some changes than bowler bladder habits or sleep habits um they're not going to tell you mom I'm depressed that too\nUm but you might notice you know more of those are internal symptoms and then you know they get that school age you're going to start to notice if they're withdrawing are having trouble making friends academic concern um with isolating all those kinds of things\nSo what are some of the services that you're providing children to help them through these personal struggles\nWith mental health therapy you know we try to address services what they can do unless their parents too so it's kind of a dual program when your children's mental health counselor [noise]\nUm you know I work in a variety of things like emotional awareness coping skills problem solving and healthy relationships\nUm behavioral management stress management strategies relaxation you name it you know we can kind of cover it or will cover it at some point in time um there's a lot of talk therapy you know if they're evil otherwise it's a lot of play based interventions\nAnd so a lot of times when you see a kid come into the clinic do they do the sessions with their parents or the first couple of times and then they separate how does\nFormat look like they're kind of various pending let the\n... with their parents or the first couple of times and then they separate how does that format look like start\nYou know just as there is pending let the concern is usually our initial evaluation we'll all meet with parent and child jointly or for sure we need that parents there to give us some of that background information as sessions progress\nUm you know sometimes we'll meet let parent and child those right away kind of get an update me with the kid a one on one ... mom or dad in at the end of the fashion talk about what we worked on\nUm sometimes it's just the kids sometimes it's the whole family it just kind of varies pending what's going on in the home\nAnd so I think as you know we've talked about you know the importance of having more advocates the importance of removing the stigma is definitely becoming more of a buzz within the state and also within our community whether it be within the school systems\nUm the availability of services you know it's it's out there but I think a lot of people don't know what to do\nSo as a community member or as\nI'm concerned citizen what are some things that we could be doing to help in this arena for not licensed to really provide any real guidance but there has to be some things that our community can really do to help a mental health\nShare you know I think really what they can do is a kind of be supportive non biased aware you know if you're noticing\nI Can't do that for some reason you are working whether you'll come in contact with a lot that seems you know emotionally just a little bit out of sorts or a little bit down a little bit anxious or something and you got you know it just kind of tiny something's not right here don't be afraid to ask questions\nOr if you know as parents that you know seem really overwhelmed or like they are struggling don't be afraid to say hey doing okay you know it and I can do to help or hey you want to talk to somebody you know here's where you can do that kind of a thing\nUm I think and then also just being kind of non biased in our speech as we talk about mental health issues you know or\nIssues that kids are struggling with today and making sure we have that non biased approach so that people feel comfortable having those conversations\nAnd so as you've been working at pediatric there'd be partners and and getting to meet some of these families and adults\nAnd really helping them grow and and get through um maybe\nSome of the issues that are doing what are some of the success stories that maybe one stands out to you that it is maybe your favorite\n[noise] you know\nWe see a lot of ... you know I'm for a variety of concern they think the biggest thing that's part of the success of where we have families where\nParents are joined part of the process so when we have families that are open and honest and just kind of willing to kind of buried all you know as he got that therapeutic process their successes so much more\nUm you know it's important to me I feel lucky to be able to be part of the journey to the super resilient and people are really vulnerable and they come to the U.S so helping them and that process of you know pretty good [laughter]\nAnd so Courtney how do people get connected with pediatric therapy partners if they are maybe in need of ... are going through some difficult times yeah they can just feel free to call her clinic seven five one six three three six is our number\nIf they're not sure kind of what service they're seeking out they can just call and talk to her office staff and kind of let us know presenting concerns and we can steer them in the right direction\nUm we also have a website pediatric there'd be partners dot com there's more information on all of our services on there too as well\nPerfect in real quick before we end this segment you are opening a new clinic tell us about that we are yes so we are I'm building a new facility and that is going to give us more space to provide even better services and more resources to our families and\nUm that will be is set to be finished in spring twenty Nineteen so well congratulations and thank you to both of you for all that you do and and really being the advocates for mental health in our community it's it's truly important work and and we appreciate is but if
