a good and bad way in such an extremely short period of time as MoviePass MoviePass\nGave the movie theater industry the best year it had perhaps in the last twenty\nIs people rediscovered going to the theater for cause of MoviePass MoviePass has crashed and burned and it's still hanging on by a threat but now if you were someone who benefited from MoviePass but you dumped it\nYou have a reason to potentially be extremely upset about what I'm going to say and today's car courageous moment [noise]\n\nClark gorgeous mullet [noise]\nMoviePass in desperation to have some money coming in is automatically re and rolling\nIt acts customers without asking you in fact what they are doing is they're sending out\nEmails to people that I'm sure a lot of people think is just marketing stuff\nMoves sending out an email that says if you don't opt out they're going to go ahead and re enroll un automatically charge you again for MoviePass [noise]\nNow that is\nUnbelievable it speaks to the desperation MoviePass has to get money but it's almost certainly not\nA proper legal activity but even if it was something that was legal it's in no way ethical and you should know that if you were a MoviePass subscriber\nPay very close attention to an email that may have even gone in your spam of your email look for one that would have come and the last forty eight hours\nAnd in it there will be something you have to click on in order to opt out\nOtherwise they're going to go ahead and start charging you again\nIt is completely outrageous\nAnd if one thing if movie passed at any one good thing it did help a lot of people\nAnd it's pretty simple you save money to the point that you saved twenty five times the amount of money that it costs you to live in one year\nAnd once you hit that target whether it's in your thirties forties fifties sixties or never\nThat's when you know you have enough money built up for the lifestyle you've grown accustomed to that you can afford to live in definitely on the money you've saved\nAnd it I Know that's an oversimplification but it really is that simple as soon as he went on to say the power that you need at least five or six million really you might need ten million dollars\nTo retire securely and respectfully I strongly disagree with what Susan said there are people who easily can get\nWhen they hit the point they've saved a million dollars that means they're living a\nNot a a barebones lifestyle but they're living a more careful frugal lifestyle\nBecause what you wanted to see one enough money saved that you have invested that you can throw off enough cash to live on each year and at the same time have the piled the stash you built up\nHave enough in it that you can earn enough on it and the years following to cover the cost of inflation but let's go to a core principle\nIf somebody is a Mac saver\nOr today a proponent of the FIRE movement\nAnd they save like a maniac can they get to a point you know let's say in their mid thirties that they've saved enough money that they've created real financial security it doesn't mean they don't ever work again it means they only do what they enjoy\n[noise] you know I retired at thirty one and\nHere I Am working now talking to you at sixty three [noise]\nAnd since I was thirty one I've only worked when I wanted to and doing what I enjoy because I had that financial security when I was thirty one\nSo don't let somebody tells you oh you're never going to be able to retire 'til you have twenty million dollars [laughter]\n[laughter] oh boy [laughter] anyway no that you have to have a goal you have to have a target you have to be realistic about it and you have to live your life in a way that you will accomplish that you know one of the things when a years ago\nMy book living large and lean times came out and then the companion book that came out later living large for the long haul his I learned so much from people\nWho had adjusted their lives to live a more frugal life and to be in a position where they weren't living on borrowed money where they were always saving money and I was inspired by so many people in so many stories\nOf people that I talked to who did change the direction of their lives and how they were living and created that independence and freedom in their lives so they don't want anybody tell you you can't do it it's up to you if it's important to you\nAnd it's just got to be something that you don't say you actually do\nJohn joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi John\nGood afternoon Clark [noise] how're you doing

adopting the chrome book is their computer of choice in massive numbers and the ... now completely dominate the educational environment there are still a particularly in the private school environment where\nThey're using Mac books but overall the chrome book dominates not totally but gosh it's moving that direction and Google\nHas a suite of\nPrograms that are similar many of them in nature to the Microsoft sweet you were referring to and\nFor the educational environment those are generally free and they can be used not just on a chrome book at home they can be used on any computer anywhere even if it's not a crime but so\nThat's why the schools have been adopting that they don't have to I have a an IT department or anything like that since everything on them is Web based and you're right that to make a crumbled useful you have to have an Internet connection for most everything you would do on it\nSo it it would be a good question for you to ask going from a home school environment to one that is a more traditional classroom to find out if the school they're going to be attending is a chrome book school\nOkay that that's a perfect point Clark or to follow that quick like um tell me about\nThe ... ability to function in a disconnected state meaning stand alone or not having\nA access to the Internet by yes\nOkay they used to be a complete door stop that if you didn't have Internet it was basically a worthless piece of furniture taking up space when it didn't have Internet connection\nNow there are a handful of functions you can do off line but then once you

I take that back\nHank Paulson would be as close all I Would argue that actually have would actually be like the real Wyatt Earp that John Wayne tried to bases that are on your side we're at banks gonna they're gonna fail we're going to say here's one [laughter]\nI get we're doing that I can we're doing that I can almost imagine Hank staring at ... ... from Wells Fargo in the room saying\nYou're going to take on this bank aren't ya and then just staring just staring at him is that yes [laughter]\nAnyway\nSo that's the primary mortgage market survey on to the mortgage market guy with a friend bill Bodner and the boys out there from New Jersey as they tell us that they've got definitions today\nWho yeah so that I was going to be this has got to be an interesting one capitulation ooh ooh that's a big word is when Kennedy says it [laughter] Siri can you get us the definition for him if it's relations is when investors\nGive up any previous gains by selling to bail out the market ... involves extremely high volumes and sharp decline it also usually involves panic selling the term is derived from a military term which refers\nTo surrender off of the folks in real estate there is no ... that you later [laughter] Sandy\nMade thirty four percent coupon lost nearly a hundred ... from yesterday afternoon that's when rates really went up bugs\nOr until this morning's opening low we can call that capitulation the yield on the ten year teen out hit three point two three this morning a seven year high it was just three point zero five yesterday and currently at three point one son and what made bonds\nWhich had been flirting with the ceiling of resistance finally ... uncle jobs jobs jobs yesterday the Pew report showed a blistering two hundred and thirty thousand jobs fifty thousand above expectations\nBut and I got a lot to do with the wages have been kept relatively flat and having grown up and all\nThat you would think that that's got his start going and then as I understand it that inflation will hit mortgage interest rates are going to creep\nUp and all of a sudden mortgages interest rates are then it goes by [noise] and then people start investing more in Fannie and Freddie and that brings it back down in my not well\nWhat they'll do what they'll do is they'll buy or or what they'll do is they'll go long on them in and inflation the idea that in rice or get it they will go along with the idea that have recessions coming yeah\nSo it's a it's a it's a recession it's a recession protection strategy because I think I think because you're expecting that if inflation hot you're expecting a recession\nAnd the other thing to keep in mind is this month I I Believe from correct the fed is stopping their purchases of mortgage backed securities\nWhich will how it will further cause interest rates to go out so\nThere is not that the buyer in the market anymore\nSo somebody's got to replace them if nobody replaces them than the United states issuing treasuries\nAnybody issue bonds are going to you're going to have to pay more uh you know the ... on it so as I was going to cause I have an effect to him you know that's and that's an annoying because it's never really happened before and to this extent\nSo it'd be interesting to see what happens you\nKnow we will have you here everybody's getting a raise\nRates are going up ... I Want to know\nOne thing that that plays into this too and I was just throw this out um we talk about the uh incredible dollar value of home sales\nMhm [noise] and I'm actually the\nSome of the reports we're going to see our our showing home sales are off\nBut wholesale prices has gone up too and now the annual ... dollar volume is going to change hands with home sales has gone from five point two trillion dollars this year to five point eight trillion dollars this year ... that's more than Warren Buffett's worth folks\n[noise] fire fire a little bit a little touch 'em ... how about\nThe Amazon guy diesel says it more than him Asia hundred and forty three Billy ... says five point eight or nine brilliant they got along they gotta catch up they got to work with the housing market is right you\nKnow um is\nOur number really and they got along they gotta catch up they gotta work at a ... but now I'm\nIs are there more home sales ... you know even though the dollar volumes gone up while we've heard about you know is a shortage of housing so prices have gone up so much is most of that do to just the price increase or are at home sales kept also pushing\nHome sales are are of we're going up they took in August they took a one point eight percent dip in pending home sales new home sales are ... are a a\nKind of creeping up fairly well um [noise] but the existing homes\nAre down on them and so the the pending home the homes ready to close a debt indexes off just like I said one twenty percent and that's not unusual\nBut ah it also I think shows a trend nationally the largest generation of home buyers now has switched from baby boomers to millennials and I've even seen this in my own business we've seen a locally\n[noise] the millennial homebuyers first time home\nIs a totally different house than the baby boomers first time home and use it to death\nOr they don't want somebody's used house if they're going to buy an older house they wanted to look like new V. like you know and and I think part of that is a lot of those handyman skills who don't belong to that generation of people\nThat I I was a they'd rather have someone to do it than to do it and so and and this everything is cyclical everything adjusts this isn't the way it's gonna be now forever but for right now new homes or or like new homes are much more attractive to the millennial buyer than it existing home\nAnd it's hard to get enough of those built yeah yeah no that leads right into that we we don't even plan this stuff you know if it happens okay\nOur friends Frank and Brian from the national real estate's ... blog this morning ah was on something similar to this uh uh what the gyms e which is roughly the twenties ... says the thirty forty year olds\nAnd then the the uh then you've got the millennials which are well ... are are thirty forty year old snacks is yeah yeah okay so that there was a study done by his company called property shark um the Franken Brian look out for this and it was what\nWhat Gen Z millennials in Gen x wanted his size wise at home what they expected and became so agenda these the youngest yep okay they wanted a two thousand eighty one square foot on average they said that's that's what they would want okay gay what they could afford based on the average income for that sector\nThey could afford a house of eight hundred and three square feet on average\nSo outage disconnect between what you want and what you can afford gave a Gen x wanted two thousand one hundred and sixty square foot on average so roughly the same they could afford nine hundred and Seventy four square foot home so they're making a literary income Dayton and the millennials\nThey apparently have come to realize that realization that can't afford\n[laughter] how are they are there's a whole are they finally starting to realize that they're down their average\nWhat the what they would like at home is eight one thousand eight hundred and eighty three square feet on average so they're they're becoming more realistic um but what they could afford was eight hundred and twelve square feet right yeah and I'm ... you know for whatever that's worth\nAnd it's got interested in terms of talking going back to like Greg was saying about\nI just did a quick calculation on payments what an interest rate impact is so say four and a half percent to five and a half percent [noise] and and I really think that if you want to know her home prices are going just just follow affordability now this is see here's the deal though\nGregg you're gonna be surprised to learn this okay I'm always you're going to surprise wins the most is a prize or what I enjoy the interest rate in the interest rate going up a full point is just going to crush should just crush house prices right\nNow let me think about that goes up as one or two hundred thousand dollar on the interest rate going up a full point would increase a payment on two hundred thousand alone by about a hundred and thirty bucks somewhere in their ... hundred and thirty bucks right\nSo now\nWhat that does is you have to if you go back to the four and a half percent rate you have to lower that loan you have to lower that loan five thousand dollars to have a hundred and thirty dollar impact on the payment and some\nWere just talking about what are millennials really what are they really basing their expectation on how they're figuring out what the real payment is connected with what they want mhm they're starting to learn about payments versus expectation and it's the payment that's really driving our awareness\nBecause if they go by there want they want to do this amazing house when they feel a payment they go\nOh and so so if interest rates go up the whole point\nReally what should happen is that should affect the average listing should I not an economist but just in terms of portability respect average listing by about five thousand bucks now if you own your home for five years or more and you had to sell it for five thousand dollars less next year because interest rates went up a point\nThen you could have sold it for a year ago did you lose money on that deal [noise]\nProbably not I guess yeah house is worth way more ... way more still today than it was five years ago so I Know\nI Know people are going to all these houses are on the market these ... and this is leading up to a question for you because I was on the market now we're losing money on you know we're not getting the money how much of that is based on what the same as safe as I think I'd love to see a boomer\nExpectation on listing price just like millennials have an expectation on\nWhat they can how much square footage they can relieve had a and I get the feeling that when people go to list their homes right now\nThey have an expectation that's kinda like this millennial expectation they were and I I Would love to hear you talk about that where like I I ... ... are you really losing money or is it you're losing money you expected\nThat's well that's exactly what it is now\nAnd the you know we we still are hearing the a well back in two thousand fourteen Bob down the street sold his house for three hundred and twenty thousand dollars in my house is a lot nicer than that it should be three fifty when the truth of the matter is there is no above down the street\n[laughter]\nYou know as a movie of el it's harder and harder as Harvey hanging out with James Stewart off that movie with what about ... ...\nThere is no bogged down the street but everyone knows one you know and and\nSo they didn't don't took take a look at the reality of the market when you're selling you know six years ago I could have bought IBM and made six million dollars so did I lose six million dollars no way in your head right only in that same thing\nThe upside of the other side to that joy you said is absolutely true so here and I have that national housing affordability index rate right here [noise] but\nFor a little bit short of Argentina um so our increase so I just how much just how much our economy increases near that amount alone is enough to make it twenty two in the world because this is our size\nSo every year of ... to ... percent increase in our gross national product creates the twenty seventh wealthiest most powerful nation in the world\nIs as as as an unbelievable and we're in you know we're ... know are we had four hundred million people know three hundred we're we're like three hundred grade a little over ... over three hundred her to some of the other countries\nThat are linked to the ... in a six\nBillion world yeah yeah and the six billion person were were three hundred million holding the [noise]\nMost everything yeah most everything we buy a lot of stuff and we make all the new stuff grow a lot of\nAnd we should be proud of it are ashamed of it depending on your ...\nDepending on where you're at but yeah isn't that amazing how big our economy is yeah and and and and until China figures out their economy where the where the where are our position is number one is is it solidly\nYeah it takes a while to make up the difference between us and China five trillion dollars especially if we grow in three percent every year they want a girl at\nTen years they if they can grow at like double digits it was like it was a tenure and you're saying yeah to to catch the size which I mean you know a heart attack ... to do for free much not\nUm what was the fastest growing economy last year it was easy with a four point eight\nWell let's talk in emerging markets every once in a while yeah already percentage wise to your son or something yeah\nBut I mean the stable economy as as a was ... just under five and then you know and and we were we are just a few years ago we're saying well we are so big now that are two percent GDP is almost on attainable and here we are\nOver for well not just and that's that's incredible 'cause you just think about big ship as your in your poll yeah growing\nFour percent on a on a survey all ... and then I kind of leads into this one a Bernie Sanders\nBernie you ran for president when I remember ... honey easy was a Democrat and he became an independent from Vermont\nUm he wants to break up the nation's biggest banks independent of what I don't know [laughter] just he's just he's an independent Bernie see here's another there's another problem does like the windmill yeah break up the big banks because there are too big a risk breeze Brandon he'll too many migratory birds\nCan act or that he's going to introduce and Congress in the Senate ah it's called too big to fail too big to exist act [laughter]\nEvery two or three ... seals hateful [laughter] ... group Wells Fargo Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley file 'em they just do six banks control assets equal to more than half the country's GDP\nWhile the fourth largest banks or an average approximately eighty per se aren't larger right now than they were before\nThe financial crisis handout which\nJust goes to prove that our Congress rights laws according to the stands a standard [laughter] at the office that happens of what ever they meant to do [laughter]\nI like I could have had a point of Dodd Frank too and I called the Jew big to fail a yeah okay and the bags that it was supposed\nTo like the most are eighty percent larger than to I'm going to put them in I'm going to put them in charge of the job should lose the lottery law and I hope to God they pass it [laughter]\n'cause then Joseph I think you should have done that in our congressional delegation for [laughter] come on come on you why you want to get my vote yeah eighty percent larger than before the financial crash which\nThe Frank got act was supposed to fix the biggest things well did\nThey already know that I ever really brings all wrong about this I mean you think about oh you think about five institutions holding\n... how are we just talked about how big I didn't even intentionally set you up for the snow that none of the what do you think about that a Nineteen trillion dollar economy so that means\nOur growth is twenty two would be number twenty two in the world yeah so if you look at the bank assets in five of our banks what is there almost as big as\nThey're they're like fourth or fifth largest economy in the world they're behind the EU and China that's it\nThey control eighty percent but remember now the GDP yeah\nThat's that's their assets those arrests and\nThey don't control eighty percent of our GDP you know that no no no\nThat's world assets you know yeah those five guys\nThere in the ... there in China and Japan their biggest they're ... they're not controlling everything in the United

judge Kavanaugh is confirmed and\nYou know I I Hope Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski are satisfied I Know who Susan Collins says she was satisfied with the FBI report\nAnd Jeff Flake said the same thing I don't know where Lisa Murkowski is he has not spoken publicly as of now what I Hope we don't reward this behavior because if we do to me it becomes a tipping point in the country where you're just going to get more of this\nAnd anybody that the Democrats don't like is is going to be subject to guilt by accusation and this type of smearing and slandering that goes on I'd also like to see a change in the standard in the law if you're a public figure well do you have to show in the ... the absence of malice how do you prove an absence of malice\nIt's a ridiculous standard that nobody could ever reach which is why people like you and me whatever what people say about us we get stopped taking it\nSure looked like learning to shake I think that overwhelmingly the American people do not want to reward that kind of behavior and I've seen you seen it now and the kind of surveys we're seeing now are amazing people have moved\nPeople have moved very significantly in the last week and it's in reaction to out just pick up all oh and how vicious and how personal or the Democrats and they brought this on themselves and I think that they're now going to report on when\nI miss the bigger things for being with us thirty three days like today ... time eight hundred nine four one show on\nWell Brett Kavanaugh saw near the punch bowl so it may be probably was one of them and he\nGave out red solo cups I saw her give out red solo cups so it wasn't lined up in the hall but he was in the hall I saw him in a hall\nAnd nobody else can corroborated they were never getting the answer that they want it because they've all known as a smear so now they're just me or the FBI investigators in this case that did what they were supposed to do\nThere never was going to be a recommendation or a conclusion made by the FBI we learned that from Joe Biden in Nineteen Ninety One but that wasn't the purpose of any of this their whole their dream their prayer was that the FBI would find them\nOne but that wasn't the purpose of any of this their whole their dream their prayer was that the FBI would find the smoking gun that didn't exist based on the accusers own words in each specific case\nAnyway joining us now glad you're with us by the way eight hundred nine four one Sean Dr Sebastian Gorka former advisor to President Trump author of the\nSoon to be released book why we fight Monica Crowley is a contributing editor to spectator usa senior fellow at the London Center for policy research\nAnd woke up both to back to the program on a good way to begin with you I'm listening the Democrats didn't get what they want but it never was coming was it\nNow because they never would be enough for them to Sean very smart and reality that none of our ships they cited and that is that the left is that war\nThere at war for the future of the country they are at war against the constitution they're at war against free market economics air war against individual liberty in other words there are at war with everything that judge Kavanaugh stands for and the fight for on the Supreme Court\nThere for not only he'd be blocked you must be destroyed\nBecause if he was sent to the highest court about ... that means that the left is no longer going to be able to use the highest court in the land to slam treated their agenda\nBecause lord knows they can't necessarily get it to the ballot box to for decades they've been around lying on the judiciary in order to affect their ... and they know what happened on the bench it's essentially over forgotten and they're going to have to change tactics that's why they have\nI don't know if they ever ... this this is the only play book that then all my years of now Thirty years in radio now having but gun my you know but my own two days I'll begin my twenty third straight year at ... since the day they launched the channel\nAnd I'm One of the remaining original boxers\nI mean I got to tell you things have not changed and and that's the point though to workers that they don't change their tactics\nThey don't seem to have any concern at all for the fact that there's no corroborating evidence in any of the cases that they brought up now they're sending out or at least Deborah cats as friends are sending out these phishing emails saying you know something please we need your help hurry up please write us now tell us\nYour absolutely right so I wrote a piece today in the hills\nUm which is a kind of summary of my my book why we fight if you're surprised at what ... has been put through this trial by what field is this column they shouldn't be then you have no historic perspective\nThe Democrats have been doing this for a century now go back to Nineteen forty days and the case of Whittaker Chambers his was the first ever televised live televised testimony\nBefore Congress and what happened that this is a man who was a former communist who knew where the communists were inside the U.S government including out his loved by the Democrat Party senior State Department of former\nOfficial he he told Congress this guy's a Soviet a joke I was the person carrying secret messages from Moscow to out to his out to his denies it but because he he was a a darling of the left they took\nWhittaker Chambers and they used a ... of everything you can imagine they choose them of not only being unfaithful to his wife they choose them in the death of his brother ... of the accusations are true I'm a long enough to where the country and just died when the the load a a a communication\nYou have to prove that out to his was a Soviet spy so sure they've been doing this since at least the second World War and a lot of cars absolutely right that doing this because they are war\nWith the will of the American people we told we chose Donald Trump though from chose judge Kavanaugh of that is why drugs capital must be destroyed\nSo what are these three Republican senators do of Collins and Murkowski and of course Jeff Flake and then what is Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp was down by a Lebanon North Dakota do Monica\nWell I think based on some of the comments we've hurt today Sean from Senator Conan the particular looks like they're pretty satisfied with the FBI investigation on and it looks like they could be yes his flight crew knows sheets of flake\nSo who knows what he is going to do ... we might pick up some red state Democrats like Joe Manchin Heidi Heitkamp is now down ten points in her early ... in North Dakota and if they really want to stand for the constitution and what's right and human decency they voted\n... I'll be honest if they if they vote for Kavanaugh it's probably going to be an election year conversion only after they see that the Republicans have the votes to confirm him\nYou know showing if I could just jump in ... when he ate it this brilliant summary of the house for his case do you know but Republican congressman exposed headsets associates by it was Richard Nixon\nI teach today and spectator usa because I went back I looked at my notes of my conversations with Nixon during the Clarence Thomas hearings and Mike Rowe is all of that mix\nAnd the way for those I don't know I mean how many years did you work with and for a former President Nixon\nFor years for Nineteen Ninety ... Ninety four Sean and I was there in Nineteen Ninety button during the Clarence Thomas hearings with Nixon and Mike confident in usa\nMight that have Republicans should have foreseen that's a thought on Kavanaugh because Nixon certainly did twenty seven years ago you know they they they they're\nThey're all on\nAnything that anybody that's good in the sense but certainly anybody who believes in the principles that we believe that this country great if they stand in the way the left left will destroy dominant take them out Clarence Thomas ... cabin on it doesn't matter for them it's not

the FBI now investigate them if this is the new standard Jonathan\nNo because that's not our authority that those are local crimes that happened now the case of we need a Broderick though however um he that would have been a state matter because the the time a Bill Clinton was the attorney general\nYou know and so but here's the thing is that you keep saying and and Daniel well have you been here for you keep missing and so many people that are emotionally involved with this\nIf you take the emotion out of it I Know that's difficult because people are very passionate\nBut if you take the emotion out of it and you look at the investigative facts there are none\nAnd there's not going to be any because it doesn't matter\nWho you question the very people that uh the the the the alleged victim claims were the closest to the to the electric crime\nDon't know anything and so if you go out in a perimeter away from the people who the victim says was was there and you interview other

case quickly falls to the side\nAnd I certainly agree with Jonathan totally right and the the the problem is that and then also the fact that the FBI is being used outside of their authority for a political matter and that scares me as a former FBI agent that scares me because that is the that's the thing that totalitarian I'm a governments do\nLook look I agree I I think that one thing that's important got activists want us\nTo stand it here this is not a criminal investigation uh this is an investigation and to conduct that may or may not have beer in a way that somebody gets a lifetime appointment [laughter] um and I understand and I agree that this is the kind of extremely political and extremely emotional and I think that's partly because\n... is an important question do you have any corroborating witness for any corroborating evidence at all you can say right now\nThat have been on the question that as an unseen\nAre really high at an unfair question Jonathan I don't think it's unfair to them\n... well I I think when we say fair or unfair I think what it is is on the Senate question I'll tell you why didn't you know because people are so again angry and people are saying I Believe her I Believe him but in this case there's just no other witnesses there is no other evidence and so when you're asked if you\nFeel this passionate about something and somebody says

Democrats had just an adequate rate\nAll of checks and balances the trains that treatment this government they are now you think that you don't ... I guess it early and and it's time for us to stand out and can\nCan make a law firm asked me that long ago and we had\nThey purposely gone against police officer and it's all just systematic now they want for us to try cases\nIn the court of public opinion and then it's not how the United states that are on the United states it different country because of our lives and because of our judicial system and the color line for an agency and if we can uphold down we fail to be accounted for sure how like movie no better than any other dictatorships and the horrible\nYou know things that you see happening in other places in the world\nWasn't this is what makes us unique this is what makes us special this has worked very well for us in in our two hundred and fifty year plus history\nThis is what keeps America different there are countries where you're guilty until proven innocent um I uh things have gotten so overwhelmingly over the top so extreme in each case where where judge Kavanaugh has been accused\nAnd the accusers mention names of people\nAnd whatever evidence that they would have to corroborate their story it has fallen apart each and every time we watch this man go through the agony of crying repeatedly on national TV Now we hear some senators saying well he may not have the temperament look at how angry he was when he was defending himself\nWell I I don't know what they think the approach\nAnd senator saying well you may not have the temperament looking out angry he was when he was defending himself\nWell I I don't know what the sink the appropriate response is if you're accused of drugging young teenage girls and systematically raping them on an almost weekly basis I don't know what the appropriate response is but I think if I was innocent and somebody said about me I'd be pretty pissed off\nAnd I'd want people to know I Want people to see the righteous indignation in in me that I did not do this\nAnd the passion that that that is behind that those words that I Am speaking\nThat's not me that's not who I've ever been that's not who I Would ever be I'm not that person I never did that how do you say that in a way I mean it's supposed to say it like no I'm a minister these purchase\nNobody's going to believe that most human beings as I felt the judge Kavanaugh as the ... was role I bet you he's never been that angry and emotional and his wife\nBut the circumstances warranted it based on the seriousness of the allegations against him I don't know any other way that a human being would otherwise react\nAbsolutely I call that righteous indignation that are quite believe this I Believe that the man\nHas spent his entire life wanting to be a judge and get everything that he needed to do to get to that tradition and he is also like he sat on multiple occasions\nThat justice system flock to itself\nIt is intended to protect the innocent and instead what we're seeing if he is absolutely being attacked by them very alive she has spent his life upholding which is he the defendants does not have to prove their innocence is on the prosecution\nTo prove someone's guilt and they're completely foot thing that the tide and we cannot\nLet it go to for a second Michelle that he gets on the Supreme Court after going through this experience and he's a judge and now he more than anybody I think it's going to have a heightened sensitivity to the idea of\nThe presumption of innocence right I I Wonder in many in a weird way God works in mysterious ways\nThat he may not become one of our best justices ever based on this process and based on what has happened to him and his own life experience with us\n[noise] absolutely I completely agree I mean especially when she's managing the semi name can understand how it feels to be treated when you're in a sink um you know end up against it and I mean she is the highest level in the land they're just not somebody that they just\nPulled over on the side of a road you know he's being treated by police officers many hundreds that have the right in the highest levels and they just will system where all of these you know the highest\nSecurity clearance that is available because somebody that's not the kinds of the United states\nMichelle near the coast toward nuclear weapons or Eighteen days ago you had an impeccable reputation as character was never put in question Eighteen days ago

that no we ought to pray for professor Ford um I Know I wasn't that good a ten year old that sounds like a pretty special to me\nAbsolutely and we all need to be praying because this is I don't believe that this is just against Republicans and Democrats there's a spiritual more going on here\nAbsolutely and we didn't train because I don't ... the Republican Democrat spiritual more like a hair and on an area\nWhere any time you buy is Michelle I Hope you're out there in North Carolina matters a eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the program\nMary is

I have a lot of different questions I actually live on Long Island don't want them at one of the things that I've taken note so that's how the liberal media completely distorts the facts and puts it out and then let you do due diligence or pay attention and Fox News um you totally miss\nWhat reality is I mean you have to go to the Senate Judiciary committee review their timeline of investigation to show what they actually investigated before they even had this saddens FBI investigation you out there like\nBecause if you just pay attention and the liberal media I think they said they said nothing that that that did that didn't even\nGet Brett Kavanaugh of that and instead they they made him so many different times at this point and now once now that's coming out that they have nothing more fully completely\nUm the allegations are totally on on substantiated and yet now they're going into the fact that always drank some school and like you said always they said oh it's true I said
