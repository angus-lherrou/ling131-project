child will tell you later that you have become so much smarter than you used to be\nYes I like I'm only help in those days [laughter] it's come and don't worry\n[laughter] hey I Want to start by thanking you about some and I have been listening to you for a few years and recently I open an online bank account and then afterwards ... listening to it\nIncentive to do so by the same bank so I called up immediately and I I Am eligible led by like it's getting my teeth by two days you just made me a thousand bucks I Would never know if I hadn't listened to\nWhile okay so that deal is now gone so I don't even know if I should mention that bill was since no one else can get the thousand that you've got but I'm Glad that you grabbed it when we had bad out there\nYeah I that I didn't notice it on on their website so that was awesome thank you\nSure well we can make the mother money let's see if I can help\nSo I my husband and I have a sense um my son was born he Fifteen now do you question\nSo it got four years ago and she was saying that they're giving me a little and you know one is that market right now you know seeing as the timeframe that we're now under the second is that we live in New Hampshire which is the second highest in state college tuition the country average college tuition here thirty grand so\nWhat you're going to need over the other side of the story though for your fellow Americans that is that New Hampshire has overall lower taxes than most other states\nSo there is a tradeoff\nThat is truly don't have any income tax but they all get you in one way or the other I pay a huge amount and property tax it washes\nOut I think in the end [laughter] okay it's a great place to live though I'm not complaining about my state okay [laughter]\nSo we have about last week we had a hundred and thirty five thousand they account today we have a hundred and twenty eight\nOh 'cause of the market decline what what are you invested in in the five twenty nine are you in the age space portfolio or are you in something of that\nBut we are an age they portfolio and I looked in preparation to call and it you know fifty percent well only thirty one percent stocks bonds at fifty one percent so they've already taken into account that I get nervous considering I think we have most of the money we're going to need hopefully\nSo I'm just wondering when cash preservation comes into play it versus growth\nWell you're shallow breathing I can get it right\nSo you may be at that point you know I Would I Would encourage you to stay age base 'cause we don't know at what point the market does go through serious decline and since you're at a point that the movement in the market only has a thirty percent effect on the college money\nI Would encourage you to stay engaged base except I've heard you loud and clear you've got the money you're going to need so going into\nA fund that just preserves the cash is fine for you to do and then you'll just rest easy threw his four years of college\nThat was kind of my my brother and when they were four hours come freshman year\n[laughter] one problem at a time\nRight right so you know if you know most people are not in the position that you were in that you've already been able to save a hundred percent of the cost of undergraduate school and since you have done that been forget the classic advice I Would give of being in the age based\nMix and just go into the the thing that will preserve the money and you won't have to worry the next four years\nAnd so even going and buying them and that could potentially lose money too right\nYeah there are as interest rates rise on bonds which they are the value of bonds you hold go down and then you've got enough years with the higher interest rate should counteract quite clearly some of the decline and the value of those bonds\nBut again you've already hit the goal line you've already done it okay you've already scored the touchdown\nThere's a take victory laps for four years do it and you learn a little puny 'em out and the and the preservation find you might earned a couple of percent per year and that will help a little bit with the cost of inflation and tuition over the next few years to just take that victory lap\nI Am writing as we speak\nAll right that's the EU and besides you got a thousand dollars on that savings bonus pet is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Ted\nHey Clark how're you doing today\nGreat thank you Ted you or I had at the end of a line you've been trying to get to enter while tell me how long this path of getting rid of debt has taken you\nAh well we started really seriously about three years ago and um we had three credit cards within our whole debt total and we're we're actually paid off too and we are in the process of getting the third one paid off by November\nCongratulations ... tested\nYeah we're kind of excited about that it's been a been a dark cloud over us for a few years so but I did have a question um once we pay off the third and final credit card should we keep one of those accounts active all three of them active or should we just cancel all three\nYou want to keep all three active\nAnd that's really key to your credit score your credit score has been rising probably all through this three year pay down process is using less and less severe available credit if you close accounts it will actually affect your credit score negatively because it will show last available credit\nIn your credit scoring mix so are are you going to be tempted though to use them\nIf the accounts stay open and you don't want to do that\nEither I I don't think so and less like something major happens um we really\nBecause you need more of a cash you\nCould cut them up but we I accounts open so you'd who are prevented from using the cards\nAnd you would have the benefit of having the cards active it will be a a decent while before any of the three credit card operators decide you've been an active too long and they are going to end voluntarily close your account\nOK you can let those run for a while the ideal thing would be twice a year to use each of the cards for one small transaction and that we keep them totally active and you wouldn't have to worry about an issue we're trying to get rid of you okay\nCongratulations to you on the discipline living on less than what you make so you could pay off this that that was just it sounds like it was a burden in your life\nIt was and are a target date as the spring of two thousand Twenty one will be totally debt free\nCongratulations on that as well it feels fantastic owing nobody on earth any thing [noise] Kenny is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Kenny\n... folks at all\nSure Kenny you have a question

house and I have about almost Fifteen Percent safer downtown so\nSome of my friends were saying you know ... to get the twenty percent they all have to deal with mortgage insurance and I'm trying to gauge does it hurt or help me more to do it for all and K loan to get to that twenty percent well first thing\nThey have to come up with that five percent any more\nYou can do a alone where you put a Fifteen Percent down and you're able to get to the twenty by doing a very small second mortgage\nAnd that would negotiate you having to borrow from the four one K. and these are known is eighty Fifteen five ... where you borrow I'm eighty percent on the first mortgage\nBut they all get very very good reviews so it's really the system works best for you the costs of the equipment it's very

how all the countries that people are fleeing by the thousands thousands of miles just to get the hell out of their own home country\nI think right now politically all of this a cruise to the benefit

down there with the orange vests the yellow vest whatever color of their\nDay to day glowed vests they know day glow they uh they are a left wing or is from America who are down there organizing them

information\nThey're involved in making sure no one talks about this this stuff but\nBut that's about it I think right now this makes the Democrats look bad and it makes the Republican position look I think most people agree that we shouldn't allow caravans of many thousands of people to just flow into the country and received a\nPackage of benefits or whatever it is that they're expecting play station in Buffalo wings and and an apartment in a job I played the audio yesterday one of the organizers the media says it's not organized they're lying about that\nAnd I'm ... and once it reaches

will be shot you know\nBe killed because that'd be good for them that they ah\nDon't know you got to break a few eggs of economic and\nAnd they they think that the worm will turn\nOnce they reach the

claim from what I understand\nYeah right that's right well now what what I mean you said we should cut off money flowing to these corrupt governments and the corrupt government in Honduras
