right outside Denver\nSo in Denver it's become impossible for someone in the middle class job to buy a home right now\nIt's just the way it is and it's been very frustrating to people I read a story and the last few days I forget which\nI think it was in the Financial Times that did a story about how there are people and middle class professions in Denver they are actually choosing to move

don't know how people do it is you know we ate my wife and I we you know as a as a household we make well above the median income a site you know I I can only imagine for those people to make below the median income you know what they're facing\n... one of the issues in Denver which is not just to Denver a problem it is in other areas as well is the cost of land acquisition for builders\nAnd then the cost to permit the costs of hiring labor and the cost of material new homes are a out of sight and builders because of the base cost they have from ... things like that they only want to build larger more expensive homes\nTo try to make any profit out of the deal so are you really have to you and your wife really have to concentrate if you want to go ahead and buy now\nOn used homes but housing markets go in cycles and anybody who's been in Colorado where Utah for a long time knows the swings that have occurred in both states where the real estate going on a pendulum\nOf

[laughter]\nWell we definitely I definitely have patience and I'm looking for a long term and that's kind of relate to what my question was is I'm ... I'd be curious about is you know for for folks who by during when it's you know the the market's really hot\nUm are they worse off than than people who buy in a in a buyer's market you know just long term because\nYou know for for a second home no matter when we do as a second home you know housing values are going to be up or down or if we jumped and when things are very hot um I Would just fall under is long term that would impact the finances of and that if in a negative way\nThe way you make that test is by comparing the cost of renting today versus what you were effective cost of homeownership would be today\nIf when you take the cost of the mortgage taxes and insurance and add those together if they are more than twenty percent higher than what you can rent today\nTournaments and add those together if they are more than twenty percent higher than what you can rent today your best off waiting a while before you buy\nIf you can buy a place at a margin that is less than twenty percent higher\nFor current cost of mortgage Saxon insurance versus rent then particularly if you're going to own a property for a significant number of years which in an overheated market like the Denver metro area you want to look at a ownership window of ten years\nYou're comfortable in owning a house for ten years and you can buy a within that that price window I'm Talking about no more than twenty percent higher effective cost per month in rent then go ahead and buy [noise]\nOtherwise had away for a down cycle\nAnd they always come\nOn I think in my late [laughter] I think our focus is going to be or just you know stick it out in the apartment and to help 'em as much towards my student loans as possible for\nThat is a very effective strategy you know a lot of people don't feel like they've really settled down\nIf they're renting instead of owning but that is something that is um in some sense psychological and if you can get your financial house better in order and getting rid of student loans is a great thing to do and rent and let the market find new equilibrium\nI Would do just that\nJames is with us on the car coward show Hi James\n... ... ... ... it's\nGreat to have you here James here a little muffled sounding right now though\nSo sorry about that is all a little bit if that is better [noise]\nOkay my holds true for you is all with the fortune ... company I've been contributing to a traditional four one K. for at Seventeen or so years fall I currently contributed a eleven percent where they ... the match\nAnd Jeff fish mom or they had advised that they're going to start off the wall for one day so I'm kind of half way and so now you're tired and say I'm ...

answer the question yeah so my oldest brother\nThe address and they just go wherever and right now they're living in Arizona for six weeks and then they're going to go to Japan for four weeks and just wherever the deal is on a cruise ship or at a resort or travel internationally they're going to go to\nItaly for two months and the fall and they're doing everything on the cheap\nSo the question of where you Dahmer style I mean like I'm not going to give you the book cancer I'm gonna give you the real answer OK\nPer inch ditch for instance you know tax reasons yeah I'm sure injury and write\nA voting I mean how do you do that if you're if you're traveling\nRight so you establish residency wherever it's almost of convenience like a lot of people will register and Montana reduce the taxes are so favorable and that's where they'll Dahmer style or they do so in Florida you work for a state with no state income tax\nIs rule number one mhm and usually what you do is you do I'm now again this is not the book answer this what people really do okay if I give you the really do answer\nWhy I call okay so what people will do is if they have a friend or relative or whatever in a zero income tax state you Lisa room from them in their home and you sign up for these probably never use the room\nBut you just pay 'em like a hundred dollars a month to be able to call their place you're home\nSo you don't actually fish we have to own property and know your residency states\nKnow the big thing is you don't want to set foot ever in the state you live in now if you come from a high tax state you live in Connecticut and that's why we want to\nFind you say you're never and Connecticut again [laughter] right if you go if you go back to visit relatives in Connecticut you stay in a hotel\nIn somewhere else in the tri state area and you drive over to see 'em but you're not spending any time in Connecticut because the big thing in high tax states they're going to try to come back at you and say wait wait wait wait\nWe don't really believe you're a resident or whatever\nAnd you been here a lot you're not there are a lot when you leave Connecticut you leave Connecticut\nOkay so you just basically do the math figure out which is the most tax has been changed your state and decide to live there\nYeah and it practically what most people do is they do Florida Texas or Montana are the three that are done most often but there are special advantages to Montana and so if you\nLook around on the Web and then you'll see where people posted articles about why they use Montana as their

R. G. um cars are to go to dot org our our website has all of our brochures that are available we've developed information around I'm kind of understanding domestic violence sexual assaults\nUm other topics that we also have resources on her around dating violence and stocking and I'm strangulation and [noise]\nUm algae beauty cue survivors and I'm trying to think of we have we've developed a lot of resources over the years I'm\nSpecifically information around protection orders and sexual assault restraining orders which are something that um have have just kind of come on the scene in the last two years on that that's a another resource for sexual assault survivors specifically um we saw a gap in services around the fact that not every sexual assault\nA victim um is in a relationship with their with their perpetrators so\nSpecial resource available for them um as far as a limiting the contact that that person may have with with them through through a sexual assault restraining order so that's that's a a newer um resource that's\nAvailable um we also have um been involved in a a policy development and I'm\nAs it relates to responding to domestic violence and sexual assault incidences by law enforcement's\n'em and evidence collection protocols I'm so we've been a very engaged in in that process and and kind of bringing people together to work on improving and enhancing our responses to victims throughout the state\nI can see why you and I can see why Fifteen Years has gotten really [laughter] it does it gets a little crazy mhm\nSo what are some of the things you're seeing in North Dakota and have you seen any trends in the last few years\nWe've especially been in involved in in working with programs on that have been impacted by um\nThe Balkan Region um we have seen definitely a reduction and resources available for survivors um and I know United Way like you mentioned before addressing issues around homelessness has been something that we've become\nUm more and more involved in um our programs around the states have definitely become more involved in addressing issues as it relates to um homelessness because it's not uncommon for domestic violence or sexual assault to be a component or we\nSee a lot of victims of domestic violence and it's interesting we've even had a few men had our shelter who are victims and\nIt's it's so sad because even the the resources for emergency shelter for domestic violence victims or swim I Know locally abuses don't Research Center is usually fall and there's they're referring clients to United way's homeless shelter\nAbsolutely and that's could be said 'em all across the state um there has been a big increase in [noise]\nIn people coming to the state of North Dakota specifically for for employment for example and perhaps they've come with their partner and when there's an incident\nUm they're in need of shelter um and oftentimes they may want to get back to the area that they came from perhaps from another state or another part of the state [noise] um so our programs have been I'm\nKind of get stretched thin based on just having limited resources um as a result of that and also housing has gotten more expensive um and it seems like it's harder and harder to find 'em affordable housing for a lot of our survivors because they may not\nHave you\nKnow full time jobs or they may not be able to seek employment and in that moment because of the the um abuse that they've encountered um so there's a lot about economic issues\nThat I we were talking about this um before he went on air that it was found it interesting that that Seventy five percent of survivors of domestic violence staying abusive relationship like relationships longer due to the economic insecurity and you would would you say that's pretty accurate by what you were just saying that the housing costs then\nWould definitely say that that's a very accurate because um as I mentioned before housing is has been limited um shelter spaces is oftentimes limited um just based on\nUm with the communities have to provide 'em because it's it's more limited people are staying in ...\nBefore they can find 'em affordable housing yeah that's what we're seeing in Bismarck kick Courtney what advice do you have for someone going through domestic violence and I think it's very important for us to remind people that they're not alone um that there are support people out there that will lead to you and listen to you\nWe're looking out potentially an extra two hundred thousand that we need to make up so empty you\nAnd you can be number one [laughter] [laughter] you know if you really have been a number one in\nSo many ways and I just think of how you mentioned that it starts at the top and do good and ... and his wife pat and just\nShe I Wish you would have been at the kickoff because so ... to have an employee campaign we have a presentation of each of the you know subsidiaries and we do we do a little presentation and I'm Dave spoke at the one for resources group and he actually got choked up\nMhm oh he's a very ugly he really did talking about hunger in our community and homelessness\nIt was really he gave such a hurtful speech to every one and a degree we are so blessed to have that support starting right from him and rain so it allows you a little bit of time not much but a little bit of time that you're able to dedicate to working on the campaign right right\nMhm we have excellent support from our executive when we kick off our campaign every year it's with the taco in a bag up on the corporate campus and um the executives served at all so it's just great for the employees to come and see that and see them behind their and supporting it and\nSo how do you um you had said that one of the important things about um like caffeine is engaged in the executive what would be your advice to\nIndividuals that are trying to do that with the businesses that they work at like how do you get executive agreement I guess\n[noise] I think the best way um would be to get them out into the community and um maybe do some of the tours that the United way offers because that's really eye opening and when you go into some of those shelters or the different places and you see what's actually going on\nAnd what United way's trying to do in this community that that's just an eye opener and I I think that could be probably the first step because I think anyone that goes and does that you have to come back and think yeah this is something we need to do mhm\nNine I agree and you know we're actually having some tourists coming up on live United day right Amanda do yep so friday November night we've got 'em where is that ... that's just part of a RC abuse do Research Center we have um Charles Hall and then United place at\nEmergency homeless shelter and self anybody's listening as interested in having to wear of any of those agencies and having the opportunity to kind of a sea signed the scenes of the facility and ask some questions that need ... voice had I'm just kind of questioned about\nHow things are running operating and what resources available you can definitely come on fighting November ninth and we'd love to to answer all of those things and show you guys around\n... what motivates you personally to give of your time and your dollars to you know either way\nYou know Jenna I'm like I say I've always kind of felt that you have no way of knowing if some day you're going to be in one of those positions you're going to be one of those needy people you know you might suddenly find yourself without a job\nOr without a home maybe it's a medical condition you could you know being an abusive relationship I mean there's just so many things out there\nThat can happen and we can look at ourselves and say oh that'll never happen to me but yet we don't know that and you know I just think that ... you know just that aspect of it is what drives me is just to think that it could happen to me any day\nAnd to be able to step forward and help those people and help United Way help them to get their lives back on track\nThat's just so right in fact we've seen that we had an employee\nWho was um partner had a massive heart attack and had to stop working and they had to receive some short term assistant and I mean how quickly\nBills can add up it's just so heartbreaking and people say that you're only two paychecks away from that type of a crisis in your in your life and [noise]\nAnd so when I when I just think about people like you Paula who are giving so much of your time and your personality and energy to helping others I I'm so grateful for you or your ... I mean really really think you know so gratifying\nYou know it just is it just you\nVolunteer it out and you know when we deliver those Christmas presents to families to see the look on those faces of those kids and or when you you know hand out the backpack cars or things like that I mean you just walk out in your heart just wants to ... feel that you did good\nWell thank you to everyone at Mt you resources group including WPRI nights river and construction and and do you well Montana Dakota utilities you hey man\nI mean there were all so involved and we appreciate everything you do for making this community just really high quality community to live and we will be back in just a few minutes you're listening to the United way's community talk [noise]\n\nSuper ... news headlines and whether together I'm\nJim Walsh ABC News following these stories president Donald Trump hedge to Pennsylvania today to join the community in mourning eleven people were massacred at a synagogue the germs or a week away and gun control is once you get a major talking point following the synagogue killings in Pittsburgh\nThe Pentagon is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the southern border with Mexico this week\nTo North Carolina a woman was fired this week\nAfter a video of her yelling racially charged remarks went viral and your forecast sunny and fifty four today July partly cloudy overnight lows thirty four at your moral mixture of wilds in sun with a high near fifty ABC News at the top of the hour\nWe're breaking news and weather avenues up their followers on Twitter followers on baseball get super talked to ... dot com was it do\nYou think you know movies British installment of film trivia here's some things you may not have known about transformers age of\nExtinction\nCharged\nMichael Bay originally wasn't going to return to direct another transformers changed his mind after visiting the transformers riding universal studios\nWhen he saw people lined up for three blocks to get on the right he realized that he wasn't ready to give up the franchise\nThe agreement that level they worked out that he will return to direct\nAccording to the filmmakers marvel reform most of his own\nWay and in my early on got dumped step artist really did some sound as I'm working\nPartially shot the next three needed Campbell\nFilming and Hong Kong Michael Bay was assaulted by\nMovies says approach which is one John Goodman launch from the Big Lebowski\nJohn Goodman also provides the voice for the auto hound and this film\nFrom ... ... ... was destined to be the transformers movie because she sang touch wood just from\nThe animated movie transformers the move\n\nThem\nThat's it for this episode of you think you know movies there's a longer video version of this episode because even more facts you may not know available on screen crush dot com\nOh awesome to add up by some\nAlexa place it's from queens okay\n[noise] [noise]\nCloudy skies tomorrow high temperatures reach out to the upper forties Thursday with next to the patient possible at times turning much cooler friday with a ... and the low forties from the weather elegy leather center on staff meteorologist Jennifer ... chief ski I'm super top twelve Seventy currently it's forty three Dave Ramsey\n[noise]\nSuper taught well so [noise]\nWe'll come back to United way's community talk you're listening\nTo you know go and um industry is [laughter] that everybody's just\nSharing and I think so either they're heading the launch earlier are going to their noon or optimist meeting and they're truly that on the way and boy did we have some exciting information for you who you really do have a lot of ways to get involved and we really need it this year I I don't know what\nWe as a community are going to do if we can't raise the money through United Way that we need because we're making sure it's going where it's needed the most\n... and I said a presentation this morning I said well\nWhat what would you do if we don't raise enough funds where would you start cutting and we don't want to have to cut programs I mean\nWhat would you start which Martin ... kids going hungry or kids having a place for emergency shelter\nOr domestic violence and women are getting out of a relationship and seeking some refuge\nOr preventing and some of these issues through our healthy families program through Lutheran social services", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "30"}
