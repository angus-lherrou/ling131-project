very well on them cases tripled late in life now I'm curious about where you stand on buying a actual full you\nI'm a much bigger fan of you doing what you've done so you were buying gold exchange

it to you\nOften what they buy it back for me for us to store it you have to worry about theft it's not\nIs convertible as quickly and to cash is you have with the exchange traded fund it's much cheaper and much more efficient tone gold or any precious metal with an exchange traded fund any T.

well how are you\nGood you have a question for me about seeing if you're on track and on target have enough money to retire with comfort is that right\nThat's correct so I've gone on to um some retirement calculators on line and I get a enormously wide variety of answers\nAnd that so frustrating\n[noise] wow it's some some days I'm happy and some days I'm scared out of my mind though\nSo there is one thing as a retirement calculator that is more than playing horseshoes\nOkay you know there is no precision where the the closest there's been the precision is a tool that it was developed by a organization called financial engines\nBut generally is available to people if I remember right to people that work for a specific participating employer they use something known as Monte Carlo modeling\nThat takes projections and calculates in worst case scenario based on historical declines in the market and what age you are and all that and comes up with\nA best guesstimate about how close you already are targets and how likely you are to never run out of money\nOkay but again as I as I recall that's only available to people at participating companies unless they have some consumer version now\nBut if you tried different calculators are a lot of organizations or less you use there's\nEven if you're not a customer of them you think of any of the big financial companies they'll have a calculator and usually you go to finality investments and use theirs and they are all using different methodologies and that's why you'll see such variation\nIn who thinks here on target and who's not so if somebody who wants to rest easy at night\nYou find the one that says you are headed towards financial Armageddon unless you increase your amount you put aside by so much\nAnd you go with their very pessimistic projections to make it happen\nRight okay so the Monte Carlo model would that be something that if I met with a like a financial counselor they would have that available for me\nYes there may be there may be some that are ... subscribing to Monte Carlo simulations\nThat would be able to give you based on the all the various\nScenarios give you the likely outcome and it's not a certain outcome is ... percent outcome with ... percent odd that you will be okay if any of the tools you you have used have they shown us based on a per cent calculation\nNo it's just been basically you need this much per month and I'm your projection is that you'll have this much per month\nDollars okay and it's been all over the place so\nAnd that's and that makes it is clear is that could be that what I said is true and that that they're doing their best effort using the best methods they know but the likely outcomes are going to range so far\nYou know with certainty but somebody who is if you go to a um [noise] the only financial planner you know you might if you want to check up you might contact people with Garrett planning network\nAnd they charge you an on an hourly basis to give you advice and guidance and ask if they do Monte Carlo simulations about how you're doing and then you know if you've found somebody that you can pay on an hourly basis to run those analyses for you\nOkay gotcha\nBut I Will tell you that my general experience is that when somebody is asking the question you're asking and running the simulations you're

that hotels when you book far in advance tend to have a higher price that they are offering you\nPin they offer much closer if they're not going to be full so if you so if I had the booking hotel ends up full I've already got my room that I booked without risk way ahead of time but then much closer when I re shop\nI'd say probably at least eighty to Ninety percent of the time rates have dropped and

I think is the dark as it's ever been so I don't think it works\nToday in fact I think we know I think this is the maximum we could put it in the studio probably just saying it's our studio yeah yeah but if everybody in a so did you have some questions for car ah\nAh I Know what he wants to we're going to get into the text up a little bit but of course there was curious what you are at the end ah you know you you just finished your rain as Mr America and a lot of people around the country want to know what you're up to now so so go ahead Dave\nAnd I think it's really interesting that you know when we are talking between breaks\nThat car still has a heavy schedule of travel probably not as much as when you are the reigning\nMiss America but it's kind of cool to hear someone maybe maybe I can tell some of the clients you know you're traveling here this next week and uh you know what it's like to be out of the role of current Miss America because you're always gonna be Miss America to thousand Eighteen so\nTell us a little bit about what you're what you're doing right now\nYes I have my tied up with America should as an Eighteen about three weeks ago\nAnd so the first two weeks I came back and kind of the compressed figure out what it is that I Want to do an upcoming year I had a lot of people reach outlined to me as a former Miss America\nAnd we weren't able to hear my story or you know instances that happened over the last year that want to hear it now and so that's very fortunate that I'll be able to continue speaking to her and throughout the next year maybe year and a half we'll see how long that way of goes\nAnd that really I've been speaking I've universities thought I was just in Atlanta at Coca Cola scholars and forgetting to speak at the Robert Koch was pretty amazing\nI'm you know all these opportunities very similar to that I had as this America but now it's kind of on my terms and the content is all mine um I don't know I'm no longer censored or I'm being kind of control as to what I can and cannot say which has been very nice\nAs well that's probably been the ... was that the most frustrating thing you had by hurting Miss America is not being able to really express who you are and what what ... what do you want to say to your audience out there as well right\nOh absolutely absolutely and so getting to talk about things that I'm passionate about such as to make a wish foundation um chose miracle network hospitals and the cost of education and health care issues and those are all things that I excited now um to go out and be able to talk about\nSo go ahead and I just I just worry about that mold that you were placed into rates have missed America um were you comfortable with them most of the time or was a very uncomfortable most of the time\nAt the start of the year my my job is amazing and I absolutely loved it and we ended up having a leadership change a ... about three months and\nBut most of the time was very uncomfortable most of the time\nI'm at the start of the year my my job was amazing and I absolutely loved it\nAnd we ended up having a leadership change a ... about three months and and it's slowly um got to the point where it was an uncomfortable working environment and it's getting to talk about that too as a twenty four year old how do you kind of navigate um those waters\nAnd especially when you are a public figure and you're always going to be a public figure I'm making sure that everything you say and do is accountable you're open your chance parents make sure that for all others um they can look up and say you know she spoke out I think I can to if they're ever innocent and I said sure\nI think the challenges that or what a lot of people don't understand and is that it really is just a job isn't it it is it is\nAnd um yeah I mean you're traveling across the country are changing locations that every forty eight hours and you are an employee of the organization and so they're set standards when you're an employee that should be out here to no matter what that businesses\nSo you know Puerto Rico is part of what the brought you\nInto the limelight was um you know looking at her from the ... of the situation of you know promoting\nOur state right and then a greater vascular for that I mean\nIt's really cool that do we have a somebody coming out of or large states there's more to that for the first ... North Dakota representative being Miss America what does that mean to you what I mean really whoa whoa whoa what was the heartbeat behind the\nYeah oh it was it was amazing um that night you know I had the schools making history for the call and I didn't know what that meant that meant making top five we've never had\nUm a woman in the top five we only ever had three and top ten and so it's like if I can make it a top tenant maybe top five I think I'll do just that and it ended up you know that I walked away with that title which was a huge honor in itself and then there's also a big responsibility with it when you're the first one to do something you kind of set the precedent\nOf you know what it means to be a North Dakota Miss America\nUm and so that was something that I always thought about and knowing the legacy that I Would leave I'm being the first and worth Dakota was always a huge aspect that will follow me so\nGo ahead with of course in ... I'm a I'm I'm a on tourists was probably outside of maybe a little bit of controversy to jihad during during your rain uh what was the biggest thing that stood out for you during the year\nI'm of exciting thing yeah you know something that uh you know fifty years you know you're going to look back and say oh my goodness I was I thought of getting prone\nUm is America I mean there's something that really happened do during the course of the year that was that was truly exceptional\nYeah it's it's pretty funny so I competed for years to win the title of Misrata and that was the goal I never thought that I'd be Miss America I never thought I Would see a girl from North Dakota become Miss America\nA and so my third year competing I had already graduated college I didn't have a backup plan I was going to be missed North Dakota\nAnd unfortunately that year I was first runner up and I was crushed and I didn't have a job and have a way to pay back my student loans and so very fortunate to get an internship with senator Hoeven in DC and that kind of feel my passion for lying for politics\nUm but here I was an intern in DC and I thought you know maybe I'll come back and compete one more time for the titles miss North Dakota and so and I Miss America senator Hoeven actually asked me to be his gas at the state of the union so and about a year and a half I went from an intern\nAnd so when I Miss America senator Hoeven actually asked me to be his gas at the state of the union so in about a year and a half I went from an intern for the Senate or to his featured guest um which is pretty remarkable and I think I was the youngest person\nOr in the gallery at the state of the union and it was it was just one of those great moments because you know that I got to represent North Dakota\nI'm and everyone that made me who I Am\nNow it's pretty cool story you know I think what's really cool is the\nPerseverance is that we all need but especially you are saying you know I was runner up north Dakota but I you know I still think I can become miss North Dakota and then ultimately become Miss America because you had to go in there say I know I can do this\nOr I can become North Dakota's first Miss America\nAbsolutely absolutely and you know every year I kept thinking I felt I felt I felt and then when I finally did win\nA detailed miss North Dakota I felt so well prepared for Miss America that on that final night on the telecast I wasn't nervous I competed how many times and then I was so well prepared an even throughout my year as Miss America there were so many times where it was like I've done this before um you know I'm I'm so well prepared\nFor the giants you know we we talk a lot about a day when I Do a lot of ... in the country and across the state and the two messages and I was going to class or perseverance perseverance and consistency is the fact that you were and I didn't know about you you you actually ran from his nap Dakota on four times\nMhm I did and you were passed over\nThree other times just to get to miss North Dakota and then when you become Mr North Dakota you become Miss America\nMhm incredible now you know was really\nCool Islam through all the other contestants that became miss North Dakota gone I Do Miss America\nOh yeah [laughter] yeah\nYeah I or ... you remember the question that they ask you um you know I think it was was that back down to the top five they ask you a question do you remember that question\nYeah it was on my thoughts on the Paris accord and President Trump's decision to plot\nSo okay and what was your what was your reply I remember I mean I was I\nRemember yeah in that moment I mean I wasn't nervous about it you can just go into\nUm you know auto pilot and so however you feel is what comes out and I said you know whether you believe in um climate change or not it's the importance of being at the table and having a voice on and so I didn't agree with that and even during my years Miss America\nUm there's a quote that had a summer summarizes my ear and it's related that onstage question actually and I heard it on the road and it's a fight for a seat at the table because if you're not the table you're on the menu\nPossum rivers surgeon really really good so we're talking about technology I mean what do you see this last year been Miss America and being in different going to different\nUm companies and seeing what was going on what what stuck out in your mind is something that was like wow this would really cool that we're doing here in the United states says anything come to mind\nYour brain as Miss America\nUm and would you do it over again\nI still sits at city they I've got this question a lot\nAnd and I'm very fortunate to have bent Miss America like a it's a title that's going to follow me throughout the rest of my life and it's given me a platform and a microphone to now speak out where if I face these kinds of issues and didn't have that platform microphone I don't think it would have as big as Evan of an impact my voice slide\nAnd so despite the fact that I had quite a few struggles the last nine months\nAnd that was just nine months and the impact that can make now is going to continue to last a lifetime and so I I wouldn't change the title earning the title if I could have changed the circumstances a little bit sooner maybe I'm ... everything's in retrospect now\nSo we have to talk about technology a little bit on the show of course oh I'm so we're going to do a little version of ap or is now and a car as being surprised by this of course but ... says\nI'm going to give you an out by having my phone and you're going to try to out do me with an app you have on your phone\nAnd cable is that so so first of all you are an iPhone or Android user name and I thought it was even better cause them Android\nSoda as you are on my phone to okay and on their Android so\n... and Jim Will be the the great yep so Jim is destroyed as well so so we're we're all old\nMen yeah yeah and ah so it's it's interesting ah the dynamics between iPhone users and Android users but ah so I started off since your calendar so important to you you know I use the most basic calendar\nSo how about you I ... a ... your favorite what's your favorite part of the older\nI'm I'm a huge apple you know the fact that um that innocence for anything that um you know being able to have it right on my phone and goes to my laptop ... whatnot\nIs it so it festival is so easy you know wherever I may be the ability to share it with other individuals\nUm I work calendar actually went from the calendar on the I found to them being Google Calendar and everything like that being able to color code being able to do or whatnot like that and it just that being instead that change as um where the other calendar it might have taken a while I had to redo my phone to see those changes where girls counter I get it immediately\nI think my favorite part of it or the other than all of that has all ... is the map speech or or do you throw the address in there\nAnd after a while it actually gets to know where you're at and they'll say hey you should it gives you remind is like you should leave now so you can make your next appointment type of deal you know which I think is kind of cool so that yeah oh yeah yeah if you put the address in the first thing it'll actually start to learn your habits and say you know especially if you don't leave quick enough\nOr it'll actually every money they've you should put this on your phone too that's just saying that's the main cause it will actually start nudging you a little bit you know this meaning now so I'm\nCurious what your was what kept you use is the most on your phone\n... its shifted a lot over the last year I Would have to say I'm Instagram is probably my most students at\nWork I especially with the demographic that I'm reaching that you know is interested in the things that I'm doing at this point I have my largest following than any other country what's your most used that\nWould probably say that as well Facebook social media things\nOr um you know just ... yeah you know we can probably when I go to the mall you know they were about you [noise]\nYou know I'm starting to get more\nI've never been a Facebook fan and then recently with what's come out about being happy in a kind of like that going to as I can do it or not um but you know I'm I'm getting into\nA more of the of the Facebook but Lincoln has been really good as a business person to stay connected with a lot of people out there so\nLincoln or you know um and it became it became more prevalent this year I'm just at all the people that I was meeting and share and what not\nI'm not sure I'm trying to think of is what my actual most used to happen it would probably be wow I Would say Google Drive cars I'm and drive all we're creating ... I'm In an ever know to keep ... almost on every note so Jim pulling Michael ... what do you know the most\nYou know what the heck you thank you I'm I'm a Facebook guy okay definitely Facebook all the way\nSo do you do you ever do you spend more time on Facebook on your mobile than you do in a desktop\nI spend way too much time on Facebook on my mobile okay I mean my wife and I both were serious heavy duty Facebook be okay and what's funny is that uh you know my wife and all you know how old you know we're all about the same way here uh we seem to be the uh the big demographic for Facebook anymore it's not that the younger folks they have done to other they have Instagram\nNow yeah those are the ones that that the younger people are no you\nAbsolutely have also you mentioned a Lincoln that's another good one I found that very useful and and also Twitter Twitter's fun\nYeah Twitter is fun I I Will I I didn't give a lot of credit Twitter right away you used Twitter quite a bit correct\nAnd but I have realized that same thing about the demographics and it is you know according to statistics on my Instagram account it's those that are between the ages of Thirteen to twenty eight and and that's the primary demographic and then I go on to Facebook and it's so interesting the difference in comments um you know what younger people are looking for in social media\nBut the older people um admire ah you know it can be something just as simple as that you're wearing a little more conservative on base that\nI'm ... and those are kind of trends that I've seen that I just interesting room as the millennium\nSo you're stuck in the airport for a couple of hours you catch up with all the communication is going on and whatever you got a half hour to kill what you go to out for that you have the game was something on your phone catch up on social media a little bit more\nI think just catch Anthony et cetera Catholic all the different avenues of social media someone you feel like you finished when you realized you just didn't want that and then you have to go to the next day and the next um so I kind of you know while they each have their own specialty I kinda wish that there was more of just one place to go to other than having to balance so many different avenues you're\nSure I'm Dave ... when when we were reading well\nI think the key that we all kind of run
