the\nPowerball and what's the other one called mega millions I think whenever I don't play lotteries anyway there are a lot of people who are really end of this kind of thing and particularly people that are older\nFor decades had been swindled by a con artist usually overseas\nBritish lottery scams\nThat people were getting calls saying they had won the lottery in the United kingdom or this one or that one or the other one from Germany and then there are a lot of them that were\nUm callers from uh\nEurope or Africa saying that people one lotteries and more recently it's been out of the Caribbean and regardless of where they come out of the Caribbean they're referred to as the Jamaican lottery\nScams or Jamaica it's packed with us and actually\nA lot of them do actually operate other

again and again\nNo matter what the pitch no matter where in the world that comes from and what I Need for you to know as as your parents' age\nYou got to get more involved over time they may have more time on their hands they may be getting lonely and they may be too trusting you got to be involved there's even a federal law now\nTo help federal prosecutors prosecute these crimes because they are such a continuing problem but catching the bad guys\nIs so difficult and the financial harm can be catastrophic because once they have an elderly person on the hook and they get them to pay any money they call again and again was story after story about why they have to pay more and more\nMoney\nUntil it can end up being in the many thousands of dollars you know what's going on you know with

or something like that you tell them the incentive is\nEvery dollar they don't spend you're going to match with a dollar to create that concept\nSo somebody comes up with a free card like usa\nNow my kids grew up with usa spending cards or whatever they call them where you have parental control and all that it's all free\nI get free I don't get paying for these things but ultimately I can tell you

Mr Howard oh great but please call me Clark\nAlright clerk I'm I have a question for you I Am in high school are about to go to college and I just wanted to know what I should invest in 'cause I'm thinking about investing about a hundred dollars a month [noise]\nAnd I really want to start investing [noise]\nOkay so\nMost people are going to college you're only spending money how are you in a position you're going to be able to invest you working while you're going to school\nYes sir I have a part time job right now and when I'm In college I uh to get into another part time job\nWow so for example you so you're like\nSeventeen Eighteen Nineteen somewhere in there\nWow so for you so you're like Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen somewhere in there\nYes there\nWhile okay we're not related are we [laughter] no I don't think so\nBecause I started my first IRA when I was Nineteen years old\nBecause I really was working while I was in school and so the beauty is that when you put money aside as a late teens or in your twenties the money has a chance to grow and grow and grow because time is your friend your ally\nAnd because you're working ... something called a Roth IRA which would be my favorite place for you to look at stashing you're a hundred dollars a month\nIf you've ever heard of ... you know what that is\nI'm not sure what the differences between a Roth IRA in a regular IRA\nSo a lot of hate your age you don't want to do a regular IRA because you're not going to a guy in a high tax bracket or Ross IRA works backwards from a regular IRA regular IRA you get our current benefit on your taxes but everything that the money would accumulate over the decades\nFor the next gosh forty years\nWould grow tax free but then every penny you'd end up with would be taxed with a raw that's the opposite you get no current tax benefit but everything that that money grows to be over the years becomes years tax free\nSo that's why I particularly when you're young doing the Roth is a vastly superior option\nIs er at Clark dot com I have information Grayson on choices I'd like you to look at\nTo put that Ross money and you can put in a pop to what you earn in a year but never more than fifty five hundred [noise] so you're a hundred dollars a month as long as you're earning more than that you're good to go to do the Ross\nAnd once you have a thousand dollars is really easy for you to open one of the really great Ross IRA investment choices [noise]\nOkay so Grayson if you go to my investment guy to Clark dot com I'll take you through how to set up the raw\nAnd then what you should invest in in that raw you know where you could do the raw and then based on where you go what to invest in and you're off to a great head start and I think that's really exciting\nYes sir I Want to start early just you know so I can have the money for retirement\nWill you start as early as you're starting you may be able to retire significantly earlier than most people are going to be able to do so good for you David with us on the Clark Howard show hello David\nHey car payment you are getting married I Am well congratulations to you that\nThey get so much a June third oh [laughter]\nRight or another June wedding you know the people in the wedding business get overwhelmed every June\nFollowed that [laughter]\nWell how can I be of service to you\nWell as the advice of any marriage counselor I think they tell us that you know it's important that we enjoying a bank account and I currently bank with a lot of the biggest banks and so basically\nYou know we both used direct deposit we use a debit cards and credit cards for\nBasically you know we both used direct deposit we use a debit cards and credit cards for\nI Would say Ninety nine percent of all of our purchases and then you know what what we do put all the credit or we'd be able to pay off but right now since we are going to be enjoying a bank shall we want to find the best and banks that's going to be for us\nWhether it is with a major bank or something small you know we want to add that online banking option we still want to have the option to be able to write checks of need the still be able to get cash from an a an ATM that's not gonna you know hurt us with the ATM costs and\nThose sorts of things as we're we're overlooking for\nSo I got several things to say number one I normally don't recommend that you merge all your finances right away but what I tend to white for a couple to do and I should ask first how old are you and your bride to be\nI'm thirty and she's a twenty nine\nOkay so you've been out in the world for a while that's especially when I don't like for a couple to merge everything especially not at the very beginning I think there's an enormous advantage and having his accounts her accounts and their account\nThat you have a household account where you take care of the household expenses like rent\nOr mortgage or utilities anything that is a obviously and expense of life living together\nAnd then that you each continue to have your own separate accounts as well and you agree up front how much each of you will put into the joint operating account because people come into a marriage with different ideas about money\nAnd I don't want you to be in a position where you assume one thing about her she assume something about you and then it becomes a flashpoint for disagreement about how each of you sent your values with money and priorities\nOkay over time you may find that becomes necessary and you completely merge everything but I think at first it's best to have his hers there's okay\nAs far as as where I like for you to look at putting money do either of you do much investing\nA I Believe or you know we are both worked for the state so we uh we uh we ... invest in the retirement system and\nRichard don't you don't have like an investment account with the stock brokerage or anything like that and\nYou know okay now\n'cause that's my first go to is usually the best\nUm accounts for checking and for ATMs and all that are with the stockbrokers but if that's not part of your life and your state employees I Would like you to look at doing your joint household account with the credit union available to you in your state to state employees okay\n'cause credit unions are owned by if you open an account or will be owned by you and your bride to be\nYou know you're you're an owner of the place so they're not trying to rip you off they're not trying to come on you and they're going to offer you a jet straight up deals at the credit union and you may have an office or offices right near the state facilities you work out\nOK so that would be my favorite and over time\nYou'll know when it's the right time for you\nSo that would be my favorite and over time you'll know when it's the right time for you to um jettisoned having any separate account of yours her having any separate account of hers\nOkay here and it's usually really advise that you keep each keep your own account if you have really different ideas about consumption\nYou know what I mean if you want to be really loves to shop and the other would be happy never to walk in a store is that right either of your deals\nOh absolutely I mean we are I'm more of the savers she's more of the ... there's\nSo then I Would say for longer than you might imagine it will make sense for you to have to separate accounts but congratulations on your wife starting together on June third you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nOne hundred percent

you're famous spreading you're famous spreading throughout the country they\nWell you know I Wish a dead girl or a geek who actually started the radio show where he's been on a cruise for two weeks so

washing your day you know to multiple times in DC we're two weeks away from the election you got a tougher in North Dakota you got a tough battle up there ah fortunately it looks like maybe not so tough about it looks like miss Heitkamp is gone\nWhich is good news good news for North Dakota good news for the countries that I'm a looks nonetheless you have a race that says this year\nWell we've got some interesting things going on in and Jack is a a talk show host of his own and what's the name of your talk show jak\nWe are behind the curtain day for behind the curtain rod cats out of Arlington, Virginia All right we're we're syndicated by radio America\nAnd you have your is your show like once a week\nI should say I'm it say yes it is a a weekly show it's a weekend show weekend terrestrial radio show with kind of a daily podcast and then it is also signed will cast on Newsmax TV which which has a lot of viewers up your way\n[noise] so how long you have how long have you been hosting that are behind the curtain\nI had hosted behind the curtain for eleven years if you can believe it eleven years which is a zero eleven which is a long time you know let them All right hold on for a long time\nWell you know it's it's interesting I've just been involved with the tech crunch here for for a couple of years and you know there's so much exciting news out there and obviously a tech ranch is talking about\nNew technologies and um you know knowing a little bit about yourself and maybe uh maybe the our listening audience would like to know a little bit more about jak Berkeley and I'd like to ask you a few questions about some of the cool a technologies that you've seen come across\nA your desk and the last few years but when I gave her French\nAnd what we we see a lot of them because we found a lot of them I mean we see them all so many things I mean the most interesting stuff whole probably in the just the waste disposal and the waste to energy issue you know there's all these people out there now that can\nTake waste out of landfills and and uh and and either burn it or converted into energy there's so many new technologies to help with waste I think what people like me need to do is a better job of getting things into the hands of government so our landfills don't have to be full\nAnd we can really get moving with some of that stuff or those that oh you know of your way there's all kinds of ways to make fracking safe and efficient and deal with the water efficiently and all that all kinds of fracking technologies in the last couple of years\nNow that certainly exciting or even in solar power which I thought it was a joke for so many years is finally getting ready to come on line I think\nSolar might be a little ten years away\nUsed to be fifty years away\nBut it's a they're closing in on some real solar power\nYeah I Know that a actually a there's a couple of my partners and we just bought an old hospital in Richardson us kind of flat roof on it and\nIt's only a there's a couple of ah my partners we just bought an old hospital in rich and that's kind of flat roof on it and there's a solar company in North Dakota and you always think like solar North Dakota and going no man and we have a lot of days of sunshine\nAnd uh so they get a ... they looked at our building and said you know you guys would be ideal for solar panels on your roof two and a half years uh we could get our investment back so you know that's\nPretty they were used to be like endings like that yeah not many things like that in the world\nNo that's for sure so [noise] you know since you're sitting there in the hot bed of of ah American politics or you know what what are you going to read in the hotel\nThat was going to say no that later on what's that I thought you were going to be sitting there in the hot tub\n[laughter] I don't know if ... if you are that's that's all right too [noise] so uh what do you ah what do you see in the mid term elections or you know where we get off topic here a little bit in regards to technology but\nYou know I think of we're listening audience would like to know what's what do you sense out there what kind of changes are going to be in the house and the Senate\nWill it looks like the IMF will take the sensitive I think you're going to hit Speaker Pelosi on January thirty might not because of the Kevin off a debacle it might not be as big of a democratic sweep it otherwise would have been they might have taken as many as fifty feet now he might get thirty if I had to ... I Would say policy\nWill emerge with like a three or four seat majority is all but sadly that'll be enough to put her over the top Republicans will hold the Senate they'll probably as one could add to probably had won tickets to fifty two I think that's most likely that what you're looking at an election not only fourteen days out\n[noise] yeah and boy I'll tell you what talking about the money spent on election day on advertising especially in our big race here with a high camp and Kramer I mean I don't think there's a day goes by where I don't have some kind of printed literature and newspaper ads and the TV ads\nAre just incredible they put a lot of money into this campaign both parties that's for sure\nDo yeah that's a good one of the most roles are showing Kramer I think going away even six to ten point so I think it's going to be hard I don't know how much of a racist really left up there [noise] uh but we shall see\nHe has a lot of uh independence and uh that's gonna be the uh as going to be the key I think it\nGave me a North Dakota if you were what percentage of the elected me some numbers on how many into me some numbers on all\nThat [noise] um in regards to a independent use it then it's like what percentage of the likely voters would be independent I\nI'm guessing that's probably a twenty percent twenty five who so\nIndividual is very high so you that's very high so yeah it is very very high that's why a ... billion in order to go to swing one way or the other\nBecause of because of those independents out there\nSo uh I always say that uh if you're a Republican you better be somewhat liberal and if you're a Democrat you better be somewhat conservative as how you get elected in North Dakota [noise]\nUm but so we got one other cool a measure that's coming up here and that is\nA measure number three for a recreational marijuana we got we got married a medical marijuana prove two years ago but we still have not got it out in the public yet and I think people are really frustrated about that\nWith California and Oregon and ah and Washington is that um they have a mandate that are there any new vehicles coming out cannot be diesel anymore really yeah so you ... your grandfathered in\nBut you can't burn diesel you can burn ... so\nWhich is which is a you know plant brace products and I think we're going to see\nThat happening in North Dakota we've got a definitely one plant that's gonna be converting in this brand new plant\nUp in Trenton is going to be making a ... D sun you can make ... from quite a few different products corn and soybeans um I you know one thing I haven't figured out yet is about\nUm sugar beets and whether we can utilize them for um for ... D so but there's going to be a huge demand for buy diesel in California and Washington and Oregon so [noise]\nBut there's gonna be a huge demand for buy diesel in California\nAnd Washington and Oregon so\nUh you know that's that's going to be a a a big market for our refineries here in North Dakota or to produce that I'm ... so ... so and um you know I'm I'm been looking at you know some of the things that that are happening in in the energy\nAnd environment when it comes to uh take a natural gas and utilizing it and some of our big issues in North Dakota has been flaring our gas right and so we've got we've got to try to figure out how we can take it from the wellhead\nAnd converted into a a a a clean um natural natural gas because our natural gas has a lot of um liquids in it and burns very very hot [noise]\nSo um besides how much oil we're producing are producing a lot of of natural gas\nAnd I'm looking at these conversions whether it's a liquid natural gas or compressed natural gas um is is definitely important [noise]\nUm you know we we jak um commented a little bit and I did too about the renewable side of things with a with solar indefinitely wind\nAnd uh one of these uh Mondays we are going to talk more about electric vehicles and what's happening out there I'm needing electric charging stations are state uh it was really lacking in that but I think there's going to be some uh\nUh some uh really new legislation coming out about that here this next a legislative session and uh that's going to be a ... this next legislative sessions going to be interesting because\nOur revenues are back up a little bit more and so we'll see um I think ah how we're going to use utilize some of those revenues in in in different areas\nUm and you know speaking of technologies um as as I've been understanding more about a a luxury cars and a electric vehicles\nThe ah you know the tendency is that who where's all this extra electricity skin to come from and you know North Dakota still produces so much a electricity from our power plants\nAnd er which used coal and one of the things that you know we've been pushed I'm kinda under the buses to clean up our environment with clean coal technologies and there are definitely getting\nBetter and better at that as we speak but ah we're gonna continue to need a lot of electricity um for for many things and especially a specially vehicles and I think that uh with the\nWith a new a president in in office and eat PA and stuff like that that kind of backed off and some of that but [noise]\nUm we still have plenty of needs out there and I think we need all forms of a of a fuel whether it's coal or oil or\nNatural gas or wind or solar in our state is very blessed to have have all of that with us [noise] um I'm there are a last break Oregon have our our last segment we're going to\nHave all of that with us [noise]\nUm I'm there are a last break Oregon and a half of our last segment we're going to have um I'm I'm ... and he's going to be talking a little bit about some new technology or I'm keeping hospitals up from you know the bad bacteria that\nPops in all the time so stay tuned for us and thanks for joining us on twelve step and to use the French [noise]\nSuper jock ... news headlines and whether to gather\nI'm Jim Walsh ABC News following these stories the migrant caravan continues working its way north through Mexico\nA Saudi Arabian official says it was a chokehold that led to the death of journalism ...
