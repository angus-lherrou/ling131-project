made it better [noise] but that ... story is kind of a fast they're fascinating story and I got a couple of a\nOf thoughts on that a couple of articles on that didn't you know that ... has a link to her son of bin Laden not one link links to Osama bin Laden did you know that\nThat you know that ... show he has links to the Muslim Brotherhood that you know that long time links to the Muslim Brotherhood and that he has spoken out against ... in Saudi Arabia a strict form of of Islam\nA buddy only ... and the only reason he's done that is because the Muslim Brotherhood\nAnd the ... hobbies are in conflict with one another and he's a Brotherhood guy so it's probably a Brock Obama supported the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt over our thirty year ally Hosni Mubarak could kept the peace in the middle east for a generation\nBrock Obama betrayed him Mubarak ended up in prison\nAround the world went running for cover when they saw Brock Obama doing that but never mind all that a couple of interesting things about this ... the whole chop chop square or fame\nUm the interesting things that I Want to get into engineering to show you anybody remember the famous arms dealer famous arms dealer not a lot of famous arms dealer but ah I ... was one famous arms dealer Saudi arms deal in the Nineteen eighties made a lot of news\nFor a variety of reasons and it turns out Jamal ... is the cousin of a non ... and um and there are some interesting ties there a non ... shows cousin is on it you know there's a lot of that going on over there are a lot of his cousins and uncles and nephews stuff going on in Saudi Arabia\nBut his is a cousin of ... who's now deceased [noise]\nUm which means that um he's related to the ... the family you know do the al ... who killed the Princess Diana so there is I think there's room for all kinds of Internet conspiracy stuff here and I'll get into well I'll get an ... not the Internet conspiracy stuff but some of that stuff\nA little bit later on this morning as well\nAnd in the meantime we we need you know next time a Democrat wins the White House I assume it'll happen someday it remember when uh Obama was the end of the Democrats were saying the Republicans would never win the White House again\nThat's because that lie all the time because they they have a fertile imaginations that's why they're run Hollywood and they do a lot of dress up and make believe sometimes just at home behind closed doors with the curtains closed but sometimes in Hollywood and on TV and in the movies and stuff too\nAnd um they said that the Republicans would never owned the White House and never control Congress again and it's just because they lie about everything all the time but the next time there's a Democrat in the White House and and they're presumably will be\nUm and it will be a terrible day for humanity when that happens but it it's likely to happen anyway we need to form like Romney's raiders and ah you know the McCain resistance front and then whoever the Republican as that loses to the Democratic presidential race\nNeeds to former resistance group they sell group an underground network of operatives inside and outside the government\nTo do everything they can to disrupt\nA the agenda of the Democratic president and destroy them as a party and destroy their ah people their leaders their followers their family members destroy them all and all the while Brett Kavanaugh will be at a homeless shelter feeding the poor the indigent the needy\nBecause he's a good and decent man whereas Bill Clinton with a cigar in the White House it's like a colonel mustard and the and the library with a ranch but it's Bill Clinton and the oval office with a cigar and and I love all these fraudulent clown\nA left these yesterday that Kanye West has brought disgrace to the oval office and they're sitting there wearing Bill Clinton T shirts and they said they got Bill Clinton underwear on a these reporters when they say this and I love that you know they love Anthony wiener and Eliot Spitzer these are they they protected\nHarvey swine ... these are these are not good people not good people at all\nAnd they're bringing us to a very bad place but we get to that Michael Eric Dyson who ah you know what what is the a white supremacist Ventura liquid seven assist\nOr whatever I ... likes to make things right and um and you
