speaking of possessions today's car courageous moment yet again military personnel being mistreated so badly and I wanted to tell you something is going on when military personnel move from one post to another\nSuspect for the members of our US military and coming up yeah later\nThe biggest mattress company and the U.S has filed for bankruptcy they're closing hundreds perhaps even a end of the

experience I had a flaw\nWith how people log into their accounts at Experian that specifically affected people who have gone to the extra steps of putting in place or credit freeze\nAnd so the problem with it is that the pen code that you use potentially is exposed\nAnd so what I had been recommending and what we've recommended at ... dot com\nIs that you go if you do have a security freeze in place with experience\nThat you go on their website and that you change\nBecause as an example where she was working is there anything that she could do for them extremely part-time and from her from your home they would bring in some income they would still give her the flexibility of being at home with your young son and bring in a world when come\nSo we we actually talked to them about that and they're just [noise] she's um she's a finance I'm thinking and and it just wasn't any opportunities like that um they invited her to come back once you know she wants to re enter the workforce but they just don't have any position like that available right now\nAll right you said you said some in key there her expertise is in finance and banking is that right\nYes correct um\nI Wonder if there's anything\nGo ahead opening new ones to cut it um you know helping out with a you know people that come into a financial and are looking to open up the colon says pick out lines of credit and stuff\nWell I mean that's an area where there's all these on line lenders now maybe there's something she can do part time with one of the online lenders have become prominent I Know right now she's just exhausted\nAnd you are too with a newborn but I Love the idea of her staying in the game just a little bit and bringing in income just a little bit and if she was working ten to Fifteen hours a week and working\nFrom home doing that it deals with a lot of the costs squeeze because you don't have the daycare costs\nBut deals with some of the loss of income so a little bit of her saying active in the workplace and bring in income the creative on that because that's where I'd really like you don't look\nI mean we don't you start looking at the other side what do you do on the expense side you have to if you need to ... you might need to take a hatchet to some of the expenses you have in your life if you do attack the contribution to retirement accounts you get any match where you work\nUm I I Do not um I'm In law enforcement so I I have a state and she was okay and I also ah contribute to our four five seven and a Roth IRA\nI'm so there are five seven you might have to can that for now right\nAnd that's kind of what I Would think\nYeah if you if you have to do that you have to do that for now but I Love the idea her staying active solving two problems keeping her on an experience lying and also bringing in some income along the way very part time and that's where I think the real answer isn't\nFor you in law enforcement please stay safe out there\nYou're listening

C. as a vastly inferior protection for you than what you have added a credit union through in the u._s._a. or at a bank through FDIC\nSo as I PC is a privatize version of protection and the most contentious cases of involved where a brokerage has been crooked\nAnd s IPC has not been there to protect people in the event of a brokerage going insolvent CSI PC takes care of people but if it's involved fraud or something like that they don't\nPut your money how is it held is it in mutual funds or ...\nMost ... most of it as a mutual funds indexes and then I say I'm a little bit of it is in

couldn't pay out people's accounts\nAnd they went at least temporarily insolvent and it was a terrible problem very upsetting to people\nAnd a money market situation that brokerage houses offered generally two options you can either have the money in a ... earning FDIC insured\nA account or you can have it in a money market account where the interest changes each day [noise]\nAnd I have my money and money market I'm not particularly worried because even last\nIs this series a banking scandals no one of any ... there was no significant or meaningful loss for anybody from any of the money market even the ones that temporarily went insolvent ultimately paid people the money they owed them almost a hundred percent\nWonderful thank you very much for the answer the question the big risk

in October to talk about winter but I got to 'cause I got to talk about your wallet there's new data that shows that the amount of natural gas which were used for roughly sixty percent\nOf our energy in the United states\nThat number may be off a little somewhere more or less sixty percent now natural gas is in shorter supply than it's been in recent years as we head towards colder weather months\nAnd one of the ironies of natural gas is it's now used for things way beyond just providing heat\nBecause more and more power companies around the country\nUse natural gas as their main source to produce electricity\nSo natural gas has gone from being a smaller market serving heating needs where people and in certain households providing a natural gas cook tops there's a lot of people prefer cooking with gas rather than electricity\nProviding a natural gas cook tops there's a lot of people prefer cooking with gas rather than electricity and that we're just say that yes even though natural gas has used for both\nVats the big change so the overall market demand for natural gas is much larger the current supply a little smaller\nAnd so what does that mean and the market it means that we have a decent chance of seeing higher prices on natural gas\nAnd remember you've got hit on both sides of the equation even if you don't use natural gas you're home you're still affected almost certainly on the electricity side\nSo no one can know what's gonna happen with the wintertime temperatures are we going to see a cold winter or not it's going to be another mild winter we don't know that but what we do know is that the odds are higher than we can see price spikes\nSo what I recommend to you is they use this time to do simple things\nTo reduce the overall energy demand in

[laughter]\nI said the other guys I Want to I I I just want to grab the guys are oath to the one song and grab my ears and say this is what a Fox says\n[laughter] uh well we our diets are straight a news here and now we just put out a a grant and I just put out of 'em are more guys Facebook video or talking about it\nThis week this week in Nineteen eighty one\nInterest rates were a teen point six percent yes and and then and then grant accused\nMe of a adding anyone being there for it which I was ten years old but er but of course I told him if he ever calls me grandpa and one of our line videos I'm going to fire him\nBut what you were talking about was that the mind so it was really around\nPayment yeah and and uh you know when you when you remember that ... was there\nAll this reporting about where interest rates were at and this kind of the ... cause I talked about and we've done a lot quieter people's minds about important in getting their financing\nWell no because social media wasn't what it is you know instant news wasn't what it was you know um you had the evening news and you had the newspaper and radio of course and that was it ... ... so that there were people that were really\nUpset about the interest rates it was a tough time to sell our home kind of like now it was a tough time to buy a home except if you could make it you know back then it said making they're not if you can make their not if you can make a payment\nYou can buy a house you know you might not have been able to buy as much house you know because so much of what your payment was interest at the same time though you know the market response to that stuff so they were really good deals in houses uh-huh you know so\nUm that's that's typical market and so we looked at can we make payments and and everybody in the industry that was\nWhere they look to you go to your loan officer and they'd say well if you can afford to pay him and why wouldn't you\nBuy the house and your realtor said if you can afford the payment you should buy the house because most at a chunk of the payments coming back and you're interested actually you know you're for at least the first five years you're going to get almost all of your payment back because it's interest I think\nRight or which we've lost now I mean with the higher and induction under the new the new Trump tax plan we don't have the industry deduction that we once people still will get to the dollar interest rates\nIf you're going to be happy to ... to an awful lot of interest you have to have a mortgage yeah we have to have a lot of other deductions like Ralph I yeah I'm\nSo the so that's that's where I think that's where there has been some change in terms of what the financial benefit of of buying a home is which both but one of the things I think that that the people should understand is that buying it historic raids\nOne of the things I think that that uh\nPeople should understand is that buying it historic raids um for or a historic low rates gives you the ability to focus on that affordable payment yeah and and the and and even as interest rates go up\nThe there's there there really she's really shouldn't shy back from buying real estate because just as what happened when you just explain that phenomenon where where you're you buy when interest rates for Eighteen point six one percent well what happened then home values as interest rates lower\nThis don't they\nThey they they the home rate joining up Oh yes I'm Sorry yeah yeah they went up as rates went down yeah the home of the home values went up because really what what drove people's decision to buy the next house\nWas the payment and the pain of the payments or only can grow if you really want to know where real estate values are going\nTo focus on what the wage growth in the market is and really what about thirty percent of the payment is eating up with the average income or thirty percent of house and the lead up to the average income and that will tell you about what the average house price can can be in a market\nRight and and and and in that\nOver time as interest rates go up and down\nReally what's driving what House prices are going to be in the future is what are people making [noise] right and and what are people making in terms of household incomes and the ... in North Dakota we've been very lucky that for the most part\nWe've always experienced a healthy steady wage inflation where people have always done better here than they did for the for help\nAnd what are the other pressures on your take home income or one of the big issues in a lot of areas was a a student loans uh-huh they some of them because of what they're paying the student loans is disqualified him mhm from the house they thought they should\nAbout that [laughter] they don't see it in that you know I mean I remember the first house I I bought it certainly wasn't a house I wanted you know uh it was the house I could afford\n'em but it did well they did well by me I mean uh it it helps it helps us get a a different lifestyle and the next house and yeah I mean in in each instance in each instance the equity that I've gained over time certainly not in a year or two but over time has has really\nLed to you know some good lifestyle opportunities for me so\nI'm I mean I think that that's I I Love this idea of it it'd be great to figure out\nHow do you get the message out to people to cut around\nOr even though we we buy into it what do we report on right away interest rates interest rates you know that's what people want to know about right so we here we are contributing to the same game yeah uh where interest rates going why are they going to be because that's that's that's what listeners want to hear but when you get down to the point I'm making a decision about buying a house\nI'm interest rate is important because it is one of five parts\nOf that payment yeah it's the industry has one of five parts of the payment it's not it's not everything and really really what drives what really what drives your your decision around your future and home ownership really is can you how did you say what was the what was the saying you make the not can you make the nuts\nAnd um I noticed that and that's not I think that's the most important thing now or other things I Do something I wanted to point out you know we talk about job markets on on the crowd and not network because just as we're talking about\nNow a other things I Do something I wanted to point out you know we talked about job markets on\nThe crowd and not network because just as we're talking about weight inflation is really as critical of anything in terms of determining where real estate values are going to go\nAnd uh LA Eisenberg one of our economists that we follow that we've we love to report on here and the decode our network had a great just in just a interesting ... to ... and this is how the job market I mean if you think about how the job market is right now some of the disparities in it\nSo on October ... he he put out and one of his econ Seventy if you want to eat Eliot puts out this amazing blogging Seventy words

job opportunities apparently right yeah yeah I Know what and I am ... that made any secret qualified oh yeah [laughter] my lack the distance it's going to take for me to get to a Nobel Peace prize I'm older qualified yeah you go\nWhat did what a doctor you say\nWell you know we've talked about how ... North Dakota is opposite of\nNational standard it is where they're just in the economic ... so I don't why I live with my parents [laughter] [laughter]\nCome to my house so [laughter] um we have been talking about nationally human story is going up but it's been a compressed emerge go have a lot\nUm we have been talking about nationally the majority is going up but it's been a compressed emerge go have a lot of product home builders are building spec homes are built you know\nUh the existing homes in the market is down and that's been pushing the press price way up a fast especially on both coasts\nHe is saying now that the with the interest rates remaining stable but showing a slight increase with the economy doing so much better that um people are not going to pay the price for homes have about\nPrice themselves beyond the average buyer and we looked last time at the affordability index which ...\nYou know the east coast is almost down to one and that means like it when you go below one would you like a point nine ages or lowest I've seen that means hoses aren't affordable you can't be bought the\nUh the mid west North Dakota where at one point eight nine which is really good because it was from zero to to to being extremely affordable and under one being not so much\nUm that home prices can pressure to buy homes is going to hit that cycle he figures the first two corps in Nineteen\nWill flatten and then they will begin to decline through the balance of Nineteen with housing prices\nNationwide [noise] that's what happened just two years ago now Yemen tore increased demand went down the cost of housing of the housing prices while they're still strong have not increased a significantly\nAnd in some categories um have come down now we're starting to see more interested in buying we're seeing an appetite for homes especially in the western part of the state\nThanks for oil ... but other things in Bismarck two things are starting to turn you know so\nUm they should just watch us and then they can make their predictions and\nThat that's all right we've sort of or the pulse of an Asia\nBut here's here's really the number one guy and housing economy orange young and he's saying this is what you're going to see in the next year or so what does that mean for North Dakota was I mean for Bismarck man that home buyers and what's happening what's what does that trend do with us well\nHopefully it would mean we'd have an increase in the [laughter] yeah and it gets out of the size and the the the inventory is going to balance out\nWe won't have so you know we're selling as many homes as we have since two thousand fourteen I mean a number of units being sold is really the same but we have so much more on the market and I think we're seeing turn in that\nPosition that the image where it's going to balance out now with both housing\nMore homes coming out of the market then right that's should theoretically drive the price has already ... so that's a good thing so that we get like you said we hit that peak in our rebounding back a little bit which is healthy work yeah actually and we're so we're we're [noise]\nUm again we're either two years behind it two years ahead of wherever you want to look at it we're we're had were had were were always ahead so\nWell that that that also followed with a rental trends do\nYeah

something twenty six days they're not admitted [laughter] I I'm not going to agree with that sorry [laughter] then what are they fighting for health care health care keeping Obamacare jobs from the Trump is the one that got the jobs we didn't have any jobs under Obama\nPeople ask down he took us from the ... stations\nAre okay but he put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps and eight million more in poverty\nAnd the years in the ... okay yeah the eight years to fix that meant Trump is done all the years that's the point oh have\nStuck on employment he have Hispanic kind of planet right\nAnyway last words are good for you know I wasn't going\nYou know showing you been doing this for a long term over Thirty years he's been doing that and I've never heard a worst phone [laughter] and then you'll McLaughlin\nAnd Internet than those Thirty years you see I wash interviews where people are they're asking young people if they're going to vote and are going to say there's they know because they're not really ended if you have been in the middle of his wife was out doing law enforcement you were integrated into all this politics\nHave you yourself ever seen ... uh the Democratic party ever leave any sense of normalcy of what this country is all about I mean I remember when Reagan was an office of the Democratic\nWay only thing I Would say is that when Newt Gingrich came to power every member was right after the the Clinton care fiasco they tried to do socialized medicine didn't work out the Republicans when they took power Clinton was smart enough and I think through the advice of people like Dick Morris and others\nTo move to more to the center right\nAnd we were able to get to a balanced budget it was one of the Republicans put together they finally got Bill Clinton assigned it and it worked but it was more of the political necessity than any any principles that that he held deeply liberalism\nIs a failed law the ideology that never works\nOff it among torn with you because I Will say when my son was young\nAnd I guess it was a battle of the time but I got um a PlayStation ... for and we were playing Scooby Doo night of a hundred and fries and this this four year old kid learn how to figure out how to get to the twelfth level and and kill the mastermind long before I could ever figure it out and I tell a\nFunny I tell a funny story in the book about that because my dad is the least tech savvy person in the world he hates all that stuff and he got addicted to Super Mario brothers\nAnd I can do about that but you know but then I go out and they all these kids they know get on line of international competitions on X. box and I mean I I watch my son played two X. box is at the same exact time\nYeah it's scary but you know those games are wired to get people addicted\nTo it but then when I was not out drinking he's not a true\nThat's true but if they're going to do that if they're going to spend time I'm not saying throw away all of the city of aids throw your phone in the river ever do any of that stuff are saying is that when you're raising your kids or even by yourself you have to remember that certain\nThings can't be done on line you still have to learn that eye contact with him\nFor these kids that go on job interviews still have to be able to get their hobby that's a personal relationships and excel if you're an adult and you're sitting with our phone next to your bed at night you wake up for a bathroom break\nAnd it keeps you up in the middle of the night and not a little light and then they didn't find a screen burns your sleep that's a problem I heard from so many people that said that it was interfering with their\nLife oh you'll be proud of me I was an I did enjoy having Twitter fights with people a lot and I will it it was so much well if it was well I think probably a little too much I mean I was I mean there would be a ... a game on Hannity is at it\nWith you know Alec Baldwin or ... Jimmy Kimmel were happened to be fighting of the time and I realized that became another job but more importantly hey when what happened with our Twitter account was compromise what was once compromised and I just finally said this is ridiculous and I I just took it off my phone I don't\nOur Twitter account was compromise what was once compromise and I just finally said this is ridiculous and I I just took it off my phone I don't I I\nLinda does the tweeting and somebody at Fox does the tweeting I just you know I say please tweet this out please tweet\nThat I don't have to do it\nBut there's also blown component here too because we often talking politics about is the gratification and went out of the gratification society people don't get processed\nAnything anymore nobody in desks and I think if you look at dating a relation with anyone who has teenager should be terrified because these you know these apps and kids are in social media what kids are doing on each site it's all very overwhelming\nAnd you can't do that but that relationships are requiring that all the values that we value\nI might be talking about conservative values all are now or did it that's great but a lot of that going by the wayside with the with the ... so that you can't play video games you can't have fun and I watch a bitch watch something on like\nBut you also have to remember the happiest conversations with your kids have to have these conversations with yourself you know the social media behavior Congress and some pop stars it's\nNot you know it has gotten vicious there's no doubt I mean like a certain amount of fighting I'm not going to sit here and why I kinda like and\nIt's entertaining to watch people bubbling says when you take a shot at these old leaders to the Hollywood or left wing or but boy with a book is great do not disturb how it goes to my cell phone to take back my life should have diabetes ... and of course you see all turn on the Fox news channel now that she has been rescued from the view\nAnd we're we appreciate you being back with us and it's good to hear your voice thanks for being here\nThank you so much on greatly appreciate it\nI Want to go back to what happened earlier today at the White House when Jim Brown and Kanye West met with the president it was an unbelievable\nExchange I Want to play a little extended version of it here and then we'll try to get some calls and listen to this\nYou know people expect that if you're black you have to be Democrats\nI have a uh I've I've had conversations that basically said that welfare of the reason why a lot of black people end up being a Democrat they say you know first of all it it it to a limited amount of jobs are so the father's lose their jobs and they say we'll give you more money for having more kids\nIn your home and then we got rid of the mental health Institute in the eighties and nineties and the prisoner rapes\nJust shot up and now you have shot Iraq\nWhere people called ... which is actually are a murder rate is going down by twenty percent every year I just talked to the superintendent level Microsoft Access Ron ... the right hand man so uh I think it's the brain that helps you see this game called\nYou know they try to scare me to not ready to have my own friends but it's had it gives me it gives me power in a way\nYou know my dad and my mom separated so I didn't have a lot of mail energy in my home and also a I'm married to a family that I'm\nNot a lot of mail energy going on in a beautiful though but there are times where you know something about [noise] you know I Love Hillary I Love everyone right but the campaign I'm with her just didn't\nMake me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time like a guy\nThat could play catch with his son it was something about when I put his hat off and made me feel like Superman you made a Superman that was that's my favorite superhero and you made a Superman case for me also at the guy that looks up to you looks up to wrap it around looked up to American industry guys nonpolitical no bullshit [noise]\nAnd just go there and get it done right now you gave me the heart to go to a fetus because at Adidas when I went in and\nIt just go there and get that done right now you gave me the hearts to go to a fetus because at Adidas when I went in and two thousand Fifteen we're fourteen billion dollar company losing two billion dollars a year now we have a thirty eight million dollar market cap it's called the ... the effect\nAnd I went to cast for we had a meeting in Chicago and I said\nYou have to bring manufacturing\nOn shore and it's not even sure inches of course it's not about the borders the core of the fetus and Chicago is the core of middle America we have to make America strong\nI mean this this thing made me a billionaire and I could have lost two hundred million dollars walking away from that deal but even with that I knew it was more important to me to take the chance of walking away from that deal than I have no fathers in Chicago with no homes and when we do have written a reformation\nFor no cause it's a it's a ... and not rehabilitation 'cause they didn't have the ability than the first place we never had anyone that taught us we didn't teach us that we had no one the town that's right so I'm a it's more important than any specific deal any anything that we bring jobs into America\nAnd one of the movies that I loved that liberal tried to do [noise] flood letter or try to control a black person to the concept of racism because they know that we're very proud of most people do and I said I like try to like someone as liberal they'll say oh but he's racist you think of race in ...\nLike to ask President Trump to do for your call I'd like\nUm that the head of the police and um my staff met with me last either so hostile was we used to that stop and frisk\nA does not help the relationships and the city and every one that knew I was coming here to ask about stop and frisk that's that's that's a the number one thing that\nWe're having this conversation about uh another thing is open it up industries and we've got to get some tax breaks to because we know we're making um we got to speed factory in Atlanta\nBut the shoes cost us three hundred dollars to his confidence to too much to make things so we need some prototypes here so we can get people back working so China can't just beat us and Vietnam can't we just got Levis\nThe greatest streams company in the world making their jeans and a and Vietnam so we're going to need to get a few breaks to be able to have some places in my hometown of Chicago and the two point seven million ... million surrounding suburbs where we can create some factories\nNow I think it would be good for them to be Trump factories 'cause he's a master of industry he's a builder and I think it'd be cool to have easy id Asian\nSensors which should be a mixed of\nEducation that\nGets the modern isolation like sometimes people say this cat they ... they did he and his goal\nI think it's we don't have any he's goal\nThink we have to make it more exciting mix curriculum like basketball while you're doing\nYou you you learn about music while you meditate in the morning we have to stay mental health and our programs\nAre back into the uh back to the city so those are\nIs an example of a man that was turning his\nLife around as soon as he tried to turn his life around they hit him with six lights in the sun believe he's when you say don't tear down the statues Larry Hoover is a living statue he's a beacon for us that needs to see his family there needs to go out and represent\nWhen you have a lot leader on every single block they can\nFor me to see fish family that needs to go out and represent leader on every single day on the block it out and that's something I learned from Jim route from America can we need to put curriculum\nWho really came from the streets now people who are just trying to set up to go into work system more criticism that apply to what people are really going to which the Jim Brown is created\nWhen I'm not gonna sit on the debate about Second Amendment
