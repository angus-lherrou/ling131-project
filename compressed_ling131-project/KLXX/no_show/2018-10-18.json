I think we may have to take significant steps here and sanctioned some people and blocks and people from coming to the U.S and I think frankly are the crown prince had better clean this up or he will not be allowed back in the U.S for a long time\nThat means people that we know are here illegally that broke the laws to get in here no respect for our sovereignty no respect for American law\nWell now we know those people when they got caught committing other crimes some of them well pretty serious those six hundred and forty two thousand crimes I mentioned included yeah murder in some cases\nHow many parents angel moms we put on this program and angel dads\nOn this program and they tell the stories about illegal immigrants that were in the justice system\nThat were let out on the street because they were in a sanctuary city now the sanctuary state of California with a with a sanctuary state free health care for all legal or illegal\nCandidate Gavin Newsom out there in California they're talking about ...

I Want to just go back to those documents that that are now with the inspector general you know the final core documents that a couple of weeks ago Trump's order to be declassified right right okay [noise] and then Rosenstein came over the White House immediately\nAnd I didn't ... from what I understand it was a phone call\nOkay but I Want to paraphrase what Rosa saying basically I'm a I'm going to truthfully poison Rosenstein they used to call them up and said look this president myself and my buddies are trying to impeach you put you in jail if you release these documents it's going to prevent us\nFrom in teaching your tail and put you in jail and it's probably going to explode in her face and you aren't going to be a free man show is you'd not released the because we still working to support your president\nSean after the phone call Trump find out how to do all this stuff about Rosenstein and the stuff that was after the phone call why wouldn't Trump realize they're trying to impeach him put him to jail college inspector general said get down to the White House sit around the oval office in these two things released threats\nFrom my understanding is there being extra super careful that the president still committed to the classification\nOf releasing the the unwritten acted Pfizer warrants these are the main things we need we need the Pfizer warrant applications one we need the gang of eight material to we need what's known as the thrill twos or the reports Bruce or especially\nWith his contacts with Christopher Steele because we already know because there's some of the leaks in communications\nThat Christopher Steele who under oath and under threat of perjury in Great Britain and in in Iraq and tore even he couldn't stand by his own pony fake Russian ... that he was paid for\nYou know you got all these people now that now the or doesn't want to talk or Glenn Simpson pleading the fifth Rod Rosenstein not only not turning over documents it's time to talk to the wall Street Journal but no time to talk to\nA the members of Congress and hand over the documents so I understand it's on track it's a little more complicated than him just saying release it release it the second lawyers are on it as as the latest that I heard my sources\nBut I think I Hope that they get released before the election because I think the American people deserve to see it\nYeah it it well they're trying to put them in jail he needs help himself\nListen I I Will tell you this has been a soft coup attempt\nThere's no doubt about we know what the insurance policy is\nWe know what the league strategy is we know that they knew there was no Russia Trump collusion\nEven in the words of Peter Struck there's no they're they're Lisa Page even saying no we had nothing that's why they started leaking the the pony dusty I information all the left wing or is in the news media they never told them that it was on verified are uncorroborated like they never told the ... the courts\nThat it was on verified uncorroborated they tried to lie to us manipulate us with lies from Russia like Hillary paid for before the election\nAnd they tried to take down a duly elected president after the election so you're right um but I promise you I'm On it listen I can walk and chew gum at the same time but the big but here we got an important election of Nineteen days I got to prioritize the
