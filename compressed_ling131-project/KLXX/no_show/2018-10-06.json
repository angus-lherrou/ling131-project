percent of Americans surveyed the ... poll just released so that everyone in the military is a hero or thirty three percent it's independent on their service a parallel polling Germany found just Fifteen Percent of those surveyed think all troops are heroes and thirty percent said that no members deserve that accolades\nNow in Great Britain it fell between the two there are thirty two percent of those surveyed said all troops are heroes well forty nine percent said this summer he rose based on what they did\nThe Hugo polls conducted this year between July and September these three countries you'd asked respond it's whether troops should be considered heroes and if so which ones qualified the sharp distinction between Germany and the U.S underscores how vastly different the\nMilitary's role is in each country it also suggests the challenge German politicians faced increasing defense expenditures to meet NATO spending guidelines a sharp point of contention between Berlin and the Trump Administration\nIn Germany shortfalls and military manpower has some political factions flirting with the idea of recruiting other European nationals into the German army I guess these will be mercenaries who are not typically reliable 'cause their loyalties were saying\nWell nearly a third of Germans withhold their hero designation for all their fighters only five percent of

we're very familiar with our military or how it functions under civil authority\nIn Great Britain only six percent of those polled said soldiers should ever be described as he rose but Britain's were more likely to reserve high praise for troops who performed heroic acts with thirty two percent saying that demonstrated bravery should factor into the equation\nAmbivalence among Germans could be

our nation as an example all those in uniform heavy elected to place their lives on the line to defend our nation if needed that as praise worthy\nOf course many people joined the military for job

experience do something like that in the military it's amazing what you can do\nExactly we always joked around that were playing GI Joe out in the desert\n[laughter] I could tell you some desert stories out there but it will be ended it will do that later okay what got you interested in mortgages\nWho is that's a long story I'll Try to sum it up as quickly as possible I purchased my home using a might be a home loan benefit back two thousand twelve and we went to refinance my home I say we me and my wife\nWent to refinance my home because we knew we wanted to purchase again using RV a home loan benefit\nAnd every lander I talked to had no idea how to handle it how how to answer the question I ended up settling on the fact that I could not have multiple VA home loans I cannot reuse it by some right now I'm In a Fifteen year conventional fix Marge Haiti\nWhen in fact the lender just didn't know what they were doing so that kind of propelled me down the road of becoming a VA homeland specialist\nAnd you are that now so let's talk about VA loans everybody who served generally speaking is entitled to a VA alone at some point or other the biggest thing I've noticed that we would reduce our conversations most veterans don't know what their rights are mostly veterans don't know what they have\nSo it was a veteran out there we just talked to said the allows my about if you buy a house how to talk to a real answer when you're considering the VA loan what or some kind of loan [noise] what are the kinds of things you need to do what are the alert point sort of the things we need to be aware that we don't know\nI understand what you're saying the number one question at me as a veteran would ask a lender would be [noise]\nAm I eligible because you'd be surprised at the amount of lenders\nThat cannot tell you or give you the straight answer because it's not as easy as are you a veteran old therefore you are entitled to the VA alone is not that simple especially here in West Michigan where we're surrounded by reserves centers so the reservists need to meet a specific year end points the if we do not have\nThose years and point statements how could we determine if you're eligible to that that would be the first question that I Would ask as a veteran to a lender am I eligible and can you tell me if I'm eligible and if they say yes I can tell you if you are there is a document it is the most important document\nDealing with the VA home loan that are highly advise you and suggest that you obtain this document it's your eligibility certificate your CEO eat\nThis is the document that will allow you as a veteran to go to any lender and say hey I Am eligible for the VA home mom who gives it to be a now there's three ways in which you can obtain a CEO ...\nThe first way is through the ... benefits Web portal which if you are not on that actively I highly suggest you release check it out it's a fantastic Web portal\nAnd get through there you can get it through a lender me as a lender I can pull it for you it takes me thirty seconds and that's no joke I type a three fingers so it type a little slower [laughter] but I can pull avoiding thirty seconds or you can go through archives dot Gov\nOkay so you get it it's not a problem all you need to do is no you need it\nCorrect in the reason why I'm emphasizing this is because there's so many lenders out there that will blame these long drawn out process as to obtain this eligibility document and if they cannot get it for you they obviously do not know how to do a VA on long\nSo that's a good

in England that has developed a new engine that gets rid of the timing chain timing belt felt springs\nIn the valves are controlled by computer controlled electric motors and by doing it that way this company has been able to do die in a mom and her testing what this engine and the emissions are reduced by about twenty percent\nAnd they explained that the way they get the computer to time the opening and closing of the valves is they place a sensor up some time on the crane shaft and from reading that article it just really interesting it seems like just when you think\nThe gas engine really cannot be improved very much\nSomebody comes up with this new system to control the opening and closing all the valves and\nIt just looked super cool I just hope that they can continue to develop this engine and get it into a vehicle some day because it just a a huge embarrassment in terms of using computers to make engines more efficient\nThey've already got some similar to that in America or in in our cars now they've taken the throttle body off the car completely\nAnd what they've done is they use the they're using oil pressure to power the valve and then electronic solemn wide open and close it and they open the valve they open it more or less to control the Airflow so they open up more than its like opening the throttle bodies open that less\nTo cut it down those those are still using timing changed\nThe one you're describing is I've looked at too and it's it's one step more advanced than that but these these cars that you're talking about they don't even have throttle body on them anymore they just have a whole like a diesel does the intake with an air filter or a turbo chargers but\nThere's no there's no blade in there to control the the Airflow at all anymore which moves out the Airflow changed everything just changes on them and it's like a a better mouse trap you never thought they could come up with a better one\nThen they came up with a piece of sticky tape but uh [laughter] you know these engines it is true they are coming up and we think that's as far as they can go advanced I'll bet there'll be something\nThe manufacturers are there are

was an actress on Broadway back in the Nineteen sixties and late Nineteen fifties\nAnd then she became a real estate mogul and she's had quite an interesting life and career oh she was married at one point to Jack Carter\nThe comedian remember him from those dean Martin specials ... the roast\nA and Jack Carter was a very popular stand up comedian in the day she was once married to Birkbeck Iraq the composer I mean she said the most fascinating life which includes her best friend and\nEven our high oh All right that was\nThe dog shaping the dog has nothing to do with what ever for whatever reason your dog is itching\nOkay unless that would be very unlikely now people say that you know I mean you're in Florida so because it's so warm to shave the dog it I'm just not a fan of that in general\nYou know black dogs do get warmer than than light colored dogs because of the way the sun radiates but you know a ...\nBut they also have a built in system where they as long as the dogs in totally out in the sun all the time of I I I just I'm not a fan of shaping dogs necessarily I don't think it's necessary\nHowever I Am concerned about why your dog is itching and and just to throw the dog got pregnant soon I think\nThat that helps that may help with the itching has it\nNot really a lot and I get the medications\nYeah so what you need this I mean it's a stair ride and I'm sure your dog is feeling good and a little more Pepe on the ... uh and probably drinking more water on but I if it's not doing any good even if it does good it doesn't tell you what the problem is and if it's not doing any good then for sure\nIf the dog's been on it as a substantial period of time I would talk to your veterinarian about winning not just taking the drug way don't do that right wing weaning the dog off of it but you still have to get to the bottom of the problem now you are in Florida so the number one I'm\nJust doing statistics here do not be offended ... number one reason leaves\nYou know all it takes a couple of flea bites maybe even once we buy to cause a allergy plea Durban Titus and the dogs can it's like crazy from that so that would be the first and on a black coat a dog that they're hard to find a you know so that would be if your dog has been protected that would be the first place that I Would love\nBut it could be a whole other hosts reasons allergies may be at the top of the list now where's the dog itching at\nMostly a rear end and she liked cases here and so I I have to go and check and make sure they were okay good I gotta check for war how old is the dog she'd only like a year and a half she Cady I ask\nWell this doesn't apply to you it may apply to others you know dogs to do that what you just described in sometimes the older dogs that have an arthritic problem a very unlikely in your case with a smaller dog right but I definitely would\nConsider fleas because apparently haven't done that and I'd go back to the veterinarian and maybe ultimately go to a veterinarian dermatologist you know I'd I'd re check for a parasite\nAnd if all of that is clear and you're sure that it is a including mange than than I Would I Would consider a veterinarian dermatologist but just to throw something at the dog especially if that's something a president's zone is not working a than if it's not working it's not working\nIs there a special shampoo you would recommend\nI don't know what I'm recommending it for see that's the thing oh yeah well I mean they could use I mean it could be just dry skin I suppose a but\nA veterinarian dermatologist can do that and I'm certainly not a I'm In no position to even suggest that\nOkay All right ha ha ha ha we're going to send you better than down in\nGrade she needs to be shaved dead right\nI'm personally not but I don't think it'll help your problem because I don't want to shave and she's got such a beautiful code I don't think that there's any reason for\nRight I'm personally not but I don't think it'll help your problem\nBecause I don't want to shame or she's got such a beautiful code\nI don't think that there's any reason for now maybe the dermatologist will say but I Do

euthanize our beloved friend no don't do that\nFind out what's wrong I mean there's something wrong so the dog has always been wonderful doesn't wake up on Monday morning and say now I hate the kids it doesn't work that way\nMy first guess and I think it's a good one or something was medically going on with this duck let me give you an example and this is really a true life example that has happened repeatedly repeatedly with that very breathe a golden retriever\nOf one the one I'm thinking about though is similar family dog wonderful family dog around the age of nine ten or eleven one day begins to growl at the kids and then bit guts gets worse than this story bites one of the kids\nNot that young of a child I don't know I don't remember nine or ten or eleven years old somewhere in there a significant enough by it but the dog get been warning for weeks maybe or every time they put the dog\nBut the family members didn't put together is maybe there's a reason why the dog is growing maybe it hurts when I put the dog and the dog is trying to tell me don't do that\nInstead they keep cutting the dog and\nThe dog and to be euthanized to their own veterinarian who says there's an ear infection and you keep touching the dog's ears it really hurts and this is a bad infection\nWe can solve this with antibiotics they do they treat the dog the dog gets better and the dog for the rest of the dogs live lives out of perfectly happy life with the family\nSaid it had to come to that where the dog had no choice from the dog's perspective you keep hurting me I Need to do something\nAnd happily finally they finally they did by taking the dog to the veterinarian\nCould that be a similar type thing that's going on here I Would suggest probably yes what is also possible though at the age of eleven more unlikely it's like Alzheimer's and dogs it's called canine cognitive dysfunctions syndrome\nAnd dogs that have the some times will begin to not recognize family members or if they do don't treat them the same way I mean the personalities kind of change as a person with Alzheimer's sometimes their personalities change ah and they get unreasonably moody for no apparent reason\nOf well that could be what's going on with the dog\nEleven is old enough for that to happen in the golden likely probably not something medical going on that is absolutely my guess

I think it's the flue I'm pretty certain that flew there may be concurrent upper respiratory viruses going on along with the flu but we treated all the same way\nAnd the sooner we begin to treat the sooner your dog may get better and like with the human flu there's only so much we can do so with the human flu what is your doctor say your doctor says\nDrink lots of fluids rest and wait seven to ten days right this is an antibiotic unless it turns into an infection and sometimes it doesn't the worst cases\nOf dog flu when it turns into pneumonia and things look really bad and that does happen
