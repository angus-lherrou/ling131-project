destroyed all the women that Bill Clinton violently sexually assaulted\nAnd uh that was James Carville\nHe was new to lend you see whether they're better off with Kavanaugh dead or alive\nThere was the a schoolteacher and Minnesota I was reading the story yesterday calling on a someone to take one for the team and killed Brett Kavanaugh schoolteacher and you know that schoolteacher will keep their schoolteacher job and then I'll be fine but this is the violent murderous rhetoric of\nThe mainstream Democratic Party this is not some fringe website\nThis is James Carville a author of the men but ruptures author of the great line uh you never know what you get when you're dragging a hundred dollar bill through a trailer park pays the the uh the the standard bearer for women in America and he uh just did it this line too and the\nDemocrats Kevin dollars' worth a lot is worth a lot more alive and dead\nA cabinet to the Democrats you'll see Kavanaugh is worth more to the Democrats alive

Saudi Government and uh he went into the south who the embassy in Istanbul and never came out as like it's like a Roach Motel that uh that thing and he went in and they never came up and it turns out that the the hypothesis is the theory is\nThat the Saudis sent in a team of Fifteen men\nTo take out this journalist ... right and he's disappeared and nobody knows where he is and one this one group says oh they jumped him up into pieces and took him out in separate suitcases something like that like it's a\nYou know when Alfred Hitchcock movie but one way or the other guy has been disappeared\nJust like the head of Interpol who was apparently grabbed by the Chinese 'cause their companies and the you know that's that's how companies David Souter companies have always behave and they'll throw 'em in the gulag or or just kill 'em or something send the\nBill for the bullet to his family which the Chinese do the Chinese when they execute you and they exclude a lot of people they\nWell it's that they used to kill you and your better pay it because they mean business right by the Washington Post their leader ... actually brainwaves Donald Trump for the Saudis snatching this guy in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul\nBecause they say that Donald Trump set the tone\nAnd now we have this big um and encourage them or something and it's just they're they have mental illness I don't know how they got all these people with mental illness under one business [laughter] and into one party but there is a lot of mental illness on the left and it's on parade boy is that on parade [noise]\nYeah so they're blaming they're blaming the Washington Post blaming President Trump for the disappearance of this journalist shaggy because they believe that the Saudis grabbed the guy and bad things happened\nAnd uh and it must be Donald Trump's fault and speaking of hurricane Michael which is a horror show racing toward the panhandle of Florida Michael pierce is kind of proud he's got these headlines with hurricane his mom sending them test text messages asking them to not be too destructive and things like that [noise]\nAh but I assume there'll be blaming Donald Trump for hurricane Michael because they've blamed Donald Trump for past hurricanes so they've got it's amazing how powerful they think politicians are\nThey think that Brock Obama can slow the rise of the oceans and that the healing of the planet will be again because he was elected the news media believe that they they sold that message for the Democrats and now they're selling the message that Donald Trump is responsible for hurricanes say\nThe Democrats affect the weather in the oceans positively and Republicans affect the weather in the oceans negatively that has a sign of mental illness that is truly a sign of I'm not a a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist by any stretch of the imagination [noise]\nBut that's a sign of mental illness you don't have to be I mean that's you're crazy you're not you're cook your a fringe case\nThat's that's crazy stuff and and let me also say a lot of the stuff we're hearing from the news media and the and the Democrats just a few years ago what is mainstream now just a few years ago would have considered to be it would have been considered to be fringe extremism\nThe rhetoric of the left the get in their face the dead or alive or all this stuff they these people are\nThese people are a medicine it's not as though there is no violence that's going with it there's lots of violence that's going on whether Brooke Baldwin is aware of it or not I mean I understand that really they pay or millions of dollars a year because of the shape of her knows\nMore than anything and and she maintains a steady regiment of of uh teeth whitening strips she's a regular and those are her qualities as a journalist otherwise\nShe's not the\nBrightest tool in the constellation if you know what I'm Talking about [noise]\nAnd uh Don Lemon he's famous for being a a dumb one too but that said also in the Washington Post today as I digress all over the place into called the sex and then refined the main road\nThe Washington Post has another one today there is a gubernatorial race taking place they the election as in less than a month and the state of Maryland the state of Maryland\nAnd uh there is a Republican governor there uh by the name of Hogan and he is say Larry Hogan are very popular governor especially for a Republican in a very left the state of Maryland He is up over Ben Jealous the former president of the N. double ACP\nWhich represents the advancement of colored people and just don't call them colored people because that's racist people of color is okay but colored people as right out\nSo keep that in my ... Ben Jealous former president of the N. double ACP he's running against Larry Hogan Larry Hogan is up by twenty points\nSo keep that in my ... Ben Jealous former president of the N. double ACP he's running against Larry Hogan Larry Hogan is up by twenty points well Larry Hogan this campaign got a hold of some video a couple of different videos of Ben Jealous the liberal left wing Democrat\nI'm ... and he said some really stupid things on this on these these videos and Larry Hogan people made the public because you know you can laugh at the Democrat being an idiot and getting things wrong and sounding like a fool and that's all they're doing a showing video of him right\nTo an end he said stupid things he made gaffes mistakes but there are huge giant once so the Washington Post is downplaying it but here's the headline old veteran weakens typed up the story on behalf of the Democratic party\nJealous accusers Hogan of bullying bullying because they are published videos of him looking stupid\nQuote a new low and Marilyn politics showing video of you is a new low in Maryland ... I I don't think that's true but it's what the Democrats say you know when or when they go low uh then they then they go lower I think that's I think that's the Democratic party saying is a\nMaryland Democrat and gubernatorial nominee Ben Jealous accused governor Larry Hogan of bullying which is a term that I think should be reserved for grammar school I think it's a grammar school term\nBullying him with the release of a new campaign video that mocks him for several gaffes they say gas they call 'em guess including one where he said he's running for governor of Virginia which in case you're a Democrat is a different state altogether that's another state altogether\nAnd so uh Ben Jealous or again he's a little brighter than Brooke Baldwin I think but not a lot\n[noise] you know we will be running together [noise]\nHoping for the White House said well [noise] this jealous when you'll make his book reading [noise]\nYou got to be the first like you know they're all in the next one day we'll be looking at it as governor of Virginia\nJealous for president then they cross it out of Virginia so they made it funny at and it's a funny ad can we post that we can post that on our website so you can enjoy it and share it with your friends now they didn't doctor the video like NBC News does they they just showed clips of him making a fool of themselves\nAnd then they've got a funny graphic at the end where it says Ben Jealous for president and they cross out president and then they write a Virginia [laughter]\nBecause they're mocking him now this is not allowed because he's a Democrat and now he's being bullied and guess what he's got a victim thing to fall back on he's got a victim thinks listen he's a victim he's a victim of all of this [noise]\nJealous set on Tuesday the mistakes were due to the soldier that he has had since he was a child which at times it involves saying a different word than what he had a intended to say\nThese ads are bullying jealous at at a news conference in Baltimore there\nWhile I can take it encourages the bullying of young people and that's not okay he's protecting children and Planned Parenthood he loves to things children and Planned Parenthood\nIt's a new low in Maryland politics let's not lose sight of who the victim is here and it says on Monday the ... campaign released a thirty three second video that highlights three gaps in one part of the eclipse jealous says he's running to remove Hogan from the White House so he doesn't know\nIn another jealous says that if elected he would be the first black president and then in the ad there is a clip of Brock Obama throwing his hands up like you know what am I a new job or a chicken made over here with us\nAnd in a certain segment recorded at an event on Saturday Ben Jealous tells union members that with their help quote you'll be you're looking at the next governor of Virginia\nSo I don't know I mean if you can't use that against him as a political ad that's the most polite political out I've ever said that's not a new low it's a new high that say this is the old when they go low we go high and then they burn your car because there is a Trump a bumper sticker on it\nAnd it's amazing so listen to what he says her daughter is like a speed bump in your brain\nAnd word replacement as a way that you deal with it and and he's right one of my best friends growing up Jerry was I had a terrible center and he still has that he still has a ... a is a nice guy in the room with the greatest guys one of my lifelong best friends with the center and it's true if you have a daughter\nAnd you start to start because you know you're going to start studying over a word like Maryland or something you know it started to say you know I'm running for governor of ...

Seventy miles an hour right down Chesapeake Bay because there's this reaches the coast and those same professional affects them talking about overland diminish the storm all wrapped back up again and then go out to sea and stay\nOr from a DC to to Boston\nTell me because I really what ... what are the areas that that may have tornado activity exactly so people can make preparations and be ready\nWell south in the south and east of a path let's say from Columbus, Georgia or to Greenville Spartanburg I think ah to Raleigh Durham\nTo the tide water Virginia you live south and east of that path and the further south east to go the more the more you have to watch out for that you're going to see tornado watches and warnings\nBe put into effect in those areas and ah over the next several hours I Believe they'll start putting that out of putting that out there if they haven't already I'm sure this tornado watches up now I'm just trying to look at the forecast map going forward to tomorrow and on into friday\nYeah All right now I Want to just go through this very very slowly it's about thirty miles inland now as it is that pounded hard the the panhandle of Florida and it's now moving northeast\nAnd as it moves north east is going to burst hit Macon Georgia hundred hundred and twenty mile an hour winds possible for their uh through it's going to a hundred\nHundred mile a hundred two hundred and twenty southwest Georgia making eighty to a hundred and\nNot have regulatory guts and then then making its way through Augusta and then it'll go up the the north east coast or to the Carolinas I guess through the tip Columbia through uh the rest of the coastal South Carolina area and then into North Carolina\nRight and there'll be near Elizabeth City two\nAM in the morning on friday and then about a hundred miles east of Norfolk in the morning or seven AM eight AM and then on out to sea and a glancing blow a a you know ... like a nor'easter for three to six maybe eight hours or New Jersey on in the southeast New England out of this\nAnd this is the last this is the last one short so you don't have to\nWork I didn't know was the last one not that fascinates me that you said it's the last one this isn't going to happen for the rest of the year\nWhile we knew back in September that we're going to have one come up out of the Caribbean because it's the overall patterns and I'll tell you what folks you ... and he says is two thousand and two all over again except slowly slowly which was the big hurricane in the Gulf hit a little bit earlier\nAnd Louisiana and October but we had all the warm weather in September and October\nThis is pointing the way believe it or not this is the pattern recognition toward the winter season which I think it's going to be a big winter for much of the United states this year they there's certain types of patterns is set up so it's going to get much much cooler across the eastern part of the United states in the wake of this storm\nThat will then establish it we may see something that tries to develop but stay or most likely stay offshore before it's all said and done but impacts dorms on the United states\nThis is the last one in my opinion\nJob of starting you're hoping to save people's lives and uh you help every day you nailed this with the exact pinpoint perfection inaccuracy which is so vital for the people that make proper decisions about whether to stay or go Oh thank you for being with us we really appreciate will come back to you later Oh thank you for having me showing\nAlright eight hundred nine pool when Sean if you want to be a part of the program there is a really disturbing piece on\nThe law and crime website and stay in Abrams website That's a sister website the media I ate and ate chronicled the FBI directors testifying today on Capitol Hill and he was asked by Senator Rand Paul whether President Trump was still being wiretapped by any government intelligence\nNow you would think the answer is Oh absolutely not but that's not the answer his answer was not exactly reassuring now the FBI Director Chris Wray declined to actually answer that question as to whether or not the FBI then\nCurrently collecting phone conversations with President Trump and during a Senate committee hearing on national security issues Senator Paul asked do you think it's possible that the president's conversations with international leaders remember\nWhen he was first in office they were leaking conversations with the president of Mexico the prime minister of Australia I mean that's never happened before anyway he was asking whether it was possible that the president's conversations with international leaders are\nYou know in the foreign intelligence surveillance a Surveillance Act database and raise her response was well I'm not sure there's anything I could speak to\nAnd they're setting well then Senator Paul continued\nDo you think it's possible that Congress members of Congress or in the ... database if we talk to international leaders and then re deflected again is that one senator I'm quite confident that we're conducting ourselves in a manner consistent with the law in the constitution\nA that's a subject to extensive oversight [noise] I don't know that I can speak to every hypothetical about whether there have been such situations\nAnd then Rand Paul as director re whether journalists conversations were being possibly scooped up by the intelligence communities vast spying apparatus simply because they write stories about people with say a terrorist name and the\nAnd re declined the answer again I Can't speak to specific hypothetical or that point Rand Paul cut the FBI Director off and said the answer is yes and as this time with ray was drawing to a close he spoke about the potential abused within the Pfizer system and Rand Paul is absolutely right he said\nYou've had people bringing their politics to work the concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is\nAs James Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's why we asked you to get a warrant the information you gathered in foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that has gathered\nWith no bar there is no war it there's no constitutional matter to that\nData and yet you're going to use it on a domestic crime that has been our complaint for years and years and years and I got to admit after nine eleven I thought\nIt was a great idea [noise] never having any any belief that it was possible as naive as I guess I was\nThat we would have government officials at the top upper echelons within the intel community the FBI and the ... that would literally be weaponized seeing the powerful tools of intelligence that we give them\nTo protect we the people and I never in my lifetime thought that a political candidate him put together a flimsy top CIA with Russian sources\nAnd it becomes the basis for Pfizer Warren application but not one for the original application and three subsequent applications and that the bulk of the information was bought and paid for by one political candidate to use against another candidate\nAnd that it was never verified that corroborate but still presented to apply the court and they purposely don't tell the ... the court judges\nThat the other candidate paid for this and that they never verified it bites wearing you know we'll get into this\nYou know with chairman a Mark Meadows the Freedom Caucus and Jim Jordan later I mean think about that [noise] this is what we do we have a constitution for a reason\nMark Meadows of Freedom Caucus and Jim Jordan later I mean think about that this is what we do we have a constitution for a reason there's a reason
