S. UK Germany have developed the technology that analyzes images from from the tea scans\nUser logarithms look at the fat surrounding a coronary arteries in German which are at most risk of narrowing and triggering a heart attack\nSo right now let's see if you can't see the scams can only detect when an artery is already narrowed\nSo basically you you you have the C. D. scan you have an RV that's narrowed you're about ready to have a heart attack yeah right okay they can tell years in advance if it's possible that that artery is going to narrow the\nKey thing in my mind is to be able to find out in time to maybe reverse it yes with your lifestyle actually actually right exactly right what's really amazing about this as researchers are hoping\nTo get approval within a year for the new technology excellent so yeah a lot of lives will probably be\nSaved because of this ... this is another device if that's a out called scan and do ... I think we've talked about this before I Do know it kind of looks like yeah I think at the same thing ... to do\nUm but it is a device that that uh they modeled after the tri quarter and Star Trek oh right right and uh it it's starting to do a lot of things like take blood pressure yeah they're already\nDoing usually as that but it's but it's but it's something that you just like you know put on your chest yea do these type of things their goal is to be able to tell\nYou yeah uh you know if you're about to have a heart attack or within days of having a heart attack that because of the accumulated data that they get yeah that it'll tell you that maybe you should go see a doctor now before you had a herd of ... yeah ... something it was so while\nThe other thing that they're um really making advances on since I'm a type two diabetic is your finger printing with the blood and yeah just scan use a scanner now right now he's so much\nBetter because you know the biggest cost and diabetes besides maybe insulin is those strips right right at ya you know and it's just a pain in the butt prick your finger yeah put it on their weight and you're going to\nWhere if you could have that scanner you could just go right okay my blood sugars are a little high right now it's okay or their low\nAnd this is this is available now yeah it is it's pretty ... yeah what what's the costs of one of those in the idea\nOf you know I I don't I don't know I I haven't even really yeah into researched it at all to determine\nI I'm just kind of always curious of how you can get an accurate reading from a scam so maybe worth as you I got after all the blood yeah that goes on there and they could tell you what your glucose you know measurements are\nAre you able um so do you have one of those now that tells you or you yeah okay yeah so it'll be interesting to do a test some time Dr little blood yeah and do a test and then the ...\nSo I actually went down there sometime well no I don't have the scanner yet right but you have a I got to get out around half to get maybe we should do did do that just do that on the show sometime we actually have you know and then see how close to accurate it is to the blood samples that will be fun to do\nIs right on so love to do a we'll have to get one of those scanners right for technical reason yeah we want to get one\nExactly [laughter] exactly what we could have\nBeen on a medical practitioner\nAs well you know you know this froze up this brings up a good point about\nMedical technology and where it's going and I'll guarantee a we'd go to see us this year we're going to see a lot more breakthroughs that my Seattle I talked about my brother in law were he was on about this new debt this new technology that he has\nWhere your word on your wrist in it\nAnd there are shows you what kind of activities you've had for rehab being your shoulder your knees and it sends all that information back to the dos program saying\nHe's doing his exercises we see improvements here near um you know and it's just a device you wear on your wrist like ... percent everything's\nEverything ready to watch out here now already yeah that that means means\nYeah it's amazing it's time for me to ah get a bypass yeah right left for a month so Jim you had one of the Facebook messages over the weekend I had a several of them they got it's very confusing up people telling me that\nThey got a friend request from me right so the first thing I did I changed my password Catholic vigor and always a good thing to do anyway ... yup change my password on Facebook\nOr I haven't gotten any sense I don't know if that had anything to do with it but I notice there's a lot of very confusing information going around on Facebook about supposedly people being hacked and falls friending and are these add a counterfeit sites where people's\nNames like mining writers and whatever\nWell it's easy to you know this is the thing that people don't know it's very easy for somebody to going in and hack you or pretend they're you well yeah OK they can go to your Facebook page\nGet your photos yeah create a profile ... with all of your information and and then start friendly people and that's what happens a lot yeah you know and of course you get a lot of the uh\nLooking for mates and that type of thing yeah there's a lot of that that goes on um you know when I get a friend request now I use the click on the profiles to make sure that they are actually going to\nBe added there's like on one picture that looks like it was taken into playboy mansion rightly right\nUsually out exactly right exactly right um so\nYou have that going on I haven't quite figured out what the endgame as to this yeah I mean what if I had three owned by doing that\nAnd I mean if if it's a scam we all know what's a scam so um you're getting in probably my my best guess is that they're trying to get you to a friend them over to end up saying that hey you're sending me the friend request\nAnd then you're like oh I'm not friends with Bob oh All right okay I thought I was right and then you're legitimizing\nThis account my advice and then of course I'll get a a thing from this person says oh Jim and Dave are friends with Bob yeah all then I guess I better be friends with Bob then to write and kind of how it works so they can get a couple of people to bite them they can get a lot more people um and then\nI don't know if you know at some time or another they're going to approach you I mean I get a lot of I just had one this morning as matter of fact asking me\nAnd I don't know ... if you know at some time or another they're going to approach you I mean I get a lot of I just had one the one who's matter of fact asking me for money you know my son is not able to speak and ...\nThere's a couple of going around to I should bring this year attention because my wife and I work at people you know we have cats and we're in correspondence with a lot of other pet owners aren't there are a couple of a scam you looking ones making the rounds uh there's one for some suppose it'd\nBut we have the same thing going on even with our own companies in the United states I mean you know Google and apple practice like like there's nobody's business\nUh because eventually they're going to start selling us information that we like you know I like going to coffee shop so when they show up at a coffee shop whether I have a GPS turned on or not there's going to be an ad that pops up and says hey get fifty cents off on coffee or whatever that's the ultimate again for them is that dollar that comes to them but\nIt may well in Beijing some guy sitting there with a a pet and the paper's going ... yes drinking caffeine is you know I don't know I ... I got the important [laughter]\nI did I I agree I think sometimes we can just get overloaded with wanting to protect everything and then it just becomes a you know a new issue we're seeing you know if\nTo know that I like to go to ...\nAnd then it just becomes a you know what an issue were saying you know if they want to know that I like to go to Starbucks or\nOr a anywhere in the coffee shops that site yeah yeah I don't care it's\nTough I mean I I don't know I'm just no um I guess if you're concerned about this makes sure not buying products that are made in other countries yeah I mean the United states at least have protocols in place to to protect\nOurselves from this type of thing so um if you're really concerned about and make sure you're buying your routers from the United states and that type of thing and then you have to worry about it anymore so that's what I Would do\nI mean there are obvious things I can see where people want to have their privacy protected like who you both for that kind of thing right well you know and you know like you know that'd be using against some people fall and and even even the\nYou know in your home right I mean the TV's now our TVs that we buy nowadays have the ability to spy on us yeah you know you can listen to the audio going on in the house for example so\nUm if there's a if you know somebody has one of these chips in there and they can turn that thing on and that's being sent to Nigeria or China or wherever I mean I and I don't think so much about\nThe house although that's concerning to the bigger thing to me as board rooms every boardroom in this country has a television is rather than patients raid and every boardroom has you know probably\nUm I wouldn't call classified information but information that maybe they don't want to share to the world and maybe classified I mean even about liking government situations you know that those TVs haven't gone through some type of vigorous test for security\nYeah I don't know the gym you brought up something interesting can change the subject a little bit here is voting\n... knowing how you vote I mean still right now I'm most cases you get a ballot you fill it out right sacred yeah ... now they're looking at being able to vote on line right so talking about protecting\nYou know your privacy there also is how much easier as it can be to be able to go in there and change\nVotes or the paper ballot man it's it's done is going to rain they are the chances are yeah so you know the safeguards that they're gonna have to look at for gambling on line especially now with the Russian thing\nOr the Chinese thing or or whatever you have a lot of tracking going back to the Chinese on that now too yeah so all interesting so so I'm watching\nNow we talked about blocks and a lot with um crypto currency is yeah yeah I Know so like a ... going in and those type of things but there's a lot of other things that you're gonna watch things before so ah X. O. A. X. E.
