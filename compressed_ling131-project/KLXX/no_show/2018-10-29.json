thank you very much\nAll right I Hope you enjoy being able to take and all that theater\nAt is with us on the Clark Howard show hello ed hello car how're you doing excellent and yourself good thank you you have something that it's getting really old and your life a home equity line right\nOr right sitting down to zero for quite a while and it's coming from time to either get a new one or just tried it and it's life answer the question I have is from a credit score standpoint\nIf you're going to help me or hurt me to go hand in let's say and get another two hundred thousand dollar home equity loan but never use\n... is it a loan or a line 'cause the distinction where the difference is a line you can drawn basically with like a check so it's a line in line and the interest rate floats so let's step away from the credit aspect\nFor a second let me ask you this do you find that it's been a useful financial tool for you to know that that's available in a financial emergency of some kind\nIt is although I doubt that I'd ever need to use in except for maybe like use it to make some other investments that pay a whole lot higher interest rate so that would be the only reason I might want to use it\n'cause I liked the idea of home equity lines of credit is stand by in lieu of keeping money and things like simple savings accounts or anything like that if you have assets and you keep them invest it\nAnd if you had a sudden the financial emergency\nHaving to sell investments could be at a bad time and that's where a home equity line of credit I think can be very useful for people who carry very little or no debt in their lives a home equity line of credit can be a wonderful tool\nAs far as how it would affect your credit how long you staying in the house here in\nUh we've been there twenty eight years all the time we got another five to ten\nOkay so you're not looking to get a new mortgage or anything like that I think having a home equity line of credit is a good idea as a strategic thing then in terms of your credit history of the home equity line you have will benefit you for years to come the fact that it's been there\nThe issue potentially is available credit and ratios in terms of use of available credit and that would put the argument towards you taking out the new ... new home equity line of credit for what will it cost you to originate that he lock\nIt would replace the one that's done\nThey said it's like look I think if it won't cost you anything I'd do it okay that's what I was thinking All right we'll best to you at ... thanks thanks\nRebecca joins us on the Clark Howard show Rebecca how are you doing\nEd thanks car fixed Rebecca joins us on the Clark Howard show Hello Rebecca how are you doing\nHow Clark umpiring thank you\nRebecca you're looking for new wheels\nWhere I'm now a warm I bought myself a luxury model car\nA kick out of an Thirteen got I got it in September of two thousand twelve and wanted to keep it for five years\nBut kind of come and gone pretty quickly and I always get the urge for a new car oh I didn't have ALS and let falls on the tech arsenic object Carson and I'll start thinking and we pay for our cars out front\nAnd um it just seems like\nA lot of money can be cutting down on a car and ... ... once we write that check it's gone except for the car you know we have the car back I'm thinking I'm leasing might be an option for me\nSo I had when you bought that car back in twenty twelve am I hearing you right you just wrote a check for it you didn't take out alone\nNow we've got and pick out on\nSo it's a lifestyle choice if you're in a position that you don't need a loan for a car and you light new wheels routinely\nThat's a circumstance particularly with luxury vehicles that it may make sense for you to lease instead of by because with the luxury makes they don't like to out now discount the vehicles because they're trying to maintain a cache of brand worth\nSo with all often do is they'll factory subsidize the lease and where you get the deal on the luxury vehicle is in a way you usually for three years they want to turn you into another vehicle in a three year window\nRight and so a book cause for you is not a dollars and cents question is more lifestyle question we sing on many luxury makes would be the right decision\nWell for my next question if I decided to go into a lace the next time I Want a new car do I sell my car out right and then I go with them on because I'm not you handle your heart attack on the price of the car and not them not the monthly payment have ... [laughter]\nSo harder when you when you get the deal are involved in the trade interviewer existing vehicle it really gums up the works at fogs it up and it's hard for you to know what you're really paying\nAs a cost of that ... and ... says are complicated anyway so if you keep the idea of trading in your car is a separate concern here's how I like you to do it do you happen to live in a part of the country that has ...\nYeah if you go to ... when you're in the cycle of thinking you want to lease a vehicle ... would give you a guaranteed price they'll buy the vehicle from you for a week\nSo you go start negotiating on your lease for the one you'd like to lease\nAnd make the deal on what the least is going to be what you're gonna have to pay up front or what your monthly will be on ...\n[noise] whether it's our hearts lungs or other organs were diagnosis tends to make us uneasy at Kaiser Permanente our specialists care for you and about you working together creating a treatment plant specific to your diagnosis and total health\nFrom primary to specialty can't find reinsurance and a great team of health care professionals committed to your healthy recovery visit KP dot org slash specialty care to learn\nMore from the end of the Mayo Clinic states incorporated when when one is different history ... to ...\n[noise]\nSuper ... man\nAnytime anywhere online if super talked while somebody dot com [noise]\nHere's the latest from ABC News I'm Jim Ryan so mad accused of carrying out\nThe attack that left eleven people dead at a Pittsburgh synagogue is due in court today Robert power stations twenty nine charges ABC News chief national correspondent ... government is in Pittsburgh\nWere told that he didn't conduct any significant surveillance on this particular synagogue or in this area apparently he chose it because it was the biggest most well known target\nMore from ABC's peak combs that have vigil attended by thousands\nJeffrey Maier is like other survivors of other mass shootings wonders how do you stop it moments later Myers answer his own question addressing lawmakers with whom they share the podium it has to start with us our leaders\nAnd they share the podium it has to start with us our leaders [noise]\nCoverage for cheered outside somebody can own an average teen and three handguns and enough I mean isn't to kill an entire congregation and legal peak\nCombs ABC News Pittsburgh\nAlso expected in court today ... the man accused of killing suspected pipe bombs last week\nSay Iraq has been in custody since Friday and we'll make his first appearance in federal court at ... pm eastern today answering to five charges stemming from last week spate of apparent mail bombs say our faces up to forty eight years in prison if convicted he's\nMaking his first appearance here in Miami but his trial will be in New York were five of the fourteen devices were sent ...

do you mean the background I was going to check on my credit score during the annual credit report and\nI thought it was going to get a credit card in order to boost your credit score but on the report it seems like they're the the credit card that was under the county was counting on my credit score so I wasn't sure if that meant\nI should get another credit card like for my cells to boost scores that one counted as my second one\nOkay great question so you're are you an authorized user or\nCo owner of that account with your dad believe I Am an authorized user\nSo it depends on the scoring model and our a credit card company would report whether that authorized users status would be a particular note for you I assume your dad's a great player and that's just good stuff for you on the report or neutral one or the other\nBut yeah yeah but you're working you're out there doing your own thing now\nYeah mhm I Would much rather you get your own\nOK\nInstead I'd like you to sign up for an account at credit karma or credit sesame or both of them\nAnd you'll be able whenever you want to see what's going on with your credit to see a reasonable representation of your credit score every seven days for free if you want your able really to monitor what's going on with your credit\nOkay yeah so that they would ask me credit sesame and credit karma All right and a lot of people do both completely free for both of them excellent\nSo and then once you figure out what your next card is going to be are you the kind of person who pays your balance and fall every month\nOh yes I I wouldn't I wouldn't want to keep a\nRight then I Would like you to get a reward cars have some kind either\nAre there any uh any you use us ... suggest\nYeah so if you are how much do you think you charge in a month\nOr two hours how I'm old enough cells that are in now are out there and I know the card the city doubled cash city double cash will\nPay you two percent cash back on everything you do and the other alternative is if you're a customer of fidelity investments get there two percent cash back card\nYeah city the little cash flow into that\nAll right and then once you get approved for that that's when you get yourself removed from the account with your dad make sure you get that card first fell to you and I'm I'm Glad that your dad's a good player\nHere listening to the Clark

anywhere a kind of stay in the back yeah that's probably the right choice and you just got to get away from everything but\nUm we're going to talk about some scary technology and some things that viruses and scams and dams and mail or around somewhere and all these things that\nThat are affecting a well they they could potentially affect just about everybody everybody down ... everybody's got a cell phone everybody's got everything and we all have telephones of some sort whether or not um [noise]\nBut just to to get things going to get things maybe a little scared\nOr talking about it some technology announcements from last week and uh our boys over at MIT who\nProbably the kings of scary technology um they announce last week they are doing a mass production of cell sized robots so now they can they can create these cells sized robots ... she made it yeah yeah they're ... and ... and the reason that the reason that they work\nIs they develop the technology that will take a\nA brittle material and they can\nSonic we break it in a uniform fashion okay so they know what the the waves are going to do when it hits this brutal stuff and break it up exactly like they want it and then they can build the take the broken shards or whatever they just destroyed yeah and programmer robot on it [laughter]\n[laughter] the cell size you could put that anywhere I Know you know what that tell you were in ... what they're selling it out how small are they sell like ... like a just multiple molecules\nLike a uh your biology or selling your body ... money to be like the size of a virus or yeah yeah who this thing's\nCalled auto per for auto ... yeah\nAnd I remember way back when I worked for North Korea's safety council and we first got a computer they talked about viruses nobody really understood yeah but I don't think anybody and ah\nThey were mostly designed back then to break your computer\nYeah get anywhere I met and got work yeah it was a militia ever Michelangelo early I knew\nI had a friend who got hit by that one yeah yeah yeah there's a lot a lot of computers that they just going in basically rewrite\n... just grabbed every ... them once\nBehind that weren't necessarily criminals they were just geeks\nAnd it was like a challenge to do this yeah and I'll do the other guy or get I I wrote the Mike ... virus and I put it out there and I'm going nuts and oh you're the guy the guy that did it you know\nBut then the bad guys figure it out you know what instead of me getting dressed tomorrow putting on a ski mask line down to the local liquor store convenience store yeah I'll sit at home in my pajamas\nAnd I'll log into somebody's computer and all of your own arm and not a scam or for money right now it all switched\nA here's another thing that has happened [noise]\nThe robo calls the majority of them is switched from land line to sell for a I guess what folks that do not call list and doesn't work right bad guys don't [laughter] I hear that that's a joke\nBut it's all over the nothing's coming semester do\nWhich is bad I mean I haven't read off some of the the worst computer viruses and history and and the good the good news about this and most of them are from a decade or better yeah so that's that's the positive side of this we talk about the negative here in a minute but see if you remember any of these do you remember the Melissa virus\nOne of the first Mormon the name you know I was sent out and it was a word Microsoft Word mackerel\nAnd you would click on it and like you said it really didn't do anything except send out an email to like the top fifty people would either your contact list but what's that like a porn address or something um people and it was coming from you as a check out this site and see what Nick's sent\nMe [laughter] so I remember that one kind of\nA really all that did was a little bit of data ... that guy and they gave him only twenty months and a five thousand dollar fine okay that was it you know and it was also suspended um code red wanting to ring a bell and I'm I was working um\nEditors and that thing hit every route or on the DSL network yeah so thousands we had a cue built up in our support center about two hundred deep\nSo people were calling in and we hired more and more staff and brought into their call centers Joseph and the thing was huge it crashed every route or of a certain type of um so that one was a big one\nUm one that was a little different that most people probably didn't really hear about because it didn't hit them personally was sequel flavor\nAnd that one was of a virus that hit Web servers\nYeah when you and click on a link it would dump this stuff at the end of the URL and all that would provide as the instruction to the Web server\nAnd it would crash that server okay so it disrupted thousands of Internet servers so tens and probably hundreds of thousands of way noise Lewin now when they know who did that one and\nThey got him a little bit but the the unique thing about that that took down bank of America ATMs it took down or Continental Airlines and this was back in two thousand three yeah and um\nBut the the one with that one Microsoft actually released a patch for that nobody around the patch and then the ... the guy who wrote the program was like well if you guys aren't going to update it\nTake this so yeah it all down and it hit Seventy five thousand servers in ten minutes wow ... basically if if any of you are on the Internet back in two thousand three\nSeventy five dollars and with a lot of servers that's nothing now but yeah it was that was the Internet [laughter] back then it just ground to halt\nI'm probably a lot of you remember the I Love the virus that sent out an email saying I Love you and when you clicked on it it uh email passwords and everything back to the hackers [laughter] who got in and sent more and more emails it did ten billion dollars in damage\nWhoa hello alien even now they tell you you should update your passwords change your average very ethically anyway to try to keep one step ahead or just people constant yeah yeah\nBut to more a net ski somebody you might remember that one um that would come in and out would just basically use the botnet which was basically just\nTelling my computer to connect here's the compact to the next the next guy and we all sand traffic somewhere at once that's what a botnet is is ends on an island in Iowa terrorists yep\nSo what it's doing is it it took down I think if I remember I didn't write it down but it's not like Toys R us was one of the big oil hit and there was a few others that got hit\nI'm fine with that one did uh the reason it was most famous and you brought this up earlier the creators of the ... virus and one other one was the other one bagel we're to the other bigger ones\nThis guy wrote in the code and insult to those two creators [laughter] they'd win those two guys found it they wrote a new version of the ... virus\nAnd insulted the other guy back and it started going back and forth it was updating every thirty minutes of the anti writers programs couldn't keep up and they finally found a way to get ahead of it and stop it so good but again just the ... thing that I see it and\nYou're stuck no it wasn't really any that will yeah it wasn't doing anything to the computers\nOther than just denying them service yeah to a private corporation but these three guys gotten a little bit and contests on or else it got a little out of hand in the last one is storm um that was one and you probably remember this is a two hundred thirty dead as bad or a storm batters Europe this was about ten years ago ... um\nClick on it [noise] two hundred million emails with this virus were detected whoa so immediate millions of\nPeople who hundred million numbers you know you end up the coffee elation of this country at the time\nAbout yeah yeah so that\nThat just shows you how quickly and how wide of a net can get cost is sent by these viruses and they're\nThey're there to mostly it's it's vanity it's mostly it was back in the day it was yeah juvenile stupidity occasionally though they had a target you know occasionally they would say we're going to take down bank of America today you know and they would launch this little attacking\nUs being dumb ... click\nWhere you were measuring movie in the eighties Cold War games yes al where they are they talked about the possibility of some hacker or even a kid getting into the Pentagon system and starting to launch missiles or whatever how realistic scenario is that why at a day\nProbably not very All right I mean I I think there there are entire countries trying to act or national security guys\nWhat we know Russia's trying well and they've succeeded partially\nThey've managed only spend money at Facebook though [laughter]\nWhat's your what's your ... elections and everything else in our news cycle and everything else but um you know I don't think they're actually and that that's actually brings up a good point they probably don't have to act the Pentagon anymore now they can probably social engineer\nSomething along the lines where it's come in through the backdoor Facebook and Twitter and yeah well\nYou know you gotta wonder when you look at all the technology that we buy today are routers and our world is chips coming from and who's making them yeah right and it isn't and Americans\nYep slow y'all way bones aren't allowed to be sold anymore because of that yeah where they come\nFrom those chip certainly Internet and who knows\nBut what about not so much the Pentagon or but what about the infrastructure you know we you guys are with all the stories about how vulnerable we supposedly our with our electrical systems somebody can get into the grid and we lose our power overnight and the whole country would go back to the mid Eighteen hundreds in terms of technology\nThat's probably more feasible than uh you know hacking into their right to fit on disturbance is written about it yeah\nYeah if they if they shut down the grid or feel isn't being delivered food isn't being delivered airlines go down ... it'll bring this yeah to to grind to a complete\n... anything beyond said the steam engine gone pretty pretty wide or walking and I do I have some ... some\nFriends that are in the work for like electric companies were out you know that sort of thing and and they work in that field of securing their information now that I saw\nA pretty smart guys that have to be involved in that because you're right I mean they could they could log into that and yeah and\nTake everything down with them yeah and that's the the danger of having you know in the last probably Fifteen Years we've moved everything right into a computing environment they're not aware that you can go any more other than\nSome guys maybe small a vehicle repair shop or hand write to ... yeah but you go anywhere and everything's on the computer all your calls after a certain date and our goal in\nOkay or on your on your computer do you know of or recommend\nThe ultimate you know and I don't want to endorse a product\nOr anti virus I Know what we used at the office and it seems to be pretty effective but I hear a malware spyware yeah a virus does one anti virus take care of all of that or not need spy protection malware mala bites and all of these different\nPrograms going the wrong guy my recommendation is that if you keep your computer up to date and you you you're\nConstantly running windows updates are constantly updating the software [noise] windows ten comes with a really good window security program built in okay and they might catch almost all of it um if you're feeling a little more\n... Britain burned out to be a little more protected you can get things like Norton and you know I'm you know malware bites and some of the other ones um\nAgain not endorsing any of them because they all have their downside that um if everything does yeah if you're going to do things on your computer or sometimes those anti ... program so lock them up\nAnd won't allow you to do that now yeah\nI'm probably more technical than say my dad so\nRunning a program like Norton is probably a good idea\n[noise] from what I've run into a lot as customers are bringing their computer would it it won't update\nIt'll go so far none and crashes are locked up and was revert back and windows can seems like it updates and what happens is when you turn the computer back on you get a black screen and it just sits there and does nothing\nOr um most of the time is\nUh they've updated from window seven or windows eight yeah and so it's an older computer and at some point that windows ten computer windows ten operating system through a flag for something not being compatible the hard drive the ran out of the doubt processors or something and you really don't know what caused it um and and\nThe problem between apple Macintosh computers and windows computers is there are probably thousands of configurations on the window side\nMac is a controlled environment it's like we are going to give you this and use that for you to get this ... this car drive at all and so they're less attacked or less vulnerable because there's all this other\nGirl and I really think Microsoft should be taken to task when they came out with tens saying that it works at all computers that run window seven and eight right they didn't test them\n... you couldn't know in a way well they are now we are ... yeah I'm going to be compatible you know we could\nBuy a computer but then you we throw our own hard drive in increase our own ram and so we expose it unintentionally but we do expose it to potentially being vulnerable to ... it just kind of runs it out but um is there any recommendations on that a our piece I for anything like this or\nI'm more than likely I I really didn't see anything I was just in the scams section and I've got a whole list and when we come back from the break we'll kind of go through some of these [noise] but uh they didn't have any recommendations as far as software\nYeah it was you know sort of are going to stay on this other topic I'm keeping your computer updated is big time one hundred percent the best thing you could possibly get up and and everybody forgets about it and you know you just ask windows update all set it to ignore 'em\nYou know a lot of people don't turn a computers off they just leave 'em run twenty four seven right and the idea of turning it off when you turn it back on most cases when you shut it down it's updating and when you turn it back on it puts the updates and so it takes a little while for it you have comments or just be patient and let it do its thing\nYeah yeah or leave it on and have it ... you know 'cause you can set all those windows ten is you know a huge leap forward from seven and eight or in that regard as it does updates so much more efficiently and now the the kind of schedule him so you know you're going to have little ones every month you're going to go on a Saturday in October and April you're gonna have the big one these ones\nAnd so just plan for that and know that you're going to have it and go but\nChange your passwords changer update your security as much as you can um stop using Internet Explorer [laughter]\nTo lead to I think it'd be a few\nOthers still things that I can only do on explore you know do I buy ads sites anymore I cannot access pay pal through Fox fire I had to go through really or yeah use chrome then yeah I I mean well yeah [laughter] how about a edge or you know I've I've actually experiment it a little bit with that just a Web designer [noise]\nUm I they've increased their engine significantly over there and explore so a Microsoft edges a is a good browser use Firefox at home um but there's so many computers that have have a Internet Explorer\nDoesn't have a bane of everyone does exist tell you still got a zero people running XP [laughter] [noise] another thing to talk about right out right everything All right where he got some scam and some other
