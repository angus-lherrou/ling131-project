used to be known as hidden city fares there are certain cities that are fortresses for the three remaining full fare airlines\nAnd somebody going to one of those cities at least one way can save a huge amount of money by buying a ticket changing planes there that you don't take the connecting flight\nAnd so the fair may drop by sixty Seventy eighty percent by doing that\nAnd there's even a website called skip flag that United Airlines sued years ago to try to get the site shut down and skip ... S. K. I. P. L. A. G. G. E. D. dot com\nTells you how to beat the system at the airline hubs just for reference for the ... prior mentioned United\nFor flights to Chicago Houston Newark many times the fares are crazy high\nAnd so people were you skip flag\nTo beat those high fares delta Atlanta Minneapolis in Detroit\n... ah American Airlines Charlotte Philadelphia Dallas and so these airlines build these fortresses United is really upset about people not paying the fortress hub price when they're going to the fortress hub\nDoing a hidden city or what ... calls\nAgencies for doing hidden city tickets so let's say is an example you were going to Houston and instead you might buy a ticket to Austin or San Antonio where El Paso and it might cut your price\nEighty Ninety percent when you get to Houston\nYou just don't take the connecting flight and you go visit family or go to work or whatever it is you're doing that's what United is really upset about and the legal notices that United sending people\nAre ridiculous they are to a level of meanness that is absolutely Clark courageous\nAnd I believe that it is a legitimate strategy for you to do to save money\nIf you go on Clark dot com on our my travel guide I explain to you how you do it that you won't have a problem one of the things you have to do is you have to travel with only a tiny micro carry on because if they take away your carry on bag\nAt the gate pat bags going to the city that they were planning for you to go to that you're not taking the connecting flight you obviously can't check bags you can only do it on a one way fair but the savings involved in this\nAre gigantic and American United and delta have spent a fortune building up these fortress hubs trying to keep out competitors simply for the purpose of driving fares up to the highest levels possible\nIn these fortress cities and they don't take kindly to you coming up with ways\nTo beat the system and get a lower price there's nothing against the wall doing this United in fact\nCalled it an act of fraud fraud is a crime United send your lawyers back to law school\nSays it's not fraud is just somebody making a smart decision to save money you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\nResults may vary notice solicitation for legal services if you owe the IRS back taxes payroll taxes for them not filed your returns the IRS will get you they can take

free\nFace to face consultations and your local area all eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three that's eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three results made very not a solicitation\nIn fact the go to choice I recommend in any of the plans that I like that I've talked about on my guide [noise]\nAre for you to go in the age pace portfolios\nPage base portfolios or where you put money on and based on your child's age or grand kids age or niece or nephew or whoever you're putting up the money for\nThat the mix of investments changes as the child gets closer and closer to entering college\nIt's too complicated to try to figure out your own investment and mix them less you work as an investment professional as your day job\nSo going in the age based portfolio is what I recommend\nWhat I've done going through the plans as I've looked at them to find the ones that are the absolute lowest cost because over let's say a typical investment cycle that someone's putting money on for a child's college the money sits in their roughly ten years\nBut he says when people put money on and the money you put in through the years and so for that\nInvestment cycle the costs of the investments matter enormously how much money you'll have there for a kids' college by the time they're spending it and for tuition and other eligible expenses and undergraduate or graduate school\nSo my guide that I've just updated at ... dot com is all about driving down costs period\nAnd the good news is that college five twenty nine plans have gotten cheaper and cheaper and cheaper with intense competition among those that are the direct so [noise]\nThe ones that are involved commissions again I don't even look at because they're so an economic you should never consider them but the great news is that when I first started writing about in reviewing five twenty nine plans long ago\nThat were good for you to put your money on was teensy tiny\nToday that encompasses most plans sponsored by most states in the country and many states in addition to getting you some money tax free for college you get a tax benefit up front for participating in a plan\nAnd so check out my guide and it's something that I uh do partial revisions overtime and then do a major vision to\nRoughly every Eighteen months and the reason there are times I Do partial revisions is to actually won a plan may change sponsors or the existing sponsor may lower costs or two\nI may come to believe that the decision I made about a particular state plan was wrong and I may downgrade a planner upgrade a plan on further review but the idea of this is that\nYou have an opportunity if you can afford it\nTo put money aside to defray at least in part the cost of a child's college education and have that done the most efficient way possible tax free growth of your money\nHaving said that though\nNever sacrifice your own retirement [noise]\nIn order to put money aside for kids college your retirement comes first\nThe reason why a simple there are no scholarship plans for retirement\nBut there are many alternative ways to pay for college including the most overlooked of all and that's going to a more affordable college\nIs the number one way to reduce the costs because the dollar never had to be expended for college it was a dollar you don't have to say for it\nAnd again if the culture and your family\nIs college is not likely for a kid you don't want to save in one of these plans\nBut always save the max you're allowed to enter Roth IRA\nBefore you focus in any meaningful way on a five twenty nine\nI guess the only uh Astros to that\nIs if there's a state tax benefit going into a five twenty nine if you can put in what will get you the maximum tax benefit from state in addition to the tax free growth that would make it a one and then the raw IRA funding would be a one a\nRed anyway you can see my explanation pet CT dot com that go with my five twenty nine plan guide is this I Want you to be in a position\nTo review\nPick a plan\nFunded and be done\nIn less than Fifteen minutes this doesn't have to be hard it doesn't in any way need to be intimidating and you'll really be glad that you set up a plan with the goal of being to add to it\nEvery month if you can automatically to build up real money towards college [noise]\nJill is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Jill\nHi cartel I in great detail I Hope I can be of help to you\nI Hope I have a ... so about the online [noise] and I've been listening to you\nA chunk of our savings to one of the online banks and like he could just that I went to the bank rates like the one that had a good interest rate and the five star rating but my my nagging concern is that I didn't see a direct link to the bank so I had to\nGoogle it to find it and that set it up and it looks legitimate but I still have this nagging fear that one of these times when I'm going to go to log into my account\nAnd money's going to a site down right okay so let me tell you what the loop\nIs with a you worked at the bank Craig list with any of these lists um when someone doesn't pay them referral fees\nThey're not going to provide a direct like they're going to give you the information but it's the best right out there but that's why there wasn't a hyper willing to take you right to it\nOkay so it doesn't in any way to make that a a bad bank or one that you should be wary of it's just that since they wouldn't pay money any kind of commission is going to be a little more work for you to do business with them what kind of rate are you learning\nUm Q and a quarter\nTo quarter already knew that is I think today the highest anybody's paying is too okay yeah it it ...\nIt was when I set it up and I mean I guess my other question is since there's not a brick and mortar bank locally and I think the things that are cases supposedly based out of New York but other other special safeguards that you should take when you use an online bank asked because I'm not sure what I Would do all of a sudden I couldn't access my account or the bank's website\nWhere you can always crossed validate that you're dealing with real people are going to F. D. I. C. dot Gov and checking to see that it is a real institution stand your insurer to the quarter million\nAnd as long as you have to cross referenced you're you're good to go and online banks are going to be a bigger and bigger part\nOf our financial market in the United states because particularly people who have come of age and the last Fifteen Years\nGoing to physical sang branches just isn't part of how they do things\nAnd so the the future's going to be captured by online only institutions and what you're doing is just plain smart\nI Hope so I Am certainly seem slightly money on the

union and and actually they are currently pay two and a half percent but only on you know up to a certain amount of money so I was getting a good interest rate on some of my savings but there was a lot out there that I wasn't gaining anything on\nWell two and a half is really great that's fantastic um I didn't know any credit unions were paying savings rates that Hi Beverly with us on the Clark

into some hearing aids and they seem like air so expensive several thousands of dollars even at my favorite warehouse club or I Know it's we used to reputable Christ\nOr you are you when you say favorite warehouse club or are you talking about Sam's or Costco\nIt'd be Costco\nCosco has some very basic hearing aids that you may be able to buy it like five hundred dollars a year okay but you can do a lot cheaper than that and get a true real hearing aid and that's what you'd like you'd like a better deal right\nWhen I'm starting to see is in the newspapers or magazines some other tearing a type of companies and I'm looking to find out if they're reputable or if there's any other recommendation that would be a little bit better priced\nOkay so there's two things you'll see in the ads one you'll see your ads that are very cleverly written bit under the law the devices are not considered to be hearing aids they're referred to as peace saps under the law\nPersonal sound the amplification product I think is what it stands for\nAnd those are being very heavily promoted on the Web and as you mentioned the newspaper ads and people are selling those from anywhere like under a hundred dollars to typically camping out around three hundred dollars\nAnd then there are actual real hearing aids that require that you also have the services of an audiologist in order for you legally to be\n... a piece at you and I could go start our own Mike ... piece at company now there is one that's kind of a step in between and I'd like you to look at the website is I hear medical dot com\nAnd they sell a hearing aid they also sell a FDA approved tests get where you can do your own actual fully FDA approved era test okay because the way the business works right now\nIs a lot of places do the hearing test quote unquote for free\nAnd then they make the massive mark up on the hearing aids is to my knowledge we're the only country on earth that uses this business model and so I hear medical gets around that you buy you actually paying for the hearing test\nAnd then you get the really inexpensive true hearing aid\nSo the thing about them or any others are reputable so we don't spend money on something that doesn't work for a dollar\nOkay so the thing with hearing aids who's\nGoing to sound terrible it doesn't matter if you spent five thousand dollars on hearing aids the customer satisfaction with hearing aids is extremely low so that's why I'd like you to start off with something much less expensive and see if\nYou can find one you're happy with\nBefore you spend

Brenda ...\nDo you I mean there's just so many Bonnie dogs on our board of love Bonnie\nI mean it's just us on it is awesome what you do out there and your day of service we ... neglect does when they asked week his again record breaking right\nYes a monsignor spoke about that in front of all of our corporate faculty in our all of our staff yesterday about how he\nUh went to downtown there or to your shelter and um how he went there scrub floors and he said he you know and for a monsignor two you're just enriched he came out of there was just a vigor and just to\nJust it felt great he said and um he said he always says there was such a kind of ... and ... or ... it was beautiful and to hear that and I get it echoes what we do and it's the community isn't it I mean this community is fantastic I I I never leader because of just the Bismarck recommended\nYeah and you know the University of Mary is is is so intentional about instilling that culture of giving it we don't try giving back generosity volunteerism\nYou know I I remember well anyways I Am far too many stories I could go on and on but but anyhow we appreciate what you and are you married do\n[laughter] I think are better they brought out of you know how to how I got an\nSisters are they give us a pretty good base to starve to death or a leadership and so it's easy to do the right thing when you're at the University of ...\nIt's so much for being on here with us today cat value that I'm\nJust visiting to find a show and you're talking about how you were in banking prior to being at the university ... so I think I just tell our listeners a little bit about um I guess your background and how long you been at University of Mary and I know that directive development of the athletic department like what exactly you do there\nCorrect thank you um and it's great to be on um you know I've been in the community all my life except for maybe those six years down in the ... so [laughter] but I I ah I've been here went through all the school systems went to see him or his high school\nThe community is fantastic I've seen so many changes so many developments and and everything that makes you want to continue to be in the community because everything is in the right direction I look at our past leaders and all sectors of business and government it's been great\nAnd so to raise a family here and now to have them stay and raise their families are children it's just beautiful to be a part of and so I've been at the University of Mary probably almost seven years time flies by had a great career and the banking industry and knew a lot a lot of people\nUm and so now Bob taken my my energy out to the University of married to a new development work and development work\nIs you know people put a dollar signs of development I always talk about how and some of them like it to be some of the lonely as people in the cafeteria and everywhere\nI mean 'cause they shake their hand and then they protect their pocket book with [laughter] but you know you know that why I don't have a friend is that one [laughter] but you know uh we\nWouldn't be able to do we do if it wouldn't be for the community that we have and then over some areas up it's beautiful with a doctor Miller's presidential leadership prior to sister than sister Thomas welder and then now monsignor um I Do development work but I what I Do is I I'm\nI nurture I build I enhanced new relationship city and ... and Mary\nAnd development comes by relationships and so all you have to do is make sure that you're um you're there you answer questions and so\nBeing in development with athletics I Do relationships with our athletics teams and that's very exciting because ah everyone loves to talk about\nUh you know some part of a sport or maybe they don't know all about it but their granddaughter or somebody they know their neighbor girl plays the universe Mary soccer or something like that so it's great to be a part of and so the fundraisers that we have our dynamic\nAnd uh I guess today too I'm here to chat about ... and feathers who thinks ...\nIs since then fathers'\nWell first of all now ... do you know where they come from right a fan and a feather come on now from New York okay [laughter]\nWell of course\nFans and feathers or what we wanted to do is we wanted to come up with a a fundraiser and this is actually our seventh year of getting it right and I don't I Hope we never get it right because it's so fun to try and get a you know and so ... is all about we live in the great state of North Dakota it's a great time of the year\nSo why not showcase one day through the game and fish regulations the things that you can do in on the lakes and in the valleys and out in the primaries and in the tree Rosen in this lose hunt and fish for a day come in with your game I have a point system\nAnd then just showcase the beauty and the bounty that is out there in North Dakota for those of us like myself who love the outdoors and there's so many of us that do it's a it's a great day\nIt sounds like a Sunday it sounds like a a great opportunity for a lot of individuals that live here in in ... um what are some of the details of the day as they're kind of a timeline of when it kicks off and what they it's actually it's\nThis coming Saturday October twenty and so yes at travel one AM those teams and there are some teams out there believe it or not I can't give their names and I can't give their strategies but I Will tell you at twelve or when they're fishing am I Am in the dark\nI don't you know nice nice hysterical yeah they are already up they have their coffee or whatever and they get to this lake because they've got to get that because you know what at five thirty am we're still sleeping by the way\nThey are now in the ... because of the ducks and the geese are going to be gone\nAnd they got to make sure at ten thirty there in the field or the tree role on uncles land and then they got to get to the other uncles or friends land because there's a coyote out there that needs to be eradicated or or skunks or something so it's truly all about what you can do in this great state on one day\nAnd it is amazing the amount of game that comes in oh I'm sure and then to put a knife to it and to to secure it and to put it in ... and the market and have a memory and then to freeze it and and eat it later on this winter I Know it come on you and your looked at any gross [laughter]\nI'd love to make you a couple of those wild game a meal and just go what am I eating is this like prime river he and I go Sharon\n[laughter] wow that's exciting to me\nIt is and it it's fun to see uh the grandparents the children the grandchildren daughters and sons granddaughters that partake in this event because it is about memories and relationships\nAnd you know what some don't maybe they'll shoot anything or catch a couple but it's about those hours of being together and just building members\nThat's how you raise money in the sea that\nWell the teams um they pay a certain dollar amount per individual to be a part of it and what they go out and shoot or what they go on catches up to them but when they came back when they come back to where the forage fairgrounds by the way I should have mentioned that at the Joanna ... memorial building right across from game and fish\nAnd between four and five teams will come in and they'll go ooh and ah and try and get all their secrets words gets those fish or just shoot those ducks and\nAnd then there's raffles\nA we have a grand prize through a great community support as you to no\nAction motor sports with a four wheeler extreme sales right down the strip here with a trailer so for a ten dollar chance at Grand prize of a four wheeler and the trailer two thousand Eighteen models I mean that's unbelievable that's amazing but then all the other prizes we have that people can buy raffles for and then just give to the University of Mary or fundraising for athletics what's called the armada\nAnd that means basically all ships coming together all teams coming together\nAnd that's where the money goes that's raised all of our money raised goes to student athletes scholarships and so uh it's a beautiful thing that we can do at the University of Mary to enhance that experience for those young men and women that come to marry to play sports\nHow much do give out and you're only and the athletic you know actually double a in the division that we're in um in our ... conference they they regulate the amount of scholarships but\nSo if a scholarship is say twenty thousand dollars and you can give out thirty forty forty five fifty it all depends on which capabilities are to give out and so\nThat's awesome and hockey hockey hockey fourteen ...\nDorian complex where you are or at least one Cadillac Arena uh they're leaving tonight for Florida for a couple of games and then they're back but you've got to get out and watch this these young men are doing so great and we're proud of all the Bismarck talent and beyond that\nWe have here huh so if someone wants to get tickets to see a hockey game where can they go\nShe had a really tough day at school and she told her mom that she didn't\nLike her friends she didn't like her life and she didn't know why kids had to be so mean um she writes one of our buildings his name is Rodney he's Nineteen years old\nSo she came out at six o'clock on Wednesday like she always does she rode Rodney she played her favorite game and then when she got in the car she's like just kidding mom I don't I don't have my life anymore I like my life\nAnd her mom I'm sent me a picture when she got home\nShe drew up a picture of Rodney and said this is what freedom means to me oh wow so every every day when we think oh\nThis is too hard this is too expensive um parents tell stories like that and\nAnd then here we go [laughter]\nWow you know and um so where\nDo you get referrals from how can parents with children with a disability get third child mineral than us\nThe um local pediatric clinics have been really great I'm a patient clinics the hospitals have been really great and if you want to be a writer in our program our youngest writers for our oldest writer Seventy two you don't have to be just a child but\nYou can just give us a call um checks on Facebook on line and we can get you the forms that your physician it's a sign off on to to get you started in our program\nAnd so what what is the program like is there are different programs that can sign up for since you have a range of four to Seventy two\nYup yup so when I'm after you say most of the time we um take a look at the consent forms that we get from ...\nYep so when I'm after you say most of the time we um take a look at the consent forms that we get from\nEither occupational physical therapists as well as your physician and then we'll kind of put you up with a writing partner or maybe an individual class uh usually we set up our sessions in six weeks so you write every day I'm are being once a week for thirty minutes for six weeks\nAnd then generally we try to give our horses a one week break and then we'll start another six weeks session cool is it expensive for parents to be a part of this I'm so right now for a six week session\nWe charge a hundred and eighty dollars however we do scholarship a lot of writers and we have yet to turn away a rider on to the inability to pay [noise]\nSo um whatever whatever you can afford if you can't afford anything we will find a way to make it possible\nWe don't want it to be um we don't want it to be an activity just for\nFamilies that can't afford it we want any any kid or any adult that needs a service to be able to access it\nThat's awesome you mentioned um a story of a little girl what would you say like um the biggest difference you notice and kills that participate in the program from maybe the start of the six weeks and then at the end do you do usually notice a pretty big shift and\nYeah attitude are out in confidence um there's there's obviously the the physical\nThe physical ability increases that we can see as far as core strength um balance but where I see this confidence um these kids have a hard time in school\nHave a hard time in social situations or whatever it may be but they can come out to the bar and and they can decide on what they're going to do with the Thirteen hundred pound animal and that's pretty empowering [laughter]\nIt it's interesting I I've taken horseback riding lessons I'm Out at harmony stable yeah with Sherry she's great she's great too and she does a lot of work with Charles homeland kids you know in different group homes and whatnot\nBut it's amazing to me how intuitive horses are\nYeah it um it is amazing they they always there's a quote which oh I Can't even remember who says it but um it goes along the lines of\nNothing can read the inside of a man like the outside of a horse than it is true and the great thing about horses they're always present in the moment um so if these if our participants go to therapy or wherever it is um\nTheir therapists and physicians have seen Thirteen Thirteen kids or whatever ahead of them the horses don't care what\nThe seven kids before them did as soon as they get on its new day it's a new moment there always present and mindful of the moment ... and it is so homemade yeah to be your own horses said is it is a grooming\nIt's it's amazing to watch um kids ADHD\nUm and those sorts of sorts of disability come out and just become one with the horses really inspiring do you have any events or anything coming out of that you want our listeners to know about yeah on the twenty eighth of October we have a free
