'em is twenty minutes after the hour and your information and listen to the front lines of freedom all across America if I wanted to freedom salute to one of our show sponsors honor and remember\nOur nation must never forget those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms the submission of honor and remember a nonprofit based in Virginia with support from their national sponsors part Nash who is the leading distributor us commissaries in fifth largest distributor learn more about how you can continue the mission honor and remember dot org\nNow it's time for comments whether colonel\nYou know what I hate I hate being called a hater I been called a heater a number of times usually in the context of being a Christian it goes oh you're a Christian so you have all women who had abortions homosexuals alcoholics\nAnd so on [noise] well I Am very very pro life or if you will anti abortion but I don't hate anyone including people who perform abortions or who have had one yet some people who don't even know me I've decided that I hate certain people I think ... there are people who do have those who disagree with them\nAnd say logical use incorrectly assumed that if they hate people they disagree with then everyone does\nWell today the big focus on hate is our commander in chief and those who support him as we're seeing today hate will often morph into violence all of the politically related violence that I've seen in our nation in the past couple of years comes from those on the political far left the specifically includes antifa anti or what have you call them\nOr a classic example is a fascist Nazis but we see people who are active in politics or elected officials\nOr even people who just wear a garment with the conservative political symbol or message they're being attacked\nSo far most of the attacks have been verbal but some of them in physical these hate motivated attacks on people are totally contrary to the way of life in a constitutional republic like ours\nAnd then we have members of Congress and other leaders openly advocating violence against their opponents including the president\nWorse they go on condemned by anyone including the media this is open rejection of our constitution\nDisagreement is not only okay if at least a rational discussion that can lead to a positive change we don't want everyone to think the same way this is the culture of socialist fascism communist societies yet it's sure appears this is the path our nation is on the haters anyway\nI have defended with my life the right of our citizens to peacefully protest against things they disagree with but that does not include screaming in the face of a legislator disrupting government meetings are blocking access to buildings I guess it does include\nRound but do you know that when those groups do have their gatherings are parades they leave tons of trash behind picking up after themselves seems to be beneath them in our country doesn't need this attitude as a part of our culture noses a mainstream media seems to support this hateful approach towards our president he certainly is not perfect\nBut he's already been a significant number of very positive things including a vastly improved economy with the company the lowest unemployment rates and lowest number of people on welfare and decades his foreign policy is returning respect ordination hey look at an ambassador Nikki Haley in the UN\nWas Korea look at Israel and now we're dealing with China and Russia and Iran from a position of strength\nYet he's still hate the\nPresident Trump is to address the family Research Council a Christian group they believe that homosexual you soon so some have called them a hate group\nAnd they're putting Trump down for speaking to a hate group huh\nAnd look at justice cabinet he received death threats his home was vandalized and his family threatened and he's not the only one people will attack like this are hostile to our constitution which they want is for all of us to think and speak only what they approve my greatest fear is that's a clear if unstated goal of the radical far left\nIs to overthrow our constitution they're attacking our president with a goal of getting them removed and a constitutional republic the way one deals with an unlikely elected official is working to get him or her replaced in the next election not violence like we see today\nViolence is the exact way Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party took over the parliamentary democracy of Germany prior to World War two we have to stop the hate filled comments and return to intelligent dialogue we don't have to agree with each other and everything I don't think that's possible anyway we do have to take the hate out of the communication\nI pray for hate filled people hating her social life as a hate are much more than it hurts the target of the have the political hate also hurts our nation our kids just might grow up thinking there's such behavior is acceptable\nTroops with someone get through the hate talk just ended leaders necessary if there is talk of violence suggest that is the legal and anti freedom and you plan to call the police what happens we have to take our nation back from the haters are we still have a constitutional republic and those are my comments were today\nThere's this girl down a hill and you're listening to the front lines of freedom now we've got to enjoy some more wisdom was the one officer all last week after they roll\nColonel were in the thick of the political season with midterm elections just around the corner\nHowever the department of defense so strict rules about how members of the U.S military can participate in politics so what do these rules cover\nThe department of defense encourages active duty members to vote in established several programs to help active duty personnel register and cast absentee ballots but when it comes to actively campaigning for a specific political candidate the military draws the line it should be noted that these prohibitions\nDo not apply to members of the national guard reserve unless of course are currently serving on active duty now active duty military members can and should vote\nThey also may express it personal opinion on political candidates in issues they just can't express those opinions as a representative of the department of defense or the military active duty members can sign a petition for specific legislative action or a petition to place the candidates name and an official election ballot\nThey can also write a letter to the editor expressing their personal views on public issues or political candidates however if the letter Dennis ... is the member as a member of the military it must clearly state that the views are expressed\nAre those are the individual and not the department of defense now here's one I thought was kind of interesting colonel maybe you solve this when you were on active duty a political bumper sticker can be put on a military members person\nThe ... are signs are not allowed what this means isn't a yard sign in a military members home is actually against the rules according to the department of defense\nMilitary members can still attend rallies fundraising activities an all the other things that we would do as a normal citizen as long as they're not in uniform and not creating the appearance of any military sponsorship or approval\nWell here's an interesting one military members cannot speak before a partisan political gathering including any gathering that promotes a partisan political party candidate or cause\nIn general active duty military members should avoid any activity that may be reasonably viewed as directly or indirectly associated in the department of defense or the department of homeland security with a partisan political activity makes us\nNo active duty military members males will not hold any civil office and the federal government requires an appointment by the president this prohibition does not apply to retire reserve members\nHowever if they'd been called the active duty for more than two hundred and Seventy days they actually have to get approval from the secretary of their service to allow them to retain their public office or even run for reelection\nSo just imagine that congressman who's a reserve is who gets recalled the active duty to do let's say Afghanistan for a year he actually has to have the service secretary approve him to keep his office kind of an interesting perspective isn't it it is a deep\nWell bottom line folks is the military members should get out and vote for the most part they should shy away from getting involved in in political race until after they've left the military\nYes we have some reserve members were also politicians but we don't have any active duty service members who are currently politicians and you know what I think that makes a lot of sense it does civilian control the military is the right answer\nSake you roll very appropriate very timely I appreciate your pal\nStraight ahead on front lines of freedom will review some lessons we should have learned from the Holocaust than David Barton will discuss the importance of next month's elections all this was coming up\nI'm going to you're standing telephone lines of freedom I'll be right

with the American military has met to this country\nThese are some of the greatest people who have been in this country has been the American military and the more they have done\nYeah and ... World War two they you know these guys came out of the depression\nThey went off they save the world and I want people to really understand and I think they they might get a feel for that they read the book these guys save the world\nAnd you know what they were up against the world would be completely different and unrecognizable as these young men who are teachers and farm workers and and you know hadn't gone off left\nThe homes that they lived and traveled to a distant land to fight really for people they did not do they not only fought for the people there they fought for our nation and our freedoms are way of life and they came back\nAnd they built this country and you know so that phrase the greatest generation I Want people to not only a realized how true that is what I Want them to get to know a few of these guys personally because I think it not only it's not just about my father it's about all of them and I I Know that\nA lot of people can relate and and and another another thing I could add quickly is that a lot of the world war two soldiers didn't talk about it when they came\nPeople can relate and and and another thing I could add quickly is that a lot of the world war two soldiers\nDidn't talk about when they came home so I get a lot of information a lot of the emails and people telling me\nAnd my grandfather was in World War two of my father was there my uncle or whatever and they never talk about it and I knew that had gone through a lot of things in this book allows people to see what their fathers grandfathers a or a you know family members\nOr what the American Soldiers went through and what they would the emotions that they felt and how strong they were and how victorious they were they\nWere the heroes and these were the liberator and these are

government for the next couple of weeks that means ... doing the research demoted intelligently and then to vote\nIs our government if we don't vote if we don't look into things to take responsibility shame on us in a griping doesn't have any value if you haven't done your work anyway robbing from lots of freedom baby\nHey good to be with y'all thanks for having me\nDavid I knew you grew up in a Christian family where did your interest in government come from a family thing\nOh now button brother when I grew up there were several thanks I hated state as far away from sex ads law history government politics or for the for the states away from and now those are the various in which I ... it's been a real transformation from the way I grew up to what I'm doing now\nOkay what attracted you and what not and some of the things you've done\nWell one of the things that attracted me was that kept the goofy stuff going on in my local city council is a great example just talk about but I'm from a little town we have two hundred twenty people read my horse back and forth to work for very laid back and yet we ended up\nIn our little town with sticks lawsuits against the town too by the federal government we had in our little out a hundred and fifty thousand dollar deficit we had ... is just crazy and I looked at that said you got to be kitten that we can do better than that\nAnd so I really started working with groups and how they get better candidates and that's where I recognize that quality government is no better than the leaders you elect\nAnd that if you don't pay attention to it that people turn out and vote will elect leaders as it turns out only two percent of most cities actually choose to winter so their elections so it's a very few people that if you look at the city of Houston great example uh Houston to far just sit in the nation\nHouston by itself is larger than twenty six states population wise and generally four percent of the city of Houston chooses the mayor which is equivalent to stick it up there twenty six days and only two percent of that four percent of what it takes choose the winter\nSo central to ... percent of patients population chooses the equivalent of a gal her twenty six states and I'll let them said there's no way I can sit by and let crazy things half a mile or two percent of the winter and so that's where I got very actively involved not only in recruiting candidates but happy candidates Ron I have a political office in Texas for nine years\nI'm a firm believer that you can have good laws could constitution but if you don't have good people ministry of that ... those beliefs he'll never happy with government\nWell that's absolutely true it's a little bit like if I gave you a car and I

our nation by radical Islam this is not theoretical this is going on today we need to be aware of it\nTalk to us about what we as citizens as parents need to be making are huge in our communities aware of and this is not the heat Muslims but it's to be aware of threats am I right\nAbsolutely oh we need to be aware of threats and being aware of threats has nothing to do with hating\nPeople look when you have the security system in your home whether eighty or any other place\nNot because you hate your neighbors because you'll know that unless you lock your doors at night\nThat may be some that are within what happened to drive in front of your neighborhood and who may come into your property and break her door\nAnd he just wants to protect yourself do I say my name is our dogs\nThey're not saying that a lot because I had to you all my neighbor got my enemy you're not going to put your neighbors you know doing it for the fact that there was a possibility that that people can wander into your neighborhood and break into your home I think the church has all the time and I ask about that I said you like your target night\nAnd of course they look at me like of course it like ... and I said well if you want all that could you come to America you want us to have open borders we need to welcome everybody because everybody who need the place to hide they need to be able to\nJust walk

that condition it's heated that's got to get ten you've got plenty of basic a threat to the people use them at that and send them to your church\nAnd they don't have an answer for that because they know what I'm saying the truth and edits and so this is why we have to protect ourselves but another chapter in my book rise at a very important and it is titled operation indoctrination and it talks about what's happening\nAt three week course where students have to study Arabic or an the wayside and memorize verses from the core an adopt as comic names will go to Moscow on a field trip texture

few ... one week lately I didn't mind it just it was a time just settling down period like a time out a timeout Tesla time since\nI went to visit them at ... ... you know I was loading little call it a T T well the a Tesla model three it was\nBut if you wanted wanted was long awaited but you couldn't really get one right away and then they started making deliveries on and will now they are ramping up delivers the deliveries and actually\nThe biggest thing I hear from people whenever I hear a Tesla mentioned even if I'm not in the conversation I listen to him talk and say\nWell they're just going to go bankrupt one day they keep losing all this money and lose and all this money and I don't know what the whole deal behind the story is all I Know is that the guy that owns that company has a ton of money and I see a lot of business owners\nWhen they build a business it costs the money to get the business going and then once they get going they're ready to make a profit because they've put all that money in the building and even if they lose money to get started a lot of them do it\nWell Tesla as of the [noise] quarter three of this year uh turned a profit of three hundred and twelve million dollars\nThey ramped up the production on the model three and they're making a twenty percent profit per model three sold right now and they even had such a demand on it they're delivering enough that they raise the price of the car a thousand bucks so\nI'm pretty cool and Sarah ah that says they have a a stockpile of three billion dollars in cash in the company that's pretty good right now which is yeah that they don't need to win\nUh there's like no we're going to follow the rules and and do it\nI'm the same thing that's going on with a lot of a mission stuff a lot of shops back in the eighties would take a catalytic converter or a car and just put dual exhaust on\nAnd then when they crack down on that a little bit more people stopped doing that will now it's come to the point where somebody comes in and has a small emissions control devices on a car and they say well it's not working all just\nJust get around it or try to defeat it they won't do that anymore or the used to be you know you could do in the nineties people all the time said well I just want you to unplug my passenger airbag 'cause I don't want to you know hurt somebody that's in the front seat with no that's not going to happen now\nIt hit us and the thing that's the thing that makes it even more curious about this pet and I I'm with you a little bit when we when they first started talking to us but we'd have company tires no we can't fix like oh come on we got to be able to fix that and you got to know your tire because well it was just what I was going to say though is the\nThe the patching technology has actually gotten better oh yeah you know now they had her to the plug you pull through with the tribe backside\nAnd I know one of my friends in Sioux Falls claims he invented that but he never did quite get the royalties for that one of the guys are over at our TNA stores who falls but ah\nThey ah are definitely a there's better patches out there that you can get now and there was a long time I think where it didn't help the situation with the plugs first came out people are using those plugs as more of a permanent solution\nThat the actual plug itself and while they will last a long long time you know that they were never intended to be the final two or three and a whole no don't do that yeah those are all bad decisions that led to people having to be more cautious but you gotta be careful and you got to know your entire if\nYou look at that diagram on the Internet and see what's going on that will that's where we're here to educate you to the end you know our listeners to help them because if somebody says no this tires not ... but you know because you looked it up that it is go to another shop and then explain to that shot\nHey ah this here I understand we can't patch on the edge but that's\nNot on the edge what do you think and you know the shop the it's up to them and the final decision but still if you know you're one step further to preventing a uh\nThey'll be out there was this is really really helpful\nBecause you know I like being a professional as Syria I had no idea that certain areas are no fictional surgeries or fiction so that really made me of or a understand the situation a little harder to sexual I appreciate it\nYou bet and things like that or just unlucky Sunday is the they puncture something right through a\nBelt I had an elderly gentleman come in this week and I felt bad my first thought was this guy's getting scanned because he said the the shop I just came from told me I had three tires that we're not repair trouble but my tires were only six months old and he says I Can't really believe that but if they need to be replaced whatever so he was coming in for new tires\nAnd we looked at the tire so we'll check and find out in our guy looked and he says well that was not repair all had a screw right in the sidewalk right right through it and the other two were within a quarter inch of the far outside edge six how does somebody pick up\nThe guy said he drives through a lot of construction areas with houses and stuff that are being built so well that can happen but none of the tires had a ... in the actual flat part of the trend that we're all ... of the tire and that's about is unlucky is you can and they were new tires to they were they were really they were about six my thing is sad so you\nCan't do anything [laughter] just had my what I can see what you're really that will knock on wood you haven't had a flat land area to have your talking why don't you why would you bring that are so so you have in the field goal all year [laughter]\nUh six five nine for for one five oh\nThat's a state that I have a two thousand four hung up ... I was on my way to work\nNo matter like came on and my battery went dead I tested the battery and the charity system what field battery in it and read anything them charging system but in a battery with that I replaced the battery testing to chart a fits in with my chest and that says he says the U.S good\nThe battery is good but the battery laid on the ... still on any suggestions\n[noise] you know you're going to need to read scanned the vehicle and see if there are any codes in there because they they do have most of the cars may now we'll have charging systems that are\nPretty complicated as far as their metered by the engine computers sometimes the body computer a lot of them have a charging censor on one of the\nHigh current wires to the battery and all those things work together and they can set codes when there's a problem and even though you fixed it if there's a code and there may still be keeping the light on\nAlso um the it may have a a failure in one of those circuits maybe charging but it may have a bad charge censor there's a lot of\nThere's a lot more involved than it used to be when you just had a field wire of power wire aground wire state or wire and you just you could see the entire system now it's feeding back through like rush said the computer there are sensors involved\nOr sometimes the voltage regulator might be actually in the computer on the vehicle we had that just recently on on a question that came from a\nI think it was a listener down in Florida it was looking to buy some parts and uh so we we just have to be very aware of that the systems have got to be so much more intricate\nThan they once were ... they are trying to keep the voltage ... smooth steady state no different than you do for your home computer system right you you put on interrupted power supply in front of your computer to keep everything smoothed keep the power clean\nThey have to do the same thing for this vehicle because you're running and on board computer network throughout the vehicle controlling multiple systems and if the power is not right it's not going to work right\nSo other than checking the code to find out I mean is there is there anything that he can do without bringing in\nIt's not going to work rate so other than checking the code to find out I mean is there is there anything that he can do\nWithout bringing in the end is there any all the kids you know times are able to check it out and actions in because I have some cars coming it's amazing how many Coca Cola and there are two threes loose tooth brush clean up the connection but there\nThere's a lot of stuff that's this loose we have a car come in and see I've worked in all the stuff that doesn't work and they just give me this look when I say oh well this wasn't plugged in and I plug\nIt in [laughter] we're going to go or serious [laughter] yeah [laughter] and\nSometimes I feel really bad for them because I've done all this work that they've put a hole in take manifold on the whole but they've got all the coils and spark plugs and you forget for the oil in\nNo way you don't really I have seen that so many times where people have on their own ... listening to us we're trying to help you here we're trying to help you from yourself [laughter]\nIf it because I I'm this guy I have done it with a washing machine I've done it with a free trader you assume you know what's wrong\nAnd you commit say large operation your gear up Vegas learning operation you purchased parts for this large operation you spent half of a weekend they had this large operation he put it back together and it does exactly the same thing is that not frustrating and super fun and then you find out it was\nThe door sensor on the door and you're just replace the ... I mean on the washing machine whatever it might happen to be I mean there's just these are the types of things that people do all the time on cars where they they make this decision that All right I've got\nI've got a bad intake gasket mhm I've got to have a bad intake guess I had a guy replace\nA transfer case shift motor on a Chevy Truck he replaced the four wheel drive shift module you replace the switch and then he replaced the transfer case because the the transfer case\nWould not go into four wheel drive lowered he just absolutely had to have that for Boehner's vote on the water and they came and he says I've done all this stuff I Can't figure out what's going on I said well what do you do and he goes well see I pushed it and it doesn't do anything just flashes\nI stepped on the brake put a neutral hit the button and it shifted and he says well how did you do that so well you got to have a neutral step in the break oh he's tried to go to for low and he says no you don't and I said yes you do we know you know\nYes you do want to get into your clue he could have started with the owner's manual or inferring down his son vice president need anything it was working perfectly\nAt age ... five ... for for one five oh let's talk to Mike in Idaho Mike you're on the under the hood show what can we do for ya\nI uh haven't two thousand three Corvette and about a thousand miles to go out for the new alternate around it and they set the battery was about fourteen months old and was good\nAnd now it's sitting in my garage up north here in Idaho and draining the batteries just draining\nHow quickly it could end up how quickly or maybe three hours I won't be out driving around and I can watch the alternate or go for fourteen point one Thirteen point seven years old so I don't even want to shut it off anymore and so overnight in my garage I have to charge it\nSo it goes down while you're driving\nYeah even while I'm driving so there was a draw somewhere and I'm just curious what's the trick\nIt if you had if you had a a just a standard let's say you know nine PM Alternator or a hundred probably just over three hundred and fifty ... well yeah my ...\nYou got you got to stand there was a a hundred and thirty ample later on they're charging at full capacity if it was a good Alternator and it was actually losing current as it was driving to being driven\nSomething would be on fire and then [laughter] it would have to be that big of a of a of a short seriously I mean it would have to be like to start or\nSomething would be on fire and that it would have to be that big of a of a of a short seriously I mean it would have to be like to start or pawn and running continuously\nIt's more embarrassing yeah I think so they're like right people look at you and go look across it always curl up in the back seat of the precinct leaders could just say dumped done for the day I take a nap [laughter] eight six six five nine for for one five oh let's talk to rod rod you're on the end of the show what can we do for you\nYeah I have a two thousand four vehicles ... thirty eight hundred engine and the plastic\nTo come out of ... ... are are are bad I'm going to replace them and I'm just wondering I could relate it quicker as long as the other part that are as a hundred and forty thousand miles on it today to replace the water up at the same time and if I Do what it is going to feel it on the boat\nI'd be more concerned about the into the gas gets in the water pump but you know at this age we do put water pumps on those cars ... foot one on this week and it at least so long that killed the or had guests gets on the car because it was only later get hot too many times\nDoesn't help that their gauge and their desk has been broken for but the ending yes there are definitely in our in our listener northern climate they are the bigger culprit of problems\nIn a water pump they go from ten below zero to two hundred degrees and back and forth so many times that the expansion contraction but those those cooling bypass too you're talking about those things right out all the time very popular item\nWater pump if you're if you're in that area it's a lot more work to do the pump than just the the tubes\nYou're actually taking on another operational rice on that of almost two separate is not in stream with what you're doing really\nAnd on water pump boats anytime you pull both out of a block like that you want to put New Zealand on anything that was sealed when you took it out sometimes you'll find both the longer ones you pull him out you'll see that threads dealer on him they need to be completely cleaned reach\nThe open and put back in just the ones with sealer if you get to see her on something that does not have ceiling on it you can actually break the block by twist and soaps and then from the hydraulic pressure of the boat going into a whole like that\nDoes that help you out yep thanks very much\nAppreciate that very much for the call eight six six five nine for Ford won five oh let's Dr Jack Jack you're on the end of the show we do for you\nSay in our area member why why factor hair

two\nTo four to six cylinder okay look for vacuum lines leaking on the on the edge and look at the back side of the intake manifold where the PC valve is connected were hidden and you can't see it as a rubber boots on there those boots tear often\nJust from age and when they do they'll they'll loud too much air and the engine it'll give you a lean on both thinks that is the first thing to start with look for\nLook for symptoms things like that that might\nCause it to run Leno we've mentioned it before but\nWe've had a some people that have used the they've either never used it before\nAnd made the switch to a ten percent ethanol or they've always used ten and now they've gone to Fifteen and because of the nature of it that causes field trims to run a little higher and the engine which

mile or Ninety four\nYeah sat for quite a while that's what I'm Wondering if maybe that ain't the problem but I had a story for about five years ago I took it out I put tires and breaks on it and change oil up real good drained a gaffe the gap filter on it\nPut plugs and wires I they're all that stuff you don't correct completely filling it up\nAnd started up arrives fine seems like but\nAfter a while that it warms up it starts breaking this rattling noise like it's got lift her life\nThat I Can't really place but when it's cold and don't rattle at all and uh I've taken it to a couple of places that made all and I'll let it as they say it's kinda weird but ah they shut it could be something to do with the uh counterbalance weight on the character or\n\nOnce again we want to send our congratulations to the whole stands up new sailing now mine quite all and\nThey were clearly superior today in this quarter final game defeating Shiloh\nFifty to fourteen [noise]\nFirst play from scrimmage ratings are up go Seventy yards and\nIt just was never in doubt today the states were dominant\nThey definitely were you know they put up pretty mistake regained their only mistakes coming lights\nIt just was never in doubt today the whole things were dominant\nAnd they definitely were you know they play it up pretty mistake regained their only mistakes coming late in this game which at that point they were pretty irrelevant\nAnd they capitalized on all shells mistakes shallow is unable to get away with anything you know if some if you missed naps miscarriage here they capitalized and all the ... the capitalize on every ... tackle and they're all over all did a great job at a just utilizing all ... states than playing the game playing again the best ability [noise]\nSo the whole scenes will be home next week we believe against rape powers later\nThey were ahead in the game we haven't heard a final that will be next Saturday at two PM right here in New Salem\nHas the whole teams will be just one victory away from moving onto the Dakota bowl and\nThey're they're they're just an awesome team Josh they're going to be hard to stop\nYeah those are definitely I mean they they they have all the weapons they have all the tools they need they can go all the way they could take this and um he got one more game to get through and then when it's not ... I did the first day anything can happen you got to show them play every game and they got to make sure they're they keep them safe free and like I imagine they could see themselves as culpable knocking on the state championship\nAnd we're going to bring in our player of the game ratings or obscene you're running back\nFor the whole teams had three touchdowns on the day including that Seventy yard or on the first play the game Brayden congratulations or\nYou guys came out in this game you had a lot of fire you knew you had said you knew how how tough Shiloh was and you had to come out ready talk about that first play from scrimmage and how it set the tone for this game\nUm yeah they're they're good football team and they always are so we knew he had to come out strong arm I just got the ball that kind of set up my blocks and I saw the might just hit as hard as I could and I got an open field and just\nCut it ends on I Can't imagine how much fun you're having a team with so many weapons hanky starts and then you have your cell did as she got superior back into the line up you can't can anybody with your team right\nRight uh you know all we have a lot of good athletes on a team uh everyone to make way we all we're all their executing and uh we had a few hiccups tonight but we'll be All right next to him or get that squared away [noise]\nI'm Talking about not shutting down shallow as often as you know they've been able to score and everybody but you guys really made it hard on them how was your defense able to dominate today as well\nUm I thought I thought we were just more aggressive today um we say discipline and everyone said in their own spots we didn't get out of out of key or anything they we just kept him inside of us in may plays\nYou got a taste of the Dakota bowl a couple of years ago you are now one went away from getting another trip to talk about the level longer\nFew guys I'm you know there's a lot of seniors on this team where we're really anxious and we we want to get there I'm so we'll be working hard as ever just to make that happen\nWell Britain as our Bruno Z pizza player of the game you get a ten dollar gift certificate to Bruno so take a ride into Bismarck with your family enjoy it beats on us I think congratulations you're not going to bring in the winning coach sleep clients and congratulations coach a you guys came out ready to play I mean I I\nThink human nature would be the way he handled Shiloh a couple of weeks ago maybe there would be some overconfidence there was none of that\nChild has a great program and traditionally is a tremendous football team and we knew they were going to be well prepared and you can't do you know you know you got to the stage of the of the season you got to be ready every game you can't take anything or anybody for granted and you know and and and so we we looked at it as\nYou know we report that other game away and said we're focusing on you know this is a zero zero team playing teams playing against each other and we've got to come out do the best we can\nBoy that first play from scrimmage I means er off really can do that seems to talk about how he gets by one guy and its forget about it\nI I think the team's underestimated speed\nThat means or off really can do that seems to talk about how he gets by one guy and its forget about it\nI I think the team's underestimated speed a little bit you know and and he gets the sidelines very quickly and and once he turned the corner it's extremely hard to catch him I mean he he runs angles and he just doesn't nice things that you just got an opportunity there was an inside power and got a little bit of a balance on that and once you reached outside the numbers look good and he was gone\nI don't know how a team could start to defend your off ants hanky starts it\nWas or off and did us announced appears back ... back on the line up you have so many options how much fun as a coach\nYou know we're very fortunate ah you know number one is is that we've got\nSome tell the kids and they're not just talented but their own selfish and they they want to see the other guy do well they want to block heart for each other\nYou know they want to do those little things we don't have anybody that is worried about Kerry's or catches of things like that we got guys that are just happy with winning games and being successful I think that you know that speaks even volumes above their athletic ability is is their team approach to the game\nAnd it's not only your skill guys I think your line doesn't get enough credit how they dominated scrimmage on both sides that are so tough and\nAlso the guys up front and in the trenches they always get over look you know what it is kind of just the nature of the game but we've got some kids up there all year that have just been getting better and better each week and on and we got some nice size and some good strength up there and and and they just work well together as a group and they've been doing a really good job force\nWhich Shiloh ending your season here a year ago in the semi finals is make this a little sweeter\nPeople have talked about that and you know it's it's always good to be the good program anytime during the year and\nI think it's one of those deals where we're really focused on this year and in in concentrating on what's in front of us rather than you know stuff like that I mean like I said you know we've got a bit of a rivalry and it's always nice to win but you know we're we're going to enjoy this one for a little bit and it sounds like most likely get ready for ...\nHours late I think there there were ahead in their game and you'll have it here\nTend to nothing was the final re powers like winning it so there'll be here next week I got to be at home for the semi finals or that lines up nicely for you but I'm sure you'll stress to your kids they gotta come ready again\nWell you know we talk about every week we we we we are one week at a time and we say we have to play in the next best game of our careers\nThis coming week and that's what we tell the kids next week Saturday we play the best game we played all year and if we don't we open up opportunities for bad things to happen and that's that's been our approach all year no matter who replayed and and that's been our focus and so you know we're just going to try and you know stay on that focus\nAnd what words would you have for Shiloh with a you know what how the battles have been\nWell I tell you what you know I mean they've dominated us several times over the past several years and and it's nice for us to be able to you know there's a great job he runs a great program you have tremendous athletes\nAnd and you know it's just one of those deals where this year I think we we had some better athletes plain and simple and sometimes that just the way it turns out you know but we we've got all the respect in the world to the program and and the things that those kids have done and the things that their coaches have done\nWell Steve we'll be watching your point for you guys the rest of the way congratulations steak you appreciate it that Steve climate and head coach of the whole stains a fifty to fourteen victory over the shallow sky hot so\nKudos to the whole teams but Josh sum up the season for the sky hawks again you kind of set at nothing to be ashamed of nine and two yeah they didn't make the semi finals for six straight year but they've got to the quarter finals not as solid year for ...\nDefinitely was a

don't worry he's been ... welcome back to Steve Down at\nOur telephone number is eight six six five by poor ...\nYou can call with your pauses if you like a train your dog to do it so far not a single dog who's called I Want to see that changed\nUh Hey Lynn yeah you're not a dog [noise]\nNo I'm not you're not a cat [noise] no but you have to\nYou do have to I Want a cat to call in one of these weeks I expect the cat to call it how can I help you\nUm my cat can wear a room in no time\nFor ... I'm afraid Dan ... you mean ... ... okay and\nI was wondering if there is a type a letter that would be that bad or if it's like another issue going on\nAll right here's the sure so I never clearing so the good\nWhoop I'm\nNot sure\nOkay that would be thinking through my mind a little boy okay so that would be more interesting actually not so into it weighs twenty six oh not so true and that and I say that we can go clean twenty four and twenty six\nI said because it depends on how low it is [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] now that's my next question is what comes out especially loose or is it solid and from\nA ferry some times ...\nOkay so here's what you need to do I'm thinking the problem have you talked to your veterinarian about those\nI'm not really\nOkay so what I Believe you could do is take a picture\n[laughter] veterinarians actually like these photographs take a picture of the number two in its various forms\nAs ... so you're waiting for your veterinarian put them in let's say it's a week away so during that period of time take some images of the poop brings that with the cat to your veterinarian my ah hey my guess is that\nIt's either you know some of us do well\nI can eat hotdogs every day in my stomach would not complain and just say bring it on I Know other people one hotdog\nAnd that's one too many you know and they are problems and our cats are the same way so some individual food may disagree maybe the brand and maybe not necessarily the brand but the kind of food you're buying within the\n... I'm a I'm a what I thought was a ... it\nMay let me let me finish it might be a really good brand for Ninety nine percent of you know every individuals and individual you know so it may work great for your other cat may work great for all the cats down the block just not this one individual cat doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the brand in fact I probably it's a suburb brand that you're purchasing so\nIt may be the individual food but it may have nothing to do with the food\nIt may be or that individual brand and maybe a food allergy about an ingredient in the food\nOr it could be or it could be a gastrointestinal issue that\nNeeds to be solved that um lots of foods your cat would have a problem so\nYour your veterinarian can figure out which of those\nUh is the most likely possibility but definitely if the poop is loose on a regular basis that can't be comfortable for your cat clearly is uncomfortable for the people that live in the house probably not comfortable for the other cat has got to share the same box from what you said\nHoney they he does not cover a fair stuff mhm\nAnd um that girl at all I have to go in there and and try to bury it I mean and\nI feel badly for it to somebody you want to say that must be a guy thing [laughter]\nYou know you know a so individual cats for a variety of different reasons will not bury their number two and we don't even know with all those reasons are some cats is just an individual tendency now to do it other cats are saying essentially they don't like the litter\nOther cats just want to get the heck out of there which might be the case with your cat or because it is so often uncomfortable the go perhaps so maybe your cat will begin to bury it once your cat is more comfortable about using the box I definitely would think that adding a second box might be\nFair to your other cat to give your other cat an option about which ...\nThe space I Would definitely do that because at some point in time she may say the heck with it I'm not using this box anymore so you're lucky\nBut your other cat is hung in there but I wouldn't force your other cat because this box seems at times I mean you can't be home all the time to scoop immediately and uh and it's not your other cats job to cover it even though the your other cats said I'll do it I guess I maybe your other cat his union I don't know\nSo you got yeah I don't know if you've got your other cat doing this so at some point your other cat may say I'm retiring I Want to do this anymore and\nSomebody else told me that could be because of it by now that wouldn't be getting ...\n... shape is wrong and\nWell All right so that's an issue and an important issue we you know it up and I'm Glad you brought that up we live in a nation you're not alone filled with overweight cats and as a result of the cats being overweight there are all sorts of medical issues\nThat are linked to being overweight or obese for cats we know that is the case and we know it's not healthy for your cat\nTo be overweight or obese so you're absolutely right about that however\nWell that might explain you're right that might explain why your cat has not bearing the poop it doesn't explain the loose poop and that doesn't explain the stink up the poop so still same thing see your veterinarian those possibilities I laid out\nAre among the possibilities that are most likely I suppose parasites and some other things are possible as well so see your veterinarian and let me know what happened\nOh okay I Will do that thank you for your house right fair enough thank you so much okay Bye bye ... ... ...\nTo our telephone number is eight six six five five for pets I'll be right back I've got to go get a close spin for my nose\nYou can find me reach me several different
