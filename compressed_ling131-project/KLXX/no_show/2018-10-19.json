withstand a cat five hurricane plus\nAnd the windows may not survive they may blow out the home itself is a hundred percent structurally sound\nAnd all that has to be done is its host out there is no issue with mold and so the reason I bring this up is we in America face an increasing problem with flooding\nFrom population growth um increase rainfall it's we're in a cycle of that\nAnd much of the United states and there are so many techniques that can be used\nThat will make homes and people in them safer make the structures more solid I went and toured\nThat will make homes and people in them safer make the structures more solid I went and toured\nA neighborhood in Holland is a an area subject to flooding a lot of Holland is below sea level and they now have these homes for a flood

circumstance we in the United states tend after a flood or disaster to rebuild exactly as we did before\nAnd a lot of these things if we think about how do we prepare\nFor the unexpected [noise]\nA lot of these things don't cost\nIn many cases any more money\nOr just little amount photo incremental amounts to make a structure much more robust make it safer\nAnd eliminate the thing of wash rents and repeat where property gets destroyed and then you have to rebuild and then another a active nature happens you have to rebuild again on and on there's no need for us to be fatalistic about this\nThis is an area we just need to be practical\nRalf ... is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Ralph\nHello Clark thanks for taking my call absolutely how you doing I'm doing great\nWe uh recently moved back for a living uh overseas for many years and he appreciated oldest say he said you have to say to make out to the integration milk cheese area because so many things have changed and very grateful for all your life you've given us so thanks for that\nWill give it a little back story where have you been living in for how long\nA first we lifted the u._k. for about five years spent in Switzerland for seven and put in Hong Kong for two years\nMy goodness and do you have kids that speak like twelve languages now\nNo kids so [laughter] how about you have any language is do you speak at this point\n[laughter] well three fluently and to a little bit so\nFantastic [laughter] and I speak English and enough Spanish to be able to find the bathroom\nWell see that's all you need you just need to be able to or the food and drink in line and then you got to go\n[laughter] [laughter] um one thing I'm curious about after all those years away did you have a hard time re establishing a credit score getting um auto insurance anything like that worry those areas difficult for you when you re integrated now in the U.S\nNo because we we have an address ... thanks very good friends of ours and we also had a home outside Atlanta on a lake that we kept so we never from that point of view we didn't leave [noise]\nWell that's great because you know the financial reintegration can be really difficult for people who are gone for a number of years but how can I be of service to you today\nWell the last thing that we wanted to do is we purchased the crow look and to do our banking and financial as you have a dies then I did some research on your website on that as well but\nI'm not quite sure whether I Need to set up a new Gmail account or the way that I can use social Jews and access to well to get that going\nWonderful question and when you're starting from scratch using a segregated computer\nOr financial it is recommended that you set up a separate Gmail account they would not integrate because you know with Gmail with Google accounts\nWhen you sign into a computer it just kind of automatically populate everything from a prior went on and so having that separate Gmail\nIs the best idea you can do to protect yourself and protect what you do well ths where how much was the chrome book he bought just for financial\n[noise] ah I don't know I live bullets fully from my end or service to them no real happy anniversary I'm sure she's very little money [laughter] I'm sure she did that go she listens to you too of course\nA perfect so with the ... the whole idea of a crime but the rough and I are talking about is they are ultra inexpensive right now routinely available to a hundred bucks for new ones not ... or anything like that\nAnd they are not prone to the same problems with viruses that can happen to a windows computer or a Mac and so using chrome book for financial only know Web surfing no email nothing no social media just\nBuilt pay banking brokerage those kinds of things creates an additional protection for you from people who would try to mess up your life\nBy creating financial chaos emptying your accounts or whatever and so from books are the safest\nWay I Know to do that stuff and having a separate one just for financial is something I very much want small businesses to do to protect themselves because where we as consumers have a lot of protections under the law if we get hit by a hacker\nBusinesses generally don't have those same legal protections which is why also in addition for businesses I recommend that you get um insurance to protect you from data breaches from hackers\nAnd having this kind of coverage is something very few small businesses have but if you got wiped out of your small business\nBecause of a hacker what would happen next that's why I have any insurance is so key\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nClark thanks for taking my call sure Chris you got to a modern puzzle for me\n[noise] oh yeah ... glad to hear that actually I uh applied for a life insurance and they set up a medical you Sam\nAnd of course ask what does all his tail of course they take your eyes white blood pressure\nAnd they say take a blood sample of them ... all I Know that that blood sap that'd be used for genetic testing and I actually called a call your team and or your team's fantastic\nBy the way Oh thank you and power and the anti Clark Howard at your team but Howard said to call the state the insurance and I said that's a great idea so I gave them a call\n... after a few departments or later I finally spoke with somebody in in the lady said that uh she got almost guaranteed that wouldn't happen\nThere's nothing in the law that prohibits said at this time so there was a law passed a decade ago fit for him it'd your DNA from being used genetic testing for being able to ... be used for health and\nThen as more and more information has become available through genetic testing and how easy it is for people to do it the law has never been updated to cover\nLife insurance long term care disability insurance and so this is an area that the feds need to be all over in the Congress and not permit genetic discrimination\nSo I don't know I don't know anybody doing it yet just like you were told by the person at the state insurance department emphasis on yet\nThat's what I was afraid of because of that and I had actually called the last ... sickly said it was a note for a ... test for an hour in saying the lab and stayed in the destruction to do that I Would say they would do if\nThey would not to that and you know there's there's a question so many of us like me I've done twenty three and me and done ancestry dot com and there's so much

yet another one for you to use when you love to travel and you just want to know what deals there are so let's talk about you ripping yourself off\nThere's a new study that's been published by the oil rig a consulting outfit and they found that people doing four O. one K. loans decimate\nYour future financial security and retirement\nIt's very common that employers will make it super easy for you to do alone from their four one K. plan\nAnd the philosophy of employers historically has been hey if we locked down our four one K. and people know they can't touch the money under basically any circumstances\nThen they're going to be afraid to contribute enough money to save for retirement\nBut the reality is a lot of people do take loans out from a four one K.\nAnd depending on whose survey data you believe it's a very very common thing for people to do four one K. loans and typically somewhere twenty twenty five percent of people will do four one K. loans\nBut the thing is when you do that\nThose loans dramatically reduce\nHow much money you have down the road when in fact you may find that\nYou will have to do away your retirement years down the road that you'll have to work any of a number of additional years to make up for the last earnings\nFrom that four one K. loan that's even when you pay the loans back and you may wonder how could that be\nWell there's a two for here when you borrow from a four O. one K. you have to pay back the plan right and so while that money is not invested\nIn most Sears Holdings in foreign one case go up so you lose the up escalator on that money that you borrowed\nThis electronic Coyne how much do you get to the commission\nIdea that ten percent\nTo ... get Fifteen dollars and then whoever is putting this together gets a hundred and thirty five\n... uh evidently\nAnd the whole product is this supposed that money that you're supposed to trust and that doesn't actually exist yet to be used to buy or sell things\nThat's that's the story\nOK I Would tell you don't even think about getting involved in that because that is there is no true product or service is being sold\nIf it's just speculation that at some point people will be able to use these electronic coins and that sounds to me like that could very dangerously end up being\nAn illegal pyramid and then what are your game of chance so\nUnless you are somebody who really love is the whole idea of gambling you love to gamble\n[laughter] [laughter] I Do a little bit\nYeah and then go to Vegas taken a show enjoy all the glitz and the lights and all that but don't get

to know that this this woman is a perfectly typical leftist\nShe has been brainwashed by the insane bigoted divisive polarizing left that divides us along the lines of race class and gender bases and gender and gender and gender and gender and on and on and on\nBut this is a classic example this is the left believes that we should be divided up by race you're black you're Hispanic your European Caucasian you're Asian Asians you don't get anywhere near the front of the line at Harvard\nA black and Hispanic people you'd do Whitey or you just come in on a legacy affect everybody's treated differently based on their race everybody's treated differently based on their gender the women must be believed unless they're accusing Keith Ellison or Bill Clinton\nBottom line is they're still defending Elizabeth Warren because they're a joke Glenn Kessler is a joke the fact checker\nOffice at the doctor evil posed as a complete joke it's a Democratic Party that might as well be funded by George Soros himself\nAnd and ah today but interestingly they give themselves they give the Washington Post three Pinocchios now they agreed on a curb that shouldn't be four\nBut he admits that the news reporting on the DNA test was a complete joke and in the end he circles back and says but it's still shows that she's part Indian and what she's always claimed as true\nSo it it again it makes no sense they he spends four pages saying everything we wrote about it was wrong everything the Boston Globe wrote about it was wrong\nEverything the RMC said about it was wrong although all they did was referring to in New York Times article and the New York times article made a point that the Washington Post now says is wrong because they'll sacrifice the New York times when they're defending Elizabeth Warren [noise]\nHe'd types on behalf of his party which is the Democratic party of the United states America it's a press release for Elizabeth Warren masquerading as a fact check at a news organization which it has in fact not\nAfter being egg done by President Trump put salt Trump's fault this is how it begins Senator Elizabeth Warren deem mass released\nThe results of a DNA test on October Fifteen that indicated she had native a Native American ancestor now and again that they they they dance and skate around all of the fun facts that don't contribute to are funny cause\nThe result which identified Native American DNA from six to ten generations ago were immediately misinterpreted\nThe result which identified Native American DNA from six to ten generations ago were immediately misinterpreted\nAnd he said and then he says that they were misinterpreted by the Boston Globe they were misinterpreted by the Washington Post their own real smart they're they're the smart next that way a way to keep our ear to the ground for what they have to say because they know\nThey're using the old noodle all the time up there\nIt started with the Boston Globe report which initially indicated the test showed she was at best one thirty second Native American and possibly just won five hundred twelve Native American\nAfter confessing twice twice to a math error they confess twice to two different math errors but but let's not get technical you're just a news reporter right the globe corrected the numbers to one sixty fourth and one\nOne thousand twenty fourth Native American that would translate to between Ninety eight point forty four percent and Ninety nine point nine percent not Native American well that's right and that's the correct interpretation of this right isn't it oh not so fast\nThey are and see now he wants to politicize it instead of making it about the truth the RMC then issued a news release directing reporters to a two thousand fourteen New York times report that said European Americans\nHad genomes that were on average Ninety eight point six percent European point one nine percent African and point one eight percent Native American\nSo it sounded like Warren had less Native American DNA than the average European American yeah that's what it sounds like 'cause if you look at the New York times piece in the Boston Globe piece that's what you might surmise if you whipped out your Bones Are calculator and did a little busy work with your digits there I'm thinking [noise]\nWe even issued meeting ... by the Washington Post we even issued a tweet along these lines\nAt a moment when the globe still indicated the range was between one thirty second and one one thousand twenty fourth now he just got ... ... is that for a brief time it's true they only corrected the second\nFigure and not the first figure because they're not very smart this is this is the conclusion that must be drawn from all of this and I I drew that conclusion the day this came up because I started questioning the figures immediately as well\nAnd as did everyone else except the geniuses at the Boston Globe the Washington Post on New York times\nSo in any case the the Washington Post he goes on and on for four pages and in the end he gets to the Pinocchio test and you'll never guess that it's mostly somebody else's fault because ... liberal you know\nHe said Pinocchio test we're not trying to defend Warren's decision to release that test\nJust to set the record straight about what the test shows the media bungled the interpretation of the results first they bungled the math and the results than they bungled the interpretation and and but all in favor of Elizabeth Warren let's not lose sight of that\nAnd then ... opponents used the uninformed reporting meaning the Washington Post the Boston Globe the New York times\nTo undermine the test results even further by introducing the New York times article from a couple of years ago we fell into this trap as well this is the Washington Post confessing to the\nFalling into the trap and we're too quick to send out a tweet not deleted say not that they don't they just to delete their mistakes that they don't correct them\nThat made an inaccurate comparison we should not have relied on media reporting before it tweeting [laughter] they Washington Post says they should not have relied on media reporting and you know what they're right there right about that they should not have allowed on a ... million\nIt shouldn't post says they should not have relied on media reporting and you know what they're right there right about that they should not have allowed on a relied on media reporting by the Boston Globe or by themselves\nAnd you know what Glenn I don't make the same mistake every day I avoid that ... that that pitfall that trap is one that I'm aware of every day when I got out of bed I'm Still rubbing the sleep out of my eyes when I say I wonder what the Washington Post is going to lie about today and then\nI pick up my paper which lands outside my door and my best girl and I laugh out loud and how it all to be asked that you're a phony baloney newspaper publishers every day\nBut keep in mind that the conclusion here is that the Washington Post said we should not have relied on media reporting [noise]\nTrue er words were never spoken I think that Glenn Kessler should there should be the Glenn Kessler award and on the loose ... block it will say we should not have relied on media reporting and and\nThat would be the Glenn Kessler word loose I blocked sharp edges horns Native American DNA as identified on the test may not be large\n[noise]\n... it may be one one thousand twenty fourth and it's not Native American because they can't compare to Native American which he admits and page four of this and say that he wrote on behalf of Elizabeth Warren\nAnd and we know what the we know what it is I got it right don't worry about me Glen\nI got it right because I didn't depend on your phone reporting\nBecause I read you every day and I know that you're not only crooked you're not very smart you get the math wrong then you interpret it wrong and then you change one statistic without changing the other statistic which means you're really incompetent when it comes to basic statistics and I knew a long time ago that I could depend on you\nWeren't there to identify the tests may not be large\nBut it's wrong to say it's as little as one one thousand twenty fourth\nNo it's not no no you're wrong again I I mean these people are just incompetence on intelligence unserious\nParty hacks that will say anything to do anything and when they're caught being wrong they come out to be wrong again he just explained\nHigher up in the piece that it is perfectly fair and square to say that on the lower end this one one thousand twenty fourth those are her numbers that she issued from her expert Carlos Bustamante who is a revered he's not really but the climate is because he did all is with Warren's a test and and uh and and so here we go\nIt's wrong to say as little as one one thousand twenty fourth or that it's less than the average European American no it's not\nIn fact reading your own piece that is in fact a perfectly reasonable conclusion encounter now it may be as high as one sixty fourth and it may be as little as one one thousand twenty fourth\nThose are the numbers Glen there in your own pace see if we can sort this out and your little brain and maybe tomorrow you can come back we're the correction of your correction of your misinterpretation of your a misunderstanding of statistics on facts\nSo they end up with this three Pinocchios all around including to our tweet\nYour tweet it's not just your tweet it's all your reporting it's your home and and now it's this idiotic pays which once again misinterpret misunderstand send misrepresenting the facts so thanks for that go on your credit guy\nThere it is and they give themselves the Washington Post give themselves three Pinocchios but they think they're sharing it with the Republicans because the Republicans pointed to a New York times article which the Washington Post says\nThey don't know what they're saying because the New York times article is fine and when you compare it to the Elizabeth Warren claim you come up\nGlenn Kessler is trying to muddy the waters on because he's a crook and he's a Democrat water boy hey water boy I let's go to the uh let's go to the telephones [laughter] hey wanna boy let's go to a let's
