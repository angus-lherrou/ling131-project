I got a picture and they're the rifle risking\nA actually I'm going to take this call to take your calls leaving us take a phone call okay I'll continue us so I think the appeal of online shopping um\nIs really it really is the price of an inconvenience I I Swear everything is cheaper on Amazon\nIs it a generational thing or are they are older folks are getting into it I\nThink there are definitely older folks get down to it when you really how you know at the older folks quote unquote can learn how to use a computer with you know just simple things on the computer yeah it's really not that bad and again you don't have to move you don't have to leave your house I swear I find things\nSo much cheaper on Amazon every I I I should say everything but almost everything if I'm In a story about to buy you know say a TV or a new speaker or whatever I lately been thinking oh\nI Know I'm here at target or whatever but I'm not going to check Amazon just to see even though I kind of want it right the second [laughter] and I go on Amazon and I look and it's usually the ... cheaper\nI have noticed a I'm a bookworm I buy a lot of ...\nAnd I've noticed on Amazon I Love the fact that you have the options are buying new or used you know you walk into a bookstore and I love Barnes and noble passionately I'd want to ever getting a new book store in a few months here really I think a a Doug might know more about [noise]\nBut uh you know when you go into a bookstore you if you want to buy a book you basically have to take what they got ... you take it usually it's new or it's a recently released on paper bag with Amazon you have all these options uh you know you can get a a a race\nThey were back for used for like pennies on the\nDollar right and it may seem pretty decent quality most of the town\nYeah that is and that's another thing you know a lot of people are moving to kind of candles or reading books on their phones I Am kind of like you I Love Barnes and noble with a passion yeah I Love holding a real tangible book in my hands when I was eating um but I don't mind if it's used of course it even maybe a little character is kinda yeah kind of a cool thing so\nYeah that's just another one of the many many amazing things about Amazon is that you you have that option save a little money get a used book and yeah you know it's if you had Amazon Prime it really doesn't take long to get well sometimes you get that old book smell though\nI I thought that I kind of like the smell I gotta look and it depends yeah of course there actually is a cute little book shop 'em down on mainstream mad and have you ever been to that one no what's it called ... Huffington\nI've heard the name it it's all you lose and they add books just absolutely stuck to the ceiling if you're ever out and about not feeling like shopping online now that I mean I say\nOh we got a place in ... and I like that I forgot the name of it but it's right there on the main dragging mandated that is what I was talking about oh maybe that's the same well I'm sure as you say mandate or man that man down [laughter]\nSorry from ... from my dad at I get it I'm old [laughter] everything [laughter] starting to be my excuse for everything but I still I still think there's a place for the brick and mortar aspect of especially with things like books I mean I I just love to go into a bookstore nice cozy bookstore\nOn a rainy day or a whole winter's day you go in there you get a cup of coffee and you're just grab a book off the shelf and you just start reading\nThat something where it's more all in the experience of working with the birth of brick and mortar and same sometimes for me I like to try on clothes before I buy them or order them so that's another thing where I think the brick and mortar is still you know there is used for it\nUm but you know if you're going to go buy a new God I don't even want to say Blu ray or DVD player anymore could really use of that\nBut you know I knew very hard to find him on the shelf anymore I mean we are it has a former ... right right but you know just the odds and ends things like that there's really no quote unquote experience of going into a store and get in that cup of coffee and kind of cozying up you know why not just on your\nCouch in order on there's a great little place in Jamestown then I don't know the name of it but uh my wife has family out in Jamestown\nAnd a couple of times a year we'd go out to visit her son who lives there mhm and we usually go downtown to this a very plush local owned and operated coffee shop or they don't have the books there but they've got all kinds of nice furniture nice old furniture you can shouldn't like a love seat or a couch\nAnd a read a magazine and drink your coffee it's really no and that's just fine yeah that's again just kind of it is not a a lot of franchise just a local place\nAnd those are special yeah I Love I Love the local thing you know if I did and I chose local as much as possible so\nDoes everybody think then that uh some of the local we've talked about the big box stores closing the smaller shops opening up are we coming backs\nWhile I was kinda thinking my next question was going to be you look at Sears and stores like shears Kmart which is under the fears of Rick uh where do they go wrong why are they failing Sears whereas there are brick and mortar stores that are\nSome are thriving summer doing okay obviously Walmart is not going anywhere anytime soon was Walmart doing right that shears isn't I think the short answer\nIs they stayed\nWe can pay for ... [laughter] that's funny you know I once in a while my dad will send me a check in the mail and that's\nI mean as much as I appreciate and love that he does that all we I mean I Will always appreciate that it's like oh no I got to go to the bank I got a job that check off you know that yeah something that I don't I Would never have to really go there for anything like that so\nIt's interesting that they asked for this really only time I\nHad thought I was younger my dad would send me like a cashier's check if I needed money ... and there are a little bit easier to cash or he would do it or back in the day there are companies like Western Union and where you could actually wire the money\nYou go to your local Western Union a outlets wherever that we'll all the supermarkets had him at the time and you could get your money there you know for your mind as one or two dollars that they ...\nI go to I mean I'm a big I really like concerts and kind of music festivals and things like that\nAnd the last I don't know five that I've gone to over the last couple of years on you just you get 'em and I I Know you can even pay with apple watches and we hold on and things like that too but you just get a wristband and you can just you know put as much money on as you wanted when you go up to buy a beer or buy a hotdog by whatever all you do it touch it to the thing and it's\nSo easy it's so easy you just touch it to the little light and it's done\nYou could give it a span which of course a lot of musicians parks parks you have to do it for years but now they actually have like a a the scan coat on there and they scan\nIt's not even a code the wristband it kind of a nice thick fabric like this man there's a tiny little chip in one part of it that you know you can activate with your debit card ... whatever hook it up\nFabric like this man there's a tiny little chip in one part of it that you know you can activate with your debit card your eye out whatever hook it up and I yeah you have to do is you know walk around for four or five days are there and that's how you pay for everything it's so easy you don't get it down because it's on your S. so you're you're set there there's\nNo need to carry cash so there's no concerned about losing the exactly\nAnd if you want to tip somebody um you can just click on the you know the little screen tip Fifteen Percent you know when you present it makes life so either you don't even have to sign anymore because yeah I mean what if people really do with those signature as you put on that I I've heard that that's kind of starting to fade out to ... people are asking for signatures anymore 'cause you\nKnow you can just push credit and go right past all of that on ... yeah with the chip though that's moving more and more towards the cash for society but you know the people that can read your chip cards and stuff like that all it when they'd be able to likewise\nWalking past you in a crowd be able to steal your data off of them are very slick too soon\nProbably I'm the I'm not I was probably way to do it I'm sure there is and I'm sure it does happen um I think people are starting to get\nYou know be unprepared for stuff like that you don't like some of the bigger festivals I went to the governor's ball and New York city this year and I also went to a lot of pollution in Chicago and both of those they had you know they pretty well

I've been out of town the longtime although I'm from the from the Philadelphia area so I wrote in the shadow of a fairly large metropolitan area [noise]\nUh as far as what's going on today are we behind the curve on a lot of the kind of thing we're talking about we are yes\nAbsolutely North Dakota I Would say five five to ten years behind and so many things that matter\nI mean a lot of people think that's a good thing I remember having the same conversation years ago when I moved to Jackson, Mississippi to work at a radio station there in those back in the eighties\nAnd they're saying is like a you know it was Nineteen eighty two and it was like Nineteen Seventy two they're culturally riots but in terms of the uh uh the way people do things with the the online and in what way are we\nBehind I think it's partly because North Dakota just more of a conservative state and that tends to yeah you know make thing progressive things not happen as fast but um I mean just like I there are tons of little dive bars dive restaurants here that are cash only you can't use their heart and not as funny to me\nUm they they usually have an ATM in there but there are a few little funding dive bars around where I live in restaurants and we know and we walk in there we I always forget to within so used to paying with my card or whatever and then as soon as that are like oh that's right this place of cash only\nKind of you know put a little bit of a damper just because you have to do that extra go to the ATM go cash out you're going to need\nBut I mean you know a fairly a bad thing\nOne of the big movie theaters in town here up until a couple of years ago with cash only and they had an ATM right there in the theater and if the GM ran all the money you were just kind of hello yeah I didn't get to see you're moving not much you can do in about a change that they did change it\nWas on their part to go back to running themselves out of business\nWe were there uh about
