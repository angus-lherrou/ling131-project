days was northwestern ritual and he was recently honored as an employee benefits advisor of the year so I'm sort of like that will come from a freedom day\nThanks any appreciate the call\nTalk to us about your timing mother army what'd you go to West Point and what'd you do when you got up\nI grew up in Sterling Heights Michigan and really nobody in my family ever bent on the military for my parents or grandparents or my parents were teachers in Detroit my grandfathers were union workers and uh the factories for Chrysler Ford and I had a chance I was in high school was pretty good athlete and ...\nAnd an uncle of mine who lived in New York was friends with a couple of West point graduate whatever shooting range I think he went to initially suggested West Point and that's how I started to learn about it applied in junior high school\nAnd then I ended up getting recruited for football to both Army Navy air force and um by the time I was a senior had a chance to go visit all three places and just sold on West Point just kind of fell in love with it and that was supposed to go\nWhat'd you do when you graduated\nSo I got out in eighty nine and I was in artillery officer I had my first assignment or post was ah Fort Campbell Kentucky so went through our children basic school charter schools and and landed at Fort Campbell and um after my first summer there said I'm a date equate we ended up getting deployed to Iraq and Saudi Arabia Nineteen Ninety\nOkay and when did you get out and what'd you do when you got out of your life\nSo I went through Desert Shield Desert Storm wasn't sure if I Want to you know do a career or not but it you know back and it was just funny because\nNine or ten months in theater wearing live rounds in grades and doing the deal and then I remember very specifically coming back to Fort Campbell\nAnd putting out of uniform again with my chance route fast and then my goats talked in our bike adapters\nOn and and I just you know the thought of the time was gonna just practice the next Twenty years and we're never going to see any action I just chose to get out and get into the business world\nLooking back I I look at you know the just challenges and the hard times and deployments all the things that have happened since then for my classmates that are still in and I I just admire everything they've they've done in their service but\nFor me I got out and I took on our our job originally through um\nA recruiting for that kind of chased people getting out of the military and ended up in Dover, Delaware for a while for about three or four years in the commercial credit business learn all about finance or that kind of thing and then had a kid moved back home to Michigan and so that began my career in HR and benefit and insurance field\nOkay we've got a lot in common I spent some time in Fort Campbell to back when it was airborne that's how long it was All right I Know the game I also deployed with a hundred and first we went to Vietnam little different trip when you came back to Michigan you settle down and you obviously a\nSound northwestern new show where they sound you and obviously you like it because you got one heck of a good award talk about what you do there\nSome northwestern new show where they sound you and obviously you like it because you got one heck of a good award talking about what you do there\nI began my career and the Employee Benefit and insurance business originally with AGP which is a large payroll company and they had a division called total source which was like an HR benefit outsourcing right now so I did that for about eight or nine years\nLeft there to run a large group sales and service for humanity in Michigan which is a large national insurance company that many in the military now because of their involvement with kind of military healthcare delivery and retiree health care\nAnd I got recruited to come in northwestern mutual and she doesn't tend to run a small kind of flailing Employee Benefit agency that was part of the northwestern mutual system and it was really a great opportunity I didn't know a lot about northwestern which I'll tell you that\nIn the insurance world growing up uh you know we were born and raised to learn the u._s._a. is wonderful and it is a tremendous company that I've always had a lot of admiration for about a client of usa since I was a kid at that point\nI still am to this day yep slide northwestern mutual I Would say parallel and rivals usa in terms of quality integrity financial strength\nAnd I didn't really know a lot about that one I got here but very quickly an ear to after us here it became that so my specialty is employee benefits and working with companies to help put together\nA group benefit plans for medical dental vision life disability all those things retirement plans love that work aton Hannah and we've had a great run for the last seven or eight years here\nGoes up it sounds like it and you were their employee benefits advisor of the year right\nYeah so Employee Benefit advisor magazine is probably the largest industry publication we have it's connected to the national association of health underwriters which is our National Association and each year they select four or five different categories of benefits specialist to recognize and then an overall advisor of the year so I was fortunate to be selected for that this year ...\nCongratulations and it was great this is going to be going from either freedom and I'm shooting the bull with West Point ... since we are west pointers and since armies about to play here for some football and then another month played navy got only prognosis on how they're going to come up\nSo that's a loaded question 'cause I uh actually played football farm is my first two years they're going to have a couple of minor surgeries and didn't play but that was back in the gym young era\nOf army football and then he was amazing and you know I think three out of the four years as their army went to ball games we beat navy at least three or four years when I was there and really had a tremendous program is we struggled for a long time but I'm so proud to see what coach Montana's doing now\nI firmly believe where you will take both games no questions asked\n'cause aren't we just got that momentum going and they've got to really solid team and programs that I had a chance to take my youngest son on a recruiting visit to army and a couple of years ago and saw their new facilities incredible I mean just everything about West Point or athletic program so our first class division one quality\nSo I think army's got a good thing going\nWell I agree with you and they certainly have been doing well so far so therefore ah looks like we're going to keep the commander in chief trophy absolutely so what do you do when you're not taking care of your kids and a and handling employee benefits ... what do you do for fun\nAnd you don't hunt and fish a lot that's kinda my therapy actually at West point I was very proud to serve the president hunting and fishing club which is one thing about the academy is there's all these obscure different things you can do in terms of sports and activities and very much enjoy getting outdoors and Michigan's a great place to do that how we got a small family farm up in the thumb area where we hunt down and\nJust trying to get out do as much as I can and a lot of my weekends are tied up chasing my kids around the country because they both are two or three play football and it's a lot of fun to watch out of the college level\nYou know watching you do well in anything is fun but you have this hunting and fishing\nIt's a lot of fun to watch out of the college level\nYou know watching your kids do well at anything is fun but you have the hunting and fishing club at West point I was captain of the west point chess club I couldn't play chess very well when I was really going to study the trips so that is happening or what's [laughter] but\nThe toll taker right I think I Belong to the drama club the Spanish club whatever club near free weekend out of there that was definitely a fun part of my time there\nIt was they were about out of time going back to your profession or any kind of advice you would like our listeners to know that some inside you might share that might benefit of\nThe Employee Benefit in human resource arena for about Twenty years\nIt's a tremendous field I I think a lot of people in the Employee Benefit arena have been kind of a lot of the people that are for a long time we've been chased away because of all the fears are on healthcare reform and you know this projection that the government's going to take over health care\nUnder any scenario and I don't think our company that our country's ever to go to like a single payer a government run system but even if we did go to something like that there's plenty of opportunity in this industry for professionals like us to get into an add value to companies because companies are always going to compete for talent in this country\nSo from a career perspective and I think everybody in the military is discipline they're smart they work harder ambitious this industry I think it's got just tremendous potential uh in the future so happy to talk to anybody about you know what that looks like for them cool how could people contacting\nThrough my a Web site will show benefits group dot com an easy way to do it or they can always email me David that so called ah that's

the show what can we do for you\nAnd my question is enough out of their call for that\nA website where you can check the articles out before you purchase the frozen car is there such a size\nWell there's actually quite a few of them are you know one of the more trusted ones over the years was Consumer Reports\nThey have got you know they they I get suspicious anymore and everything but they claim to be fairly independent ... and you always got to look to see who's funding what ... what angle they might lean but they have proven over the years to be quite independent on their tests and they've also archived a lot of their tests that they've done over the years\nThat you could go back to ah they test about everything car and driver motor trend wrote in track\nThey are they like to test for the specialty vehicles first but at some point they do get into a test of of common cars I and I said come and just a more normal stuff\nAnd those you have to be a little aware of because they might score something higher or lower based on something that they think it's important that has no interest exactly and they will do long term\nTests where they put the cars into their fleet and they drive him a Consumer Reports says a similar thing there are but as far as a Web site are you thinking where you'd look and see okay this cars at this many problems reported um that sort of a thing I guess we'll make sure what they are looking for\nYeah that is correct so it'd be kind of a forum were oh boy that that's it I got to think about that for a second I think a lot of it or you know there's Consumer Reports than they used to have a ...\nI Believe they had a Consumer Reports reported by actual drivers type thing they did that with a fuel economy sites ... go for a while it said here's what the\nGovernment sticker or you know manufacture sticker set on the window and here's what drivers actually reported and they get you know twenty people that said well I got sixteen miles per gallon average\nOr out of all of them and the manufacturers that have got an Eighteen or got fourteen so sometimes it's better sometimes is\nWhen you when you talk about the well this is always a a slippery slope because if you put in\nA guinea company any type of car anything and you say rant and rave about this or whatever might happen to be or I mean there's websites dedicated people crabbing about stuff right and guess what people do they're they come and crab about stuff that to me it's not an indication of what really happens with that\nThing or that car or that company or you got to be able to dissect that data and look for some common themes are because I'll tell you that\nPeople that have vehicles\nCan have a bad experience with any vehicle based on their used or their care right and it really can so I mean it would be hard to make the results be consistent 'cause none of the problems are happening under the same\nThe same circumstances if you know if you have a certain type of engine if they fail quicker under poor maintenance than if you did good maintenance where it would last much longer than people rarely\nGo out and how how well something works occasionally you'll see something on a on a former website but it's\nIt's rare and this kind of is very dangerous but I got to say it\nThat based on the type of car and the demographic of the consumer that it would end up in the type of comic could be different I totally agree yeah\nThe experience factor um you know certain demographics might have more experience with automobiles than others and they could give you a completely different report than a first time car buyer or depends on the you know a ... there's just there's gotta be careful absolutely\nAnswer your question re asked there are

they have to with the fourth and six\nWith five oh three remaining\nUnderstanding that that a little earlier [noise]\nObviously they have no choice but to go for at this point [noise]\n\nAs a break the whole they ... the shock and once again [noise]\nThanks to snap is\nGoing to throw has a receiver and taught us\nYard line [noise] so catch me by urban hall [noise]\nFirst time we've heard his

to read the field and didn't have someone in his face and he made a good through\nWell they have said that if they give him time he can make frozen and uh they didn't want to them to be able to throw the ball at will on them this game and he hasn't been able to because he hasn't had that\nTime I hadn't had the time and so that's why we've seen a lot of the sale\nHa ha under center this time it's

dogs like wolves well what does that even mean and why would you want to do that what would be the motivation behind it and incidentally\nLet me go back a little bit here yes dogs did evolve from wolves they evolved from a wolf species that for millions of years has been extinct\nAnd the gray wolf you know the wolf that is most common in the United states that's the wolf that everyone thinks the dog's evolved from actually that species the wolf came about\nOr the ticks if they do land on the pet therapy they're out of there they don't even get a chance in many cases if not nearly all

trainer Kelly Gorman Dunbar is right here I'll be classes are a good thing and you've been talking about that for a very long time clearly a good thing\nHas a good thing almost gone overboard so now there's these puppy parties and dog trainers are saying bring your puppies there's no structure to the class the puppies just play that's all they do that a good thing I kind of hinted as to what I think or maybe not such a good thing I\nI don't see that that's a great thing we do advocate will be called puppy parties that serious is a more of a human party where you invite lots of people over and they are you know doing what people do parties knowing about\nPetting the puppy given the puppy a chew toy letting them go sit down and will be to what the human things and acclimate ing them to you know human life\nBut I'm different type of people when you try to yeah so I imagine these events you want kids you want senior citizens with Walker who want a wide variety people would be ... maybe you want to win poor people from Chicago because I Know you're in California's ... wearing a winter coat yeah the puppy gets exposed to everything\nSo you do and you have to kind of plan for that right because you're not going to get all those people necessarily in one room at one time so you do have people to maybe a drink costumes or something funny to wear or you know whatever the kitchen bring a skateboard or you know things like that\nSo you know we can do this in your own home and you can everyone wants to come over to your house with a puppy anyway you know so you should invite them and let them\nUm and then you can do it when the puppy is very young and still very open to absorbing new things coming in Port and is that it's a very important I mean when you're a puppy everything is new and they are designed to\nDeal with and accept almost anything new novel up to a certain age to a certain point the trick is and it's you know and there's not a hard cut on that there's no it's a it's a tapering line so\nEarlier you've got a lot more value ability and that really kind of fades as they get to somewhere between twelve and twenty weeks you know it's going\nDoug sorry folks you know nobody wants to hear that\nWell [laughter] but you just want to begin puppy cross was until the puppy is foolish vaccinated or even fully vaccinated or six months to me these random Liberia what's the downside of\nThat you've missed the boat and developmental window you know completely at that point I mean animals can learn just like humans killer anything with the brainstem can learn but there's a difference between learning a new skill\nAnd just you know having um adapt to something into the fabric of your leisure became you know and so um you know they're at puppies every every mammal has\nThat window right you know of socialization may call it and whether they're open to anything and if it's a prey animal that window sometime they showed us twenty four hours because they don't have time to sit around admitting and most things as when you pray\nA like a like a hunting animal horse or against al ... you got to get up and moving those things are a
