months maybe a little bit longer up and get offers from companies that are interested in buying my house and um you know they're pretty persistent and so I just said let me\nLook them up and see what they're all about but uh I haven't really been able to find out much about them so I guess my thought is I'm\nA they number one on the sheer number two um if they all legit today you know do a\nA low ball offer on your property and what are the dangers order risk in in going forward with one of these folks yeah too and I'm I'm just doing it primarily right now for\nEducation to learn what they were about what their business model is like so that I can make an informed decision\nRight so the the people who are approaching use your house a house in good condition and and I are established

open door\nAh I've addressed open door on the air and let me explain to you what this is about there are a number of companies that are established ching in their racing to establish the city after city in the country\nWhere for um [noise]\nI guess you could for to his mid priced homes in a market there's enough inventory where they feel like they can figure out what is a fair value for your home\nAnd so what these people do is they guarantee in the case of open door and its competitors they guarantee you that they'll they'll evaluate your home they may come in and they'll do that on line they may come in and do an inspection and then they will make\nA firm offered to you\nTo buy your home and then with the idea being that you've vacate really quickly typically within a month\nCan be quicker but they just buy it and they charge you roughly the equivalent of a real estate commission to do what they charge you about six percent [noise]\nUh and so I'd say just for argument's sake they said the house was worth\nTwo hundred thousand they would pay you like one eighty eight somewhere in there and you're out and you're just going so the question with any of them oh and the reason they do that\nIs they believe that they develop systems open during his competitors leave they develop systems where they can properly price house\nGet it I'm dressed up however they need to win the landscaping or inside and get it sold\nQuicker than you can when you going to a traditional real estate agent\nAnd having them market the traditional way whether or not these things are going to stand the test of time the market will decide what you get out of it is you're just dont know if you like the price they offer you ma'am you're out\nNo questions no gifts you know you're done you don't have to worry about\nShowing the house or anything like that\nNo questions no gifts you know you're done you don't have to worry about showing the house or anything like that\nI see okay\nAnd you also have to decide the price that you were offered [noise] do you think they're low balling you or do you feel like it's really a decent offered they're making for your house\nMm okay All right does that make sense yes yes it does yes I I just um you know wanted to have an idea what they're about whether or not you know they were\nTotally totally legit\nNo doubt that this is a a a real thing and [noise] the company's doing this I think another one is offer pat I think is another one and there's another one called knock\nAnd so with these companies they're learning how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell\nAnd then they add cities around the country very heavy emphasis\nOn the south south west and west\nAnd the reason those areas because those are areas of the country that developed along the automobile have a lot of suburban housing a lot of ah subdivisions and developments\nBuilt with very similar housing plans and looks so they can more accurately price to house they're not interested\nIn really high end houses 'cause they don't know exactly how to price them and how easily they'll sell and they're not interested in the houses that tend to be in neighborhoods

confessed that well maybe not but it's still should be a level of security they should offer [noise]\nIt's as you can issue though that I Need to point out to you the reason the current issue or may not care as much with a business credit card is business credit cards don't enjoy the consumer protections sit\nA consumer car does under pre existing law and the card act that was passed after the banking scandals so the Congress carved out\nUm exception to consumer protections for business cards so as an example let's say a criminal\nI'm exception to consumer protections for business cards so as an example let's say a criminal did run up a lot of charges on your car if they were successfully able to take it over and run up charges\nThe credit card company with a business card can say oh

night on the Connors we find out that Roseanne Carter I he Roseanne Barr [noise]\nUh they decided to kill off her character [noise]\nWith an opioid overdose [noise]\nRoseanne herself for real Roseanne was not happy about that\nExpressed grievances\nApparently a lot of people were not happy about it I don't see the problem I I thought it was great I thought it was perfectly in keeping with the things this show does well I thought it was fine what about you [noise] six\nSix six three\nTwelve Seventy Jim Walsh on super talked to all the Seventy and super talked to all the Seventy dot com good to be back behind the ah the a microphone are talking about the\n... the day so last night the counters the new rows and free version of the Roseanne show\nRoseanne to point do whatever they had the premier of the first of the post Roseanne era\nAnd there was a lot of speculation of course as to how they were going to deal with the actions of the character of Roseanne counter and a lot of people had a pretty good idea what was going to happen and we all heard through the grapevine social media\nThat they were going to kill her off with a drug overdose and it turns out that is exactly what they did the show opted to write off her character with an opioid overdose or here's a clip from the show\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office ah autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery then it was just I'd be pro [noise] it's got to be wrong\nWell I Wish it was that they think that that she must have taken the pills right before that and with their health issues [noise] it was enough to stop for breathing\nAnd I was Jackie Laurie Metcalf the actress talking to Dan John Goodman about the coroner's report and they took off from there with it\n[noise] Roseanne Barr real Roseanne said she would not watch the premier but shortly after the show premiered last night she did have some things to say\nUh the the whole thing of the opioid overdose did not go over well with Roseanne or her close friend and sometimes spokesperson rabbi ... ... that's ... I'm not a joke\nI'm not making a joke they're rabbi ... what they call him he's a talk show host to eight talks about the cultural issues in whatever\nAnyway the two of them issued a joint statement saying quote\nWe regret that ABC you chose to cancel Roseanne by killing off the roads and counter\nCharacter that it was done through an opioid overdose\nLend an unnecessary grim and morbid dimension to an otherwise\nAnd then on Thursday night clear skies are lows near forty one degrees from the weather all the weather center I'm ... and the Carlyle on super talk twelve Seventy right now it's forty\nDave Ramsey is heard here\nSuper talked wells Saturday\nI last night the ... the new post Roseanne version of Rosanne is basically ... [noise]\nThey killed her off [noise]\nWith an opioid overdose now I for one like the way they handled the Rosanne thanks very gutsy very uncompromising [noise]\nIt's what you come to expect in a show and this is one of the things this show has done well so I don't know why some people have a problem with it [noise]\nRoseanne as a problem with it but who cares [laughter] a move odd rosy [noise] because\nYou like it or not you're going to move on it you moved on anyway six six three twelve Seventy Jim Walsh here on super talked to all Seventy a couple of comments about this over Facebook [noise] um [noise] ... writing I did to\nThe show has been known for realistically dealing with these tough issues now with that said do I plan to watch every week I don't know by the way next week they're bringing back a David who is I think the boyfriend or the husband whatever of a share a Gilbert character\nPlayed by the guy from a big bang theory maybe if they keep the ... thing or they're probably going to keep that going for a while to to the kind of get people into the habit [noise]\nBut ... they did okay last night they had like ten people tend to be a ten ten million people tuning in which is okay for a show like that it's okay it's not going away anytime soon\nOr another comment here from bill writing didn't watch the first time around them in the original incarnation and I have no plans to do so now\nWe're not for the fact that the network used Carly Simon's anticipation for the commercials leading up to the re boot of the re boat I wouldn't have registered at all thank you bill although I notice so you seem to have made a really big deal\nOut of the fact that is not a big deal to me things the gentleman protest is a bit too much\nShe must have taken the pills right before van and with their health issues [noise] it was enough to stop her breathing\nThere you go to Laurie Metcalf and John Goodman John Goodman to me it's just a force of nature he's one of my all time favorite actors or just to everything he's done like with the Coen brothers all those movies uh oh brother where art thou and he was great in that as the the Cyclops guy\nGot to go rent that movie if you've never seen to Clooney is and it with them is fantastic [noise]\n... ah yeah [laughter] somebody mentioned the blues brothers two thousand okay not so much but hell I even liked ah I like John Goodman and the Flintstones and that was a horrible movie\nAnd people that are dirty beat walking around that the whole movie is kind of off putting but again John Goodman one of my favorites and I thought he was fantastic last that he he doesn't look that great though yeah it looks like a guy who lost a lot of weight in a hurry which I understand is pretty much what happened because you know at one point he was\nAh getting pretty big there are words like morbidly obese were attached to his name so he lost all this weight but he looks like a guy a classic case of a guy who lost a lot of weight weight too fast you know what I mean\nBut his personality came through beautifully as it always does on the I thought he handled it very very well last\nNight some people were not happy with it I was so the within six six three nine eight nine ... the other thing I wanted to say I mean let's face it here's the dirty little secret of Roseanne\nThe dirty little secret is that John Goodman has always been the main reason to watch that program let's face it grows and as interesting as a person but she's never been very\nLikeable or related to ... to most people\nUnless they're relating to a certain political views but really the heart and soul of that show has always been Dan counter\nJohn Goodman it wasn't the beginning is now in every shall be world without end or at least until the show ends finally whenever it ends John Goodman is the reason he is the reason to watch that show always has been in my not so humble opinion\nYou may think I'm full of beans find six six three twelve Seventy\nYou're just tuning ever talking about the ... last night a cultural ... if you will\nUh they decided to kill off the road and the typically I say it typically non compromising way because this show has always been about these hard non compromising issues\nWith the possible one exception there was the one thing about the daughter who is played by two different cared what was that all about remember the original series they had the one daughter the blonde and they had a different actress played play her and then the first one came back for the last couple of seasons\nHotel is that all about I'm surprised and then tried to play into that are saying that that was Rosie illusion dating as you as a directed the bills and so you to listen to anything that her daughter was different\nWell they could have done today they're probably going to get away with it as if they had\nSo last night it premiered in\nUh Roseanne ms bar herself the real person and she was not happy with it she issued a statement with her friend a rabbi ... that's his real name I'm not no I I'm not making a joke here it's not one of my little cartoon characters from the FM show\nNo there's a real guy damn rabbi ...\nBrandon sometimes spokesperson than they issued a joint statement saying that they didn't like the way it was handled well mood Boo Boo [laughter]\nAnd then later she tweeted eyeing gig beats you know just your career alright six six three twelve Seventy I got to be sure I get the phone numbers right because you know I Do the morning show down the hall here\nOn cool money eight point seven with a with a classic hits thing in the morning and I I tend to if you if you're in radio and you work at more with one radio station at a time it is one of the occupational hazards of the gig\nYou probably have similar issues if you've ever moonlight and ... you're on one job and\nYou know the old muscle memory kicks in and you're doing things a certain way and then you suddenly realize you're doing them the way you're supposed to do with them on the other jobs hard for me to come up with a specific example outside of my own personal experience which is I'm On this radio station\nAnd part of me wants to say cool bloody eight point seven when in fact I'm On super talked about Seventy is just one of those issues that you have to deal with especially when you get older you know the memories of second thing to go nonetheless uh some things I Want to talk about in the remaining half hour\nA thing that they used to be very popular in middle America\nAlong the white middle class or the mom community\nAh remember they used to have chickenpox parties remember that the deal is back\nWhen chicken pox was pretty much a an unavoidable way of life for families kids would get it I had it when I was five years old and got over pretty quickly but I did have it and of course once you have at your supposedly a immune to it although you can have complications later in life like shingles or whatever\n[noise] but they're used to be a thing or in some communities where the moms were all get together if one of the kids called chicken pox than all the moms would get together\nAnd they have a chicken pox party where they all bring their kids to play with the kid with the chicken pox to be exposed to the chicken pox say they all get the chicken pox and get it over with while they were young enough that it wouldn't be such a big issue\nBecause the better if you're going to have it\nAnd it kind of makes sense if you're going to have a better to have it when you're really young moms same kind of deal uh you don't want to have moms but if you're going to have bombs so it's better to have it when you're a child then when you're an adult when all kinds of really awful complications can happen\nBut now now we find out that a chicken pox parties are making a comeback in some communities\nWhether it's a religious thing or whether it's the uh the anti ... crap and it would Jenny McCarthy and those idiots there are a there are families communities in this country in the twenty first century [noise]\nIn a society where a chicken pox vaccine is a thing it exists it is available but for some reason people have chosen not to trust that and they're actually going back to having chickenpox parties\nTotally unnecessary totally ridiculous and uh yeah we're gonna talk about it in a just a few minutes here [noise] man\nHe will leave [laughter] leave so I couldn't agree more talking about and just a few minutes here six six three nine eight nine eight seven\nBut you know the issue here again just remember we're talking about people here who place more Korean boost in Jenny McCarthy and doctor who's on television then he'd do from an actual doctor's somehow somehow these clowns are credible\nWell the actual doctor is old who's in the pocket of\nBig for both who who's part of the big medical conspiracy shut up get your kid vaccinated don't be an idiot and alright\n[noise]\nI mean we can make jokes about calling the herd people doing stupid things and getting themselves off but when you're talking about people's children it's just not it's just not funny\nSo\nI I like to know if you've heard about this and oh by the way the absolute ... reason in the world to do this or the religious reasons will\nGo the moon and ... ... you know shut\nUp God\nChicken pox vaccine came out about Twenty years ago a little more than Twenty years ago and back before that\nIt was not that unusual for parents to expose their kids to the virus to build an early immunity\n\nThen you could argue the or you can argue the merits of that\nAll the the philosophy was well this is a part of life\nAnd we don't have a way of preventing it so if they're going to get it at least they should get it now and build up their immunity so they'll be good to go for the rest of their life rather than get it later when you're older and things are potentially you know like months\nYou know are we mentioned moms or if an adult gets a case of the mumps it can be very serious you can have some very serious long term side effects which I won't go into here\nBut anyway back in the day the parents used to have pox parties well now they're doing it again social media pox parties are they're getting on Facebook and they're saying it might get his chicken pox\nEvery I write bringing all their kids over and they're exposing them and the parents in these group that willing to put their kids or the drive them a hundred miles even to a different state you know like I Am in Bismarck I drive out of the\nIdol of billings Montana somewhere a Salt Lake city even why to put their kids in the same room as an infected kid\n\nWhich is fine except for the fact that uh it'd be so much easier just to go get the damn shot right here have already a day I get the show loses ...\nLook let me tell you there is absolutely no credible connection between these vaccines and autism are or anything else you know we talked about this before\nThere was one guy who came up with this theory he was vastly discredited\nThey studied his uh they study this paper they looked at it uh they read it they analyzed it and they found that it was a bunch of who we\nLet people still talk about this guy like he made some great discovery like he was Louis pastor or something and they'd rather believe this guy than somebody with an actual medical degree who's actually done the actual research\nFor\nBecause of whatever psychological need they would they would rather choose to believe some idiot on television who's talking out of there as as opposed to somebody who was actually done the scientific double blind research\n[noise]\nBoulder, Colorado is apparently a hotbed for this parents in Boulder organizing these parties to expose or ... chicken pox [noise]\nUh let's see some comments here I'm a they actually I'm the Colorado Department of public health and environment um passes along to one of the big news operations in Colorado\nAnd they actually made an effort to uh they're apparently they're actually Facebook pages on Facebook where you can go if you want to do this and they'll tell you where to go you\nKnow those are those are cat and not as a kid and Bob Bowman Colorado and South Park Colorado has got chicken pox I'll go here and you can get you get exposed hey here's a better idea get your kid the shot you'll be half hour you'll be done you can get on with your life and not have to worry about it\nAs a um high everyone here here's a here's an entry from one of those pages high every one I had been swamped with request to have my daughter shared chicken pox and I can accommodate as many requests as possible [noise]\nSeventeen year old son just broke down and blisters yes okay gets a little graphic here but uh oh and by the way there's a bonus for sharing snacks out of the same bowl so apparently some people are trying to make money off this deal yeah a great get you get exposed to chicken pox get him sick\nParents to bring the airport it defenseless kids into your house to get exposed unnecessarily so you can make a little money off the deal you know I'm not a religious person but if I were were I'd have to think there's a special place in hell for people like that [noise]\nThe
