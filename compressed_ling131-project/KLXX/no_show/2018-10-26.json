Howard show hello Dale Clarke I then I'm doing great\nYes I Am thank you\nSo you got a question for me that how you doing makes a huge difference potentially to how I answer that question\nCould they may help in the long run I was just curious about the\nQuestion concerned about taking Social Security at a sixty two [noise] and possibly investing that whole mail as opposed to waiting for the higher amount at a later age I feel like with the right of investment you probably wouldn't be\nDoing better off than waiting till a sixty six and four months\nSo it seems like a whole chunk of change\nAnd the government and all and you could probably be doing something with it yourself\nWho's done or is it what investments earn today what savings earn today it is nearly impossible for someone to take early Social Security invest that money and out or in\nWhat the and Putin advantages to you waiting those extra for years to take your Social Security the reason is is it every year you wait\nYou get a Social Security check roughly eight percent larger and then as the cost of living adjustments occur\nYour cost of living adjustment as a space for the rest of your life on a higher initial amount\nSo and also there's no tax you are going to go\nFor waiting to take Social Security versus taking it early investing the money and then if you do well investing you then have to pay tax on the money you earned investing ... so there are a lot of inherent advantages to wait\nAnd the most common age people take Social Security is what you're new to laying right now at age sixty to write my advice is when you've got to have the money\nIs when you take it and in my case you know what age I'm going to take it\nWhere you know eight eight Seventy that's the last time you can take it and get all that build up of the eight percent price me extra each year\nRight and so I'm going to ah hold out till the last minute so that I can end up with a much larger Social Security check at the time I take it so you gave the ah you gave the analogy\nOf sixty two and your retirement age which you say sixty six years four months is that what she said\nYes so if you were still doing okay financially and you didn't even need it then I Would like you to keep kicking the can forward\nA plan on it I'm pretty healthy I'm not going anywhere I still feel like I'm Eighteen so I don't think anything's gonna stop me soon so\nProbably a good advice it just seemed like a lot of money left on the table my calculations kept telling me take to eleven years to regain the money that I let go at sixty two\nThat's completely true but the big problem with um retirement years is later and retirement\nWhen we may not be physically able if we needed more money to go back to work we may have more medical bills I mean the fatter check becomes more benefits now let me tell you the risk I'm taking my brother\nIn January my oldest brother it will have live longer than any mail\nIn my entire family tree and as far back as any of us now ever and he will be at that time Seventy two so you know\nGenetically disposed to live as long as guys in my family so can you imagine I'm going to wait until late Seventy [laughter] I may have no benefit I ever get out of the system\nFor a mother that it's over Ninety and she's still chicken so I\nWill say in your case there is a direct advantage to waiting because what you're really concerned about his way down the road\nSo I Hope that my brother ah who also\nWaited until late Seventy that he ends up living a really really really long time for many reasons not having anything to do with money no but was with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how you doing\nFiber talk to you I'm a big fan\nWell thank you so much Yes sir\nSo you have had a nasty gram from a credit card company what did they do to you\nSo I opened up a credit card or a store card I Know you're not a I Know you're not saying I'm a several years ago and I haven't used it in years and it's only got a limit of about a thousand dollars ... or anything like that on it but I got an email saying that\nUh if I didn't use the card by December wells that they were going to close the cards and I wanted to see if it would be\nIn my best interests I guess in my credits best interest if I close the cart before then or if I just let them closer or or or what we'll do that\nThat makes no difference either way but I wanted to ask you a question this store card does it have a visa and MasterCard logo on it or is it just for purchases and that store\nIt looks like it's just for purchases in the store\nThere's no real advantage to you having that if you have you ever sufficient credit elsewhere abuses MasterCard as American Express discover\nOut oh yeah it's it's less than two percent of my overall credit\nBecause I ... I Would dump it just let them just like them kick you the curb\nIn December and be done with them because there's no real advantage to having store credit is looked at in the industry is junk credit right and you're not intending to use it again so it just walk away\nOkay is it did have the fees or MasterCard logo or because\nYou're not going to then I'd want you to keep it should go keep it\nLeaves some purchase somewhere or whatever you know five dollar purchase somewhere just something that takes it from being an active to an active card\nOkay ten minutes stays as active in part of your overall credit mix but when it was just a way that I think is referred to as a minor wind where it's just for that particular store right those you don't want to have\nAll right well that sounds great I sure do appreciate you taking me on the goal and I've been a big fan for years thanks very much\nFor your kind to say that thank you so much you're listening to the Clark Howard show

to save for retirement\nBut the reality is a lot of people do take loans out from a four one K. and depending on\nWho survey data you believe it's a very very common thing for people to do four one K.

zero along eight hundred ... you're not going to get it\nThis is a double standard in the media you get conservatives who say you can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible because one of his ... supporters went up there and shot somebody but it's there there is an obsession to always blame conservatives\nAnd went to narrow was saying about the president our president De Niro saying that he wants to punch the president in the face that they do any research over there you know over and fake news CNN any at all\nYou see a pattern between the president's attacks on Twitter in and stage being echoed an amplified by Fox News why Robert Deniro Sean Hannity October fifteenth that old segment blasting deniro\nOh so that's why he got a package from this lunatic polymer because he must have heard Sean Hannity playing didn't arrows own words calling the president of punk a dog a pig a con a BS artist a mutt and saying that he wants to punch him out\nI Want to punch them in the face I'm not going to stop calling pointing out the calls for\nViolence against the president that frankly is the right thing to do why didn't he joined me as a question he needs to answer\nAs the red light just like CNN with the mobs we've been witnessing you can't even say the word mob when you watch women and children being run at a restaurant it's been conservatives that have been saying this got this has got to stop\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out of restaurants by a mob how you're not going to use the word totally on my head is without a doubt that we're now it's up to put up a lot of hip hop stop that his mom but they have\n... we already did that\nWere already said they weren't mobs no or something about running for people who are not the way the ... the way the country's going and a policy that they were not for those who is before you jump in\n[noise]\nThe same deniro who's screaming F Trump at the Tony Award sea so blatantly stupid up punk good dog the pig a con artist to be I saw it as a mutt\nDestroyed Trump media completely ignoring what is the lesson file calls for violence on numerous occasions now going on for two years like you know fantasizing about blowing up the White House I Dream an awful lot about blowing it up\nI'm not going to stop calling pointing out calls for violence against the president imagine these words used by any conservative\nDuring the Obama years or the Clinton years if you're a person of good will like I Am you deplore violence of any kind we can settle our political differences at the ballot box eleven days\nI Am you deplore violence of any kind we can settle our political differences at the ballot box eleven days\nAnd when you call out fake news for what it is that is not in any way so I Need to be clear for stupid people that want to purposely misinterpret words of people\nWhen you call them out having an agenda for being fake and phony and fraudulent that is just telling the truth that they don't wanna hear or when you point out that they spent basically every second of every minute of every hour of every day demonizing\nA president trying to de legitimize a duly elected president\nWhen people say that they care about the truth first and they say they really want to get to the bottom of Trump Russia collusion\nAnd Russia collusion at all or Russian influence at all and totally and completely and utterly ignore\nThe candidate of their choice obvious choice buying Russian lives disseminating those lies to the American people in the lead up to an election that that's that's not news that is strong opinion and that is it's not even opinion all it is a propaganda\nAnd misinformation you know I don't but with that said\nI'm the one that was saying and the Obama years protect the Obamas protect the president protect the first family protect all politicians we saw what happened in the Kavanaugh hearings I didn't see many Democrats on any of these fake news network saying that\nUh we need to stop spending it senators we need to allow senators to walk the halls freely without being accosted I even said that it might be a good idea that we would clear the halls of the house and Senate because things are too hot and I don't want to see anybody hurt or worse\nYou know but when you have fake news people desperate to get any attention any ratings they politicize only those things that they think ... benefits their political side\nI guess it would have been easy after Steve ... shot and the shooting took place in the softball field for me to say well that guy is a burning supporter Bernie Sanders encourage this he's the one responsible\nBut if I did that it would be dishonest as they are\nYou blame the people themselves they're responsible for their own behavior and actions now with that said I'm not telling anybody ever to get in anybody's face\nAnd create a crowd and to\nYou know go after people and get them tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore with the crowd\nAnd I've been the ones saying that what's happening with secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz a Henry Kissinger Mitch McConnell and now Kevin McCarthy has got to end because it's not going to end well if we don't stop this liberal confrontation\nAnd based on the orders of people like Maxine Waters Cory Booker and over the years years gone by even Obama himself\nYou know we've watched all of this happened we've observed it\nAnd I've been saying time everybody to come down Hillary's calls for civility oh now she's now she's calling for civility after the shooting after the pipe bombs have been delivered Eric Holder a week ago saying a kick up\nYou know but we're sending to\nAndrew Cuomo yesterday you would think you know he joins became the pope calling for peace and stability and eat pluribus own them and the same guy that said if if you're pro life than you believe an assault weapons\nFor say there's not enough to have you on\nA wanted in New York because you're not a real New Yorker now he's talking about\nAnd togetherness want to tell you something because this this it doesn't ... you can aches\nHer now he's talking about peace and togetherness on and tell you something because this this it doesn't you can explain crazy like the burning guy was crazy you can explain whoever this guy is and apparently is the Yahoo News reports saying that he was not\nOn the one hand loving and hating Trump at the same time lunatics have no political boundaries you know the guy don't hold Al Gore responsible for the Unabomber because he had to earth and the balance and has that little hut that he'd build out in the wilderness\nOr the shooter as Steve squeezed blaming Bernie Sanders to suggest any way that honest a vigorous debate and criticism\nIs the motivating force behind one fringe violent individual let me tell you what that is that is intellectual laziness and a cheap attempt frankly to capitalize\nOff a dangerous and serious incident especially in light of the fact while others on TV have been utterly silent their silence is deafening I haven't been the one saying something horrible is going to happen it needs to stop\nYou know do you say CNN sucks or CNN is fake news that is not a cry or an advocate of violence in any way shape or form it's a feeling people have when they see a few abusive lean biased news coverage\nIf you're American whether sold a shit transcend politics I deplore all violence of any kind but legitimate fair criticism of me that's fair game media criticism is fair game calling out networks that have political agendas that's fair game\nWhen networks spend every second ... an hour of the day Haiti on Donald Trump Donald Trump cured cancer they still hate him\nWell I'm allowed to call that out that's not hate if there's any hate their it's their hatred of the president that they can't seem to get over\nYou know the bottom line is you're watching people trying to make an attempt to exploit\nAnd politicize the actions of one unhinged lunatic and conflated with fair and wanted criticism and that for them as they're putting politics above all else and that's wrong for the country and anybody that has intimidated into stopping what they do because of\nThis predictable attack I put it all up on Hannity dot com\nAnd it's called the less new low Hannity's slams the media is total failure to report liberal calls for violence\nYeah we've got it all chronicled with all we we put the tape and everything you need to one place\nAnd we're going to tweet that or we're going to send that out to everybody where Lebanon days away from election day and there's a lot at stake right now Republicans you know what they're behind I think in Florida that means Rick Scott's behind that means the Santa is behind there's a lot at stake\nFlorida goes to Gillum in terms of governing the state of Florida it will be a disaster that's my prediction it doesn't help that many have been displaced in the panhandle a very conservative part of Florida and I hope those people are able to get back and unable to vote before the election\nBut I can tell you Marsha Blackburn can and should win in Tennessee if everybody goes out and vote and I think the Missouri can be flipped easily now that we know that Claire McCaskill just like the British sent in Tennessee has been lying
