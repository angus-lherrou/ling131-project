[laughter] that's a good idea to believe what Ninety two billion when we're running take half your money anyway a credible Henie landed on\nOne issue this is a solution not voted four times for late term abortion this isn't a moderate you this is a radical you this is a guy who is trying to pretend he is that I support the president he's not going to support the president\nHe's going to support Nancy Pelosi is going to support the impeachment caucus he's going to try and write and with all these Democrats you never shown that in fact on\nHe's never stood up to Sheldon Silver in fact he was picked by Sheldon Silver for the job you get to the assembly now we can't take by Chuck Schumer\nWho brags about it and Andrew Cuomo funny none of them have come to the district to help him get elected but you know who came to our district President Trump the first time in my home city of Utica New York in ... years we had a sitting president ...\nWell you also head of the sudden everybody there and his daughter a bunk up there they recognize the importance of your race and that's why a mum having your own lives and the only thing I can say is to the the people up in the ... area in northern New York in that area you this was a district that you can win it's plus a Republican\nAnd you have about thirty thousand more Republicans and Democrats in the district so you have a political edge there the key is to get the vote out because otherwise you're going to end up with a Nancy Pelosi Democrat Nancy Pelosi as speaker and that's going to be a disaster for New York I can promise you\nThat absolutely and by the way they are raising incredible amounts of money I've been talking to my colleagues all across the country the amount of money they're dumping introduced racist to try to deceive voters Israeli it's outrageous to me and my opponent is star outspending may I've always been a very independent Republican I'm One of the top conservatives in New York\nUh when I served in the assembly and still you know one of the top conservatives but we have got to continue to stand up for our values and be able to witness elections to fight the fight because we've got a ticket to Washington we gotta support the president's policies which are creating unprecedented gains\nEven an upstate New York where we have a really tough economy I mean we are actually helping her small business community are small business humidity is about Ninety eight percent of my life to visit says in my region and they create most of the jobs\nThat just being health is alive by Nancy Pelosi that somehow the wealthiest are the only one benefiting it's absolutely false we voted to make the tax cuts permanent and the reason Governor Cuomo is suing the federal government over the tax cuts\nIs because his wealthy donors wanna leave New York because they're not getting the lifeline that they used to get there actually paying more it's all a lie coming from that side and we've got to fight this is this is a tough battle because the Democrats have the money to deceive voters and fool them into thinking that this guy is somehow a moderate he's not and I encourage everyone\nTo support us get to vote out its most important as we can beat the wall money but we need a Republican voters to understanding each ticket out oh it's really really important\nI write a quality attorney or running in New York in unimportant seat this will tip the balance of power one of our thirty seats we've identified on Hannity dot com ... the main\nYou know ground zero seeds that will do that will literally tip the balance of power so Claudia we wish you the best things for being with us and hopefully we'll send in your back to Congress in ...\nMark deserves it we don't have many good New York politicians at all\nUm by the way just going back to direct or re what he said earlier today a they have confirmed that these Thirteen bombs were in fact real\nAnd that in fact they've been able to identify at least some forensic evidence including fingerprints\nWhich which to directly connected to the person that was arrested earlier today or more about that as the day unfolds here or let's get to our phones as we say Hi to Danny is in Austin, Texas Danny Hi how are you glad you called sir\nYes listening to you a lot and I have not been any clinical sense whatsoever at the summit terms are on your way in court\nTo get out and vote [noise] uh the end you hit on it every day I listen to it and not watch it or not [noise] I I'm\nListening I Hope everyone feels the same way you do this for a hundred and thirty five members of Congress every seat is important ... vote for a Democrat you're voting for policy you stay home it's a half a vote for ... in the Senate if you stay home a half a vote for sure if you don't vote for the Republican\nThen you're basically voting for sure I mean it's really not that simple and we'll get the government we deserve\nI've been at this game a long time I've had a lot of victories I kind of loved when we shot the world in the media you know I see three scenarios that could unfold so I had to say the more likely scenario based on my full\nObjective analysis it would be a split decision whether Republicans pick up houses or pick up seats in the Senate and maybe lose the house of representatives but the house of representatives is well within our power to win if people identified the thirty districts we've identified on Hannity dot com and people take it seriously and get out and vote\nI mean if every Trump voter wants the successor in the last two years to continue and goes to vote Republican in eleven days then that means we'll keep the house will pick up seats in the Senate and things will be a lot easier in the work will be getting done faster\nIf we don't do that then you know we get the government we deserve and I've had many ups and downs following political races in the course of my career I wasn't exactly happy the two nights that Obama won\nEspecially thought he could have been defeated in twenty twelve alright it didn't happen and you do everything it can to stop the agenda on their side I'm prepared for whatever Nancy Pelosi an Adam Schiff of Gerald Nadler and Maxine Waters want to do to the country\nAnd we're not going to go away we're not going to cry we're not going to be the cry babies like they've been for the last two years\nAnd when they try to do things that are detrimental to the country and the president and they want to enlist investigations were going to be there as a backstop to tell the American people the truth and then some of you will probably regret that you didn't get out and vote this election season so don't wait until I'm telling you what's gonna happen\nWe know they only want Obama Care we do they want to open borders they don't want to fund the wall they believe in open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nWe know they want their crumbs back we know they want higher taxes we know they you know they don't they don't really care they are all things hating Trump all the time not exactly in the best interest of the country to keep\nFocused on that for two years but we'll do our best you know or we can win at all or we could lose at all plus an all of us\nSean Hannity show we love the dollar shave club dot com slash Hannity or you don't pay to be a

doesn't hear about it and I know that we've highlighted your case I think he once told me that very few in the media ever came to talk to you about the death the shooting death and the tragedy and the murder of your son\nYeah that's correct I mean you know it's one of those things that that the liberal media they don't want to put it out there you see an end and cover it um you know they don't want to talk about it it affects people like you Fox\nThey don't want to put it out there feared CNN didn't cover it um you know they don't want to talk about it thanks to people like you Fox News um some of the the local affiliates for ABC and CBS they covered it but\nThe liberal media in the some of the mainstream media so afraid of this subject and there are so afraid to you know\nGo against the narrative and and that's the big thing that that we want to change we want to change the narrative\nYou know a lot of people don't understand that a lot of the crime it's spilling over into our country\nComes from the literal war between the cartels or the other side of the border last year alone thirty two thousand Mexicans died at the hands of cartel violence ... there was only ten thousand citizens of Iraq that died\nBecause of the violence in Iraq so think about that we'd be said for having Iraq is a border state federally wouldn't Mexico\nYou know it just it it ... it just seems to me you know if this caravan and we'll see what Mexico ends up doing we'll see if this caravan comes apparently there's another one building behind it know Salvador\nBut the reality is the president has been from and couldn't be more clear the same with the vice president they're not getting in we already have deployed and began the deployment of troops to the border\nIf there's any confrontation down there will not be caused by American troops will be caused by people that are not respecting our law our sovereignty and our borders um I Believe probably they will be some types of barriers put up in the meantime temporary albeit a because we had a wall it wouldn't be an issue at any point wouldn't\nKnow and and that's the big thing we're we're gonna go on a tomorrow morning\nOr we're going to go to a section of the border where there's maybe one or two strands of barbed wire scale this caravan yeah you're going to see them trying to overwhelm the ports of entry but what about in the middle of the night what happens when things die down through the day for when people are busy with watching this\nSituation it smoke and mirrors shot they're going to go to these parts of the border that don't have any protection they don't have a wall they don't have a ... a fence to speak of and and they're going to flood into the country\nSo we saw the fence didn't menacing at the southern border of Mexico where they just knock that down in in charge through\nI don't think that's going to be allowed to happen here I'm sure there are contingency plans being made right now and I would imagine the barriers are part of that plan and I would imagine as many troops unnecessary to stop the invasion of the United states by people that are not willing to follow the laws that we have set out on immigration\nThe really sad thing is that we have on her silence on the left\nAnd and even they almost outward support for people that want to violate our laws I guess that's what we've been watching unfolding with sanctuary cities and states and\nYou know the here we have even criminal aliens I mean in the case some of your son ran a how long was the murder of your son in jail before he was let out and not handed over to ice\nWas shot it actually the the Vatican better grant never served at day in jail or prison for his his prior conviction\n... but never served a day and and you see this all the time with a lot of these illegal immigrants they played it down or they use their ... status or you know their children they use their children I mean I've got an anchor babies I don't have anybody to take care of you know they use this all the time and\nIf you really want to talk about child separation edits and its finality um and the president was the one that fixed it even though it existed in the Obama and Bush years you're experiencing child separation\nSon was murdered ... we we can't bring him back from the dead\nShot him and it it's like people I spend Christmas we put up a Christmas tree out grants grave I spend just birthdays and most of the other holidays we spend with him at his great I mean we we don't\nThat's the only way we have to be with him obviously you know anybody who believes in God and believes in the habit that he is with us all the ... ... you need a place to go visit him in and that's why we place\nAnd share your have all these angel families that that is what they do this is what they have we're never going to say that they get\nThese illegals that are bringing their shoulder to or using other children and screaming about separation they're going to get to see their children to get there going to be reunited by law within seven to twelve day touched by law\nI don't I I I I just want to thank you for what you're doing your you know I listened to your when your strength and\nAnd obviously you're trying to prevent this from happening for we're really asking for nobody is against immigration we just wanted to be legal we want to be able to vet the people that come into this country they've got to be able to take care of themselves and we want to know that they have the best interests of this
