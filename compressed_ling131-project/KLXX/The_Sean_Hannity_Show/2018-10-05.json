I'm just saying it again I just\nI bet there's never knew Susan Collins look one thing that the Republican Party has the the Democratic Party does not have\nThere\nIs not this monolithic one voice radicalism that has taken over the Democratic party and the ... and the Republican\nParty I mean it was what's been fascinating to watch with all\nOf the madness the blood joining the character assassination the smearing lying the intensity the protests and it's not\nGoing to stop this is going to go forward\nIt's gotta stop if wherever we want to be the United states of America\nI mean how is it the Republicans always support Ruth Bader Ginsburg and and Justice Sotomayor and Elena Kagan\nThen Republican nominees get just get bull legit but does it matter if there's any corroborating evidence in a one\nThing is I'm watching Susan Collins a speech was so well thought out\nBased on facts\nAnd the standards that she uses to evaluate important issues maybe that's why she kept a tour so pretty much the whole time nobody know knew what she was going to do\nBecause she clearly followed her conscience on this issue and\nShe had it ... it was obvious she missed nothing she had followed every single solitary detail of this process did all the work you would ever want or expect from a representative\nAnd and now I guess the left is about as unhinged they'd been I don't even think it's safe to walk the Senate halls at this point\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina I Would argue it would not have happened but for him\nAnd he joins us on our news maker line um you know you told me something when I was in Washington earlier this week\nAnd I asked you I said well what are you know about Susan Collins and\nYou'd you basically describe what I learned about her today I was blown away and I don't get blown away very often I really I'm too cynical I'm from New York I've been in radio Thirty years I'm a tomorrow I start my twenty third year in the Fox news channel\n[noise] well uh you know I'm I'm In a\nPolitical system this deteriorating I think what you saw today somebody step forward to maybe say that\nThe biggest winner of the speeches the judiciary because her as a wholesale attack on the independence of the judiciary one at all costs what you saw that day was a person embracing the rule of law not the rule of the mob what you saw today was a woman\nNot being intimidated what you saw today was a good man Brett Kavanaugh being said the strong woman\nWhich you saw today was everything good about the Senate good about the country and I'll have my differences with Susan Collins Collins going forward but this is as close to McCarthyism as our hope for witness in my life\nAnd if anybody turned it around and it was senator Collins\nAh you know senator you had a moment in this process to and and that moment came when they were going the hardest after judge Kavanaugh ... ...\nSoon the things that this man was accused of and and and I saw the outrage even with Susan Collins that remember the accusation by Julie sweat neck was that well it's almost on a weekend basis that that judge Kavanaugh and others\nWere routinely drug in girls lining up in halls gang raping\nThem and it happened frequently and I I Know that some people brought\nUp the issue of the judges temperament he addressed it in his Wall Street journal article that came out last night\nHow was one supposed to act\nIf you're innocent so the charge of drugging teenage girls and participating in gang rapes of teenage girls I don't know what the appropriate reaction is but I Would think if you're innocent it is one of deep anger\nAnd and the frustration Eighteen days ago\nNobody thought any of those the judge Kavanaugh\n[noise] well yeah I think I think most Americans saw a man who was fighting for his family his reputation his life I did not do this\nWent through a logical explanation of based on a calendar that very few people in the world Cape except him and his dad and just a warning to everybody know this is not may you're trying to ruin my life\nI'm not evil and I I think he reacted consistent with being innocent but let me tell you a pivotal moment here when the sweat Nick allegation came out it was breaking news allegation number three at a very new and\nEvil level right so I thought I read it and I said it made no sense to me from the very beginning that a person would go to one party or where people were drugged and raped and go to too much less than\nThat made no sense ... and she said this sounds bad and I said yeah Susan is going to be this way for a while to come read it here's my take on it and being in the law for most of my life prosecutor defense attorney and a judge\nDoesn't have the ring of truth she said you know that makes sense followed anybody to keep going back and putting themselves in that situation and the friends not tell anybody and you've got to remember is ...\nAnd she worked through the process you took each allegation on its own she went to all the major decisions that judge Kavanaugh and spent a lot of time talking to him and this is a ... every I think they should be in every civics class in the country every high school student should probably have to listen to senator Collins\nExplanation of why she voted the way she did and what the rule of law is all about\nYou know I Am we have an election and thirty two days\nTo me senator a look at\nYour when Senator or I I Know how close you are to Senator McCain right and who recently passed away and I I've always admired him for being a war hero and I even said I've never regretted not a day not a second supporting him for president in oh wait over ... it was the right decision then and I stand by the day\nI had a lot of disagreements when he came back and voted no on the health care repeal I was frustrated\nThen I remember he said that how would these people on radio and TV and you know I understood Senator McCain that's you know he kind of had that\nSide of him and I knew it really well um but he also talked in that speech to about civility I don't know if there is not consequences for what has just gone on in the last the teen days political offensive Alice box\nI mean so here the consequences a party that will do anything to maintain power should probably never habits are the best thing you can do to stop this and the futures deny them their goal of having more Senate seats more house seats\nThere's been say listen I you know went through the record the allegations don't hold water in terms of him being some kind of gang rape the serial sexual predator he is a very reason logical judge I looked at everything they said about him I compared it to the facts and I'm voting yes here's what I Want the voters to do\nOn the voters to remember\nWhat the Democratic Party will do to get power and that they're being driven by people who would assume somebody guilty simply because they don't like their judicial philosophy remember this America do you really want these people in charge of your government\n[noise] [noise]\nWell I think that's a great question you know there's something you mentioned earlier I saw I I've never known Susan Collins that well I Know that look look the Republican Party\nIs not a model out for dinner if you want to and I love to I\nI I found somebody today that I had\nNo idea that the federal ... under which she makes her decisions and I I ... back time I respect I ... I really have a deep respect I Want everybody to have their own mind I'm not even a Republican I'm a conservative for reasons that I hold passionate and deer\nBut you mentioned something earlier that this was a profile in courage for her right in as much as we you've been outside in the halls and the Senate and you see what's going on there and all the protesting\nAnd Maine is not exactly a than expensive media market and I know they've been spending millions of dollars in Maine to try and\nInfluence or and groups are pledging now to to vote her out of office in destroying her\nAnd I'm like that anybody listen to what senator call just said that anybody want to listen I don't think anybody wanted to hear what she said because it was the single most\nThorough case for for\nHow any senator or congressman should make a decision\nAgain a good example for a civics class to look at it in terms of the way a senator should act but let's talk about the politics for a moment [noise] okay I talk a lot about ... only because I've tried to save the system\nYou know you always have ... votes but I mean I Know but but you know you more than made up for it\n... I don't think I had anything to make up for I really ... for you to disagree with me I'm not going to run my life around being somebody\nThere for I'm not going to end my life around what the hell Hannity things no way that are that are going to be honest with you I'm going to be true to me aren't you truly you yes or Leno wouldn't look like anything that\nSusan Collins she's a moderate pro choice Republican from New England\nThat represent say party a that used to exist in New England in greater numbers\nShe is a fiscal conservative she voted for the tax bill she's a social moderate and she will do things you won't like in the future but whatever she does will be thought out and reason but here's why I appreciate you talking about Susan Collins today\nShe has come as close to anybody in my lifetime of saving the republic\nFrom the abyss because we're headed down where nobody ever want to be a judge in the future if Susan had legitimize this God help the Senate confirmation\nPrior to ... she said it it's been a rapid decline for Thirty years they've tried it but I've got a new senator\nUm okay I don't think there's what'll happen I don't think I Do\nWe shape that but I I'm going to do something without ... just just for a second okay I'm going to send me on every or another politician do probably uh I'm fine uh you know I'm fine uh if you can help Susan help says they're going to try to destroy her now she comes from a purple state a President Trump last name a few points he wanted a second\n\nFiber optics move crazy amounts of data and even crazier speeds and filed by horizon is be one hundred percent fiber optic network with files that connection you'll get the fastest Internet available download speeds up to nine hundred and forty makes\nTV phone added to your price guarantee over Seventy nine Ninety nine per month on line with a two year agreement plus get two hundred dollar shorter range of Google and that smart devices and a one hundred dollar bills are pretty big guard when you order online go to get by US DOT com and switch to the one hundred percent fiber optic network one hundred percent phenomenal\nThe white committee when you know buying or refinancing your home\nAbout our new holding hostile\n... to ... somebody gay men\nAnytime anywhere on line to talk to somebody dot com [noise]\nRepublican considered a swing vote in the Senate has said she will vote yes on the nomination Mr President\nI Will so chicken for\nThat Senator Susan Collins of Maine following her hour long speech on the Senate floor democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia also says he will vote to confirm Kavanaugh one Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against Kavanaugh what his nomination move forward this morning and\nShe still hasn't said which way she will go during the final vote likely for tomorrow that war to end in a tie fifty fifty vice president Pence would cast the deciding vote outside of Chicago courthouse\n[noise] for officer Jason Van Dyke been convicted me twenty fourteen shooting death of ...

Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters and Chuck Schumer that's my of my biggest hope ...\n[noise] I think you're right and uh uh in terms of it's just for weeks out over four weeks ago ... lot can happen but I Will tell you that the key thing has Donald Trump is putting the Republicans on his shoulders and bringing them across the finish line in that he's bringing his votes to bear\nBut his his voters are coming back out but the key thing has\nHis two real opponents right now are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer she needs to take them on\nThey're gonna be a nightmare if they get control ... either house uh uh for next year so we've gotta do is they're supposed ... last national survey had fifty five percent unfavorable rating\nI mean fifty five percent will be a landslide for the Republicans and they

that's been grabbed my old white\nMale rich patriarchy in mind huge I just have it on me to pre clear he does not have the judicial temperament believes the Supreme Court is just one more political no that's not what the Supreme Court is about and I think in that hearing judge Kavanaugh disqualified from sounds that is\nThirty two days you're thirty two days away that is the base of the Democratic party that is\nThat is who people like Nancy Pelosi are appealing to Chuck Schumer is appealing to Maxine Waters is appealing to\nAnd of course Michael ... the new face of the Democratic party what has happened to the old Democratic Party party that was believed in tax cuts stood up for the working men and women in this country didn't believe in socialism believed in civil liberties and the

that people can go to\nJessie Molly Peterson a dot com generally tutor dot com but we've got to be talking with Democrats and Republicans and independents about this upcoming election because a lot of people are really really upset at what happened with Josh cabinet are\nEven people who at one time thought that they were going to be voting for the Democrats started to rethink their position and I have to tell you Sean I grew up on a ... down in Alabama\nI grew up a born and grew up under the Jim Crow laws or remember black and white size only when I voted at Eighteen I voted for the Democratic party all those three are growing up on a plantation living under Jim Crow laws that I was actually a Democrat\nDemocrats are right for you to help free thought\nSpin on life here to take care of yourself they lie to you about the Republican Party every ... the a straight white conservative Christian now they're always calling him racist and they use those words to brainwash you in order to as slave view and the beauty of all if there is it a beauty and death about what's happening\nIt was worse to brainwash you have in order to as slave view and the beauty of all if there is it a beauty and death\nAbout what's happening with the judge and a hatred and anger and the accusations far south of gays without proof that if we have seen over the last couple of weeks or months or so even longer than that or even a lot of black people started to think about the Democratic party\nAnd they're starting to realize especially in the Christmas they're starting to realize maybe they are involved with the wrong party and that the party the Democratic party has a lot like the party that they joined many many years ago and I think a lot of folks have been affected by this\nYou know see O'Brian I remember correctly where are you part of the N. double ACP for a number of years\nShowing I'm a two term president at the end up ... he's the Garland, Texas\nAnd the way you might not know and I'm I'm a life member I became a life member\nI was not an event in Atlanta and I just so happens I said please the next time take politics out of a man like Clarence Thomas is in advancing and is exceeding at the highest level please please support him I said that when I when I pay when I paid my membership the cardio somewhere\nAbsolutely right Sean and what we're seeing now are the fake activist who are hitting the street I remember when I was president ah there and I'm going to disclose this that there were times when we would look load up ten buses full of activists by simply giving them ten dollars and a tuna fish sandwich\nAnd a drink to get on the bus to go protest something that they\nHad no clue what it was that they were going to protest and that's what you're saying\nOn the streets now and that is fake it is something that will not stop freedomworks the organization that I Am with what you have grass roots activist who are in the capital right now who are checking on their congressmen and senators\nTo make certain that they ride herd on this particular vote we want cabinet noted come through last week\nFreedomworks we had two thousand people on the Capitol Grounds pushing through\nNot only Jim Jordan who I can be the next speaker of the house but also we wanted those elected officials who should be responsible to the American people for the opposite they old to make sure that they go and do the job that we sent them to do it's a long way from when I was president\nOf the N. double ACP twenty seven years ago to where I Am now and that plantation that revenue Peterson was talking about the Jesse Lee was talking about by the way Jesse leaves in my movie runaway slave or just the lead on why am I not in your movie what's up with a ... do you and I have to make the next film together Sean we have to make the next\nNo no no I'm just wondering why you picked Jesse you didn't pick your friend Sean Hannity\nYou might good buddy you got to come on the show real soon but that plantation was real I grew up in Louisiana during that same Jim Crow era it's very real but many of us have run away from it\nAnd we encourage many more at this point in time in America and the president is giving us all the caliber of that's necessary to run away from that type of enslavement\nThat this nation that following up on you know to\nAdd to that and the beauty of what President Trump has done that because he lack fear he's put country first he's not afraid to really deal with these people he's not afraid to use social media to put the truth out there and discredited is encourage a lot of men and women\nIf those are good to stand up and speak up fight for their country fight for what is right\nAnd when they saw this attack on judge Kavanaugh his wife his daughters while they're saying that they care about women they care about children we're too\nKevin are his wife his daughters while they're saying that they care about women care about children which the love and compassion for the judge and his wife his children are going to have to deal with these allegations\nThis whole thing has to now look we've got to get through the vote tomorrow and I am cautiously optimistic that judge Kavanaugh gets to be on the court that he deserves to be on\nWhat if we don't deal with the these tactics the willingness to tear down bludgeon destroy men families kids are obviously impacted by it if if they can't even have the the most simple as the civility on these issues", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018",
