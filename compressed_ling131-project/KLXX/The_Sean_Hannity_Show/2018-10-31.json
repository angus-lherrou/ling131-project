worked in the oil field\nAnd now in the evening I came in after scrubbing toilets I certainly am cleaning business out there and the cleaning and catering business right yeah so\nI come in at night

majority Eighteen year old rough neck six year old black liberal women\nWere listening to my showing at the highlight of it I had a following of like twenty thirty some thousand\nThree awesome

been unparalleled the as quick as any politician as promised stuff and then make those promises happen\n[laughter] yeah it's it's it's just ridiculous that's essentially what she's running on and uh and so we're we've been doing everything I was going door to door I think over a thousand houses personally I'm a second pair of shoes\nOr we need people to come make phone calls doorbell with a volunteer contribute you know Dino Rossi dot com come help\nYeah what what do you think do you get a day by day return in terms of a Republican Democrat or do they not give that information out there and\nWe don't register by party in our state so it's only based on what we've I deed and are in our people are voting but so we're there's clearly asking a master so we really got to get our people are male and about anybody listening to us right now if you haven't senator but I'll do it now get your family to do it call your friends get it in because\nThe sooner comes in the same work take

wants Obamacare let me guess she wants to impeach the president\nWell she's just writing it running basically on hate as you said so that's the main difference she wants Obamacare let me guess she wants to impeach the president she wants to open borders she wants the crumbs back anything else that's any different from the rest of the checklist of every other Democrat running\nFor that is a checklist we have a few other things that are that we're in the ad obviously we we're we don't have a state income tax or straight she favorites that that's been turned down nine times by the public or your ... on that bandwagon\nFire you know into your tax time for a for not being a fan of Obamacare when Obamacare came in I lost her health care myself my wife and my my four children and I ended up with a lousy plan to cast too and at times as much\nCoverage things I Want coverage covers I didn't want covered\nTwelve thousand dollar family deductible on top of that you know my goal is to have as many health insurance companies chasing people around for their disappear possibly get so you can decide what's your plan or some bureaucratic politician decided for you it was called freedom\nWell listen we wish you the best Dino Rossi a that is the difference in this between Republicans and a conservative agenda or the radical left agenda Nancy Pelosi I keep reminding people vote for any Democrat anywhere in the country is a vote for her and it is because the electorate speaker\nAnd a vote for any Democrat in the Senate well that's pretty much a vote for sure so I Hope the people in

thinking about Maxine Waters is the head of financial committee just think about that for one second\nTo brief diversion so I was thinking it might be nice if on election night you hosted your own show and I think we should take a poll and see if America would like to see host your own channel okay\nWell ... ... you're saying is which has been a fact all my twenty three years at Fox is I don't work on election I this is true and it's all Fox News division that takes over and I went one year I went in and uh you know I was on for five minutes and I'm like I I Want to be home alone\nAnd I want to have my three TV sets off for depending if I can set up another one in the meantime and my six computers and I want to do it I always do I want to be looking at percentages and finding out beforehand whether we're winning or losing\nNow the former president of Fox News bill shine can attest to the fact that has emails to the fact that I have called it right before anybody else every single election year because\nYou know I'm sitting there looking at let's see uh\nUh Cuyahoga County and Palm Beach county and the panhandle and southwest Florida and I can figure out usually Broward County all these important counties whether or not Republicans are going to win or lose now there's a little tougher because of\nThe different congressional races my guess is it's going to be late into the morning before we can ascertain who can maintain control of the house\nIn large part because California matters Southern California we've been featuring the seven important races there on our list on Hannity dot com the thirty most important racist Seventy total important races although they're all important and I'm just not sure people understand what a Speaker Pelosi means\nTo heartbeat away and you have a woman who says we have to pass the bill to find out what's in it yeah that's what you went running your country then by all means staying home listen at the end of the day will deal with whatever it is\nWhere I'm going to rage\nThere well you can rage away as long as it's not against me I don't really care I'm going to be so mad at Republicans that they don't go out and the well the very\nVery sad that we found ... she's already picked out the drapes she got this thing covered\nUm I'm not so sure I'd want one of the unknown factor is the ... the greatest hope for Republicans in my opinion\nIs that it absolutely there is an unknown Trump factor [noise]\nAll bets are off 'cause I don't think Trump supporters of the type of people are going to answer anybody's call for any poll ever I don't know if anyone calls me I never get called for a poll\nAnd polls you know I look at them I Know a conventional wisdom is I read real clear politics every day you know Nate Silver as as an eighty five percent Democrats take the house\nOr but I also know that they got it wrong and two thousand for two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and sixteen and not only did they get it wrong they did it in a colossal spectacular way\nSo I'm just saying to the American people don't be swayed by polls don't feed the spirited if you think you can't win assume that you're behind\nAnd go out there on the field that's why we play the game and you know sometimes your favorite team wins and sometimes your favorite team loses I didn't particularly enjoy election nights and two thousand and eight yeah because you can't draw\nYou cannot complain if you don't vote so go out and vote I Can't complain because I'm basically I'm not talking about you everybody knows you vote\nHas nothing to do with the voting\nSo go out and vote I Can't complain because I'm basically I'm not talking about you everybody knows you vote has nothing to do with the voting\nI said oh we can do is informed people it has everything to do with the voting no it has everything to do with everybody my my vote is meaningless in New York for the most part now we know we're in a blue state
