candidates take Chicago a Peter Roskam district for example showing here's a got Iraq there was one in two thousand and six year we actually lost out he'd be Tammy Duckworth and now us a senator from the state of Illinois he beat her in that election Peter Roskam knows how to win so we have good candidates across the country\nWho I think know how to win and he's talked how climate but again I think\nWhen you look at where the left wants to take this country I think most people with comic that's going to say I didn't sign up for that I'm going to keep Republican control and the great economic gains that we've seen under the leadership or the president\nDo you think the cabin on hearing the caravan the mobs um coupled with the president's success is is there a base out there that

you sense that you feel that that people are in fact moving in that direction and and were outraged by what they all happen to a judge capital\nYet they're running this play book all across the country because they don't have anything else that\nWe broke healthcare well it's all hardly they rely tried to fix it\nWell millions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie is well Republicans didn't support preexisting conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific battle\nAnd in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill that was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate is gone\nAnd I mean it will all all Obamacare was was one huge redistribution scheme where are you going to have the young and healthy literally buying plans that they don't need or want be enforced by law to have it or penalized if they don't get it financially\nAnd then literally redistribute that money to the ... the elderly and disabled in some redistribution scam\nAnd meanwhile they're young to get off a lot better by paying for one doctor's visit a year to make sure they're healthy and buying at their age you know catastrophic insurance which you know it's going to be like fifty bucks a month\nAnd in case they got cancer or heart attack or bad accident so uh it was never fair to the people in this country they sold us a bill of goods and it never worked out the way they said it was\nExactly right we tried to repair it a ... and then of course we repeal that voted to repeal it and replace it with a much better program and then of course it failed in the Senate but that doesn't stop them from only telling half the story which is that somehow we voted to repeal Obamacare\nThen the Senate but that doesn't stop them from only telling half the story which is that somehow we voted to repeal Obamacare and in doing so uh and the coverage for pre existing conditions like the only way to have coverage for preexisting conditions is Obamacare which was on its

people and help people\nThat's absolutely true story that's actually the ... family they didn't thirty forty your friends and stuff\nAnd I wanted to relate that story you know an tele quickly Fred Trump showing up to collect rent with these twenty six year old son Donald J truck in and they're\nWalking through the uh the garden apartments knocking on doors Carolina family cannot pay the rent the father has lost a job as a blue collar worker Fred in his son are looking at them saying okay no problem\nThere very often guy let's wait a month let's see what happens I suspect you'll get a job well and behold a sixty short days later or he gets a job pays the rent that he was owed\nA and it's just a wonderful story that their family never going to be told by the mainstream media but people talk about what does the president has compassion for these people does the president that empathy and the answer is yes he learnt that at the ... riding shotgun with his father\nIs he was either building these buildings helping to build buildings are collecting rent for blue collar people that were living shot so\nSo I wanted I get a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story arc of the Trump family which is a great American success [noise] many ways to had any family is also an American success story the arcs or different er and the generational transfers are different uh but they're both part of America the both part of that broke up America\nYou know the the generations that built this country and I don't know if you're a Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations I built this country are just amazing people the\nI appreciate it God Bless them but\nThat's my front with Fifteen days to election day one of the important Senate races were watching is out in the great state of Arizona which by the way could be impacted by this caravan that had marching towards the southern border as we speak\nI saw it when I when we heard this I\nI couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harbored al ... who can and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops to include you know troops well I was deployed over there\nI've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them and are eight ten but often times uh you know the the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would light up on the taxi way as they ... the flag draped casket would come through and there is no this is silence there\nAnd everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes or who perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates and for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign\nAnd Arizona and should make a different choice to not vote for ... this is really personal for those of us who served and was shot at by the Taliban and and saw Americans parish over this\nUh you know I hear the emotion in your voice and understandably so\nTo serve there were shot at by the Taliban and and saw Americans perished over this\nUh you know I hear the emotion in your voice and understandably so I mean you ... said six deployments that's amazing\nYeah well again it was an absolute honor there's so many Americans who have done that and more are both on the ground in the air and on the C I mean this is this is you know why we fight or to protect our way of life and our freedoms and our liberties\nAre in it you know this is you know in addition to this\nA comment saying it's okay for an American to join the Taliban to basically commit trees and she also was protesting right after nine eleven\nProtesting our troops in a pink to to a flyers handed out at protests that she led depicting our troops as skeletons and saying stop the U.S terror in the middle east\nSo this isn't just a one off or her uh this is the pattern she advocated is shut down Luke air force base I hosted the president President Trump at Luke air force base on friday to see what an amazing national security treasure it is she's trying to cover up or tracks and with George Soros\nChuck Schumer and the millions of dollars that are flowing in to you know cover their tracks and Turner into something that she's not in the greatest political cover up in Arizona history a lot of people think she's moderate a lot of people think she's right of center a and it's just not true and we\nGot only coming out on a three weeks before the election I mean it's almost on a daily basis it's like you know a a deep dive dumped has been made but I Would think that this was common knowledge\nOr had to have been common knowledge about her I mean I I wouldn't underestimate remember the allegations against the blind shakes attorney that she invited to Arizona State university I mean that's another slap in these two people\nThat absolutely look at you know we are sort of joke that the Democrat Party should have done better in internal opposition research on her before they had Herbie Chuck Schumer is talk recruit for them to try to flip the Senate majority\nWe knew about her radical cats uh we didn't tell them people about it in Arizona every single day uh and that and the last few weeks you're right some some videos and and things are coming out every single day but unless you're on conservative radio conservative TV Fox or another and social media you're not\nFinding out about this and so we still have enough of a number of independents\nAnd Republicans who are not Sunni and unfortunately that need to know every time we have to put up and add to put some of these statements and like you just played it cost us about seven hundred thousand dollars to make sure the message gets out to the voters as they are voting every single day right now\nAnd she's had so much money dumping into her you know and if people do on a supporter of course they can go to mix Sally for Senate dot com because we really do need to help to make sure Arizona they're aware\nOf Arizona are aware of all of this they will never vote for her if they're aware of your heroic background they absolutely will vote for you\nUm I've only gotten too good to know you in in recent months and I got to tell you I'm more impressed every single time I talk to you and I think you'll be a great senator from the state of Arizona I Hope you're not going to turn into Ben Sasse and run away from me after you get elected but um that's happened more than ...\nYou know it's on you may not remember but back when I was a major in the air force I took out in the Pentagon because they were making our service women wear ... when they were in Saudi Arabia and I put my career on the line and I actually sued the department of defense or fought for eight years and got legislation passed to overturn it\nAnd I actually went on the Hannity show during that whole thing ah to talk about how important it was to protect our religious liberties and not say\nIt was a very you know that that was that was a good move I mean I I don't like the idea if American Soldiers are are on foreign soil and were there to protect them and help them which is usually the case ah I don't think that we need to go by their customs were American\nOil and were there to protect them and help them which is usually the case ah I don't think that we need to go by their customs were Americans we get to follow her own customs or else you don't want us there then you don't want us there\nExactly that's exactly oh we we were there it was with the U.S military policy it was ridiculous I stood up for it I thought for it took me eight years but I finally got legislation passed as a citizen\nOr to overturn it and make sure that our values are that were set up for it yeah\nWell I really do we both love and why didn't president anew and here I'm a ... Martin Luther king's Ali if you're not paying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention first in cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban while Martha McSally doing her six tour of duty twenty eight years serving our country\nAh she's got one of those crazy pink hats on you know talking down our troops and accusing them didn't you choose them of torture as well\nAs she was a line with a radical uh anti border patrol a group down at the border trying to help uh you know help with illegal immigration and that group ah ... accused the border patrol of torture yes there was a rare again radical extreme group that she was very much involved in a in the inner path\nWhat do you think the president needs to do with the seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border if they make it to the border what's the best plan for the president\nSaid this is absolutely ridiculous we have got to stop them from coming in the president needs to use all elements of power that he has shown we're seeing little mini caravans coming in every single day though because they're taking advantage of our loopholes in the law uh I work very closely with President Trump often called the good that bill that was also the Knicks Sally bill\nThat would provide thirty eight billion dollars for the border wall\nTo secure our border and close the loop holes that the cartels are taking advantage of it has to stop every single day right now there's people coming in in ...\nUh and that's a a sector that is being overrun right now all they do have been down there many months they redo yeah they're released into the interior of and I said sixteen thousand five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recorded this is not certain president John fall it's a Democrat's\nFault for obstructing a closing these loopholes and securing the border and the president as frustrated as the eye and you need to use everything he's got in to to get to to put pressure on Mexico\nAnd then they usually for building a wall and finding and fully funding all yes and you have\nBoarded our bill thirty eight billion dollars including building a wall Yes sir\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell so and I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on that House bill I'm getting my asking for it right now because it's being misconstrued by the Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people who have family\nMember wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare has failed in Arizona there's only one choice in fourteen if it really counties which has no choice people lost their health care coverage where people right now at three conditions who can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I worked hard to make sure that we were moving away from that uh and and towards something that gives more choice for people\nMore flexibility at the state level more free market get the federal government you know to not be doing this as one size fits all top down penalties taxes and mandates it's failed and so we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ing that vote\nI I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions oh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr Martha McSally a really a rock star a hero who served their country and an important race for the republic\nMaintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate that'll make votes for Supreme Court justice is a lot easier going up against a very radical leftist in the name of Chris and send them a thank you so much a Martha McSally for all you've done for your country and and the position you take and ah you should win this race\nFar and wide when the people of Arizona fully understand the record the background and the radical views of Christ and send them a thank you for being with us Martha McSally\nThanks I appreciate you signing a flashlight on that in an advocacy and if people want to how they can go to Nick Sally for Senate dot com you need your support and help and donations and weaken my next thing thanks and I\nThank you rod as in Florida crushed view on the Sean Hannity show how are you ride\nA yes or no resolution on your show dedicated listener concerns my concern is the Supreme Court list that the president had actually a presented when he was on trial is okay\nAnd the reason why my concern is is is because magic close is already a put the\nNews out there that they do smear campaigns\nAnd they've done a ... they want us out of transparency and so we've given transparency it's like open up our playbook so they can actually investigate every person on that list so whoever President Trump actually nominates they've already got a team investigating that specific personal attack on a smear campaign",
