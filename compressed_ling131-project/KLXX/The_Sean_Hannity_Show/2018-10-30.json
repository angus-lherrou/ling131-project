hated Donald Trump\nFor being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts get in a way of a good propaganda ally in an election year well anyway Republicans now are beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also\nDirect primary care or what I call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining momentum and I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress in the Senate as we move forward and there are a couple of plans that are percolating one would be block granting money to states so that they can become\nYou know the fifty outlets of of new innovative medicine and they'll turn over every penny because their political futures will be dependent on it which would be a good thing Gavin Newsom wants universal free care for everyone he gets X number of dollars good luck with that but in states red states with smart governors\nOr it could be a lot different and a lot better you know we we often go to the case of health care savings accounts\nAnd that would be your only count you manage every year and set of eyes a yearly checkup and your younger years you're building up money it's your money but\nWhen you get older if you really get sick that money that account has built up a fortune and you couple that with catastrophic care fairly inexpensive depending on what your deductible is you know you could pay as low as a hundred bucks a year and get a great catastrophic plan if you have a heart attack cancer\nOr have a bad accident but anyway the health care cooperatives of Dr Josh I'm ... has been a pet project on this program of ours now for years and he joined us atlas empty Wichita, Kansas he joined us with Dr Lee as gross and he's the president for doctors for patient care foundation a thank you both for being with us\nOr Dr Robert just to remind people I I Lived in Wichita I could walk into your office pay you fifty bucks a month\nGet unlimited care twenty four seven I get a Ninety five percent reduction in all of my prescription medicine costs and my kids get unlimited care for ten bucks a month is that true\nThat for every American could have come tears level direct care just like you know important people like Sean Hannity\nA ... a month is that true that is very uh every American could have ... level direct care just like you and how important people like Sean Hannity um yeah I don't think people under stand just how important this election is um we see how divisive DC as we see how much infighting they raised\n... and we don't want those people managing our health care\nEvery American deserves Affordable Care and the direct care model cars manager for a penny a pill labs for two or three dollars unlimited visits no co pays brief procedures\nWe can fix is we can um work with employers and redesign insurance plans to decrease savings their premiums by thirty to sixty percent we can do that but we need Republicans in office\nAllowing the free market to function because if we go back towards a an Affordable Care act style a Medicare for all it would decrease our ability to really you know innovate in a way that is meaningful for patient\nAnd more importantly shot you know we're looking at a vision right now we have two completely different visions on healthcare future one is a completely government controlled\nSocialized medicine or you're going to insert that government between patients and their doctors or you think of the cabin out here you know that's how the ... at the same government that's going to control your health care or you have a another position that his health care free to meet with the freedom of choice between you and your physician\nA word that your decisions are not being made by the ... who\nBy by the government and so you know while direct primary care isn't is not a partisan solution it is a solution that has been embraced by most Republicans that are running including or just saying this is running for governor in the state of Florida he is a race this Newt Gingrich has put this in his you know to\nDirect primary care and his platform a so this is definitely a platform that Republicans are supporting so if you want freedom this is definitely the vision for him\nI mean the thing is it's almost mind numbing to me and you you know what you're right Dr Josh I have friends of mine that are doctors and because it's not because I pay them to be honest but I couldn't pay them I mean I I Do pay them in other ways and thanked them when they do favors for me but\nUm I I Will tell you that I can make a call at three o'clock in the morning any day and get a doctor's care\nAnd get a doctor's recommendation and didn't and you know what if every American white a white only a few Americans deserve that or they ended up going to the stock in the box places and I'm not now playing them like I'm sure they play a vital role in certain towns and communities\nBut I don't think it's ideal because I think most people pick a doctor because they like and trust that individual and know that that person knows who they are and knows their medical background that's important to\nYou and everybody should be able to choose that and I think that goes back to what Dr gross is saying about this is a referendum on freedom and we want freedom in our schools in our homes and all that kind of important decisions we make but then we we've been missing that level of freedom when it comes to the most important decisions in health care\nSo this really is a crucial step in history\nWhere we can say look the free market can do this better than the government's been doing it people aren't happy with health care system now and met our ten dollars a pill we we want freedom and health care we want choice the direct care model\nAllows every man woman and child preexisting conditions or not to get incredibly high quality care in an affordable way\nUm and I saw on the cars you know it shouldn't be a partisan\nFight it you know in our practice we have not raised our prices in eight years we've tried to sixty dollars a month for eight years for unlimited primary care services are\nX rays are twenty five dollars are MRI's or two hundred and twenty dollars these are all affordable so in a pre existing no pre existing condition the question is can you actually afford to get the care unique by the doctor you need when you need a and these direct care solutions getting the government out of the middle of this relationship can actually do that so you need\nThey're running for office that support the freedom and health care\nYou know it seems that you know it's so simple and so basic and so fundamental and this is where I got frustrated with the Republicans because they had promised repeal replays and they weren't ready for the moment there's no doubt about it now to the president's credit\nHe got rid of the individual mandate but that's only a first step in if every Democrat is going to go out there and say well we're gonna have we're going to have better health care options for the American people but in many cases that the very same people that gave us the failure of Obamacare\nWhen you're offering a health care cooperative model you've duplicated down how many practices across the country doctor remember\nWe've helped over five hundred and fifty practices get lost but there's over a thousand growing every day I'm you know we had a twenty practices started last month alone that's a new practice every business day\nOr the ... and then you have any direct access to every individual twenty four seven direct access to a doctor\nThere are no pre existing condition prejudice at all and these practices exactly have you can afford a cell phone you can afford direct patient care primary care there's no insurance except you probably would want a couple the direct care with like a catastrophic plan which is fairly inexpensive honors\nYou have car insurance for the big stuff but I think you know the point that goes unmentioned is the fact that the insurance premiums are going up twenty thirty percent every year when Dr Lynn I never raised her prices is is\nKilling the economy it's killing jobs it's taking\nMoney trying to be noisy but are you making money at fifty bucks a patient I'm a I'm a make a month are you making any money\nWhat do you want me to has been acquired yeah yeah\nI mean this has not been acquired by the big boxes you know we're able to keep the practices afloat or able to drive interest in primary care were able to treat people in the rural communities these practices are in inner city there are critical access hospitals are critical access communities in suburban and urban setting a and it's worse\nThan what they say poor people in America people we defined as poor or lower income they can pay fifty bucks a month and they can get a hold are you twenty four seven and if they need to Z pack they're going to walk out with his Z pack and pay above the Z pack\nWas that you know ... ... yeah they should be able to get that if you think about it\nThe poor and ... the more you need a model like this\nMIT did a study on Oregon's Medicaid system and only twenty cents on the dollar cut to the recipient don't believe you need to have a functioning car and car insurance gas money to get to the doctor if you're poor you can texture doctor you can email that you can call them you don't have to leave the house necessarily because the doctors are\nAnd how many patients you have\nA we have about six to seven hundred per doctor\nOkay so I'm a liberal Democrat and I'm like most practices and probably most of your patients like me\nI really don't want to see you unless I really need you unless I'm saying hello or you know say let's go fishing together hum because most people will drive but there's probably at least ten patients of every practice where they're calling me every day I'm assuming\nWe we have our high utilizes\nAnd our last year we had her high we have our high utilize there's a we have a few pains and they asked it never stop you know we factored that in um the only part of the program\nWe have doctors coming from a three hundred and fifty doctors from forty one states descending on our land do this weekend to attend the conference to learn how to set up their practices after that so you know with over a thousand practices nationwide already practicing the director model our looking increase that just by thirty percent with one conference alone\nOr the interest as massive and keeps on growing and as long as we put policies in place at the state and federal level that continue to allow these practice to to grow\nAnd blossom or you'll see this movement leaving all across the country are getting better access better care for their cost us and I got\nTelling you anything about health care that's out now is they're talking point we're offering health care a ... and Republicans will you take care of preexisting conditions that line\n...
