Chinese Chinese re militarized\nPaint all the bad things in the world on America what resulted the rise of ISIS Russia invading its neighbor Chinese Chinese re militarized Asia at the end of the Obama administration just one metric take take politics out of it for a second\nWe had sixty five million refugees in the world that's more than we had at the end of World War two when you don't have American leadership the world is a dangerous place now that ... thanks to Donald Trump now we have a commander in chief who believes that even exist read his war so speech listen\nTo what he says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing what he said at the un\nLine yes absolutely absolutely so that's why I wrote why re fight but but you're absolutely correct we have domestic issues here he will exist not just outside of our borders look what they did to the godly man Brett Kavanaugh in the last fourteen days a man who\nHad the probably the cleanest most spotless record in an American public life goes from being\nA stand up standing federal judge to amass rapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next thirty days are so important showing\nIt means ah everything and then look everything's riding on this\nI don't know if you would have asked me three weeks ago I Would have leaned in on the side that history would would win out because the party that wins the White House usually ends up losing seats in a midterm election they totally not happened three times\nOnly valley picked up seats three times in the last hundred years the last was\nAfter two thousand and one of the attack in the eye on number eleven September eleventh\nUm but there's so much at stake here and that is what ... literally jumps off the pages I'm reading through your book that we better defeat America's enemies and we better do without apologies tactic orca we don't get to do that if we're not in power right\nWe we have to take very seriously this concept but the left so the left has been taken over by the radicals\nThinking about the fight but JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist stronger national security he wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have we have the crazies we have the that Ocasio Cortez\nIs we have the Maxine Waters in control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply\nThe ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool well guess who use that philosophy in the past that philosophy drives to the labor camps that drives to the ... drive to death camps whether you are right wing extremist whether you're a fascist or whether you're a communist that's the philosophy\nAnd we've got to stop that shall we have to stay true to the principles of the republic\nYou talk it in a book about the a will to winter and then again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies\nAnd here's what we can't have any more and you talk about the will to when you talk about will\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized it is and we pulled out\nIn Iraq and Afghanistan we pull out waving it dates of our withdrawal and we lost nearly six thousand kids in the end so many others comeback without their arms and legs and they're in their faces his figured\nFighting for their country we cannot commit American troops ever again\nUnless we're willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you have to win these wars or else don't start to be involved in the\n... so my book is about two things it's about all the threats we face\nYou have to win these wars or else don't start to be involved in them\nSo so my book is about two things about all the threats we face as a country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China\nBut the second part is much more important is is the one who hitting on it do we have the will to defeat our enemies because Vietnam is the great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with wooden sticks and Ross the rifles defeat us\nHow's that possible because we lost the war at home because we allowed the left to undermine our will to win\nAnd and what are the most important things is the individual real to win\nIn addition to the the ... of the threats I have full vignettes of American heroes I go back to the Bobby was two hundred years ago I took it by the Korean hero a trusted pulled her I talk about a man who spent six and a half years as a naval aviator even the Hanoi Hilton\nBut the last story is very very important for what we are seeing right now and it's Whittaker Chambers most kids have no idea who would it could chambers is\nThis is a man who was cabin old before Kavanaugh was born in Nineteen forty eight the first live televised Senate hearing was the man who would occur chambers who have been a communist agent of the Soviets who went on record saying\nHey I'm no longer communist but I Need America to know where the communist or in the government including algae his he was a guy who was working for the Soviets what happened to this man who stood up for the truth\nThey accused him of everything cheating on his wife ... of the death of being responsible for the death of his brother none of it was true but what did he do he had the will to fight he stood up for the truth justice justice Kavanaugh will have that sort of showing his his his his a scary thing\nThe Democrats have done this before so it'll be surprised at what they did to Capitol they've done it since ... years ago\nThey have done it every election in my lifetime they play the race card the jet rye or you know they divided America old versus young rich versus poor black versus white this is the identity politics which which they have mastered and I keep playing them in
