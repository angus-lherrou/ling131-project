George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist French at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now\nThat she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House in twenty twenty I'm male focused on Massachusetts whatsoever\nOn this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nBecause you're one percenters but she also herself deducted fifty thousand dollars worth of closed in one year to lower her own taxes that's always a warrant\nFifty thousand dollars and old clothes that's like the Clintons\nDeducting their use the underwear as a ... that's all true they did it as a tax deduction by the way I don't think anybody wants their old underwear and they put a value to it\nYou know I've always said this Jeff that basically liberals are generous only with other people's money that we had the latest numbers from twenty sixteen come out and the bottom fifty percent\nOf taxpayers in this country don't pay three percent of the bill just three we have redistribution\nTen percent pays forty percent of the bill you know I mean so I mean I don't know what else\nThe tax cuts the fact that they want their crumbs back they want to impeach Trump they want endless investigation they want to keep Obamacare disaster they want to eliminate eyes open borders I mean that's the whole thing and hate Trump that's it\nShe wants to get rid of ice in fact it was a Cambridge a warning supporter about a month ago there was arrested for putting a five hundred dollar bounty on ice officers I mean you know her rhetoric actually is dangerous in when Republicans wanting to fix health care make it actually affordable about a year ago a she was the ...\nThe money from the American people do this right after a congressman ... had been shot by that Bernie Sanders supporters so you know she really doesn't seem to be able to temper her rhetoric whatsoever and I think if you saw on Monday after the backlash of putting that video out a and she got a lot of backlash around the country including\nDemocrats like David ... is critical\nUh she went on a twenty six I Believe tweet a rant about Donald Trump just obsessed with Donald Trump and has no focus at whatsoever on Massachusetts and what's important here whereas a you know I've been a legislator here for eight years I'd actually\nPut two billion dollars in tax cuts back in people's pockets and they know it and we've been campaigning pretty strongly I think that again you're going to be pleasantly surprised in November sex with what happens\nIs that I Hope so are you may not notice about my background but I live five years from Rhode Island ah in Warren Rhode Island not far from the ... borders with Massachusetts and you know I spent a lot of time this is by the way when it was the greatest NBA time in history with magic\nVersus Larry Bird and and parish McHale a DJ and Danny Ainge I mean it was probably one of the best teams in one of the best rivalries ever in sports I'm ...
