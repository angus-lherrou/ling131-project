I Believe in what he's saying I Believe and what you're saying you cannot let that migrants hung in and now\nIt's ridiculous it's out of control but it's all about the whole coordinated effort and showing it so that the Democrats crack can't play their same game as you know the ... you know the way they're using all of their their word to feel sympathy and build\nNext trust against the Republicans and trumpet so good at that she's just got to make sure again there's a coordinated effort said that there is seen that people there and the military show of force start sending ... start sending plane off stage they're ready to say we mean that\nThis is his reading in the sand just like Obama hat with Syria\nHe didn't do that this is this is Trump is is that and he's got to show this and handling is right with a really great question where it needed Africa\nReally not worry yeah of course I Do I mean we don't want a humanitarian crisis you know the vice president actually said today that\nYou know a Central American leaders told him that left us in Venezuela or bankrolling this caravan which wouldn't surprise me the manure and re president telling the vice president that and ... told the Washington Post the president of on doors told me this was organized by leftist groups\nIn Honduras financed by Venezuela look bottom line is they should be turned back now but if in fact we see they're getting closer and closer to our southern border we've got to protect the border\nWe're going to do this in a way I I Know that is we want to have the best interest of innocent people and all of this nobody's innocent if they're willing to just brush our border Russia across the border\nWe don't want people hurt we definitely don't want people killed\nAnd ultimately the people that will precipitate this crisis they're going to be on the Mexican side of the border because America is not going to do anything to people that don't violate the law but if they violate the law there'll be arrested and I I hear what you're saying we should have food water medicines supplies and transportation back to where they came from\nAnd I think you can do it and as as expeditious way possible with them as much hair as possible\nUm but I don't think any arrest\nAs expeditious way possible with them as much terrorists possible\nUm but I don't think any arrest ever looks good and if the people on the Mexican side of the border with border want a confrontation with American police and ice and our military our side is going to win and you're right we should do it as passionately as possible I don't want anybody to get hurt\nYou know a lot of these people probably come from nothing they have zero to lose here and that's a that's a tough position to be in and then you have agitator that or\nYou know they're not telling them anything that's on us than truthful that they're they're telling them they're going to get in and so they're going to be disappointed feelings of anger anger is going to probably be on display so we're just hoping to get it turned around before this even happens but\nYou know let's let's be clear here this is the United states of America we're a constitutional republic\nWe believe in the rule of law and the application of our laws that's it Democrats don't like it they can change the law good luck to them doing that on this topic which John Podesta says they shouldn't even be talking about right anyway Patty thank you I'm Becky is in Tucson, Arizona next on the Sean Hannity show how are you glad you called\nBecky Hi Sharon how are you today I'm good what's going on I\nWell I got a couple of things being from a border town so that people don't understand about this this law that's kind of [noise]\nYes they come to our border but they don't understand that they also come with a lot of diseases like TV and chicken pox in life and our border patrol agents and all are people that are working with him get exposed to this they don't understand there's long term ramifications of them and I had a feeling of pot about\nWhy I'm Mexican\nGovernment is not stopping some mob\nIt's because when they come here and earn money they send millions and millions and millions of dollars back to their family members the wire transfer\nSo why should they stop them because they're making money off of it so I think we should stop the wire transfer\nLook there is a part of me having been down to where you live in Tucson\nThe Rio Grande everywhere in between and I've been I've spotted reported on the border more than anybody else that I Know in media today I've been horseback all terrain vehicle helicopters goats I've been there I've seen a I was up close and personal when it turned out gang members were being arrested I've got the video of it\nDrug warehouses tunnels I've seen it all look I understand the people come from countries where there's great poverty and little opportunity um but the answer isn't not obeying or laws that we have a an immigration policy immigration laws the first step if you want to ever come to America\nIs to respect the laws of this land and respect American sovereignty and respect our borders and that if you're not willing to do that basic most fundamental of things and then at that point there are other people that would would be willing to accept that and doing the right way\nAnd they should have precedence over those that are law listen don't respect our laws\nSo it's really really simple and you know I feel listen to the world America had the money you know we do so much already ... the tunes are billions and trillions of dollars\nWere spent over the years to help other people in other wins at some point we've got to take care of America First we've got to take Americans out of poverty first we've got Americans that need help in this country that\nThat don't yet have not fully gotten on board we need every American successful\nAnd those that can take care of themselves they will be taking care of no Americans never lack for ...\nWe need every American successful and those that can take care of themselves they will be taking care of no Americans never lack for compassion just the opposite there's never been a country that has accumulated more power\nAnd used it for the advancement of human good around the world more than the U.S\nIncluding paying the price and shutting the blood for the cause of liberty and freedom for many people around the world [noise] um [noise] but it is that is we cannot take on the world's problems either we don't have the money we don't have\nThe ability to do that anyway eight hundred knowing for one showing you want to be a part of the program Donna's in Iowa Don Hi how are you glad you called [noise]\nHi Sean thank you for taking my call I appreciate it a I'm a marine veteran\nYes sir semper fi ... glad you called ... thank you sir I called actually to echo what you had earlier reported about that\nAre being

feel that that this has got his his uh organizing skills written all over it\nWas an I don't ... you mean in terms of the caravan while the ... the the vice president\nIs saying today and and again I don't know who's organizing it who's funding it I Know that you know I get the distinct feeling that there are you know the the last silence on this is very suspicious to me you know why don't they
