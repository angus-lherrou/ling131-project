line\nAnd he said she said case\nIs incredibly difficult to prove but this cases even weaker than that she said Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either a few that

or the other um Mr Speaker thirty six days is election day\nAnd I will tell you there's something I never\nEver in a lotta years now witness the anger and the level of anger that exist on behalf of the Republicans and conservatives in the base over all these tactics against Brett Kavanaugh um\nIs that enough for Republicans to win I Would I'd love to see a contract with America and promises made by these Republicans to insure people they're not wasting their vote\nYeah look I think there there are three steps here one is to communicate as you just did that this is about America\nThis is the most important midterm election in my lifetime and I think will be decisive in whether we keep going forward or we returned to this left wing fanaticism second it really is a contrast between results and resistance and whether people want to continue to create jobs\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they fall for this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to debate the details of this or that tastes when actually there's nothing to do with the details with justice itself this is a tactic\nDesigned to hold onto power when\nRon ... is an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the census is going to be re watched this has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some use some are most phrase next thing you know the leader of every show Ron dissenters as a racist you knew that was going to happen because it had to happen\nAt work right there there are in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad in Missouri by the Democratic party said oh you know be like Republicans black cross a crosses are going to be burnt on people's lawns\nOr ... well the James Byrd at I mean our war telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you in the census at all\nAnd just really outrageous claims and you know one of the things I'd like to see come out of this that what has now become a predictable tactic\nThat they get called out on this Brett Kavanaugh up until two weeks ago yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen and now all of these allegations all of these solicitations\nAnd it doesn't matter like if Michael ... is making the claim that thirty six years ago\nThat there was a gang of boys that were routinely drive\nAnd then waiting in line to gang in trail rape Sam and that this was happening with the regular cards but nobody said it at the time nobody told the teacher a law enforcement official uh parents\nThat it just kept going on and was covered up for this long but there's I Know where I go to where I went to school if one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds\nWell it's ridiculous I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive ... gang rapes in a row and never said anything to anybody and no one else does either in she on the end for them was rape herself and didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven years okay I don't have time for that actually there's a whole country\nWith all sorts of real problems to address as to why you really have to be a Republican senator since you had to take that seriously these people fall for the same gag every single time it's football\nAnd you have like the senator from Arizona's like oh really you're hearing really if there are plausible claims being made yes they should be investigated this is a guy who's had six FBI investigations into his background in space Twenty years\nRadical clearance that allowed him ... codes to the nuclear arsenal he was fat\nVetted and yet we need another on the basis of claims that have no substantially shut all remember tactical Christine for it I'm just making the obvious point she claims that this happened to him for people she says for president or for say it didn't happen\nAnd no one has the brass to ask follow up questions in the\nBook it's a joke is what's actually happening it's a joke and only the Republicans in the Senate don't know it's a\n... well this is the point I either some said they had no recollection amber of anything like that ever happening or being at any party in the case of her best friend she said well I I don't doubt what professor border saying but I don't have any recollection but also professor in Fort identified one person\nAnd that was mark judge and mark judge having been in the room when the alleged assault took place\nAnd he has said over and over again that's not true now they made statements under penalty of felony\nAnd if they so when the FBI goes back to them if they changed their story they will be admitting to committing a felony\nSo I'm not really expecting a whole lot to change here except now the Democrats are put out a statement earlier today and they are now demanding all the witnesses telling the FBI how to do their job and meanwhile when they had a chance last week to talk about this Ramirez or\nA Michael ... client they passed it and they punted and they didn't bring it up but now they want to go then to ensure that aspect and put some\nBut why we playing along with this I mean they actually\nGoing to tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra work done it was supposed to be limited in scope and uh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way\nJeff Flake is not in control the Senate they could pass it without flake and where the leaders other than ... and I hate to say is Lindsey Graham seems we only person\nWilling to tell the truth but we're the rats were the other night in Republican senators out there on television make their case not just for Brett Kavanaugh but for common sense and presumption of innocence but where are these people and\nThey they control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of the agenda pretty much that the president land on they're giving the finger to their own voters and on this one thing they can't just tell the truth why is that\nHard at whatever parade of exactly I don't understand\nWhat do you think you've been in cable news a long time you were back in the crossfire days I think even had a stint shortly at them as NBC I don't know how that worked out for you but uh I got fired yeah um well I mean I think that they are\nIt's all conspiracy all hate Trump all the time but\nI'm now you've been doing really well in the Fox news channel news shows doing really well and uh what what is the difference that you think is happening with cable news today I mean we're on the opinion side of things and Fox obviously I was a news division but\nI kind of look at what I Do is talk show host as being the entire newspaper we report news sometimes it straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions other interviews we have people give opinion\nUm we do sports we do culture pop culture\nIt's to me it's the whole newspaper all these other people claimed to be reporters and they're anything but [noise]\nWe break a lot of news on our show and we have reporters working on the show there are only job is to find new things to flushed out do interviews I mean I you know I I had been in this my whole life\nTo what my family that I don't feel insecure about you know why you're not a journalist whatever I don't care what you call me but we bring new facts to light\nEvery night and I see are dropped more than I have a car to explain what this means to really confusing time it's I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen why did Trump get elected ... who didn't get a black to grow up what actually happened and what actually happened was\nThe people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions about our culture our economy our foreign policy they never said sorry and they never learn anything and so voters got mad at punish them and good for them to why we're so that's I that's what I think my job is is to explain what gets me\nAnd I think maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right now\nNo I think in the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least for honest about it\nI totally like for example there'll be days on his radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on T. V. there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that have opinions\nAnd that's what it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism it's part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway talk\nA little bit weird that the all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed her silence\nQuiet [laughter] there you know what I mean there are less than nine Tucker there is a is a handful of us Tucker there's not that many ... and by the\nWay there's a orchestrated effort in millions of dollars being spent to shut down any anybody that dares\nTo not hold that prevailing left wing view but anyway we're putting it up on Hannity or on the website ... dot com\nThe ship a fool's how selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution Tucker Carlson is with us they show every night week nights eight PM ah preceding Hannity on Fox News channel and you're going to be against you know one of our panels tonight we look forward to have a new\nI Can't wait thank you Sean\nRight Tucker thank you Hannity dot com Amazon dot com bookstores everywhere\nAh listen I Want to remind you if you are a responsible gun owner you running out of time to claim your free lifesaving guy you're free audio book\nNow if you want the truth about what really happens when people have to God Forbid ever use a gun in self defense they're going to tell you about it it's the U.
