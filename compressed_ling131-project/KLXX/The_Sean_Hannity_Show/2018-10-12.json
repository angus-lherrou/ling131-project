that\nHe's going to vote with the Schumer wing of the party once she gets elected kind of see they don't want them even the Democrats don't want them to be Chuck Schumer democratic so all this is

I think it goes by by the way Donald Trump is saying the same thing\nIt's just the Republicans as a party have not been a sensitive to the issue as the Democrats but I I got another issue Charlotte\nThey're all saying oh hold on to Obamacare So\nWell to my way of thinking what they should say is no below sea no impeachment of cabin on no impeachment of Trump just work on issues like a compromise on immigration compromise on health care and continue choice in education\nNow let me tell you if they if they would listen to that which\nThey never will because they're not a moderate

in any way hum one race I Know this was a long shot I Know when I talk about California the sanctuary state that it is where Gavin Newsom\nThe lieutenant governor now running for governor out there wants to have\nFree health care for every body member in the state of California you got a Thirteen and a half percent state income tax I thought it was bad in New York with a ten percent state income tax\nNow that's a lot of money a lot of people's money and Gavin Newsom now wants to make universal health care available to anybody Californian non California in\nA legal illegal doesn't matter it would cost a fortune now I Know because California is so radically left wing it's kind of hard to think that a Republican to win the governorship out there but\nI kind of believe in miracles and when I saw a poll that showed it was a five point raised with John ... the other candidate running for California Governor against do some I'm thinking Well Donald Trump shocked the world why not um here a couple of the ads that John Cox is running out there in California\nI live on a\nTrafficking rather from going out with friends and family moving out of millions of Californians me or on a lot of the poverty line\nAbout change them nothing sky high gas in your water [noise] so yeah it is in charge someone\nThis election is about the status quo versus change\nMust have the courage to admit\nThat those women lead in California for so long [noise]\nGavin Newsom stands with a lobbyist and the insiders it's about time someone stands\nJohn ...\nAll right so is it possible that there could be a California miracle out there now one other addendum to this is there are a number of races house races\nEspecially in Southern California and that would be in our friend Dana Rohrabacher seed and Darryl ISIS old seat\nThese are really important seeds in as much as they could determine the the balance of power in the U.S house of representatives go anywhere from Los Angeles straight on down well frankly the whole state of California\nYou have to get out and vote for these congressional candidate each 'cause otherwise Nancy Pelosi could end up being speaker but\nIs it possible that there could be a California miracle anyway a Republican John Cox who is uh I I think if surprise so far a lot of pollsters nobody bought you get within single digits ever and one poll how'd you within five\nThanks for having me on a Sean and you're right I was listening to your earlier remarks about the Florida and everything and uh you said help is on the way that's actually our message to the people in California that Gavin\nResulted in the highest housing prices the highest gas prices water is being rationed in California you're right he's proposing new openly\nRationing the water because of the delta smelt I went out there in Denver newness his district is a great guy and if you're in the in the San Joaquin Valley I was out and I did a show from there a couple of years ago and then farmers couldn't form because they were saving the water for those little itsy bitsy fish called the delta smelt\nWell that's part of it Shawn but they haven't built a reservoir out here in Thirty years imagine California if it hadn't built a road in the last Thirty years can you imagine what the congestion would be like it's it's all horrible anyway and but they haven't built a reservoir and we built one desalination plant that\nTook Twenty years because a lawsuit and regulations and you know we've got to do more just sell nation we got to do more recycling we got a Bill Maher reservoirs that's all there is to it and but the political class you're right they don't want to do that they want to save a little tiny fish which is wonderful but we've got to live\nWell farmers got a farm and that is such a big part of the California economy I mean you're growing oranges and avocados and and all sorts of other you know strawberries and\nAnd fruits and vegetables you may not know this about me but I Lived in Santa Barbara five years of my life when I was broken and have your ... I was the poorest guy in Santa part print the time but\nAh I Love the weather out there and when I had my first orange picked up a tree which I stole a it was like a I think I've ever had in my life um let me ask you this so you have Thirteen and a half percent state income tax rate out there you are a sanctuary state not a city hall stayed\nAnd now the avenue someone's free health care for everybody's busy putting up a sign that says if you get sick come here will take care of you\nI saw that the Newt has said that all the other governors around the country are probably for for a noose of so they can send ah anybody who is ill to California\nAnd our tax payers pay a their health care you know that's ridiculous shot I mean even for months that they didn't want single payer health care but you know new so is\nBasically just offer anything free to anybody and in the process what he's doing is he's going to make California even more unaffordable than it already is a\nI think the people know that this guy mismanaged San Francisco you didn't fix the homeless problem there he's personally compromised he's a\nPretty much an empty suit he was put in business by uh uh the billionaire Getty family and I think people want somebody like myself I I struggled I built a small business I got results in the private sector a and I think that's what people are looking for\nHow come the people of California then maybe I should ask the same question to myself because we're not far behind you in New York state was nine point nine percent high the highest income tax rate why did the people of California takeoff Thirteen and a half percent\nIncome state income tax rate and and there's no rebellion out there why are they taking that crap\nIt's beyond me and a lot of people are leaving Sean as you might know California has had an exodus of people\nTo ... New York New Jersey in Illinois when everybody's saying in Texas and Florida and then the Carolinas you can come but if you're going to bring your dopey dumb liberal policies with you know stay home [laughter]\nI don't blame them I talk to Greg Abbott about that is that they are they're they're\nThey're ruining the politics of that state although I think they'll still survive lets it we've got to make sure that California is affordable that it's open for business Sean our education system is now vying with Mississippi for one of the worst education results in the\nMountain to be the best if you'd be the best you know look\nI don't know what the I don't know what your odds are I Will say this\nPeople are California pay attention because you know putting a businessman in their California is one of the most beautiful states in the union and it spills literally being destroyed from within by politicians\nAnd I hope the people of California rise up and realize that this is happening to them and the idea is Gavin Newsom of putting out there are so dumb and so it cost prohibitive that it's going to end up being a disaster for everybody and there'll be just the further mass exodus of tax dollars nobody's gonna want to be there so I Wish it around", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "12"}
