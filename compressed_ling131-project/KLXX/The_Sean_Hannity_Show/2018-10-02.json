mentioned earlier that in fact that they're not going to be good people that ever want to say yes to yeah positions like this I wouldn't say yes who wants to live through this\nWell I think the the contrast asked a question here said there's a report out today or poll out today that at the FBI supplemental background check does it change things\nSixty percent of the people leave the judge Kevin I should be on the bench so it it it that doesn't you know all I can say is it the stakes are high who would follow Kevin Oh after this they will destroy everything we stand for Republicans if we legitimize this it only happens to us why is it always just us\nThis is a time to fight back stand behind Kavanaugh\nThe votes he needs he is a great judge and destroy what I think it's been a process that will destroy the country\nI got to tell you I don't think anyone would even want to run for office under these conditions\nOr you know even for you taken a strong position I mean you've been mirrored in slandered by all the right people just so yeah people that hate me too so I don't know I don't think you'll find that I Will say that I I don't think you had a fine or moment in all the years I've known you and\nBy accusation you argue anybody can make any accusation\nAnd I believe the accusation we have no rule of law at that point throughout the whole process nobody\nAnd I have watched this process now unfold was Richard jewel Duke lacrosse Ferguson, Missouri Cambridge police or Baltimore, Maryland Trayvon and George Zimmerman everybody thinks they know\nAnd they all ended up being wrong because they rush to judgment and maybe with the FBI investigation and the the disaster is interview on NBC yesterday\nMaybe now people understand that it's falling apart and people's names character reputations families they've been bludgeoned for political\nReasons or a good friend Amy Kramer is checking in with us or Amy Hi how are you you're wonderful daughter Kiley is now joined our team here on the Sean Hannity show that you can give you the back number or did you call in and actually get\nA shot I Hope you all can handle or she's a little firecracker and\nThanks for taking care of her up there [laughter]\nShe's doing great we love and and I was wondering\nI appreciate you add all your ... and the teams that Sean I have to tell you something I never in my life expected to be on the same page with when the grants and inviting hand to one of our of that and actually we've done that this week and he's he just I mean he ... out is all last week that he not\nWell I think ... ... ... you know and that's another thing he well he doesn't have the temperament now if you if you're accused of gang rape and accused of sexual assault and you're innocent\nHow was the what is the proper way to act was he supposed to be monotone uh guys I didn't do this or just not true I mean because as his wife is crying behind him as his daughter is saying to him pray for this woman and\nIt doesn't matter what he would have done it wasn't going to be the right thing and\nI and I believe it that didn't even have to be Kavanaugh could have been anybody this is much bigger it's about them stopping the Supreme Court confirmation that's what it's all about they're willing to do anything to stop it and he's a liberal women these he kept wearing liberal women out there speaking\nLike they speak for all women they don't they absolutely do not end when the press in the media and the the leftist obsessed about women this um this cycle we're just not going to sit back and take it we're the ones\nFirst sixty ... since the Nineteen sixties women have been fighting the women were the ones that don't like the Donald Trump's women are the ones that are going to decide what happens in the Senate\nTurns and we're going to be the ones that decide what happened and twenty twenty and conservative women are kinda that together and we're pushing back on all of this and said they don't speak for us and we stand with Brett Kavanaugh I mean we're not going to back down and let and let them win this absolutely no way\nWell it's going to be up to three senators probably Jeff Flake snowflake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and then it's gonna be whether or not the whether or not I looked at said it's going to hold a vote and a big Lindsey Graham has a point\nUm we haven't really heard from Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski on the issue\nWhat is it ... the the convinces them he's not qualified for the job you know the guy admits that he drank he liked to drink drink beer still likes to drink beer sometimes drink more beer that he should have drink\nAnd then people say what he must have blacked out we know that he's a liar he's perjure right and now they want to investigate an ice throwing incident at some game you know back thirty five years ago this is how absurd this has gotten\nWell I Can't tell you what I was doing thirty six years ago but I can tell you what were the one and two days and that\nIs we're having a win for Trump or first ever conference here in Washington DC it's limited for America first hills on gloves off and women from across the country are coming together and we're going to spend three or four days together and talk about why we love this country and we're going to people that are supported the\nPresident and Brett Kavanaugh and on Thursday were taken a little trip to the U.S Capitol while the others are camped out at their most conservatives are working but we're going to take a trip and visit some of the senators and let them do how we feel about it and encourage them to vote\nAnd to support to confer Brett Kavanaugh we need to do this and I'm hoping that Mitch McConnell brings this phone on Thursday it we're having our first event Thursday night and it would be great to be able to celebrate the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh um women for Trump at our conference\nSo I Want to see what happens we'll know a lot more by the end of the week we may never know I'm I'm hearing rumors that the FBI may be very close to finishing their report\nAnd when that happens maybe it'll happen for tonight when that gets an ounce will senators will get to read it and then the cloture vote will be called and we'll have an up or down vote we'll see where people come down on this shouldn't be that difficult to read the FBI doesn't reach conclusions\nThey don't make recommendations they just say interviewed person a B C D E F G\nAnd but in every case there's no corroboration in every single case several\nCases inconsistencies and every single case is very problematic\nAnd all I'm saying is is if this is successful we will never ever get good people ever in this ... like do want to do anything publicly why should they\nSean I completely agree it's a political hits\nTo Republicans do the right thing and confirmed hand so glad to see Lindsey Graham\nStaying with the ... with the president and fight back for a change instead of playing on the terms that the Democrats et cetera and I hope that they keep up this fight and confirm Kavanaugh weekend anybody that's out there that wants to join us this weekend we'd love to have them and I just keep up the fight\nRight thank you so much for being with us we are very proud of Kiley is now part of the Sean Hannity show\nAnd she's the one that's answering everybody's calls as you're doing a great job and we appreciate her on the team as we do you backdoor busy telephones are Kathy is in Virginia Beach Virginia how are you happy glad you called\nSharm el you nice to talk to him [noise] what's going on a ... I'm very upset the way this is going on like the way the Democratic party it's been treating this judge um [noise] I feel sorry for the men the\nMen children son father that we have the fear\nThat a woman is going to be paid by to come out and say oh I was molested okay if the woman was my heart goes out to us but it was not by judge Kavanaugh\nI feel that I Know that the Democrat and the story in the system\nI Will tell you that we see it every two and four years systematically it's now when we come to expect that they want to smear slander destroy character assassinate\nAnd now they do it for anybody any thing everybody is fair game doesn't matter how young your children are doesn't matter what your that your wife is crying behind you does it matter that there's no evidence nothing matters a Pam is in Hampton, Virginia Pam how are you\n... thank you for taking my call ... points and I'll make a quick and then you can comment first on its high school records matter why getting a matter of fact if\nIt's a great point second of all the way to me he was part of the ... he was part of that wait a minute he was part of the June gang remember yes yeah the little blow remember I think we have the tape of admitting that\nYeah that and him now it's critical critical mass second of all where we're at the parents are the owner of the house or the houses I mean somebody I think that's something I just can't believe that kids were just ... in ...\nIt's very very hard to believe this part of it to me that ... ... again in the case of Julie's sweating it goes down all over the place with her story\nAnd well he was near the punch bowl so I I don't know he gave girls red solo cups that is not drugging that was the original al ... girls and gang train raping girls\nWhile he was in the hallway but I don't know if\nIt was him he was there but I don't know it was near the punch bowl whatever you call the bowl this is so serious you don't make allegations that somebody is a gang rapist and then what goes on almost every weekend you know and she went to ten of those parties\nAnd that she was aware of but\nShe didn't realize that the time why the boys were lined up in the halls\nWaiting their turn to gang rape the girls that they have drug this is what Democrats won investigated and she gave an interview and in the interview she gave multiple statements that were inconsistent", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "02"}
