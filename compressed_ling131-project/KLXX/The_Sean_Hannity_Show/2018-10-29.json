I'm Sorry to interrupt you\nShine oh it isn't saying it it is you know it it is them desperate trying to help the Democratic allies win elections\nLove which at the rabbi sad rabbi Myers said that you know he's a citizen of this country and if the president wants to come here please come on he was not objecting at all to the president's visit which I appreciate and when we start focusing on this blame game which is what we do especially the the ... media\nThat then we lose sight of what really happened to you know what really happened is as we discuss an anti Semite killed gee that was his goal those were the words that were true and spoken from him he wanted to kill Jews but we also had\nPittsburgh Police who are amazing I Love these guys I Know so many of them they went rushing towards the gunfire while everyone else of course is rushing away we had a doctor of analysts\nWho went to care for a gunshot victim and he became a victim himself rabbi Myers made every effort to save as many lives as they could and he regretted that he couldn't save more these are the real stories and this is the truth\nThese were not acts of a nation divided that's what the last ones to bleed the media wants to believe that we're a nation divided but we're not we're a nation or a community like this one like any other when we're faced with adversity when we come face to face with a madman we roll up our sleeves we face that evil with courage and the sacrifice\nYeah that's right and and Sean ... are a vice that people right now certainly uh ... thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature through our organization is thick nor the polls ignore the press ignore the pundits do your job get delivered\nOr everybody but me you know I make a living for people not ignoring Hi and thanks I Love your except it\nOkay but I think you're right though because the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman in Georgia with re elected the first Republican governor in that state in a hundred and thirty four years\nThe last helpless poll in a midterm election\nShowed him trailing by Thirteen\nKey worn by five favorite only off by a team points and particularly in a midterm election work turnout is everything it's all a matter of who does a better job of getting their voters to the polls and Sean\nI talked to a friend of mine who's helping to run independent expenditures and every target it's been in the house race in the country he told me\nKurt down to as few as twenty three hundred are undecided voters in an entire congressional district everybody's got their uniforms on everybody's blocking and tackling and everybody's going to the polls and the good news is\nWe've got the ability to identify twenty six million voters as either evangelical for pro life Catholics we have phone numbers on forty five percent of them\nWe've got an email about half of them a week we have the ability to get directly to them and we know nightly whether they voted or not and then we can follow up with more phone or email us more tax and worked or not\nWhere do you see because I'm looking at six races believe it or not in Southern California that matter for the house there's\nThose races in New York house races that could turn tip the balance of power and New Jersey can tip the balance of power and Minnesota has house races that can tip the balance of power\nBut then I say that and I'm thinking well there were four hundred and thirty five races going on a in a daze in any one of them can tip the balance of power and while you use the poles and it's somewhat helpful it's much harder to decide and get a feel for how the house is going to go\nLook right and now we really see the houses on the bubble we think it's a plus or minus five or ten feet and we think when you're dealing with\nProbably right now a hundred seats in play and probably half of those are tied again it's all about turnout and and look you remember the special election in Georgia sex when they had all stop up you know two three four five and he lost by four\nIt's all a matter of who does the best job at the ground game and the good news Sean is the power brokers and the media and no longer get to control who wins or who loses we've got the ability to communicate to voters\nDirectly on line on their cell phone at their doors wherever they work play and live and if we do our job and get our bowed out we're going to have the potential to have a shocking\nAn election night to the to the dominant media as we had two years ago\nI mean that's what I keep reminding people you can shocked the world again we can go against history nobody thought Trump would win I mean the networks were literally when I read the exit polls at five Fifteen I was doing radio at the time and and at that moment reading the exit polls Trump lost Florida he'd lost North Carolina he laws Pennsylvania\nHe lost Ohio he lost Michigan he lost Wisconsin He lost it all new id barely won the state according to the exit polls the same thing happened in two thousand and for the exit polls at five Fifteen election day show John Kerry was president so you're right and I pay attention to the polls but more importantly\nHow do you get all these people involved that they're really spending the time making phone calls getting on you know getting the boat out and sending out these emails and letters and tax what are you doing\nI I have to be honest with you Sean I I got to give credit where the creditors do first of all\nA to President Trump for providing the banner of the positions on the issues that have got these people so excited\nAnd secondly to the Democrats for during the cabinet nominations\nTrying to ... air and destroy a good man and his family and we saw a noticeable inflection point in this cycle when they try to destroy Brett Kavanaugh it's a reminder of why people turned out in sixteen and we've got thirty nine field offices and Nineteen states we have a team's operating in every state in the country\nThere overseeing walking teams that are going neighborhood to neighborhood we had a woman the other day that was verbally accosted a guy got and his car and followed her all the way down the block screaming obscenity at her or she sent me an email later and said not only am I not\nThat church she said I'm now going to walk every neighborhood in my town and knock on every door\nIt's that kind of intensity that kind of commitment to our country you know at at times\nYou know if that kind of decency and character still alive in this country the answer is a ... yeah it is it's in the heartland of the country it's at the grassroots it's alive and well\nWell I think grassroots politics works grassroots works and I think it works from the beginning one of the things though I think Obama lead the way but Trump and the Republicans did some catch up and we saw the benefit of their working twenty sixteen and that is the use of social media I don't think anybody has more powerful platform on social media than President Trump\nI think that's right I think ah you know\nA rock Obama was the first social media Internet president in the same way that FDR was the first radio president in the same way that John F. Kennedy was the first president to master television but if Obama was the pioneer I assure you Trump has mastered it or not only in his use of social media\nPlatform but also the thing is that his campaign ... dead in twenty sixteen\nTo catch up with what the Obama campaign did and we for example a Sean when we took our Christian voter file and matched it up against social media platforms\nSeventy two percent of the voters were seeking to contact or on Twitter or Facebook or another social media platform and we're broadcasting out\nThirty two million videos get out the vote messages and other targeted messages directly to those people and again I Want to stress the minute they vote they get dropped out of the turnout universe and all the videos we've been pushing to their social media count then begin to go elsewhere\nSo I agree look anything's possible I ... I don't take things for granted\nI'm I was one of the few that really believe that Donald Trump could when I saw something happening but it was I was out on the road I also see it happening this time anecdotally you know I can see it in ratings every single night it's a you know Fox is audiences enthusiastic\n'em and you can see CNN fake news and and that mess that they're just desperate then they'd like not doing well they seem almost the audience seems depressed but\nThere are three virtual outcomes here one is we shocked the world Republicans picked up Senate seats hold the house that would be the best case scenario then there's the split us Asian where Republican seats in the Senate but below sea become speaker and then there's a worst case scenario you wake up\nYou know ten nine days from now and you find out as speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Schumer and\nIt's really up to the people which decision which outcome they want because we'll get the government we deserve you stay home well that's a half of Oprah below sea and Schumer if you don't vote for the Republican you're basically voting for below sea and Schumer\nYeah and I and I really believe showing that the intensity gap in the enthusiasm gap that\nWants to separate the two sides has closed significantly since the Kavanaugh nomination\nYou know you see different polls would Democrats with a high enthusiasm maybe Seventy two percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight to Seventy percent but anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out there that I saw in twenty sixteen I was in Des Moines Iowa last week at an event with\nThe vice president we have a very strong organization out there we have over a hundred and fifty people walking door to door just in Des Moines neighborhoods and this one gentleman who was volunteering told me he was at the president's rally the previous\nA friday and Cedar Rapids they filled an arena\nThere were over two thousand people who couldn't get in they stood in the driving range for two hours and watch it on a jumbo Tron\nThey stayed there to show their support you simply cannot quantity of quantify that with a poll or within analysis it's an intangible it's out there and it's real\nQuick break we'll come back more with Ralph Reed founder chairman faith and Freedom Coalition might cybersecurity some things you need to know cyber security that's the protection of networks devices and programs from cyber attacks\nCybersecurity some things you need to know cyber security that's the protection of networks devices and programs from cyber attacks that are designed to access or destroy sensitive data or extort money from businesses and people strong cyber security has layers of protection spread across computers networks programs\nAnd realize not only ON Technology but also making smart choices\nLike keeping software updated and staying informed on cyber safety out consumers also need cyber security to protect their digital lives in today's connected world it just takes one weak link criminals get in a thank goodness there's the all new light block identity theft protection with the added power Norton Security or that protects\nYou against threats to your identity or devices that you can't see or fix on your own out new life lock with Norton Security\nWell you can get it now like block dot com you need it in this day and age protect your name your reputation your finances life lock dot com one eight hundred lifelong promo code Hannity or get an extra ten percent off your first year for a limited time may twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with your annual enrollment as life lock dot com one eight hundred life lock\nRecreated the films they saw on TV with the brothers are notorious for being scripts stickler most of their films line from mine are exactly as they are on screen as they are on the script\nSome of the actors most frequently casting their films are ...

right now and we're going to some some people in November six\nI noticed that former New York city Mayor Bloomberg is you know putting tens of millions of dollars apparently into a lot of these house races are you seeing the effects of his money and others\nI'm not seeing Bloomberg's money in in this race but I'll tell you one thing closest Pakistan a million dollars on hitting me right here in my home district ... million dollar San Francisco money being spent right here in the ... value in Pennsylvania attacking me\nBy the way I say this to everybody I said they're foreign or thirty five members running for Congress and if you vote for any Democrat make no mistake about it you're voting for ... they're just not saying that they're not saying it but that's the absolute truth\nWhat are the polls latest numbers show uh in the district\nTwo points back or the latest poll shows that were to back to back well within the margin of error and we're and we're gaining momentum uh we we debate at several times I made an average debate she will not to agree to any additional debates recall her actually listen to this we caught her in the debates talking about supporting open borders then she correct\nSouthern border twice she said that in the last debate which completely makes sense because during the primary she was running on a ballot eyes open borders but now we're getting the general election they're trying to pivot and we're going to and we're going to expose her for what she really is\nWell this is really important race a now Marty no Stein is running for the seventh district of Pennsylvania this Lehigh Valley district\nLehigh Valley county in Pennsylvania\nA it's a dead even race it's all going to come down a turnout Democrats are spending a fortune Republicans sadly of not spent as much and they should be meeting these guys dollar for dollar but I Hope people in the seventh district I Know we have a lot of listeners there are paying attention and and get out and vote early voting goes on in Pennsylvania right so people can vote soon\nYes and then we're seeing and talking to our election boards you know there's so many presidential election is what they've told me what the amount of absentee ballot requests and what is being turned did so people are really really engage the really engaged\nAnd he's getting any feedback as to you know what's coming back Republican versus Democrat\nI haven't been getting any any feedback but I can just tell you that people who have been meeting and the people who aren't going to be here to vote have been asking for absentee ballots and they're making sure they're getting their votes in I have a good sense that there's going to be a lot of people showing up to the polls and to be alive and there's going to be a lot of people supporting Trump's agenda [noise]\nYou know we're in the middle of the great American come back the last two years have given a lot of people hoping this country's\nMore jobs lower taxes safer communities or do they want to uh uh have Nancy Pelosi take charge and have more welfare higher taxes open borders and sanctuary cities the voters are smarter than that Sean they want cops they went freedom liberty than when opportunity that's what we want that's what we have and we must continue it\nOnly wish you the best Marty all the best of and I know you'll bring that great training as an athlete to the hard work you do for the seventh district of Pennsylvania and Lehigh County uh we'll be following the race ... a week from tomorrow and uh I Hope you're able to sneak this out\nYes sir thank you thank you for having me on the show\nEight hundred nine four one ... listen you gotta understand this is now how close it is it's all coming down to get getting out the vote\nIt's one point here two points there it makes all the difference\nThere are enough people in his audience that if everybody just made a commitment wherever you live\nOn six hundred stations now and you made a decision that you're going to get out and you're going to vote and you're not going to stay home and you're going to put any effort and you're not going to give half of ... to ... below zero half a vote to Schumer it could be you know shock\nThe world again kind of night ... stay home than it's you know maybe we split split the baby in the sense that you know it's okay we ... we saved the Senate and get extra seats there but we lose the house it'd be a lot easier and better for\nThe country if you want to continue progress to win both houses as of today eight days out I can see any\nOne of those scenarios unfolding any one of them All right let's go to our busy telephones ah let's say Hi to Katherine is in palm bay Florida next on the Sean Hannity show\nHey Sean I Can't I'm telling you enough how much my husband and I just absolutely I think you are the greatest not because of just what you inform us that's the cause of your courage\nAnd we want to harm hearts and prayers\nGo out to the people in Pittsburgh it is devastating I Can't believe Americans have forgotten the history and the genocide that went on during ... during the Holocaust I don't understand it but with that sad our hearts and prayers are with them I have a point to make about courage\nAnd by the way you are right up there with President Trump\nAnd his entire family and those that stand by and I want the conservatives in this country to take part in some shared risk and stand up not in a violent way not in the vulgar way but maintain your credibility by being several um\nRisk and stand up not in a violent way not in the vulgar way but maintain your credibility like the civil and stand up to all these bullies\nAnd oppression and and the violence and the hatred that they're stealing and the lie said telling about our gear presidents I'm comparing him to Hitler and style and which are just\nAtrocities I Can't stand to listen to but the problem is that a lot of a lot of very frightened people I think President Trump as the most famous whistle blower in the nation because he's he's taken the curtain back and all the corruption in Washington and then something\nI'm I'm a whistle blower myself unemployed nurse practitioner of laughter caught a surgeon five years ago and I'm Still fighting today that's that's fine but I just want to say if if the conservatives have some shared risk and still together and consolidated\nGot to let me tell you why we are now I mean we're now at a point where there's a there's a group of so called conservatives never Trump or conservatives again that they're just angry they've been so wrong Ben Sasse was one of the bill Kristol is another one of them Jennifer Rubin another one of them\nYou know that if there's if Trump cured cancer they would be mad because oh he was Donald Trump that did it you know doesn't matter that he transformed the economy all things that they say that they use conservatives would ever want in terms of ... tax cuts deregulation\nA energy independence a peace through strength trust but verify securing America's borders all the things that doesn't they hated all because Trump is doing that which they advocated for but they wanted somebody to do it in a way that that that's set everything the way they wanted to say it but\nThe problem is the old establishment way of doing things gets nothing done you know I agree he can be incendiary he breaks things he throws dishes and breaks them in Washington and he exposes the swamp but he fights hard\nBut we're getting the results in the benefit of that hard fight you know they're they're the type of Republicans that basically want to just sit in power in the corner and and act like they can be friends with people that are saying publicly to kick you and that don't want to be civil\nThat are running you out of restaurants and screaming at the top of their lungs at you so I you know it's it is what it is I the only thing I really want at this point I Want results\nI Want the forgotten men and women to be taken care of I Want as much prosperity as we could ever create for every American and I want to take care of Americans first and then we'll work on helping the rest of the world develop the same system in paradigm that we built that\nHas benefited our population and then I Want security or in a world full of radical Islam is and people that that want to wipe America off the map and chant death to America\nI Want to make sure that we have the meanest toughest bad US military and we can handle any threat to the world throws at us and we can do if necessary we can protect the world against evil\nWhen evil you know raises its ugly head but there's it's happened before and it's going to happen again history has proven in the meanwhile it's you know basically you know temper tantrum politics\nOf never Trump or is there there's still mad they got it wrong and we wouldn't have to Supreme Court justices that are conservative\nHad they had their way we wouldn't have had the tax cuts we will not have the regulations to roll back\nWe wouldn't have America on a path towards energy independence\nWe wouldn't have had you know all the record numbers of jobs we currently have or the big GDP Growth we have or consumer confidence that we have that's why in eight days when people go out and vote this all matters a major question people have to ask is or you're better off than you were two years ago in terms of the ...\nDisparity Dr elections and if you want this prosperity this growth to continue if you want America to remain the leader on the world stage if you're not afraid to have a president that is willing to be a tough negotiator on your behalf\nBe a trade or NATO or Kim Jong un we didn't give anything that Kim Jong un nothing and look at what we've gotten back a shot at peace and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula you know if\nYou want a president that says he's going to respect our constitution the rule of law are our laws on borders and security and respect our sovereignty first", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "29"}
