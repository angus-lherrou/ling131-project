I consider myself a liberal and my whole adult life I considered myself so I was a Democratic Party voter I always voted Democrat [noise]\nUm and that was true even in two thousand sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and I was one of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all that\nI was sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and I was one of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the media has\nBeen telling me for months and months at a Donald Trump didn't have more than a three percent chance of winning and they also had been telling me for months and months that he was a racist in a big ... and ... and a monster and basically the second coming of Hitler and that his followers or no better and you know they I think that the liberal media did\nFor me as they did for millions of others are very effective job scaring people really making people believe the stories in this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media\nRanting you know screaming sometimes crying you know saying you know I'll never understand how people can vote for for this monster and on one particular day I had posted about um you know I\nI'll never be able to understand how people could vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd and mocked her reporters disability and it was on that day in January of two thousand Seventeen but somebody\nReached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen\nI'm just asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled\nDebunking the Trump mocked the disabled reporter and for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back\nTen years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter but what's clear when you watch this compilation\nHis that this is a a voice in a bit that Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who was caught in a lie or doing something shady or grumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid now Sean but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really\nRealized that the media was capable of creating a completely false narrative and then isolating a moment out of contact to push that narrative it had nothing to do is news or the truth\nBrand that let me ask you something now once your eyes are open and once you become aware of their bias and it's like you you you ask yourself I mean I've been experienced as myself and it's even worse than has ever been how did you not see it before you ever say that to yourself\n... yeah yeah it's absolutely the kind of thing that once you see it you can't see it and what you just said is actually kind of the next\nPart of the story because then I went back to the beginning of the campaign and revisited all of those other moments like Trump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women you know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same thing time and again that's not what happened that is not what happened\nBut they made a decision after he won that primary or it was clear that he was going to win the Republican primary that it wasn't funny anymore that he was running suddenly it was scary and that they had to turn this man into the the scariest candidate that the world had ever seen so\nMe ask you this when I when I tell my audience\nTo expect and I showed a lot of the ads that are out last night and I've been I've been showing these instances people that are in the public eye that are conservative more support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants and I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I'd be giving your best shot\nYou know I noticed that it either happens to a guy with his wife or or an older person or women\nYou know what when they're a bunch of cowards the when they do that because I'd never treat anybody that way but you know this is the narrative every two and four years in elections in America that Republicans are racist or sexist massage in is that there\nAre homophobic dino phobic Islamophobia that they weren't dirty air and water Obama use those actual words that they want children to die and they'll have some commercial with the poll\nThat they weren't dirty air and water Obama use those actual words\nThat they want children to die\nAnd they'll have some commercial with the Paul Ryan look alike throwing granny over the cliff because they want to kill your grandmother that's what they do that to their play book we're watching it unfold today even Thirteen Days out of the election um do you see now that all of that is not true there's not one thing\nThat's true about that look look at the statistics for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nUm the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded for these demographics ever\nYeah no absolutely seeing that now in fact I think a lot of others are starting to see it as well which is resulting in what you just said that even I think the most\nAh these minority groups in particular that I think the Democratic party for so long has taken for granted that this oh these are just automatic vote well that's not the case anymore I mean people really are starting to wake up and they're starting to walk away because they're seen so called\nI'm at and how many people have joined your movement\nSo the movement began on Facebook and in that are rich in that first initial Facebook group we now have over two hundred and five thousand poverty impressive showing me there ... all social media platforms we have about four hundred thousand it to be clear for anyone who doesn't know this is a testimonial campaign\nSo these are just people who are going on social media and clicking follower clicking like they are telling their stories about why they are walking away so I mean they're they're making videos they're writing these stories down I mean people are there is this is forming like a network of support and people are leaving are walking away from the left\nOf the uh let me bring and buzz Patterson as we've been around the block a time or to a new around the Clintons a lot a Hillary ... we can't be civil with with people we disagree with us I'm like okay you know if you don't want to be\nYou know I ran into what's that ... the senator from that

this behavior I don't it's not affect him I said if you like to come on my show one day here's my number that's it why are people acting in a way\nYeah well you know my story Shaun I I I went up to
