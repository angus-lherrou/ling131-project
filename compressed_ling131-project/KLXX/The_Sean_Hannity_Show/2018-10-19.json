of the house I think the Democrats will get twenty six twenty seven seats will take control\nAnd then disseminating it with a media strategy to make it look like something happened that didn't and after that you know two years of investigation they want to destroy people they disagree with that is the modern left today\nI don't want to destroy anybody I don't want to boycott anybody\nI don't want people you know I Want pizza everybody has a choice I Can't make people watch Hannity or listen to this radio show I Do the best programs I can and and people have all the power but that's not enough of these groups\nKnown as they can't when they can't they can't win on the electoral basis we saw that with Donald Trump defeating Hillary Clinton that was the last straw for the George Soros is in the far left\nThe media matters all of these people once they went down in the presidential election that all of them thought they were going to win because they had the media in their pocket and still do then they said you know what we got to abandon um the free market place we are now going assassinate people\nAnd this is very similar what happened in Germany and bringing it back to the\nBy the way of saying that you know it's funny I saw some press you're not saying that they that that people today are like not the killing people what you're saying is that there are similar lying propaganda miss some nation demonization very different from saying that they're a death camps\nYeah I mean there's just look that can't happen in America thank God because our structure\nIs still in place to prevent anything like that happening\nBut I'll tell you what antifa no different than the essay George Soros behind the scenes with tens of millions of dollars alright funneling into agencies that are bent on destroying human beings and we talked about this\nOthers alright funneling into\nAgencies that are bent on destroying human beings and we talked about this last time I was on a program what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nEvery American should pay attention to that because of that guy can go down on uncorroborated are uncorroborated than anybody in this country can\nAnd as you rightly pointed out they tried it with Trump on Russian collusion that's collapsing all over the place the fusion GPS guy put out a dicey a ... taking the Fifth Amendment now won't testify what does that tell you okay so\nYou know we're living in a dangerous time\nLet's let me turn it into this you're I'm agreeing with you that that what really got exposed to me that scares me a lot and there's two things one is we ever do justice system we don't have equal justice\nOr equal application of our laws these be looking at Hillary Clinton she ... the biggest obstruction of justice slam dunk case ever\nPut the problem here is we had one party literally before the American people you mentioned Kavanaugh\nAbandon all principle constitutional law and the and and literally core values that have served those so well which are due process the presumption of innocence the Republicans for the first time in their life that something right\nThey handled it with the seriousness the topic deserves\nThey were thorough they did it right\nAnd at the end of the day there was no corroboration to the allegations being made\nAnd now we see people like what Eric Holder kick them we can't be civil Hillary Clinton getting their face Cory Booker or Maxine Waters you see these cabinet people you get a crowd\nAnd you follow them into a grocery stores department stores gas stations and you tell them we don't want them nowhere anymore that's what she said no where\nElse they want to use its amusing that you ran down the list than we are we could add ten more and then Trump goes to Montana and makes a joke a joke about the Republican candidate for Senate they're um slam dunk ... reporter [laughter] you know\nAnd it was obviously said ingest and no press goes why all crazy yet all the things that you pointed out are somehow over law\nAnd not overlook they they well they do not Harris yeah well because now they're in concert there the the American media is in concert\nWith the Democratic party and that's I don't think that's ever happened before in this republic\nWhere the the eighty percent of the media now is promoting a political party so it's going to be fascinating to see the backlash in the election coming up in November I Do believe there will be one I don't know the extent of it\nI don't think anybody does anything anyone that says they know it doesn't no I don't think a lot of people saw what happened on twenty six day now I said it's absolutely possible that Donald Trump is gonna win then ... then the the five\nDays of on the factor five days before he was going to win because people didn't like Hillary Clinton and they're even going to stay home or vote against her and not to exactly what happened but I Want to I just want to reinforce just because I Know you can't say it on your TV and radio show but what\nYou're going to you saying then they're going to attribute it to me and then I got an ally and had a lot so rightly say the stuff he won't good all\nRight you have no idea what I'm going to talk about it because nobody ever does and nobody tells\nYou I don't even think of you or me either no what we're going to save a court before comes

should never happen in a free society\nNever been out of this ... you're not the only one to talk about it right you know you have to have you done this on her right\nOn and the conservative commentators are all in danger\nAnd and this is you know to me I'm I'm saying to myself just got to be exposed number one and it's got to stop number two and you can have people telling a emotionally disturbed individuals hey surround them when they're in a restaurant\nI mean that should be marching orders should be investigated by the ethics committee or the house just for saying that\nThey'll we're seeing now and two major cities many riots break out\nWe have to politicians Republican candidates in Minnesota had been punch the guy was whole concept in a restaurant got hit from behind\nAnd

injured it's it's weird that close now it's like a tipping point you can see it on the horizon I\nDon't I don't want it to happen by the way and I will say that any conservative keep your hands in your pocket and just because you disagree with somebody be respectful were let go and tell you that don't do it\nDon't go down at a level well we've already had the shooting at the softball field

grocery store I go to the local grocery store I go to the local pharmacy or I go to the local gas stations whenever I can\nI I I Want and by the way I don't ask if you're a Republican or Democrat I I

that's just a an attack on my community and\nIt's a it's a statement as to what what she thinks about the all of us and\nUh and she had already actually pay taxes in our local community it's unbelievable\nNo she's not here for that she's here to take power and that's all she wants\nLet me tell everybody ... if you cannot hold a business owner hostage to vote these are my way or I'm not going to\nAnd somebody has a radical view very extreme that might be a circumstance where you just say I'm just not that those values are so\nAntithetical to my own personal values I'm not I'm not
