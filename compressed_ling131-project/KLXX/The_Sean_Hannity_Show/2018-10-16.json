I Would think a fairly smart guy right\nAnd and to listen to that story and say I'm going to go to that\nWith this I'm going to say that a girl who was two three years removed from high school\nRepeatedly he went back to parties were gang rapes were going on she knew they were going on and she's still kept going back and oh I won't be able to actually find anybody that can corroborate the story at least no one can independently find anybody\nThat was list I think NBC was saying yeah we tried to find the people that Julie sweating except we're out those parties one's dead or to wouldn't returned our calls at one didn't know who truly sweating to watch\nSaving the coal industry those are saving jobs so you know the ... look it's I'm I'm just telling everybody three weeks from tonight you're going to turn\nOn your TV set and you're going to watch the coverage and you're either going to be you know maybe maybe it'll be a mixed bag maybe the Republicans gained a couple of seats in the Senate when maybe they lose the house you lose the house\nThen all you're gonna see for two years is never ending non stop obsessive compulsive Trump paint and investigations and possible impeachment\nThat's the agenda that's it there's nothing to improve the lives of the American people months you know there was a lot of states\nThis is the Democrats rely on people of low information they rely on propaganda and putting things out there and can be and that's the way it is\nWell let me tell you what it is they they got one play book they're the party of smear slander mismanagement racist sexist massage ... phobic homophobic Islamophobia dirty air water kill children skill grandma it's the same playbook\nIt's never changed on Thirty years in radio it's never gonna change when they did get power for eight years with Obama you saw what they did with it it didn't improve the lives of anybody it left many Americans behind the worse the comedy in modern times was Brock\nObama's so\nThey do I do some easing that they don't want to talk about well on the tax cuts I'm working now they want the crumbs back and do well healthcare never worked out for any\nI mean it's just ... but are there focuses to hate Trump investigate Trump nonstop\nAll right um but I got on the other side I'll be blunt [noise] you know if three weeks from tomorrow it come on the air and say well\nYou know we're going to be stuck with dancing policy you didn't get out\nYou didn't vote you know we'll we'll survive it will fight we're not going to stop that it would be so\nMuch better and so much easier for all of us and especially the forgotten men and women they just getting a foothold now in terms of jobs and opportunities for themselves and their families and that is going to be you know a battle\nEvery day non-stop accusations non stop fighting [noise] we've had that for two years since Trump for president that's supposedly coming to an end\nBut we'll just pick up and we'll fight back that's what we do you don't give up you know given you just stay on it you know you have to win these political battles matter\nYou'd get the government ultimately you deserve America deserves better than what the Democratic Party is offering but that's going to be up to you [noise] my vote here in New York was meaningless in this whole case this is not going to help\nI Can't help you in this election um except tell you the truth and were telling you the truth\nAnd I'm saying all of these races are infinitely winnable right now there's been there's been a change Democrats have overreached they've they miscalculated and the American people are good fair minded people\nThey're figuring this out pretty quick they watched the judge Kavanaugh they see these mobs they hear these you know these incitement this\nThese marching orders if you will by radicals that are Congress men and women and senators [noise] All right let's get to Don and Detroit's Boyd John James is like the greatest candidate he doesn't\nHe's doing better in the polls he's down in single digits I Wish the people of Michigan gets the outbreak this guy is he'd be he's that's a long shot for us but while he'd be amazing\nBut it was a long shot for a show and thanks for taking my call but I probably had but it only campaign let them take your enthusiasm away this man deserves a\nVote no no not at all where we're going to the this'll\nBe one of my first campaign rallies percentage or for a Senate um killed it a long time it's going to a kid rock there is going to have 'em Donald Trump junior and Kimberly guilt foil there tomorrow night is that currently tomorrow night where I live on the Michigan from six tonight I I don't remember exactly\nThe venue but people can look it up at John Jay Senate dot com\nLet me tell you something that this man is beyond impressive he is these are leaders\nIn the army at the same at the same time as him and he provided air cover for me I was a flight medic provided a lot of air cover for me when I was there is an awesome awesome awesome man yeah well\nI you know I look at his background and his experience and he just uh you know some people just have it whatever it is they have it they own it and um I I just think he's a natural leader and I hope that people millions pay attention to\nSort of wiser Kevin McCarthy and Paul Ryan a couple of weeks ago came out they dangle this carrot front of us and they've done it every year every two years the thing was carried out in front of us\nCalled the ... border security and that they'll fund the entire wall\nRight only if they win and two thousand Eighteen we had a fight where we were bloodied whenever we attended a Trump rally we were bloodied up and the reason Donald Trump was elected in one of the big reasons was because he was going to build the wall [noise] the reason he won the election was because he said he was going to build\nA wall the reason we maintain the majority in Congress for the past eight years and especially in two thousand sixteen was because there were ...\nAnd when Kevin McCarthy came out who I have a lot of respect for came out a couple of weeks ago and they will that carrot in front of the voters faces\nI was screaming at my TV saying you've had the opportunity to\nPresent Donald Trump but no less than three spending bills and neither of those bills get it had any appropriations for a border wall right you had the majority in Congress for eight years he won an election to the sixteenth for building a border wall [noise]\nThey they act like they're losers they don't know how to they don't know how to act like they do but he's been more critical than me I mean I I Know\nI have news the adjectives spineless got was needing a backup bone hey look at this point it's too important we've actually gotten a real lot done the president\nWhat he's done in terms of ISIS degrading and and feeding them at a level nobody anticipated\nNorth Korea everybody thought we were headed for a real tragedy there and you know which sole thirty million people their lives at risk no more rockets being fired over Japan were not dropping pallets of cash cargo planes of cash and other currency to Iranian mall as\nA as we see what's happened on the economic front for point two percent GDP we've we've watched then economy go from losing jobs to creating four million plus jobs at this time eight million fewer Americans in poverty and on food stamps\nI'm we see the pipelines are being built an war is opened up\nUm we spent three billion three and a half billion on the new wall we need the full funding you're right the twenty five million a but we're making the progress to original is on the Supreme Court break judges on the lower courts and I I just see in America that's transforming before our\nEyes based on every measure consumer confidence everything in between\nUh yeah I Wish they would have worked faster they would have kept their promises better there's still a lot of work to do but the alternative is nonexistent there is no alternative if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for Nancy Pelosi in the house vote for Democrats for the Senate you're voting for Chuck Schumer\nAnd that's it if you you know you save the house and Senate we can get a lot done we get these additional seats in Indiana North Dakota Montana if we you know hold in Nevada and we pick up with\nMartha mix Sally in Arizona I mean and we Claire McCaskill get sent packing and Rick Scott wins in Florida it would be amazing holding the house\nIs key if it even if you don't particularly love your Republican congressmen it's not going to be an impeachment\nInvestigation vote that the Democrat is offering you [noise] so for that reason alone I mean it's important to me will survive but I'm not saying we wouldn't not going to come on here the day after election day whining complain I'm going to just take my hills in and do what I always do after elections\nAnd fight for what I Believe in what we see so much easier if we just did it on election day anyway I appreciate your call 'em data is in Oklahoma Dana Hi how are you\nSaying well San thank you so much for taking my call in how you doing\nI'm good what's going on with you [noise]\nUm I prefer from the other time and I listen to the states the truth I listen to the Democrats\nAnd it's just such as that petty and\nThey are just south south I'm power hungry it's because they don't want that trait is failing honesty they don't want one nation under God which is a certain amount God and and it's just [noise] and that's just how I had just wish everyone was required to listen\nThe car required reading that Hannity four hours a day and actually it might be used as a punishment for some and you know in jail um mainly but Hannity on a loop\n[laughter]\nSo anyway I think it had to think like I said listen I don't have the microphone\nBut for you Dana and people around the country I don't have\nA TV camera in front of me every night but for you I'm just telling everybody we can win\nI Am saying it is with in its with in the realm\nOf possibilities that we could win and shocked the world again but it's going to take every effort of every single person hearing my voice now and then some and that means you getting others engaged to vote and explaining what the consequences are
