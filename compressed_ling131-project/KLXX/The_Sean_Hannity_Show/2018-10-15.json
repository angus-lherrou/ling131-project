state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia immediately\nTo discuss what's been going on here and it gets almost more bizarre by the second now the allegation has banned that the Saudi ... crown prince ordered the killing of this guy Jamal ... now he's a Saudi national who's been critical of the Saudi royal families Washington Post contributor\nAnd he's a U.S resident but he's not a citizen he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day\nThe Turkish government had suggested that ... was killed by a Fifteen members Saudi hitting team who then dismembered his body and smuggled out and\nOf the consulate in pieces to an unknown destination but so far the evidence supporting that up to today has been hero some reports claiming that show these murder was recorded but did they know audiotape know videotape\nNot even the Turkish government which is no great friend of America is currently feuding with Saudi Arabia over other issues saying an absolute saying it's absolutely short because show he was killed by anyone that can't say it let alone the Saudis now there's just began to break moments ago\nAnd are reports of now surface that Saudi Arabia is preparing a report in which in fact they will admit Jamal cause show ... this is the Washington Post columnist now this is a very dangerous we start seeing journalists killed\nWent missing earlier this month was killed by interrogation gone wrong um when he entered the I guess the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nRight here to talk about it we have Morgan Ortega's is with us national security global affairs animal is former U.S treasury attached Shay to Saudi Arabia lived in Saudi Arabia two years\nOr she along with ... former Secret Service agent author as well as the now best selling book a Spygate thank you both for being with us um Oregon you lived in Saudi Arabia two years this just breaking there's been a mystery up until like an hour ago what do you think\nHe I guess I Lived there for ... that I hesitated something like this ... and the reason I get it because when the president said this morning that he's sending secretary I'm here to Saudi Arabia that made the secretary of state when they see these people in the world\nCertainly in the government has canceled all plans to find halfway around the world\nUm I I Do is incredibly serious than\nAh we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with whatever it is so if they're particularly believed and we're still going to have to because if if the records out there and what comes out or is that the Saudis are claiming some sort of responsibility for this looks like they're not going to get there\nBut that people are in charge of it in order to be held accountable there's a lot\nTo how was your ... there's no until now because it shows how would they not know until now or what had happened in their consulate in Istanbul\n[laughter] that's a fantastic question and I think the big takeaway that I heard from this report we'll see what happens with secretary hunt pay me to them and let the readout as it is not only need to to come clean on this and and satisfy President Trump the secretary pail you know they have an audience and and the Congress and the Senate that they're also accountable to\nMind you this massive arms deal is a memorandum of understanding it has not been signed by the president says bipartisan consensus for sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually the very vocally among supportive of the relationship I don't agree with Senator Paul for a number of reasons that I could go into\nWhy I think the relationship it is important that the Saudis need to understand how serious that says\nWe need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to see massive\nA movement away from their big finance form it's just a few weeks secretary Mnuchin says to be there we saw the Dow selling off this afternoon as reports\nAnd they were a threat to the right thing to think here yeah well they were threatening you know see maybe even using the power of their oil of impact any\nOf the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S then bonds you know I mean is getting more bizarre by the men and how to somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again [noise]\nYeah that that's highly unlikely show they were really to aggravating factors year one year already brought up the fact that this happened\nI'm In a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single a protocol moral ethical role imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well I mean aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media and I think this has ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm just suggesting that this makes it even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual our cars so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in the diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nIt's highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's the side that said wait back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now\nBut we do need the Saudis there's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis ... the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them where honor razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I do think Trump get one more thing though show I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they seemingly\nTried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond\nYou know we were this had to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move yeah\nTo yeah just to say that the thing that not only the threats that worried me that Dan just said\nIt seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they lied to the president on this you know the president came out and said that they came and ... among the crown prince that called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale unless there's something that we don't know about it look like they have like the president and I think that they need to there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nI think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and so we didn't know but I mean I I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have\nCameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia on the air

diamond and so we love you good luck can you prevent\nMore things that you're going to happen\nAlways you're always welcome a much gets busy phones will go to Atlanta I Will say Hi to I'm All right let's go to our phones we had a Robert is in a king North Carolina Robert Hi how are you glad you called sir\nA very very very honored to speak with you a day but I Do need your help um I have a daughter twenty to a lesser she didn't vote for Trump She\nAre pretty much one against the grain of everything he used on ah luckily have been able to get her to see the good and everything that Trump has done for this country\nWhere I'm having my problem is with judge Kavanaugh um she just I Can't get her to see the conservative side of it how the Democrats are going to\n... miles anybody call anybody four to five miles you know our values and I can't\nOver there I mean we spend a lot of time going over all the allegations and in the case of professor Ford or miss Romero's or miss what they get that cetera I mean in every particular case and\nI Would just lay out to your daughter and then go over you know what the allegations were how they came out where's any corroboration in any of the cases I mean I\nThought the most outrageous one was\nOver you know what the allegations were how they came out whereas any corroboration in any of the cases I mean I thought the most outrageous one was the final one to get by miss sweating egg you was claiming and her story shifted and changed dramatically within the course of a week from my perspective\nAnd I think you know she was basically claiming almost on a weekend basis that these kids were drugging these young girls teenage girls and boys will wind up in the halls and they were waiting their turn to gang rape the girls\nNow I'd rather be hard pressed to you know again that the media looked high or low why didn't far\nTo find any cooperation and they weren't able to the case of Mr Ford the one I witnessed she placed in the room so that didn't happen\nOr even are best friends says she doesn't remember any party that she was with judge Kavanaugh so you do need some type of corroboration if you believe in due process and presumption of innocence and I think we I think the Republicans handled it\nWith the sensitivity deserves with the severity it deserves considering the severity of the allegations\nBut I'm not a person that Russia's to judgment on ... you have to I Believe that it served this country well to follow the rule of law and due process and a presumption of innocence and I think that happened in this case and I think the person that laid out the best case and that was what Susan Collins\nAnyway thank you Robert good luck with that um let me play you know twenty two days I just want to remind you we now know I was telling your earlier in the program today Democrats or advice don't talk about open borders and and the limit any ice anymore it's not helping us don't talk about\nImpeachment is not helping us even Maxine Waters admitting that they're telling you don't talk about these things\nYou know but remember this will be their agenda in twenty two days they will want endless investigations they will want impeachment they want to open borders they want to eliminate ice they won Obamacare they want their crumbs back and this woman Nancy\nPelosi would be your speaker so pretty much if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for Nancy Pelosi and her views and her values\nWhich are radical San Francisco views and values listen\nI have a cat did what I mean African ... we have to pass the bill says that you can find out what is in ... in\nTerms of the sun is setting ... versus the problems that they aren't getting too far fetched to ... petition or even like so pathetic clean\nOut again and ... and then we have and the thing that I think the issue of citizenship is not just about these young people which would be just enough\nFor that other undocumented ... on a in a sense in our country was under contention impatient reform should in my view the on the path of long term ... earned pop\nEarned ...\nI'd rather have a standing before the recess\nFor the rest of the total ...\nAfter ... ...\nPeople at the ... century city settlements playground and\nWith the current president but it's\nGoing to say it's getting them some stock and then in the ... and slippery slope certainly hope sell\nIt said that he would like to Institute a single payer health care program and cancel raise taxes I think they mean roll back the tax cuts that they pass the fear is that what do you think of that one that's in part that is accurate [laughter]\nCentury city\nThat's that they've passed the fear is that what do you think of that went in part to inaccurate [laughter]\nCentury city my health law enforcement how how their\nFamily things I think our country when you click here who are working hard and military who are in school [noise] who are\nKind of asking the check I Do\nThink that if there's ever going to be an opportunity to raise the gas tax return ... gas prices are so low oil prices are so low it was time to do it I I I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings opponents of the country maybe there will be\nI think one of the jobs of the\nWay can do\nSigning some stand\nIn the constitution does not say that a person can ...\nAnd it's ... theater\nThat was thinking more of a picture of it stopped the night of the things that came out at night like a vampire a hair cat still every aspect is ...\nSo that's what's at stake in twenty two days just like in the Senate if you're in Montana and North Dakota\nIndiana Missouri is here in Arizona and Nevada or Florida well you if you vote for the Democrat you're voting basically for Chuck Schumer because that's who they are going to vote with that's that's who they will be\nThat sold there'll be listening to that ... they will be aligning themselves with that so they will be voting for for their leader and we already we've had eight years of this and the fact that we're our memories or that short it's frightening at times to me\nAll right back to our busy phones as we say Hi to skip is in Utah skip Hi how are you glad you called\nTexture thanks for taking my call I'm listening to question whether the streak will run out of the things that I see the most uh scares me the most is they seem to be running on a hatred for America I'm not put up with everything that America stands for is just seems to be [noise] being destroyed by these\nI don't want to wait until the broad brushing say luminal left the left hates America I think there is a a a significant even at times portion of the radical left in this country that literally they hate\nAmerican exceptionalism America's role in the world\nUm they don't like our economic system they believe in they don't believe in capitalism they support socialism they bought redistribution they don't on freedom um and you see an anger that has emerged cause I think they are now focused all of their anger on Donald Trump in all things Trump\nAnd you know it's just it's just pouring out of something you know we've tried a lot of these policies we've tried apologizing we've tried bribing dictators under Obama we tried redistribution under Obama we've tried socialized medicine under Obama\nAnd he's the first president never reach three percent GDP Growth in the history of the country you know we know the disaster of Obamacare no millions lost their doctors their plans and they paid twice three times the amount they weren't pay in spite of promises\nA we know that at the end of his eight years we had Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps and eight million more in poverty you know numbers means something and frankly to go\nTo these failed policies now look\nObama might even be considered moderate compared to where the Democratic party is in the house in the Senate today you know you have one moderate that Joe Manchin that's it and the rest of 'em are all pretty radical left and they don't apologize for their votes\nAnd moderate that Joe Manchin that's it and the rest of 'em are all pretty radical left and they don't apologize for their quote socialist beliefs that is the emerging Democratic Party so when I say that a vote for ... or vote for your local Democratic Congress man or woman is a vote for below sea or", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "15"}
