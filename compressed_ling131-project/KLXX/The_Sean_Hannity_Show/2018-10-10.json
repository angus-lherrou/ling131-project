couple of years and if you if they listen you come back and rebuild later\nI think absolutely spectacular in this rough period we've been going for over the past couple of years and if you if they listen you come back and rebuild later but you know I I fear for people who stay in the way of\nWell I Do too and that's why I always tell people just just listen to authorities I Know people have said because I'm I'm looking and seeing on line and and various media sites social sites people are literally live streaming the hurricane and there's some of them are even on the beach for crying out loud meaning that\nThey're ... they're showing that probably live streaming away from the center because I don't think anybody is live streaming where this this thing's a bulldozer about twenty miles wide bulldozer wherever it's coming in directly it looks like Panama City was on the west side of the wall\nAnd you know I guess this port say porch saint Joe it's going to be you know I I fear for that area and there\nIt is hard they're perfectly said Panama City was ground zero it was and you also talked about the direction that the storm would hit you are right about that which as you predicted yesterday and and the day before and ever since Sunday that the angle at which this storm was coming in and made it that much more devastating\nYeah again it's different from a different from Florence Florence did not come in at her peak this came in all kinds of placing as far as intensity goes\nAnd it's one of these cases where everything came together but you can see it coming together even back on Saturday and Sunday ... as you do I don't know I said that email out saying you're playing the show and see what's going to go on this week I've got some good news for you we're not going to be talking about a more hurricanes this year hitting the United states wants we're done with this one\nJust got to be the last one of the season a lasting\nImpact storm on our coast yes I Believe\nYou know why it's so important that we put you on and you have this incredible encyclopedic knowledge of every hurricane that's ever hit the United states for crying out loud but\nMore importantly with the knowledge that you have you can import that knowledge to our audience and you can save people's lives because you know think about you know the years before media ... we had meteorologist and the ability satellite imaging for example and the ability to actually track and follow these storms\nAnd all of a sudden people will wake up and they're in a category four or five hurricane and they had no idea where it came from um ...\nThirty eight hurricane you know you looked out on Long Island is legendary their those people had no idea what was coming your\nWay Joan I'm old but I'm not that old I wasn't there for the thirty eight hurricane in Long Island in here\nIt's legendary out there and you're at it too\nWell I saw a hurricane Gloria destroy my sister's house so

that the government has gotten their act together they pre positioned a lot of the supplies that you will be needing a I Know a lot of you are going to be very devastated by the loss of\nOf their homes et cetera but I'm the American people the most generous on earth than any help we can give you I Know that will be available\nAs soon as this thing passes I pay attention those that are in Augusta heading up to Columbia South Carolina because that's going to be in your area tomorrow with eighty to a hundred mile per hour winds that's pretty devastating\nUh All right let's get to our busy telephones here as we say Hi to read is in Charleston South Carolina Reese Hi how are you glad you called\nThank you sir thank you for taking my call I'll be brief out which is ...\nYou know getting the president to either director suggested deejay that we go after these false accusers whether it be the DNC Hillary Mrs Ford if not for a criminal part but for the civil part and the cost of the wild goose chases they were sent on\nUh trying to investigate these things from five and and so on and so forth and then strengthen the laws against false accusations 'cause they ruin people's lives\nOh I you know I I never said this but you really think about it all of that information was disseminated to the American people to lie to the American people to feed them propaganda misinformation so that they vote a certain way but more importantly then after the election that they lost in\nSpite of all of these efforts all of the line that kind of always takes place when and that's what the Democratic party does every two and four years in spite of all that then they use this phony information again and again and again\nHave a media elite strategy feeding information from one source to multiple sources to seem like it's a real story when it was a concocted story a scam if you will and that creates an atmosphere where everybody calls for a special counsel and now we're discovering that people were talking about\nWell for some and the FBI now admitting that they had no evidence of Russia collusion at all that's why they disseminated the information that's why they leaked it to their friends in the media that we're willing you know accomplices and all of this\nAnd then they talk about ... doing a presidential election surreptitiously going out and recording the president unbeknownst to him so that they get in and vote the twenty Fifth Amendment and then I guess the whole insurance policy is in place done and finished\nI mean that's what happened here\nYou know certain all these things are again being being paid for by the taxpayer and we're basically taking it in the rear end every time they do this\nAll true there's and unfortunately\nYou know when I say this is the biggest abuse of power scandal\nCorruption in American history I Am a thousand percent right and we still haven't gotten it right there is a reason Rod Rosenstein does not wanna testify have the information recorded or do it under oath because he knows he's up to his eyeballs and every aspect of all of this\nAnd yet he's the guy that has all the power I mean it's amazing he's in the literally the well the eye of the hurricane of you well All right ... thank you appreciate it I'm let us go to James in Cleveland James how are you glad you called\nI Am fantastic song things you've raskin um for small like to get my thoughts and prayers and everybody on the coasts going through the hard times down there\nHopefully uh everybody has the right thing in a place of saved and got out of there I was safe but the reason I called actually is because I wanted to tell you that I was a a number of Trump or back in two thousand sixteen\nAnd I completely changed my whole point of view on that ah I didn't think he was electable and I didn't think he was conservative back then and I was wrong in fact I lost a hundred dollar bet with a fellow employees in mind over it paid him up the next day\nPretty much since day one I have been defending his actions are the president's done a fantastic job is help my family\nAnd myself so much I can remember three things in my entire life that I've noticed the the federal government actually do for me first was the Bush tax cuts\nAnd now this fabulous come from other June ... Trump this time around has because so much money my pocket the ... the other thing that affected me was when my kind of like planning was cancelled because of the sea and Obamacare and it costs me nine thousand dollars out of pocket since my company dumped are Cadillac plans\nIt was when my count like plan was cancelled because of the sea and Obamacare and costs me nine thousand dollars out of pocket since my company dumped are Cadillac plan well thank you Don grounds for that and things you Republicans for more money in my pocket\nYou know I'm Glad you said all of that because there are a lot of people out there that are still the never Trump or land and they won't recognize it look I can understand that they don't like the president's style\nUm it may be that there is at odds with how they would manage things but you cannot argue that he's governing as a strong conservative that gets results and I'll take results over rhetoric any day", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bismarck-Mandan", "day": "10"}
