on my heart radio ...\nAnd maybe the news\nAt Polaroid and retired and came in with that attitude\nI Can't I Want to do it but I Know we're a vocal trust just like you described Susan [laughter] and I said to him you worked at polarized right said yeah I said did they make a camera\nYou said yeah I go did they make one camera or did they make lots of cameras he said oh we made all kinds\nThe cameras and I said there's all kinds of irrevocably trust out there and we can't come into these meetings with that preconceived idea about one kind of irrevocably trust and that really helped him understand\nBecause a lot of people they hear little sound bites if you will about different types of very vocal track and it's not necessarily applicable to these ... only\nCorrect and so now to answer your question that was one of those sparked in my head enough to answer your question yes there are things that can be changed in this trust and again I think the flexibility is really similar to the flexibility of revolt will trust I mean let's face it\nWhen you want to change or revoke about trust and I have lots of clients with revolt will trust\nThey come in and what do they want to change not paragraph thirty five right of the trust they although they could they come in and say you know what I Want to leave a little more to my grandchildren that I was leaving before\nThem a little bit better than it is it cut I leave some there are or\nI have one child now who's really doing well and one child who's struggling can I leave a little more than one child than another well yeah in the revolt will trust world we make that change for them and that's really all they ever want to change right or maybe the trustee\nWell into irrevocably Medicaid trust world they can do those same changes\nThere's a limited powers appointment that allows them to rethink how they leave assets to their children mhm maybe two grandchildren maybe about two one child more than another\n... and and maybe they want to removing replace a trustee Caesar changes that they can do even an irrevocably trust yeah so they're really similar mhm not so different\nSo All right so let's just go down the path that someone gets beyond that word eerie vocal and they decide they want to do their trust planning Todd ... and they're totally fine putting their primary residence in there and so they they fund their trust with their primary residence only\nBut they're still skeptical and fearful that their life will change significantly\nBy having this trust him play and they say I don't want to put any money in the trust now\nAnd then after a year goes by they say hey that's not so bad if it's money you know can they do that and they add money down the road\nYou know it's funny you asked that because I guess clients would think that\nYou know it's I guess it goes back to that you're a vocal trust mentality where it's etched in stone I went and I\nKnow we just got done explaining some flexibility that exists what these documents but but also we we have the ability to add to the ... so the answer is yes you can and I've had clients who have realized after they've put their home and they're like\nWow my life hasn't changed at all mhm I still live there I still pay all my bills my taxes I come and go as I please I could sell tomorrow if I wanted to and they're like\nI'm really not doing anything right right so that All right well maybe I'll put some money now\nAbsolutely you can add money to the trust later with one ... one cautionary word when you add additional gifts to the trust\nAnd they're really incomplete gifts or knock yes but when you put additional assets in the trust you're creating a new five year waiting period but only for that new item okay so if I put today my house and vacation home in\nIn five years that will be protected mhm\nOne year later mhm I add a hundred thousand dollars to the trust it from my investment portfolio yes five years from ... then that will be protected now that sounds like a lot but play out the string\nWhen you get past the initial five years yep the house and the vacation home are now protected mhm well folks\nYou only have one more year to go because the other five o'clock was piggybacking around the same time table as the old one okay and so one more year later after the initial five years\nAnd you've protected the hundred thousand so it's not so bad just be mindful of how old you are when you make that a ...\nYear how you want to put as much as you can end up front when you're initially funding it but no that it can you can add more later on folks you know what these very vocal about trust work but they have to be drafted properly\nTaught is written a guide for the month of October is designing in income

[noise]\n[noise]\nListening to the legal exchange and it's time for us or the segment where John we'll answer your questions about anything and everything but including the estate blaming for us this once again here's a lesbian Susan's\nOf a few questions from listeners for you\nFirst question comes from Brenda in Hampton New Hampshire and Brenda writes I Am Seventy nine years old single and I own my own home and a rental property my total net worth is around eight hundred and fifty thousand\nI did not have any children although I Do have a few nieces that I'm close to and will likely leave my state to them when I pass would it make sense to me to create a trust at this point\nI Do have a five year long term care policy that has increased to about three hundred and Seventy five dollars per day so I'm not concerned with nursing home cost would that be the only reason for me to create a trust [noise]\nWell that's just isn't this is great because this is the kind of question almost like when we've talked to people and done shows on how to get started when we look for what kind of plan is right for me and I think that's really what brand is asking right here [noise]\nUm and so everybody listen to this fact pattern in and and put yourself in it and see if this applies to you\nFirst of all I I see you're under a million\nDoesn't really matter because you're in New Hampshire resident so there's no federal there's no state to state tax you don't need our help for that\nTrust will at least help you avoid probate I see the rental property the home there's really no way to avoid probate with those items a short of putting another person's name on and watch I don't want you to do\nOther than a trust so again revoked ... or your vote ... will get you there okay in terms of avoiding probate and and then the rest of your\nBank accounts or investment accounts I Would also put in the trust that we create\nAnd just back up for one second time because the the point you made about avoiding probate if she didn't create created trust now\nHer executive her niece who never would have to go through probate and I would venture to guess that for an eight hundred and fifty thousand dollar estate it would cost them more to go through probate than to set up a trust to begin with\nI Would think that's the cash shore and it's not just the cost which is certainly there and and the evident\nUh but the headache yeah at the time can consumption or you know why bother\nWith that if I don't have to yeah when you could go just sit in the lawyers conference room and pull out the estate planning and let him or her explain you know what the next steps are and how the asset you know and it's all private ... I I think that in of itself is enough\nReason why people would want to re not do that\nSo All right so now I've I've got to the point where if a boarding probate is one of your concerns then ... and that's your only concern that a revolt ... trust will get you there you don't need the irrevocably trust\n'em now also the revolt ... trust will allow you to direct how when when your\nNieces and nephews get the assets rang\nAnd and and that's important because you know maybe you want a divorce proof or for them maybe you want to credit are protected for them maybe there's things you want to do with these assets to protect them or to control them from the grave\nAnd the revolt ... trust in this example will do that now when you were a vocal trust would do that as well\nBut I'm Still kind of focused on the revolt couple so those would be too important reasons probate and how to get it to them maybe help excluded from their state for a state tax purposes as well and skip a generation maybe control it for the uh great nieces and nephews as well\nAnd if she doesn't have any plan in place right now including a well those assets those wouldn't land when her niece's they will go to a different succession plan right\nWell I'm not really sure if you don't have a well you're you're you're correct you'd have to look to the interstates succession statute in it might be they would go to the her next closest next of kin which\nYou know probably not parents if she's Seventy nine but that would be next right then it would be siblings so the fact that she's got nieces and nephews were telling me that she does have siblings and unless they predict sister um than\nThose assets would go to siblings first right and you're never really want to leave it across a generation you always want to leave it down a generation to save taxes\nThan not to mention her siblings are probably the same age that she is and maybe have\nWith nursing homes and they could be a nursing home issue and the last comment would be why not do that your vocal trust what she does have a decent amount of long term care insurance live coverage which I think it's helpful number one not enough to cover the full boat\nBut again having no immediate children her immediate need might not be oh yeah it's very important that I say\nSo it's from the nursing home for my nieces and nephews more you know whatever's left they can have well if that's the case then you don't coupled with the long term care insurance I'd probably be leaning towards the revolt couple of trust plan for her okay are based on this this fact\nBut some type of trust plan Brenda because you want to avoid probing you want to make sure those assets go where you want them to\nFolks if you are considering creating ... trusting you're not sure really what you should be looking for when you sit down with the attorney that's going to draft your documents\nTodd has created a guide for the month of October it's titled designing in income only ... trust and it includes six provisions that absolutely must be in your ear evoke about trust\nAnd fix the provisions that absolutely must not be included it's a great baseline to educate yourself on how these trust work folks\nYou can risk last year free copy of Todd's designing your eerie vulnerable trust guide\nBy calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine or download your free copy on our website legal exchange show dot com\nTaught our last question comes from Donna in reading and math and Donna rights\nWhat does Medicaid consider fair market value when selling a home would it be the assessed value I'd like to purchase my mother's home from her and she is willing to sell it to me at a discount however I don't want to run into any issues down the road as she is in failing health\nOh Don I'm going to start off by saying I'm not loving the idea of you buying a home\nRight I mean can you buy the home and in fact I I had a student in my class asked a similar question what is fair market value and you know what if you sell the home right before you go to the nursing home is that going to be a disqualifying transfer\nIf I sell it for fair market value or if I sell it for less than fair market value\nWell certainly if you do anything in terms of transferring assets and not get back fair market value it will be a disqualifying transfer mhm so that's number one in terms of answering that kind of a question number two what is fair market value\nThe assessed value will do it ... for mass health purposes anyway for Medicaid purposes so\nThey only require the most recent real estate tax bill value okay to be considered fair market value which", "show_name": "Real Stories of The Legal Exchange", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "21"}
