{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Well let me tell you the researchers at Harvard under the leadership of Dr David Sinclair this is what they found\nCaloric restriction eating less slows the pace of aging\nThat's pretty darn impressive and what they found in laboratory studies of animals is that an extended lifespan and it appeared that caloric restriction eating less food and you're eating right now by a certain percentage increases your longevity you'll live longer it increases the activity\nOf what we call a longevity gene they get switched on day help improve metabolism it increases your ability to cope your ability to adapt in fact this gene helps increase tissue repair\nAnd its switched on by a group of genes called short too and now they've found two things at Harvard number one caloric restriction increases these longevity genes the sirtuin\nWell so does resveratrol at least in their animal studies and this is exactly why ... been making all these worldwide headlines because if it works in humans as it does and these animals and I'm optimistic it will\nIt represents an entirely new approach to managing health and wellness where we potentially using a traditional compound like resin ... target the exact genes associated with these various areas of improvement then our health and our aging and our longevity\nWell now that's the person you say that took you ten holds an elite status in the nutritional supplements industry because it's been so well documented so well researched you call this evidence based nutrition maybe give us a brief overview of the research and explain why co Q. ten researches so widely respected\nWell let's go back to Nineteen fifty seven University of Wisconsin the Nobel Prize for Peter Mitchell in Nineteen Seventy eight\nThe University of Texas Medical school Purdue University in Indiana Stockholm University in Sweden the great study recently at the University of and Conan and Italy on mitochondrial energy and co Q. ten\nUniversity of Grenada in Spain talking about co Q. ten being a powerful anti ... article published constantly throughout the world\nThe archives of biochemistry and bio synthesis the proceedings of the national Academy of sciences major studies major universities right here in the United states and abroad the bottom line and these studies\nEnergetic mitochondria

three three three one eight hundred seven three six three three three once again we're talking with Dr ...\nWhen president now that's the impression we talked about the co Q. ten we talked about there is there a troll but you've added vitamin D to this and I knew there was a meeting with Dr canal from the vitamin D council\nAnd it's made me a believer but you added vitamin D and you've added vitamin B. twelve yeah now many people go through life not knowing that they've got a co Q. ten deficiency with vitamin D vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these co factors\nWell right now I think at this point in time as more research being done on vitamin D that pretty much any other vitamin nutrient and the reason is listen to this one\nBillion people worldwide do not get enough vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine wow I mean that's a lot of people and we found out some pretty amazing things with all of this research now listen to this\nWhen most people think of vitamin D day of bone on bone health you might think of sunlight as well or vitamin D also plays a very powerful role as a supporter of the immune system\nIt supports immune system health and immune system activity quite dramatically in fact it also helps support brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and the great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function it supports a healthy colon on top of all of that and a great new study out of the University of Hawaii talking about vitamin D and colon health\nI mean who thinks that those things right\nYeah that's amazing so I think it's a welcome addition to this amazing formula to co Q. super boosts formula in addition to that I said look\nWe should put some B. twelve and here as well let's call cabal him then and I say that because the twelve converge the carbohydrates and proteins in fact that you're eating convert them right into energy\nAnd this is all about energy and well being so what you're sitting down to eat your breakfast or your lunch or your dinner if you don't have enough to be twelve that great meal that you just said is not going to be converted into energy in your body\nDown until you try this unique combination of the one hundred milligrams of co Q. ten the advanced raspberry ... the way you find them and purity co Q. super boost formula that you won't know

instance stamina I mean who wouldn't let me raise your hand if you don't want to energy interests stamina\nEverybody wants it absolutely I mean come on and this is a great way to do that and I said ... you know let's held him about it and let's let them experience it for themselves\nWell absolutely must have been fascinating but Dr presents for people who were tuning in late having a quick recap here what exactly is co Q. was very ... super formula who needs it and why is this in your opinion the next generation of coke you supplementation and how does purity free bottle offer work\nWell look I think there is a distinct advantage to having energy endurance and stamina and if we were going to isolate the nutrients and create what we would call a daily essential and somebody gave me the assignment list the top five or six nutrients that we need to literally give us energy\nTo build endurance to bill stamina I Would lift the following nutrients\nCo Q. ten resveratrol B. twelve and vitamin D day this is the advantage as we're speaking about\nAnd rather than going out and buying all four or five of these different nutrients you get them all in one with the co Q. daily super ... and the idea behind this is you take two a day\nYou see how it works for a month and you'll find that you're going to be on the phone calling to order more because you're going to have a lot more

Vera troll you experienced the amazing benefits of the key red wine molecule which you been seeing all over the news lately so don't miss this chance\nVoice of Boston you only have one hundred and twenty seven to ... to Boston heart radio station\nFrom ABC News on just the biggest\nAre equal opportunity haters\nFor those who are out there many attorneys do not transfer there are real estate in for them so how do you actually transfer real estate from your own names into your ear evil will\nTrust okay so you're talking about this irrevocably type yes right although it's not entirely different if you had a revolt will trust so I just thought I'd throw that out there it's it's really the same so the deed work we prepare because we can do that so we prepare new deeds to actually say you know\nTodd blood ski here by transfers and conveys too you know Billy trustee of the\n... family or a vocal trust who says right on your feet you guys will know that because you can go look at your real estate tax bill and see that it comes in the name of the trust and not to\nThe LA well it might endanger will re you'll get scared 'cause you'll see his name it'll probably say Billie trustee and you'll say oh how come it's in Belize name it's night Billy\nOf the drums sometimes I Can't fit the whole trust name on there so you might just see Billy as trustee that means that title has been\nChanged and it's now owned by the irrevocably trust good\nBut bank and investment accounts same thing you need to actually go to the so like for you and you go to your financial advisor chairs and you get forms\nAnd you fill out the forms that actually say I'm you know\nTrade changing title to the account to read\nThe maybe Todd let's keep family irrevocably trust mhm put your name it\nAnd then it's in there and you also know what's in their cars you will need a separate tax id number right or the irrevocably trust what you would not need\nFor the ... a couple of trust you just use your social but you're still needs to change the name and that's really how you do it and make sure you look at your statements that you get and make sure they come in the name of the trust under the new id number then you know they're in\nThere and sometimes when you are putting real estate in there you know it can take a couple of months even though that deeds been recorded it can take ... he's a couple of months for you to see that change reflected on your\nYour ... your tax bill and so forth so don't panic if you don't see that so once you actually put your home in your area vocal about trust taught him for a lot of people that's their biggest asset is there anything that you can no longer do with your home\nIf it's owned by the trust you given up any rights to anything\nI Would say the only thing you cannot do\nWould be re mortgage it okay now you can keep existing mortgages first of all most people that are doing Medicaid planning don't have a more they're not concerned but ... but ... and yeah and getting a new third year mortgages not high on there to do list mhm so\nProbably not an issue but some people still have the lingering mortgage that has been very good at home equity line of credit for home on the line of credit what we do generally is we reserve a life a states this will be one of the times where we actually would reserve the life of state\nIn the deed mhm by doing that you now preserve the mortgage\nMeaning they won't trigger the due on sale clause you didn't give it away remember we're not giving anything away we're keeping that President right to live there the rest of our lives which is what a life of state is ...\nAnd that means that you have not triggered the due on sale cause so you can keep that existing line of credit or existing mortgage you just can't get a new one\nWithout taking it out of the trust once in a tent and restarting the clock so even then you could get it but you would have to restart the\nClock so you so if someone doesn't have a balance due to a bank or they don't have a mortgage or they don't have a line of credit would you recommend that they establish a line of credit before they transferred and knowing that they're not going to be able to\nGet one after isn't you know what are your thoughts kind of a personal matter it really matters up to the client you know what do they feel you guys feel like you need that security of being able to borrow money in the future because if you keep the line of credit you can always write the check\nTo borrow up to the limit that your cats because you can use it you can you can weigh line immigrants just can't get a new one right now you can keep the one you have up to the credit limit that they gave you and the term than they gave you because you preserve that in the life of state\nSo it's really a family matter if you feel that you need that comfort level to say oh my gosh if I Need a new hot water heater I Need a new roof or I Need something that causes me I a lot of money\nAnd I don't have it otherwise\nThen yeah OK otherwise mostly no\nOkay you know folks there's a lot of questions that might be going through your mind at All right well what else can I Do when my house is in the trash can I sell it can I can I I'm Still have to pay my taxes and get the right off for that kind of put rental property in there what

everything that's including the estate blaming process once again here's Doug loves the Susan\nSon of a few questions from listeners for you first question comes from\nDave in Boston mass and Dave writes I Am the trustee of my mother's eerie vocal trust the trust has been in for since two thousand and nine and has two properties in it\nShe has a number of CDs now can I put those in the same trust if so would this adversely affect the trust and if it is not adversely affected\nHow when with these CDs be protected would there be a five year clock started for the CDs or would they immediately be protected using that trust original two thousand and nine start date days looking for a loop hole hair I'm Wondering if\nYou ask just a few more questions because there was only about Fifteen glands you're my own heart here he's looking for a loop hole you get back to you\nKnow there's no loophole here for your body but I Do have good news for your overall depending on how old you are I'm In and this is really the question right so he so I'm Sorry how old your mother is Dave I'm\nAnd and so this becomes a question for all of you when you're doing you're planning and this is why why when we do planning for people we put as much assets as we can in the trust all at one time\nThat being said it doesn't mean you can't add to the trust later if you want to so you got to see the question here Dave and we certainly can add to the trust later\nBut I'm going to explain the ramifications so depending on mom's age hopefully you put everything and you want it in at one time and then you have one five you're waiting period running on the whole thing mhm let's say mom put it in at sixty five\nAnd now she's Seventy and everything she initially put in which is what the two the two properties yeah right those are all protected\nSometimes they're not comfortable learning about how the trust really doesn't cause of many problems at all and then after this five years went by and they say you know and I kinda forgot all about the trust\nIt's not hurting me at all not changing my life at all mhm maybe I'll take some of these CDs and put 'em in there well in my hypothetical for your mother in this case Dave she's now Seventy\nCatch you put the CDs and yes she can would create a new five you're waiting period for her yes it will\nBut only on the new addition that new money so at least you can rest assured that the two houses are protected\nAnd you'd only have to deal with mhm perhaps undoing are dealing with that money that you put in if something happens in the next five years but now you have to get to Seventy five right\nProvided the increase provided that had an increased the waiting period between the time you contributed your house\nAnd the time you contribute to CDs so the answer is yes you can new five o'clock so think about how old you are when you start this right 'cause they did this planning ten years ago run mom while there you go\nSo it was Seventy at the time ...\nIt's a little harder to do does it mean you don't do it no I think you're still step back and look at her health and say you know while she's in pretty good shape let's let's get another clock started do it\nSo what do you do Todd if Dave puts the CDs in there and now in four years down the road mom goes into their thing and they don't make that five year\nA great question I Would have to decide by looking at and this is where last minute planning comes into play right\nI normally there's things left out of the trust look at this case the for example she lost a lot of money out of the trust our CDs that and go and I'm sure even though she's putting the CDs and now Dave\nThat she left out of the trust her IRA money and any other money that she just didn't feel comfortable putting in yet mhm\nLet's look at how much that is if she left about a hundred grand outside the trust\nAnd were four years into this new five year waiting period I'm likely to tell or the mother in this case or Davis the mom's going in the nursing home\nLet's private pay with the money you have outside the trust mhm why it's at risk anyway\nAnd if I spend a hundred grand to protect all I don't know another five hundred thousand of CDs that I put in the trust I'm OK doing that and that will get us past that one more year waiting period that we need to get to ... to protect it all\nOtherwise\nNone of that five hundred thousand is protected so think of it as being pro rated in the sense that yeah I've got four years under ...\nMy belt even those zero of those dollars is protected yet I'll pay for a year mhm just to protect the balance of the money that's in there so lots of options get the clock running never a bad idea\nYeah and you know what folks ideally you're going to do your planning in advance\nEducate yourself before you start the process so you know what should and should not be in your trust in how these trust operate on a day to day basis Todd's guide for the month of October it's gone back in the vault folks that you need to request your copy now which you can do by calling eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine

them\nI have an ... trust that holds my home should I named my ear evoke about trust as beneficiary of my IRA what are the pros and cons of this [noise]\nSo if it's an ear replicable trust I I'm for I think we need to figure out what size of the IRA meaning what percentage of the IRA makes up mhm the trust or makes up the entire state I think\nWith Iraq a couple trust not replicable replicable as a whole different animal but was irrevocably trust well with a ... couple of trust you could name\nThe designated beneficiary of the IRA such trust\nThem with a replicable trust\nI worry a little that the language I have to put in there in the trust to allow the IRA to be a beneficiary\nAnd the way the states are scrutinizing every application yet for Medicaid and trying to find ways to poke holes into these trust that somehow they may say that the principles of veil of all to the tone or\nBecause of the language you have to put in for an IRA so as it's not paid out so you could stretch it over the individual's right on the fisheries lifetime my my inclination is\nNot to do it have I done it in the past yes it you know I I think the ups the upside is in this case this person's single",
