they really weren't in one hundred and twenty seven to ... to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\nFrom ABC News on showing off\nHis with his hot political issue ABC is terrible Mary at the White House just\nThe business property right that's a business\nSo it's a rental type kind of place writes a bed and breakfast\nIt's non accountable because it's generating in Comedy Central to self support so we have a provision a regulation that allows that to be known cannibal so we\nYeah eight hundred thousand off the table would that be true if it were just a straight business Todd and not a rental property type situation I think so okay yes I Do I Will comes off the table\nNow they're going to put a lean on it mhm that's OK the liens always your friend because it's going to be at a much lower medicated rate than the private pay rate for the nursing home mhm way lower some like fourteen Fifteen thousand a month down to six\nPlus you get to use the net rent\nTo maintain the property right so you get you get you get the rent to maintain the property and it's the net rent that you give the nurse so after all your expenses that's ... and even that that rent along with your Social Security all goes towards reducing\nThe amount of money that the state would be paying so that lean every month is smaller clean get smaller and exactly ... okay\nSo I've got the business a property off the table [noise]\nWhat about the south Carolina property normally that was her home\nWell homes or non cannibal for single people\nUnless they are not located in the state oh remember that they have to be located in the state so that's the first issue but then I find out for single people if you move out of the house you can treat it as a former home\nAnd then the former home requirement does not require you to be living in the state ... it just as it has to be the former home and doesn't say where it has to be located flu so long so now I Believe that South Carolina property will be protected from the nursing home and\nNot even sure they can put a lean on it because it's out of state there's some gray area as to whether or not and\nMassachusetts or any state can lean out of state property interesting so at least we know the south Carolina property would be non ... because we were checked the box that it's her home the former residents and she intends to return home even if she can't [laughter] wonderful so the ... so there's a million six\nOff the table already\n[noise] we've got a hundred and sixty thousand and cash yeah you can only in two thousand 'cause she's single it's exactly right Susan so we're stuck with the two thousand ah how do we get rid of a hundred and fifty eight thousand dollars\nWe can either by an annuity or use a pool trust mhm so probably depending on her age will take the money and put it into a pool trust might be easier um and and I would do that if I Would probably only do the poll trust if\nThe annuity doesn't work number wise meaning she's probably over Ninety so let's say she's eighty five I might do a ... I might do an annuity mhm go out by him medicated annuity convert the asset into an income stream and she'll receive a monthly check\nAnd now that hundred and fifty thousand is no longer an asset\nPreventing her from becoming eligible for Medicaid but instead ... was converted by buying the annuity into an income stream for her\nNow we've got her on Medicaid or there'll be Alina pay back actually but so what I might not do the poll trust because\nThe pull trust while it also would protect the money it not only has the pay back but it also has that little charitable piece that you got to pay ... depending on how long you live there either twenty percent to the charity if you live in the nursing home more than two years\nOr ten percent to the charity if you live in the nursing home less than two years so I should say two years or more you pay twenty yeah less than two years you pay ten\nSo you don't have the charity piece what the pay back on the annuity mhm so that's the difference between those two\nSo now you see we actually can get this person eligible for Medicaid that all sounds great right\nExcept what I saw going on in the bank accounts for the business\nA lot of times the people that would work there would want to be paid in cash oh so there's withdrawals if for cash checks to pay the cash and ... and then she would pay the cash well also there would be checks to cash\nOr checks written to the son\nWho's actually working there and done the plumbing the opening the closing but if it's a check from your bank account which really was just in her name yet to the sun that's going to look like a gift\nAnd now you're gonna have to prove that all these transfers we're actually not gifts mhm\nYou might be able to prove it you might not be able to so be careful how you operate it you're going to pay somebody to give them a W to write the check from the company you know show that it's reported on their income tax return show that they work there\nThese are things to think about operationally now having said all that I Am going to just give you this last thought\nIf they had done all of this and put it into these trust in advance the house and the ... or the house and the rental property would already be protected ...

everything that included in the estate blaming process once again here's a loved the Susan followers\nKind of a few questions from listeners for you\nFirst question comes from Phil in Dorchester math and Phil writes my wife recently passed away unexpectedly\nWe were in the process of drying up our trust but we never got to execute them before she died is there anything that can be done now to save our state a state tax exemptions\nWe were worth around one point eight million when she passed when he got given how a magic wand and ... and they were actually in their defense they were in the process of doing it true true\nAnd and this is a really a great story in the sense that that it can it can really help us understand how not planning is harmful mhm right so if you have one point eight million and you were successful at setting up to trust\nOr say to irrevocably trust it could be one replicable either way\nOr that has the marital sharing the remainder share built in what that means is it's it's easier to explain what to trust say where I put\n... put nine hundred thousand dollars of assets in one trust and nine hundred thousand in another ...\nWhen the first spouse in this case died say the wife if she had done the planning right there'd be nine hundred thousand dollars in her trust whether it's revolt ... irrelevant mhm what matters is there's two buckets that form inside her trust\nPeople need to realize that this trust doesn't fold up and go away and everything flows out into the spouses hands no the whole point of the trust is that it does not die mhm it keeps on going and\nWe then take the nine hundred thousand dollars of stuff that's in the trust and allocated to a share called the remainder share or to the marital share of the trust so romaine or the bypass shared gets the amount of assets up to the state exemption\nMhm a million in Massachusetts yeah or your state exemption\nAnd the amount over that\nCan go to the marital share in the marrow share allows us to make tax elections which I don't need to get into right now 'cause in this case there's nine hundred and the nine hundred would end up in the remainder share for the benefit of the surviving spouse mhm\nAnd because of the way that remained or share is drafted you would end up having those assets not just flowing into the hands of the healthy spouse but there for the healthy spouses benefit yup or surviving now just ... right\nBut she doesn't own it and so she doesn't own it if the surviving spouse doesn't own it\nThen when the surviving spouse dies it's not taxable what if it grows though what if they're hurt your his trust grows to be twice as that\nDoesn't matter never doesn't matter how much it grows it will never be whatever's left in there when the surviving spouse dies is not owned by the surviving spouses therefore not taxable and surviving spouses estate\nBut because of that it would have been caused to be taxed in the\nFirst spouse to dies estate but it's nine hundred thousand you said hey we got a formula built in there that says hey the amount up to the exemption goes in this bucket mhm oh look it's less than a million\nSo while it's subject to tax in the first spouses estate to die\nThere's an exemption to use it up so we file a tax return but we don't have to pay taxes good question and the answer is no if it's less than ... million dollar filing threshold I don't even need to file nice the estate tax return\nAnd there's no tax too so what about those folks that didn't get around to doing their planning we know federally you can use portability but is that available in the state can we do ... of all in this state\nSo you lose that and just to play out the string what happens right because if you follow the string I just did with the planning ... no tax on the first F less than a million\nSurviving spouse dies I say there's nine hundred thousand in her trust mhm less than a million no tax yep period\nThis way because no planning was done everything will likely went to the surviving spouse mhm [noise] surviving spouses now worth one point eight million which again this is why the marital deduction is so beneficial for the government not for us right it pumps up the surviving spouse as a state\nWith the deceased spouse disaster mhm so now she's at one point eight million which is greater than the million dollar exemption so when she dies there is about an eighty thousand dollar Massachusetts a state tax liability do anything to be done with that now\nI Can't think of anything I assume they just had a simple wheels that leave everything to each other so if they have simple wells that leave everything to each other the only thing you can really do at this point would be file a disclaimer saying treat me surviving spouse as if I died\nAnd then everything would go well that was going to come to me would go to my kids but now it's not but now you know it's just a riot or while you might be able to I don't necessarily think I like the result of that\nAnd you know folks failed clearly they put off they're planning a little too long I Know that his wife passed unexpectedly but get your planning in place folks are so many benefits they will come from that and if you're concerned not just about estate taxes in bloodline cleaning and boating probate\nMaybe you're concerned about depleting those assets impoverishing your spouse if you go into a nursing home [noise]\nFind out how these eerie they'll couple of tries to operate find out the information they absolutely must be in your trust as well as those clauses that absolutely must not be included in your trust called right now to request you're free copy of Todd's designing any are evil ... trust guide\nAt eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine or download\nA copy on our website legal exchange showed dot com Todd our last question comes from Karen in brain to UMass and Karen writes I transferred money into my ear evoke about trust four years ago\nI'd like to lend my daughter's some money to buy a house can I give her a loan from the trust that can be forgiven if I pass away and consider it as an advance on her inheritance I don't need the money selling fine if she doesn't actually we pay it to me\n[noise] so you know Susan this is a great example just to show a and really it goes to the materials how flexible\nAny revoke about trust can be right 'cause all the operational things that we do for the trust from day to day are also laid out in our material and so I Want you to see\nHow something that seems like you when you read this ... and you might be saying you know what it doesn't seem like you should be able to do this with an ... but you can\nYou can explain why so in this case the trust is allowed to lend money\nBut never to the don't or okay so you can't lend money to the person who created the trust of all that's okay that's mom mhm mom doesn't
