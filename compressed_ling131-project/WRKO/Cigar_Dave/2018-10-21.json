the market ... your returns or be your earnings are based upon market returns but you're not invested in the market you are not invested in the market this is the savings tool it's not as security\nAnd the name of our show folks his mask wealth radio creating financial freedom with Jake Larry and that's exactly what he was explaining to you and I'm Dave Thompson your host\nAnd Jake is

potentially use an annuity in your retirement income plan\nWell so you have we have we have families they will come in and uh they can get a little complicated but you can actually you can actually invested in a fixed indexed annuity and you can purchase what's called an income rider on that fixed indexed annuity so your\nMoney your hundred thousand dollars or two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or five hundred thousand dollars whatever it is let's use a half a million for example you put that money in and\nYou defer for maybe two or three years if you purchased an income rider your money so you have you're guaranteed\nWhat's called accumulated value and that's the money that you can walk away with that after your contractual agreement nine years\nDown the road but then they have also an income value in this income value\nIs usually substantially higher than your accumulated value so it can be guaranteed that say like six and a half percent guaranteed per year for a set amount of years until you're ready to take\nThat money now I always tell clients\nThat is the money that you can't walk away with okay that is the low hanging fruit that the insurance company will provide you so that hopefully you stay with them for your lifetime\nBut I always ask him I said let me ask you a question would you rather take five percent as income off of a half a million dollars or five percent as income off of eight hundred thousand dollars because the income account is going to grow substantially\nQuicker and more uh it's like I said it's a\nGuaranteed percentage right for like six and a half percent your accumulated growth is not guaranteed at six and a half percent\nI Wish it was but it's not right so uh you know you've got more opportunity for income growth on those on those type of accounts\nWell France now listen your retirement dream without a written retirement plan is like a boat without sales so the reason why we're talking today is that you can understand Jake's purpose is to sit down with you and give you that written retirement plan\nTo help you get that really that financial peace of mind that you're looking for so Jake as we kind of wrap up our show any final thoughts for us today\nI Would tell the listeners out there today to have an open mind about annuities\nDon't listen to your neighbor don't listen to the news don't listen to your news you know reading the newspaper what\nI Would tell you is can be with us you know you and I can sit down we can have an open dialogue and we can talk about these type of uh products these fixed annuities are fixed indexed annuities and I think that you would really open your mind to some other opportunities cause I can tell you right now our clients that we have\nThat position themselves and fixed indexed annuities are fixed annuities walk out of our office with a smile and they rest easy at night knowing\nThat their principal is not at risk and that's a big factor and retirement you know David I had a client come in and\nThat was I'm unsure of what what was really the best option for retirement you know she had about a hundred and sixty five thousand dollars right now that she wanted to invest but she wanted to really maximize their income and she was about\nShe was about five years out from retiring okay so we just heard that fixed indexed annuity for five years but based on income growth\nCan you believe that in five years guaranteed that it was worth over two hundred and Seventy thousand dollars\nTwo hundred and Seventy thousand dollars that now you got to stand that's on the income that ... that that the accumulated value that's the income value so what that means is she couldn't walk away with the two hundred and Seventy thousand dollars in five years\nBut she could draw income off of that two hundred and Seventy thousand dollars\nAt that time frame so she had an abundant amount of money that was a lot greater than what her original premium was\nThat she could dry and come off the once again would you rather drive five percent of the hundred and sixty five thousand or would you rather drive five percent off of two hundred and Seventy thousand right you know these are income plans\nAnd like I said the insurance company is not going to let you walk away with the lump sum amount of money but the income growth that you can get off of the fixed indexed annuity\nI Believe my opinion is is that it's on ...\nI talk so listen if these options that we've been talking about today these annuities what I ask you to have an open mind okay have an open mind about what I'd been discussing because these are factual situations that have taken place in my office and I would love for you to come in for that council patient no obligation\nWill sit down and have an open dialogue between you and I just sitting there talking about what your goals are in retirement is it income based as a principle preservation\nIs a growth without the risk of of market volatility you know we can sit down and talk about these are opportunities for eight five five three one eight eighty three eighty seven eight five five\nA ... ah what was it a Thursday night if you saw Josh I'm

only two quarterbacks coming out of the stress Josh Rosen the the problem\nHe's got he has no offensive line I mean that is an awful lot of wind so I don't know if we know how good he's going to be I

and just kind of look\nYou know trends in taste and what's going on so Chris ... tell us about ... how did you uh uh how long has that been around in a ... I'll tell you the website is fantastic ... tons and tons of information which I enjoy it it's on one of my book mark pages that I a scholar every week stuff's about ...\nYeah so a broadband as part of a large organization called ... ah we're a business to business trade company we host a business conferences around the country we have three different websites one for a non alcoholic beverage professionals one for\nUm a food professionals in one for beer professionals and we publish daily a brew bound I think was launched um you know right around two thousand ten thousand eleven at the time it was just sort of a a pet project internally for a couple of guys here\nUm horse who were super into beer and they didn't really\nUm you know how much direction or you know what they wanted to do with it at the time um and our our owner John ah you know kind of took the project on and said let's expand into into the beer space and um yeah it it sort of\nTransition from more of a blog site into a full fledged a daily news publication um so I came on board\nI think my uh my first day was a gosh uh January\nTenth two thousand eleven um and I think that week we had I don't know maybe a hundred or a hundred and fifty people visit the site and now we're going to have over five million page views this year\nIncredible it is a great site tons of information and when we look at the explosion of the beer industry specifically it's really been the craft beer movement\nThat has really provided over growth and I think it's a testament to that is the fact that the big boys if you can't beat them join them and you see in in ... Bush we should all the the big guys come in and start to acquiring\nA number of these craft brewers or or boutique brewers and ah they're there and and so it's kind of an interesting\nWay of uh what is going on right now and there seems to be a little backlash from some of the a diehard craft brewing aficionados [noise]\nYeah so over the last few years I'd say I mean you you can sort of trace back much of the merger acquisition activity to [noise]\nUm I'd say two thousand I think it was two thousand eleven when goose island or was purchased by an ... or Bush um and that was really sort of their first their first acquisition and I don't think they even really new kind of what\nThey were going to be doing I'm In the crafts space when when they bought the silent out of Chicago\nUm and their strategy didn't really develop until a few years after that I'm so they sort of a plot at a course for a regional strategy buying breeze in different areas of the country I'm In fact in in Tampa where you are they a came really really close to a purchase things to our city\nUm ... yeah and the NFL fell through 'em and suggested he ended up selling to a different um craft brewery collective uh called can Archie um which was formed a by the founder of of Oscar booze out of Colorado\nOr as well as a private equity firm here in the Boston area firemen capital partners so\nUm you know ... we've seen a lot of deals says obviously Anheuser Busch has gotten into the space pretty heavily spent a lot of money and inquired about ten different breweries or Miller corps has a few breweries that they've purchased over the last couple of years a constellation has three breweries a funky Buddha and your neck of the woods\nUm that I purchased um Heineken purchase logging need it so I'm everyone sort of has a their their craft a brewery horse if you will and the race um and then we've also seen a lot of transactions on the private equity side so\nI'm you know really since I got into this space or it's been sort of a flurry of a ... a activity it it really picked up um you know twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen slowed a little bit last year and it's been\nA relatively quiet

that come up with these just totally different unique tastes and packaging ideas the big guys come in and the concern is always\nOkay are they gonna do to those companies what they normally do whereas they buy successful company they buy it because it's successful because it's because it's got a great marketing dish and then all of a sudden they say well we're smarter we've got more MBAs we're going to tweak it and then they kinda destroy the company\nThere's always that does a balanced you see some of that starting to happen [noise]\nI'm not so much I think uh we've actually seen sort of the opposite I'm you\nKnow I think it would be kinda foolish to spend as much money as they they they've spent on these companies and then you know want to run them into the ground or um you know jettisoned them somehow I don't think that they're\nThey're buying these ah these properties to somehow kill the category of ... which is\nI guess um you know a a misnomer um they're buying grows they're buying brands that are uh that that consumers are gravitating towards and and they want to participate in the segment so we haven't seen that quite as much um now that being said I think that\nThey may be misunderstood a kind of where the market was going in some cases so if you look at constellation for instance\nThey spent a billion dollars buying Dallas point out of San Diego thinking that they'd be able to have this national a craft beer brand and you know kind of scale it and that consumers would um you know continue to love the ... brand at a national level and\nReally what we've seen since that transaction is ah the hyper local as a nation of craft and\nUm you know the the ... that are the the larger companies that purchase breeze in different pockets of the country and focus more on a regional strategy you're actually faring a bit better\nYeah you know your interesting mentioning talking about the local type of craft brewers are very close to the ah John sheet resource senior or junior of Hamburg brewing up in the buffalo area\nAnd there you know market really primarily as western New York and and you know Rochester buffalo going down almost eerie Pennsylvania and they've created some great beers and they've got a great a great niche and\nAnd really what they do in that area is so unique that they get people coming all the way from across the country to visit their tap room and\nThat's another phenomenon that we're seeing a lot of these these craft brewers create these tap rooms and there was a large contingent of ah of beer connoisseurs that on weekends travel all over the country to check out their tap rooms and go to these breweries and and and simple beers from all over the country\nYeah absolutely I think um you know an interesting that that that I'd like to point out is that\nYou look at some of the from last year the the fifty fastest growing breweries in twenty Seventeen um were significantly smaller than you know some of the the brands that we've already talked about today and um you know many of the brands that anybody would recognize so\nHouse in dollars a year and a thousand dollars there on ... avenue

B. E. M. to soften the Buffalo News here's the headline from a two days ago new craft breweries have opened in western New York with lots more planned in coming months\nThey're looking at a one two three four five six seven eight\nAbout eight to ten new\nCap rooms and some micro breweries are and in fact what's interesting is there's ... house that they've been working on trying to open for the last\nI think I don't know three four years\nAnd getting investors and a ... brewing actually which is based in Buffalo they're opening their own ... brew house so it's kind of interesting to see how in in pockets of the country the enthusiasm for beer and brewing houses in tap rooms is a is still still growing [laughter] yeah\nYou know I think um it's to me it's looking more and more kind of like a restaurant business uh right you know if you think about uh just the way that these breweries are financed and you know the way that\nLenders operate to um you know they're they're lending a significant amount of money\nTo actually build out so they're spending on construction to build out the ability to build up the tab rooms and then you know make them look beautiful and and that's not money that a bank has ever getting back um so it is very similar to the restaurant business right there's not a whole lot of\nAssets that they're that they're actually financing other than the equipment I'm so in in my opinion or any of these operations that started up I think that they should be trying to do in his lean it possible take on as little as possible and open as quickly as possible and start selling\nBeer directly to consumers at the highest margin possible so that they can service that debt and get you know quickly get to profitability\nRight and and you know what's interesting is when you look at some of them look at some pictures of some of these places a picture of community beer works up in Buffalo that open this past summer\nAnd again nice or interior not overly crazy uh but that seems to be now the place where people you know want to congregate and hang out not necessarily a a a you know club where there's banging music and it's just loud and didn't you know crazy lights\nIt seems there's been a shift it's almost like the ... of yesteryear and this is what you see now it's more of a socialized social atmosphere and I think you are right on the head that if you could open up\nNot go crazy you don't have to be the biggest you don't have to be the best you don't have to have a three million dollar build out in fact a lot of the successful ones are the ones that are very cozy and quaint they they just make good beer and and people will go regardless of you know whether it's a three hundred thousand dollar build out or a a third three million dollar bill\nThat yeah exactly I think the bigger question though for me at least is\nYou know how sustainable that model is um you know if you have two breweries on on a on a city block and then two more open\nYou know you haven't created any new customers now there's just for companies competing for the same customers that were walking down the street right so I'm ... ... on one hand yeah they're bringing a lot of excitement and enthusiasm the category but on the other hand\nYou know does the industry risk kind of turning it back on traditional bars in rats\nStrong and if so you know what's the ramification of that you know five ten Fifteen Years down the road\nWhat we've seen a number of restaurants that have actually gone and within the restaurant creating a small you know almost micro micro brewery just to create some of their own beer and a kind of as an attraction and we've seen that a number of restaurants here in the\nIn the city of Tampa but I'm seeing that more and more where restaurants are looking saying you know what we want to get in on this action we don't want to go crazy but they're still kind of unique market to do that\nYeah absolutely I mean I think you know we we talked about the opening and closing more breweries are going to continue to open for sure I mean we're seeing you know I think what like two two and a half breweries opening per day is is the ah is the clip 'em and and that will probably continue in ... into next\nYear I don't know when exactly it'll slow down many people think that\nUh there could be as many as ten thousand breweries and brew pub throughout the United states here very shortly um and most of those again are going to be pretty small tapper and focused or like the ones that that are mentioned\nIn that article from from New York so it'll be interesting to kind of see how it all shakes out in long term you know how many of these businesses survive I think you know the big the big looming question over\nAll this is like can we get more consumers to drink beer at a time when beer sales are you know overall relatively flat because\nYou know if you think about it just like a bar you can stick more cats in the wall but that doesn't mean you're going to sell more beer you still have to get more consumers and your door right so the same kind of rule or theory applies to the to the broader industry yeah you can have ten thousand breeze but if you're not creating new consumers than you know who's drinking all the beer\n[noise] Chris ... dot com joins us today as we celebrate cigar October fest Chris let's take a look at some of the breweries\nThat are really starting to expand that have been successful in their own markets that maybe\nYou are are are a ton of shores are ... that are listening should be on the lookout for I Know for example Brooklyn Brewery started in Brooklyn they've now grown to do I think we're twenty nine or thirty states across the country but give us some names of breweries that are really starting to grow\nThat we may be able to find their products that we haven't been able to the last number of years yeah for sure\nUm there are a few that come to mind a you know if you think about uh now that the the trend is obviously more local right so a lot of these companies that are growing um tend to have tighter distribution footprint so access to their beers a for a lot of your listeners are", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Cigar Dave", "city": "Boston", "day": "21"}
