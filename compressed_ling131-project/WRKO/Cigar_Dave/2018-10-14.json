{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "To the state level rate of seven thousand dollars a month so what happened is the nursing home is taking the five thousand dollar annuity payment plus or two thousand dollar a month income they do allow for an allowance off of her Social Security it's about a hundred dollars\nIt's not much okay but\nShe was able to pay the seven thousand dollars with the new the payment and her income OK mhm covering her expensive the nursing home\nSo let me put this in perspective if she lives one year and the nursing home out of her annuity they're going to take sixty thousand dollars five times twelve is sixty thousand right right instead of a hundred and Ninety thousand dollars if she passed away after twelve months\nAs long as the state level Medicaid rate of seven thousand dollars a month is satisfied and her her case it is the family will get the remaining payments for years worth of payments to the legacy so the remaining for four years of payments we'll go to her legacy\nIf she didn't do the Medicaid complain annuity almost two thirds of her money would have been spent\nOn the nursing home right if she has three hundred thousand dollars a nursing home cost a hundred and Ninety thousand a year ... well that's almost two thirds of the money right so it's another option that's available you can you can writing Medicaid compliant annuity\nFor a single individual as well you don't get the full coverage full government pay but you save about half the rate you know if the if the monthly rates fit you know fourteen thousand a month in her case\nHer state level rate was seven thousand in the commonwealth of Massachusetts She saved in half the money\nAnd all she had to do is impoverished yourself using the only financial tool that has the ability to take that presence over over the five year look back which is a Medicaid compliant annuity so folks I'm just telling you right now\nIf you know somebody in the situation that's in a nursing home that's paying private pay rates and they have assets left please have them call us had them call so we can walk through what their rights are I mean I had I had a client before coming to see me go to two other law attorneys ... attorneys\nI mean I'm not an attorney they do a great job\nAnd ask their financial adviser and maybe a couple of other financial advisors I think they ran through a couple advisors as well of what they could do and none of them could give them the answer is that you just have to spend down not to say that there's not a elder law attorney is out there that are you know don't or that know about the Medicaid complying annuity of course there are\nBut what I'm telling you is that it's it's not as known about as it should be the opportunity to have the ability to protect the assets when you have a plan for that five you're look back\nOr slow the spend down rate\nYou know drastically if you haven't planned for that five year look back you can do it for a single individual as well okay ... like I said you don't protect all the assets so just real quick again if you know somebody that's in a nursing home a single individual a male or female\nThere in a nursing home their private pain for that nursing home between twelve and Fifteen thousand dollars a month and they haven't found any alternatives to help them protect some of their assets\nGive me a call ... give me a call at eight five five three one eight eight three eight seven or eight five five three one eight eight three eight seven\nAnd we'll walk them through how the Medicaid complying annuity works where we convert the assets into an income stream over their life expectancy which impoverished as the individual\nIt cuts the pay rate from Fifteen thousand down to the state level rate of seven thousand per month and then what we do is we refer you to a company called brighter connections\nAre grace Murray enjoy these\nAre two gals they're great friends of mine they're they're based out of the north shore but they work all over all over the commonwealth of Massachusetts\nAnd um they will help you complete the Medicaid application to assure you you receive Medicaid um they're they're fantastic I've been working with them for years and they really they really know the program and what they're doing so\nThat that's the plan David hope we hear from families that are in that then that situation so we can help them\nHey Jake we've got about time for a question from our mailbox that we get from our listeners and this is from Clifford in Milford\nAnd he wants to know are there really investments available today that will allow me to protect my principal and still allow for market returns I mean it sounds too good to be true\nUh [laughter] well I can tell you a clever yes sometimes it does sound\nToo good to be true but yes there are there are financial tools out there today that a lot of people are using for their retirement accounts a you know their four one K. is their IRAs for three bees and you've created this amount of money over your working thirty forty fifty years of working or whatever it is right\nWhatever that amount or if it's qualified or non qualified it doesn't have to be retirement accounts but if you want to protect and preserve it in really not not minimize the risk but he limit ate the risk\nBut also have the opportunity for market like returns\nThere are financial tools that will allow for that\nI work with one right now with a nationwide and J. P. Morgan where we are not afraid of throwing are ah are using our naming are are sharing was that we use uh we have one with nationwide and J. P. Morgan right now that we're very confident in\nClients have been coming in with double digit returns based upon how the market has been very bullish over the past\nYou know eight nine years and they don't have one dollar of their money at risk and they are seeing market like returns in the double digit\nA category so it is based on how the market performs if the market goes down or their principles protected but at the market does perform\nBased on on what index you'll elect they have the opportunity for growth so if that is something that interest you Clifford feel free to give us a call that number is eight five five three one eight eight three eight seven and we can walk you through that\nYou have a provided a lot of great information today Jake any final thoughts as we kind of

... backyard barbecue and safety harbor right across the cigar city\nUh input Alice county and uh we extend wishes to him and his entire family as well ... thank you for reminding me but there was an attack on men there is no\nQuestion about it and\nYou can say that the Christine\nBlasey Ford lousy forward however you pronounce it that coming out after capital that that was the start this goes way way before that there has been an attack on men\nAnd on masculinity going back forty fifty years but it is intensified the last number of years with this contrived statement called toxic masculinity\nThat all of a sudden if you are born a male\nThen you are born with a toxic masculinity gene in your body [noise]\nThat when you are born a mail from the time you come out of the womb\nThen you are a future sexual predator your future criminal that's how some of the ultra ultra left wing feminists the nut cases the wacky doodles that we're seeing on the ultra left the socialist lives that's exactly what we are seeing now\n[noise] and so we are seeing not only that but we have seen the intersection of political correctness with now the war and attack on men\nLet me give you a perfect example of Winston Churchill one of the great leaders political leaders in history one of the great statesmen of all time went in the face of the German Nazi invasion\nHe stood tall inspired instilled confidence of course it help if the United states of America and other allied nations including Canada and the other allies but really the United states let's face it United States and secondarily Canada we came to save\nEuropean ally that says there's no ifs ands or buts but he instilled confidence saying we shall never ever ever surrender\nWinston Churchill always with a cigar and the the whiskey in hand\nAnd what does amazing is that\nHe was very popular during the war after the war's popularity waned when he was out of office number of years later popularity sky rocketed there's no question that his popularity probably higher today than ever except when it comes to the whack a doodle ultra lives\nThat now seem to\nHijack the political correctness conversational maneuvers let me give you a perfect case in point\nX astronaut Scott Kelly\nHe and his brother astronaut Scott Kelly alpha male no ifs ands or buts you're an astronaut you go to space in my estimation you're an alpha male when I was growing up in the sixties late sixties early seventies I mean in Nineteen sixty nine I'm you know it was five six years old\nAnd I remember when man landed on the moon I remembered Neil Armstrong Buzz Aldrin Michael collins Apollo\nEleven I remember vividly at my grandmother's house washing on their big dizziness black and white TV with the space age remote can everything was space age back then\nEverything was space age if you had tang was space age remember the the drink tank and I remember everybody said that every product that came out a new microwave radios transistors it's because of the space program that a lot of it was\nA lot of it was but I remember everything was space age it's a new amount of space age men are radar range microwave a new space age refrigerator space age from everything was space age\nBut I revered those asks what they were gods and today I still think those guys that are exploring the new frontier exploring space\nThere alpha males you going to pull seven ten geez you're an alpha male no question about it so Scott Kelly\nWas making a derogatory derogatory about making a negative in a polite way I Will say negative tweet negative comment about President Trump taking a victory lap at the swearing in the public swearing in ceremony of justice\nA Kavanaugh at the White House earlier this week last Monday\nAnd Trump took a victory lap and he kind of went after some of the critics send that I thought Trump did a fine job I had no ifs no problems with it whatsoever there was an attack on Capitol\nBasically labeling him a rapist a sexual molester a sexual ... without any evidence\nAnd when people say well wait Christine Blasey Ford we she gets the presumption that that uh she's right and he's wrong no it's not how it works I'm Sorry and don't give me this BS well it's a job interview therefore the presumption that he is innocent until proven guilty does not exist no that's wrong too\nAnd the witnesses that she named every one of them including her very lifelong best friend a Democrat by the way came out and said I don't know I don't ever recall meeting Brett Kavanaugh we weren't at that party never happened\nAnd admitted that Blasey Ford's people pressured her into changing her story and she said I'm not going to perjure myself pull the FBI everything gotta give her credit\nTold the truth told the truth tell the truth you know get in trouble very simple\nSo Trump took a victory lap no problem okay in of course you've got the the lame stream media going after him and saying oh he was not magnanimous he was he was spiking the football oh please spare me\nWell Scott Kelly excess route Scott Kelly to each one of the greatest leaders of modern time sir Winston Churchill said in victory magnanimity I guess those days are over\nNow you look at that tweet okay he disagrees with Trump\nI thought it was actually a good treat I I thought hey look he made his point it didn't ... just basically said look quoting the great Winston Churchill and victory magnanimity and ah you know I always felt that when you're when you don't spike the ball you win gracefully you lose gracefully\nMean Martin levy a a great hall of fame football coach the Buffalo Bills had him on the show many times used to always say when you're when act like it when when you lose you lose

campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky\nFor miners are full then you got to get another one um good problem to have by the way it is a good problem beers a good problem when you have lots of it um but you're going to need some basic uh you know high drama there's you're going to need a bottle cap or a big spoon um and then patients\nOr you get a rush the hands of time you know so once you start making your beer the whole process takes about thirty days so uh you have your official ... day which is usually three to four maybe five hours um\nAfter that you let your beer do its thing and just ferment I'm a you know to a certain temperature for a couple of weeks and then usually be bottle age or bottle condition after that you could also go to a keg which takes another week or two [noise] well\nThe nice thing about home brewing as opposed to well first of all it home brewing is one hundred percent legal as opposed to distilling your own distilled spirits meaning vodka or whiskey moonshine\nAnd there's a research a couple of reasons for that but first I think probably the most important is\nHealth and safety right right yeah I was just telling you could you could ah really met some people up like you know poisoning on\nWhere you could let yourself up as well you make a right to bomb because I think there's two types of alcohol there's what ether alcohol and evil and one is deadly if I'm not mistaken correct yeah one of the deadly in one you can drink one right okay right right and the key is you want to get the one that that you can drink it's okay but\nThere's there's much more a regulation and that's why you see these moonshine are is it's technically illegal but home brewing is legal\nAnd Jeff ... or correction counter Meyer the master brewer a ... a hundred percent legal very different than distillation as we're talking about absolutely get that might nice in close I absolutely even closer I absolutely much\nBetter or third time it was a jarring so very big difference and uh what type of people you've seen coming in is there any specific age range or is this more men than women using give us an idea of who's coming in here to actually learn how to home brew\nUm for the most part it's twenty five to thirty five year old man and a little bit older I'm mostly people that have found that they either want to make a cheaper or they want to make something that they can't get at the breweries and they they want to have something seasonal for themselves they can make\nFor each season for each day for each month or for an event or for a party they want to make their is they want to have their own thing going\nWell I think there's also something very cool and I think maybe a little bit a romantic about saying I'm a home brewer I brew my own fears where you have people at a party and you can sample some of their beers and people can actually be very proud of the offerings that they're serving absolutely it is you know I think there's something there's that there's a wow factor to that\nOh yeah you could address flavors you can do anything you want so you can make it a stronger as light dark heavy or you know barrel aged or whatever you like\nNow one of the people that we know mutually ... who is a is known as fill our blend um these cigar Dave show my producer for many years now helps us with creative services he is a home brewer and it comes in here purchases home brewing supply\nAnd he is he's told me he said I I finished very high I didn't win the award yet and of course I resident resident about it all the time\nBut the one thing he always tells me is that he loves to be able to experiment and try different things and I think that's probably the one commonality with home brewers is they want to try they want to have fun it's a hobby\nIs making some great here five years is that one of those ... are pretty they're they're off the charts\nWhat so what makes a beer off the charts how does a home brewer able to be able to Bruce something to say that's off the charts what is it is it the ... is it how they all\nIn perspective and personal taste you know I I like uh I like I'd be a some people hate him you know I'm not a big stout guy uh but that's awesome people ever drank so to make a chart you know that\nFluctuates right either you know is relevant to someone's taste I don't know how you can do that it's\nIt's all personal taste\nBut overall what about the beer did you enjoy\n[noise] I'm probably the Roma the that that the clearing is to Chris Chris ... um\nThe overall flavor and you know his last I did I think there was a a a mango or something like that in there and it was\nJust full of flavor and again there is no right or wrong so you could have five home brewers coming up with an eye PA everyone's going to be slightly different depending on what they put in and and and I guess the hops they use and the other ingredients so really it is it is a custom creation\nAlso their equipment in there Bruce style and\nHow they specifically I mean the temperatures can change everything temperatures a fermentation temperatures of your mash everything can change in each brewer has different preferences based on what they want out of it she can make a dry or you can make it a little ... body can give it\nMore ... you can give it a little bit more bitterness fatty house really early so I mean each brewer knows what they like to know what they want and I mean there's there's great beer in every style every little bit is a little different but it's wonderful in its own way\nSo we have learned so far that before we even get into the science of brewing and home brewing before we go through the different steps you need some key equipment and Jeff as you mentioned Bruce

October fest in cigar October fest is the perfect way to do so perfect excuse for us to light up a find cigar do some beer bearings and I'm looking at for magnificent beers here at average Bruce company downtown St Petersburg we're talking about home brewing water one the science\nOf brewing it is becoming increasingly popular hobby\nSo this week we're talking about everything you need to know about a home brewing the equipment you need the process so we welcome you back to avid route company downtown St Petersburg with Jeff Keller the owner and master brewer counter Myron I should say gentleman met\nThat downtown St Petersburg always experienced day renaissance in terms of restaurants and and housing and and activities but it's really become a beer epicenter a cool little micro center of beer activity\nTotally it is it's it's grown over the past few years um we've been here about four years um you know green bench kind of started the whole revolution around here and bring in some different unique beers and and uh uh you know cycles following cage and they'll sale work saint Pete brewing\nUm they instill going\nAnd you know what ... put up a map or at ... dot com where we will put little pins on all the different breweries that are in the downtown St Petersburg area actually we're looking at one right now it's called the brewery bay I didn't realize just looking at the entire cigar city area Tampa Bay area the number of breweries\nBut ah there's a ton of 'em and downtown St Petersburg so if you're considering a visit\nDown especially between the months of like December and march perfect time if you're a beer enthusiasts some great places great restaurants and great ... right here in downtown St Petersburg so we'll outlined that no\nOne of the things that you gentleman mentioned that ruling is all about time and temperature and as we learned in step to matching of the grains you basically steep the grains whether it's wheat or whether it's cracked barley in hot water between a hundred and forty two degrees and a hundred and fifty nine degrees and you both said\nTime and temperature that's all brewing is about it's crucial\nAbsolutely I mean if you if you don't go long enough it's not going to convert all the starches and then you're just going to have less alcoholic beer\nAnd if you go to long which isn't too much of a problem but you can start extracting flavors you don't actually want so now we're hour and a half and the temperature you one for the body are trying to find is really important to kind of nailed down and taking notes being sure you're you're repeating so if you make the same here again you can\nEither not make the bad beer again or make the good beer again\nRemember those composition books we used to have back in grade school where you write everything down they were kind of bound I Would say if you're going to be a home brewer that's a good investment to make because Everytime you make a badge I Would assume the exact amount the time the temperature so you could look back and take notes and say you know\nI liked that particular beer but let me try one degree more for maybe another few more minutes see what that does and then you hit that a ha moment\nWhere you get exactly the formulation you're looking at the brutal fulfilling\nI'm sure it is you're at and so when you brought your\nEverything the exact same way absolutely have you know that I have an entire rest of your book full of just notation throughout the whole process I met his garden I noticed a very large fault as you walk in here and that is garden nobody's getting near their tractors there's patrol dogs right right around the secret service [laughter]\nAll right so time and temperature key elements in brewing now after you match the grains and you said roughly what an hour mhm okay what's the next ...\nWhich is basically a fancy word for renting the grains out for you to get where you need to rent sat sugar out of the grains that you've converted the starches\nBurning sugars and now you're trying to rent salvo sugar's out into another pot or take the grains outta that pot and rent the sugar side of the grains you just want to separate the grains from the show so you want the sugars out you know you want the sugars in so that you can use that to boil\nOh so you want to share a tragedy just remove the grain oh so once the grain is done you don't need it anymore I don't know my understanding is that many breweries when I was up at shipyard brewing they told me that uh they sell the remnants\nOf the grains to various farm so they have continuous reuse in the area yeah you can make dog biscuits out of it too and I'm sure as\nMy chickens love it they'll go crazy after a while and then they'll they'll gorge on them\nSo it's like a dry just becomes like when you try it out it's just dry up it's pretty empty of any nutrition but it's just ... there's chickens like it in like that or compost compost is another alternative okay actually a here have a I met him angel we give our grains do for his goats really mhm\nSo basically there's no waste whatsoever constant recycling that's it All right fantastic\nSo ... you are reducing the sugar out of the grains you're getting rid of the grains your retaining the sugar and the water\nYeah which is called war ... W or team now\nWe I've actually sampled the war and when it's warm ... tastes pretty good it's like a ... it's like a sweeping rain T where we're at a did even brewing and ended up Mike Brian said try this I said boy the smell was incredible\nYou could actually make a tea or a soup out who it was actually I thought it was just drinking in of itself we we\nBottled a couple of bottles of a I'm a black guy PA and it tasted just like a stout a non alcoholic style because it doesn't have any alcohol in it um so it's it's a pretty good stuff\nSo the word is basically the ... the sugars with the water\nOr after you have matched the grains so the ... the sugar out and then you create the war and that's going to be the base of your beer absolutely okay so that's you're basically that's your stock that's your your ingredients right there that's the ... that starts the process so now that you've got the war\nWhich usually is tastes sweet got these sugars in there you next go to the boiling component what does boiling do\nWell boiling does a couple of things that sanitize it it evaporates things that you don't actually want to know jazz\nJust feels so things just things you're not actually going to need or just evaporate and also that rates water so it condense is it so you have a stronger sugar solution got stronger war yes gotcha also what it does is as you add hops throughout the boil the heat and the temperature actually", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Cigar Dave", "city": "Boston", "day": "14"}
