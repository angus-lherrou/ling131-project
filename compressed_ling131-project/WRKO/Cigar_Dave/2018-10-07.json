a million dollars in assets and he wants to know are there any options to protect moms assets\nAnd they haven't planned for the five you're look back and they have not yeah right okay All right yeah 'cause I think you mentioned to the gym or this to me before the show so what do we have the ability to do folks this is something that's not advertised\nBut we have the bill there is a financial tool in our industry today that has the ability to uh protect assets from the five year look back ah when there's a husband and wife are with us so what we can do is uh the state of the commonwealth of Massachusetts will allow the healthy spouse who missed the wife\nThey will allow this supposed to protect your her home as long as she can live in it plus a hundred and twenty five hundred and twenty thousand dollars an asset so if they have a half a million that means three hundred and eighty thousand dollars is subject\nIs subject to the husbands care okay well we don't like that right obviously three hundred eighty thousand dollars that's a lot of money so what we can do is we can take that three hundred and eighty thousand dollars\nAnd convert it into a Medicaid compliant annuity okay\nWhich which what that does is it converted into an era ... income stream over a period certain amount of time which we usually do sixty months so that brings you know three hundred eighty thousand divided by sixty equates to six thousand three hundred and thirty three dollars\nComes over to the healthy spouse in the very next day the husband can qualify for mass held\nA that is an amazing thing and we do it all the time\nOkay so we do have time for one more question and let's just go and take it a we've got Julie and hang up she said that uh my parents are in their mid fifties

uh the the products of if you if you don't use it you lose it\nAnd so what I actually prefer is what's called the R U L it's index universal life and the reason is the reason that I like the idea well over the traditional long term care insurance is because you have liquidity option to the money if you need the money for emergencies mhm you have um [noise]\nUh you have the option to use the debt benefits value for your long term care needs while you're alive and we all know that the insurance value or the death benefit value is always like you know three to four times\nUm the account value so I mean it's it can be tremendous opportunity for you and if you don't use the death benefit value a it is a death benefit to your ears so the whole you don't use it you lose it operates option is out

station\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News' Sean ... just\nFew hours ago\nBecause the enemy fire is coming at us fast and furious and know where do we have to find the war on men\nIn the last few weeks we've seen the attacks on judge Brett Kavanaugh we have seen the feminist send the Democrats and are women all over the country\nWe believe her never mind if they even get the facts of the story we believe her that's like saying Ted Bundy mass murder\nAh that's like saying uh Charles\nAnother mass murder we believe we believe he's innocent we believe him or we believe before even know the facts\nI mean there's just like women saying are men would be saying I Believe Ted Bundy is innocent he is innocent never mind about looking at the facts never mind about looking at the case in this country we have\nOf a justice system that you are presumed innocent until proven guilty that's what makes us different than other countries around the world especially dictatorships\n... former Soviet Union look at China\nOh they have to do is say yep you you're guilty you're going in the Clinton Gore and the former Soviet Union you're guilty you're going to Siberia for forty years of hard labor doesn't work that way we're all of a sudden if you don't like someone or like something you said yeah he's guilty throw 'em and throw them put them in Leavenworth and move they throw away the key\nWhat has happened this hash tag me too movement has gone and transcended into hash tag every man is now guilty to movement\nAnd what we saw over the last a week ten days going on with the Senate Judiciary committee\nEspecially the Democrats going after capital I don't want to make this political but the fact of the matter is it has become political it is transcended now the feminist movement into politics and do unabated attacks on men\nInto this nonsensical term toxic masculinity every way we look as alpha males as men as a as boys\nWe're all under attack by a relatively small percentage of women in this country of feminists and what we've witnessed this week where people stopping up and down and crying and marching and and and and and walking into restaurants in elevators\nLook at me when I'm Talking to look at me [laughter] I suffered I was sexually abused well my answer is I feel badly that your work\nBut this has no your tastes has no bearing on what we're discussing just because you are sexually abused or you were in some way shape or form attacked that doesn't mean that every man is guilty\nWe must look at it as a case by case basis that was you know\nI mean for most authority an alpha male pleasure maneuvers and of course says the alpha male and chief I make sure that our voices are collective alpha male voices are heard I stand up for men I stand up for males\nAnd what I've seen the last couple of weeks is just ludicrous people women have lost their minds even men I'm seeing the results of the feminist movement on the east west divide Nablus boys and men boys that start off his was the five boys and become ... adult men\nAnd we're seeing them jumping up and down and rallying and we must believer and leave us with this is a tragedy we must believe her\nWhy do we have to believe someone let us look at the evidence and the evidence that has been presented and my feeling was and I stayed at this I think last week or the week before let's hear what Christine Blasey Ford has to say\nShe's making this accusation great she also stated that she had witnesses let's hear what they had to say\nBy the same token Brett Kavanaugh has the right to defend themselves to stand up for himself to refute the chargers are the allegations being made against him and it's very simple the fact is that for people that Christine Blasey Ford bossy Ford however you want to\nTalk of any kind of like the steam lassie Florida who come [laughter] [laughter] I have four ... but I mean maybe maybe they forgot they were there\nThe Fort witnesses all said no we don't remember Brett Kavanaugh we weren't at this party did not happen but that's not good enough for the feminine is not good enough for the Democrats because it isn't just about toxic masculinity that nonsensical statement this isn't just about the fact that\nThey want to go after cabin all this is about they disagree with the fact that President Trump has the right to nominate the Supreme Court selection of his choice\nAnd they the Senate Republican controlled Senate can go ahead and approve their ... provide their consent and vote on allowing Kavanaugh to become a Supreme Court justice they don't want the court tilt to shift period that's what it boils down to\nWhat we're seeing now is an owner baited\nOutrageous attack on men when the feminist movement began fifty years ago\nWhat did they say the first thing they said is we don't need a man we don't need a man we want equal rights now granted here we are fifty years later can anyone really say that women are being discriminated against let's look at the empirical evidence\nThe majority of college graduates are women the majority of graduates in post a a post undergraduate degrees master's degrees PHD's doctoral degrees attorneys lawyers are women\nWomen today you know companies become CEOs there's no limit on what they can achieve nobody's keeping them down nobody saying you have to stay around ... in the white picket fence in the house you can't leave the house nobody saying that\nThere are more opportunities for women today in the broadcasting industry in which I'm involved I Will tell you there are more women today that are running radio and television stations and in major executive positions\nThan ever before probably more than men I mean there are\nTwo major broadcast companies that I can think of too of what struck a broadcast companies easily broadcasting and cumulus media\nWe have affiliates on both of those both those groups both run by women CEOs are women were problem\nNobody saying oh we have to put a limit on how many women can that can service she goes nobody says that nobody says I'm not going to vote for a woman because ah she's a woman nobody says I'm not going to go see that position or go to that authority because she's a woman it's nonsense and it's complete\nUtter ridiculous nonsense women today are the best position they've ever been in there are no limits there is no glass ceiling that is nothing more than a fabricated term that the feminist need to continue their their crusade which is exactly what it is against men\nSo they've gone from we don't need a man to now we must have\nStraight men we must do a mask delayed men\nThey've gone from we won equal rights too we want superior rights and that's really what it boils down to today I always get a kick out of out of a specially feminist they all are ... we want equal rights we want to be treated the same\nYou take a woman out I've never I don't take off a nut case feminist\nThat I don't do but I've got friends of mine said oh yeah I took this woman out you proclaim for the whole dinner she was a radical feminist blah blah blah blah blah and I'm like well why don't you just end the date right there he said well but when the check came\nAll of a sudden they weren't feminist anymore they wanted me to pick up the ... equal rights no no no no I had to pick up the check meaning they had to pick up the check\nSo what the feminist movement has gone from we don't need a man\nTo basically we must cash great men\nWe want equal rights do we want superior rights and what they want to do is essentially now they want to ... and ... every American male that is born period and every male ... adult male\nThis is transcended it has gone from an equal rights moving on with the politics of the justice system and now all of a sudden when you see these people that are jumping up and down in these protesters there was a protester\nEarlier this week in the capital and she was wearing a shirt T shirt with the slogan men are trash\nNow think about that for men are trash\nThat's a blanket statement all men are trashed this is how radical how ludicrous how nuts they are\nIt is absurd can you imagine if a men's said all women are trashy hors ... what happened this is outrageous how can you do that but when this woman wears a shirt that says men are ...
