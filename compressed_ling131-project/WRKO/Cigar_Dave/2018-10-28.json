because there is a financial tool that is available today\nThat has the ability to beat the five year look back and protect assets for either the healthy spouse if there's two spouses or reduce the private pay rate\nEssentially in half\nIf your or if you're paying like I said private pay for nursing home\nLike I said I that that's a long conversation to have we've talked about it on other shows\nBut if you're in that situation where a nursing home is is an issue with somebody that you know that's paying private pay\nNursing home between twelve and Fifteen thousand dollars a month I'm telling you right now take down my number right now get that pen and paper eight five five three one eight eight three eighty seven\nHave them give me a call and we will talk to them about how we can help them a sense they qualify for mass out the Medicaid\nAnd protect a portion of their assets if not all the assets okay right but yes planning for the unexpected is extremely important you know planning for retirement in itself\nThough is is is important you know planning for life in general when you get to the point of not working any longer\nIs is of course important you know so we always tell families when they when they come in and see us you know the first appointment that we have just to kind of reiterate well first of all you gotta call us right so you've got to pick up the phone and give us a call\nEight five five three one eight eight three eight seven you set up an appointment you comment\nThat first meeting that we have is just going to be an open dialogue between you and I in your family to discuss what your concerns are what your needs are and where you're at in retirement\nAnd then what we're going to do is we're really going to break into your portfolio and figure out first of all running in the morning star report you know seeing seeing what types of fees your pain do it or the analysis right\nFigure out the standard deviation right how you know and what what does that mean well how much your asset how much your return can fluctuate\nEither down or up you know what are the you know if\nYou have an eight percent or or if you have a five percent return to talk for just standard deviation well that's not that's not good it means in deviate quite a bit so\nThe bottom line is you've come in and we'll do our morning star report and see what the average return is we'll see what your greatest thirty de Los ... could be you know we had the two thousand eight where we lost thirty eight percent and and essentially a day and the S. and P. five hundred I mean when that was a terrible as an off year\nBut you know we we want to know what your greatest opportunity for losses as well as what your greatest opportunity for earnings are um ...\nWhat would you say what would you say is the most common things that are your clients should bring in on that first meeting I mean aside from I Am like they've got their whole shoe box of life if you will or with accounts or various account acts return all their okay statements\nA tax returns are extremely important you know that's another thing we're going to do it we're going to do a tax analysis right we need to see how we can lower taxation of retirement so there's two things that can really affect your return we talked about this earlier\nTaxes and fees right\nSo you know you got to make sure that you're not paying ridiculous fees\nAnd we'll put like I said well put your portfolio through the uh you know through ... will scan scan your cart as we talked about for right he will scan your cart through the uh scan your portfolio make sure that you're not paying too much and sees\nA and really break things down and then will establish a plan for you you know that has a good income guaranteed income for life making sure that your rebalancing not take it on too much risk\nSo ... so let's just say I've got X amount of money or you know all these accounts and stuff and but my dream of what I Want to do retirement exceeds what I have\nBrought in so what do you tell us then and I mean do you say well you if you want to uh trying you know expand your income here are the options that you can\nDo yeah yeah so so we'll we'll try to see what well first of all you're just basing it on your own calculations right\nMost most likely they're not accurate right okay you know like I said we we had a lady come in a you know that was taken a thousand dollars out of her ah IRA every month and ... and she had worked out that\nShe could take a thousand dollars out of her IRA based on her returns every month and she would run out of money at age Ninety\nWell we were able to practically double that\nAnd she was never going to run out of it even if she lived to be a hundred and twenty\nSo she was astounded she was in you know ... she was on cloud nine she was a dream Lee yeah very so that you know that we're going to you know that's also we're going to look at your income ... how we can\nHelp you benefit your income so these are all the things the Social Security analyze or you know analyze what is the best tend to take Social Security if your financial professional has not done these things with you\nIs just basically offering investment and putting your money in certain places and you've got that grocery list but\nYou don't have the baked goods that homemade lasagna in writing that plan then then you don't have a plan and you need to\n... to ... ritual feasting at the rock the cave and the ... mountains near high for Israel so we're talking here goes back Thirteen thousand years the Egyptians were known to brew beer in Fifteen sixteen William before the Duke of Bavaria adopted the right spot\nI Believe on ... ... ... say that again rain who could be right who ... their ... I've got a brush up on my door and she hopes couple I've got two German shepherds so I should be first in German find who's crippled a purity law the oldest food quality regulations still in use today\nWhich only allowed ingredients of a beer in Germany water hops and ... and it's still in existence today and as a master ... first of all tell us how did you get involved in becoming a master brewer how to uh I just wanted to say you know what I Love beer not want to brew it\nI don't know from the master brewer but I Do brew beer for a living and loving very much um my\nCareer kind of started out as a hobby that spiraled out of control into a career\nOr like many people they they ... brewery that yet\nBeer and then next thing you know you're a professional\n... beer at home for many years I worked in kitchens and so Fifteen um decided it was something that I wanted to do full time went to see bill in Chicago and their sister school dome and Nick\nAnd I worked for Thirteen Years for a company called the iron he'll brewery in the Philadelphia area okay I'm open for their locations before I a jump ship and came to live in this place\nAnd how did you uh uh hook up with a J pop and\nUm I was introduced to Jay Paul through a close friend of mine case he used the head brewery at ... right down the street\nGotcha so uh you made the trek from the great white north down to the sunshine state and there you go and I should say the aromas here this is interesting because it's not just like a a brewery you've got incredible food here ah and so you've you've really married\nThe food aspect with the beer aspect are very popular place in the short eight months that ... works has been open\nHas so far so good we have a ... son\nOr you go it's all about uh enjoying the good life and certainly beer ... part of the good life let's talk about first of all a beer the ingredients that we talked about basically there is a barley\nThere is a we there's water there is useless talked about making beer the basic ingredients and the process\nOkay um so those are the four main agree and says you said um we start with what you call it matched say you crack open the has the barley in the week you still getting water for a certain amount of time and what you're doing is you're converting converting all starches into sugars reason you want to do that as the east which is a life force the beer can each ... each other's\nOkay I'm which creates alcohol so after you converted you strain of the liquid from the grain into cattle you boil it you had the hops which are basically the spices of beer that give you some bitterness balance of sweetness and also flavor aroma\nI'm cool it down and put in ... he sees the sugars and produces alcohol and see a two\nMan made it sound very simple but it's really not that simple because it does take time a soccer two primary types of beer there's loggers and ... what are the differences are the type of east used\nTo say yeah so there's two families ... forces the beard is you know it's a living thing it was used for baking for making spirits and especially when it's for making bread but the two main families or loggers nails a logger he likes to to work very a\nCold and slow and it affects the flavor of the finish beer very balanced and cleaning Chris I'm elite use a little faster and warmer and produce a little bit more the spices and a free characters and Esther is in the room listen such now\nEl takes longer to brood than it does lawyer correct um\nL L for men's quicker the loggers lottery or the other way around it takes a long time that's why we see many people that are home brewers they do ales they don't do larger sluggers are much more delicate okay loggers what a top fermenting or bottom fermenting or that his bottom from it bought it for many in the air was the top fermenting she'll give us a time difference between ale and logging\nOn for the same here same alcohol content to average it'll be about two weeks or the same loggers about for\nNow many people think logger is a milder a beer than an ale is that correct I'm\nIn a way it's it's more different it's more cleaning Chris you have less of a fruit spicy character as ... as you get with typical ales\nAnd so when we look at most of the big selling are we talking about Budweiser corps and ... those are primarily loggers terrorists such\nAnd then the ales which we've seen really a renaissance on the craft brew side of those have just exploded no we talked about ales there's some there's a pale ale then we see like a what a red tail and then there's an eye PA India pale ale to talk about those differences\nUm you know they're they're all they're all the same base in a way they're ... fame you based red tail you're having a lot more of a ... that's going to be a primary flavor and what how people associate with that there\nAre ... are really characterized by the use of hot so hops for bitterness flavor and aroma now I ...\nBack before there was a refrigeration ... weren't the hops the PDAs created to preserve the beer correct in transport you back with the British are merchants way back\nYeah that's true it was basically a beer born out in that city they they use the hops as preservative it's for the long voyage um you know from England to India and um you know when all the\nWhen when all the soldiers got back to England they wanted their India bailout and they wanted a stronger happier beer 'cause that's what they have been drinking and it kind of birth that style\nWhat are the most popular beers around the world is getting us which is what a stout out yeah so we've got stout and porters and everybody looks at those their dark thinking it's going to be super super a strong and that's not necessarily the case so\nThere's less alcohol and Guinness and there's an Budweiser\nI did not realize that so what's the difference between a talking about a ... an importer\nDownton porters are both ales they're very similar um I think especially the one thing that makes a difference to me the Puerto no doubt it's just out has a rose to ... Porter doesn't but they both have the dark mall and the roasting Neddy coffee chocolate character to them\nAnd we've got a couple of those supporters in ... in the beers that will be sampling I'll go with that list in just a moment also another beer that's become very popular we fear tends to be a little bit softer on the ballot yet we're seeing more of that\nEspecially in this climate down here um you know more refreshing um softer um you know suited for warm weather drinking\nWe have seen an explosion the last guy to be ten Fifteen Years in terms of craft ruin people just like cigars they want the boutique cigars and they want new varieties and new tastes and uh and styles and for many years it was\nBudweiser it was ... was Miller was perhaps some regional beers you didn't see people drank beer they were they stayed towards one brand\nIt was really more of a commodity and then about Fifteen Years ago we started to seek ... come in a different crowd where people said I Want to try things that are different that are unique\nI Want something more flavorful a little bit more complex and all of a sudden this craft industry has just exploded and it's changed the face of the beer industry permanently\nAgreed um I think you know a lot of industries craft in general not just here I mean\nYou know Twenty years ago how many different kinds of coffee could you get\nRight now you see you know types that Iran or you know everything\nAnd speaking of Brett I'm Glad you brought that up and I should say that uh we're conducting cigar October fest Megan tasting maneuvers from these radical works in the heart of the border city the cigar city of ... rather for master brewer\nIs our guest this entire cigar October fest mega tasting show talking about a bread than and some interesting case\nFound this which I thought was really interesting there is a couple of things number one is planters\nPeanuts has unveiled a new beer called Mr I. P. A. nuts and they've teamed up with a new one whistle brewery to create their first beer brewing with walk up to an ... hops delivers a citrus aroma any hints of honey roasted peanuts I Would think they probably want to drop the honey rose to be an actress right in the beer so that's kind of interesting yeah\nAh and another thing that I saw\nThat there was actually a company that if I can find it here that is actually starting to brew beer from used bred mhm so you can really make beer from any rain correct\nUm or is that kind of an experimental really way out kind of beer\nUm I think it stems from a old Russia America ... boss\nWell here it is it's called a in Canada yet a and it is a shuttle recalled second harvest they route five hundred cases to raise funds and call attention to Its Food rescue efforts throughout Canada the beer is called being a slice B.

explosion of pumpkin type beers uh over the last number of years\nYou think of ah just older breweries in the northeast Sam adams that started out there and just so many other southern tier brewing makes a very famous pumpkin but we're seeing this now\nIn mass pretty much every ... every way our question is does article brewers come out with a pumpkin beer they they don't and they won't I'm not a fan of style not a fan All right well you can definitely smell the sweetness on here will say cheers on that\nIt's got some sweetness I don't see any bitter twenty four on the I'd be use I'm getting no bitterness whatsoever federalize orange or amber colored to it and by the way one of the cool things [noise]\nIs that when you buy this you know they don't have a six pack they normally you buy a six pack\nA you know beer comes with a six pack but for you into especially for Utah it comes in a twelve pack one for you at eleven for your eleven wives so it works it works out but this actually\nYou know what this is a pleasant beer pretty balanced the top ...\nWhat's incredible you really get that sentiment and uh and the nutmeg and the all spice on your art so now we're going to go from Utah to this is an interesting point you're familiar with funky Buddha bring in South Florida\nThey have really in a short time come on the map we had them at our cigar Dave alpha pleasure fest on the flight line as our future beer last February they were great to deal with we had them on for ... and I said I Love your beer gotta get you involved they came up love the event\nAnd there are two beers that I Want to sample today that I picked up that I've been on the lookout for one relatively new it is the funky Buddha sticky treats its blonde ale with vanilla and the second despite the Buddha key line pie flavor cardio when you think of Florida\nYou think of ... known crabs key line pie is very interesting because funky Bhutto was bought by constellation brands yep about a year and a half or so ago\nNobody knows the sale price but I think it's interesting when you got a giant like consolation coming in and snapping up a crap for your bird so very interesting right so let's open the fuck have you had the sticky treats but I have not well I'll tell you just looking at this thing my mouth is kind of water in here\nSo again it's got a very light almost a straw pale yellow to it which is kind of interesting\nWe'll say cheers see if I can smell the vanilla [noise]\nNot a sticky treat issues I thought it was going to be a it is a a rice blonde ale brewed with plenty of sticky vanilla\nThat says it taste that's not a like your favorite rice cereal and marshmallows snack I'm not so sure about [laughter] I mean I Love their stuff they have some other beers that are just incredible I'm trying to remember the one that I bought off to figure out what a trying to remember what I bought last year ah we\nWant to find out here the small batch let me see if that was no there was one in their limited edition no way I'm going to find it because it was severe that just was so off the charts\nBut I ended up buying\nA oh some of their maple bacon coffee poor yep that I that was one of them that I bought but there's another one here oh here it is the sweet potato casserole now they say it's on vacation it's on hiatus now that is phenomenal let me take another set of the sticky treats [noise]\nYeah I'm not getting the rice crispy treats right now we're gonna try to key line pi if I open up the [noise] the beer first open that up I was in the bottle\nAgain this as a almost a golden cue to it now when we think of key line by line got some ... some sweetness [noise]\nAlright well six years on this one [noise]\nNow that's got some interesting flavor characteristic as pretty as I'm getting the darkness ... a little bit of that line partners not as much sweetness but I'm getting a it's almost like a sweet tart yet at the very end at the towards the back of the tongue in the back of the pilot yeah very interesting what do you think I like it yeah it's pretty\nGood ... you get that little line and then almost a gram cracker estimates and yeah and ...\nAnd ... and again funky Buddha you know it's interesting because\nThey've done things that are kind of different and I think that if you're going to be a craft brewer today you got to do things that are certainly different than everyone else and they've come up with some interesting flavors I was talking about that sweet potato casserole they've got a blueberry ...\nThey've got another one called French toast they're more moral blood orange ... also on vacation\nBut they're big beers down here now is they're pineapple beach there hopped on I. P. A. and their Florida half of ice and okay enough you know if the pineapple beach is very good but they're four and a half of Eisen is off the charts very very smooth next up we're going to go to southern tear brewing\nDown just about sixty miles south of buffalo I had the privilege of visiting southern tear brewery and southern tear distilling last year", "show_name": "Cigar Dave", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "28"}
