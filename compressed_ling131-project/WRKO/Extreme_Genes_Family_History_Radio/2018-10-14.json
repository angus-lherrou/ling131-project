{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "I don't know I mean some tendency would just really need it\nYeah I think predominantly of people who do so do it because they need the money right if you need the money and I mean really if you need it then well there's nothing to consider their just turn it on and get that thing rolling but if you have other sources of income or savings you do have a wholly different decision on your hand\nAnd what we found is that people who turned on that benefit early anyway even if they do have alternative options often times and I mentioned this before the bat until\nThey're doing it because they think well hey listen I've been reading the newspaper Social Security is running out of funds I better gets mind before it runs out right or get myself grandfathered right before things go askew\nAnd again guys yeah Social Security has been making headlines because yeah it is under funded but\nLet's face it unlike a lot of federal expenditure Social Security does have a tax directly related to it think about it and your paycheck there's no like\nForeign wars tax there's no like highway system tax right there is no border security tax I mean all of these could are contentious issues for one reason or another but they are to a certain extent\nLike not directly funded by a direct tax Social Security is it's not going anywhere will it change of course\nYou're telling me when they take this as scary any money out of my check they're putting in a bucket that's only for Social Security\nThe problem with that bucket is that it's not you know being filled fast enough there's too much money going out the door just so what are they going to do will they re Social Security tax probably are they going to raise the age of what you can collect\nMaybe are they going to change that calculation of term and how much you're going to get I don't know the idea is that something has to change but Social Security I mean at this point it's like it's like a foundational pillar of retirement so many people are depending on it so for anybody running around with the tinfoil hat thinking Social Security is because so many turned off\nYou know I Would directly argue with you of course again you know all of this was last in the fog of the future but with so many people counting on this as a benefit I think it's pretty safe to say that Social Security will be there in some way shape or form so then as a result if we're going to use that as an assumption\nWe've got to be really careful about what it is a or sorry when it is that we collect because when you collect determines how much you'll get over the course of your lifetime\nAnd especially if you're married and things yeah even more complicated right\nBecause like let's use some basic math right in math can be like a like a what you're going to say numbers but like I take off my shoes and that's that's all I Need you need your toes for this okay yeah I get the chess now\nWhat's at stake I mean let's do some very rough rough math\nIf my wife and I are each entitled to two thousand bucks a month that's four thousand dollars total over the course of the year that's about fifty grand\nAnd if we live Twenty years which were expected to will collect oh effectively half a million dollars over the first decade and then a million over the two decades\nSo it's like you have a bank account down in Washington DC worth a million dollars and I'm not even factoring in cost of living adjustments right the catch is is that to get that million dollars you got to live long enough to get it right\nBut what's at stake when you collect early you don't get all of that money you take an actuarial penalty it's twenty five percent\nNow this math isn't exactly accurate but in spirit it's close enough\nIf I'm foregoing twenty five percent of a million dollars that's no small potatoes man that's big money yeah and if I instead weighed because of course every year I wait beyond age sixty six or sixty seven whatever my full retirement age is beyond that point I get an additional eight percent a year which can accumulate to as much as thirty two percent more\nWhat's an extra thirty two percent of ... million that's a lot of money to some Tatar right there so this is why I'm trying to say that people shouldn't be that casual with making this decision because it's not like there's a few dollars at stake it's usually especially if you're married hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake\nUnless there's a lot that goes into this decision\nWhat kind of goals you haven't retirement how much do you have a say monthly budget what other sources of income do you have in retirement how long do you expect to live I mean a lot goes into this and I want to be clear I'm not suggesting that each and every single person waiting till seven day\nAll I'm saying is that I Would highly scrutinize what I have available for options within the context of my situation\nAnd make sure that I'm absolutely correct uh collecting the best way that I possibly can\nIf you're like me I don't want I guess I Want to know what are my options what's the best way to collect what's the worst way to collect guys Thirty years ago you had to sit down with paper and pen and spent three and a half days figuring this all out\nThe good news is now technology is so like fine and dandy but you can actually crunch all these numbers really literally in moments the problem is that it's hard to get access to that type of software we have access to it here in our office and we make the output that software one hundred percent\nFree now the unfortunate part is that we can't literally sunrise to sundown Ron complimentary Social Security reports for everyone\nBut for our next ten callers I Want you to dial eight eight eight Arcadia and ask for complimentary Social Security report\nThis is not generic information if that's what you want please do not call this is for people who want specific info on the very best way to collect Social Security for their own situation is a customize report you will love it for some people it will be a game changer I Hope it changes the game for you\nBut in order for it to change the game you've got to be one of the next ten callers\nAsked the folks that answer the phone to get me my complimentary Social Security analysis it's yours if you dial eight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two just for the next ten o'clock is on guys eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two\nWhen people are looking for a financial professional especially someone who can help with retirement planning Mike ingest what qualities and we're looking for here I think it's so hard because I mean you know how much I Love Amazon and I love Amazon\nIt's like the fifth time you've mentioned Amazon and the shows that I\nHad to get people are just turning and now it's a knife or nearby island Amazon because you can go on there and you can read reviews\nAnd I think that that is like so tallying like oasis products like rally grain all look there's like three thousand or amuse on and give me the good the bad and ugly\nThere's no website for view on financial advisors I mean there are different ways you can check up and see if they do and I think that are much down various things like that but just knowing like hey did this guy and he's talking about is he trustworthy is he going to make the most optimal best retirements you need for me there's no one's box\nYeah in fact if your securities license the SEC in most cases prohibits you from being reviewed sharing references giving testimonials and for some good reasons they want to prevent people from just connecting you to their uncle Sal who's like thrilled with your service right\nUm so some of the regulations do make sense but\nYeah I mean usually when I buy something right\nI look at the reviews and that's not just Amazon stuff if I could be like buying a car I go to Edmunds dot com what are the experts think right I'm looking at different ways of gauging the strength of my decision based on what others have done and it's difficult to do that with financial professional ... the good news is is that there are some ways around us and to\nWrap up the show today I Would say here are some of the things that you could look to do to find for yourself away to achieve some trust number one while there isn't a lot of that you can do in terms of finding reviews on financial professionals you can find out if they've been fined censured disbarred penalize brought under disciplinary action\nUm especially if they're securities license so you can check in with the SEC Irfan route to look up that information those websites Republican free to access\nFor people who are just strictly insurance license that can be a little bit more tricky you got to call the state but the idea is that that information is available for free to the public and you can find out if the person you're working with the squeaky clean and on the up and up or if there's some dirt bag who's been you know hit a bunch of times by the state for doing bad things to nice people\nAnd I think a lot of it it's kinda like when I Need finding a doctor you gotta just go in and talk at the purse and see what type of feeling you get are they using all the jargon in particular to confuse you or are they speaking on your level\nPlain language helps working with an independent fiduciary also helps\nMake sure that everything is education oriented and that it's focused on you not on them not their fancy pants knowledge not this you know bright and shiny investment that you've never heard of make sure the conversation is focused on the important stuff which is you and what you want to accomplish and I think there that's where trust is born\nThe guy financial planning is a journey it's not easy that often starts with a conversation I Know that we'd be honored here to start a conversation with you the number to dial is eight\nEight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty\nYou've been listening here's your retirement on track and on time and remember that number eight eight eight he's having his twenty three forty next week for more with Mike I'm making those
