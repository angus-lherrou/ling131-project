{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "And the question I like to ask people as well how much of that you know money all these riches that you've accrued how much of it you're actually going to be able to keep\nI I think that you know people just don't think about that in the first place but then a lot of people just have days um you can see 'em perception that in retirement they're going to just being a lower tax bracket because not earning income anymore\nWhich is usually for a lot of people not true I mean if you don't have a lot of money saved you're going to be living exclusively off of you know say Social Security or maybe a modest pension\nThen yeah maybe it's possible you'll find yourself in a lower tax bracket but let's say you've got a big pension or you're going to be collecting several of them or you accrued such a substantial nest egg that are um these are going to force your hand by the time you're Seventy\nIt's actually very possible that you could find yourself in a higher tax bracket\nAnd the reason for that as remember guys I mean be Trump tax cuts are temporary for taxes or ... facto going up in eight years because rates are going to return to where they were in twenty Seventeen which are higher relative to where they are now\nAnd then beyond that I think most people know given the amount of debt that this country is in the taxes have to start going up\nSo the question is should we be kind of continuing to do away our tax obligations to a future in which we imagined that taxes could possibly be higher\nThe thing we tell people all the time is that when you look at that statement you're going to really change the way that you look at that number that's on the front cover 'cause I don't care if you're I our race has it has two hundred thousand or ... or eight hundred thousand in it\nThat money's not all yours you you think of it as being all yours but your Uncle Sam has a lien against it right\nYou do and you don't have a ... account\nSo have you done everything that you possibly can I'm Talking about every legal loophole shelter whatever kind of techniques that we have to lower our tax obligations\nSome people out there and ... and they're like oh yeah I've done that but if you've just been using like TurboTax that's not tax planning\nThat tax prep that's what you do every single year to file an April Fifteen when we actually looked forward how our armed he's going to affect me as my Social Security gonna get taxed or not what kinda bracket might I find myself in about a year twenty twenty five\nIf you don't have the answers to those questions I promise you in a lot of cases tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars are at stake because\nWell one of my favorite attorney friends he likes to say that to some extent paying taxes voluntary mhm and what he means by that is that whether or not you take every single energy and effort to protect yourself versus just kind of like let the Iraqis have its way with you\nThere's an enormous difference between those two worlds so I Know for us in our clients we want to make sure we done everything possible to lower that talks tax obligation\nAnd you can get for yourself that same information and peace of mind as well just come on him to see us for consultations say Mike I Want to do whatever I can to reduce my taxes and you can start that today by dialing\nEight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two\nAnd I get excited about this conversation and I know people are probably saying you get excited about taxes make anyone I [laughter] what a nerd I Am [laughter] I really do\nBecause it's ... I like your approach yes taxes it's something we have to pay but\nListen you've got some room in there to make sure you're not getting owned by Uncle Sam and that's refreshing it's reassuring I think for people to know that there are some options you can really make a difference\nIt's it's not terribly difficult I mean we just start with the small ball stuff you know if you're making contributions to a four O. one K. remember\nUnder the Trump tax cut environment you're dodging a lower tax bullet today\nRight well we know the taxes are going up and for some people to taxes are going to go up even further because of their retirement situation so you might want to be augmenting what you're contributing into that four O. one K.\nFor some people are going to put in maybe less and instead funded Roth IRA or off four one K. instead we have other clients that are doing things like Ross conversion which is Hey Mike I suspect that my taxes are never going to be this low again for the rest of my life I'd rather get the tax obligation out of the way\nYou know if we assume that taxes bounce back or go even higher you know what's at stake we can calculate all this\nYou know we pay for the most expensive world class software that does all this mess for us we make it available entirely for free without any strings attached we can actually measure with some very basic information what's at stake and for some people it's nothing they don't have to make any changes but for other\nPeople I promise you it is literally hundreds of thousands of dollars it will be wasted an unnecessary tax simply because they didn't get the information that they so desperately needed up fun when there was something to do about it\nYou know it's funny to make is that I mentioned earlier that we have at least for seminars every month and some of them very low bad and won the seminars we do it's exclusively on the topic of taxes in our time and what you're going to pay\nAnd I love that there is such a diverse crowd that comes out to see as we had people listening in that room with you know five plus million dollars in there because they don't want to pay taxes and we have people sitting in that round with two hundred and fifty thousand dollars because they don't want to pay taxes either that they don't have to pay\nTaxes is probably like the one political issue that unites us All right\nWe all come together and says hey we don't want to pay more\nRight if I go into a room and say make America great again right like it's going to be Hatfield McCoys right but if I Walk into a room and we do every single month who wants to pay less tax I mean it's uniform now I suppose the people who love paying tax don't come to our events in good for those people will\nPay more there is nothing preventing you from sending in bigger check into the government at ... at the treasury does take donations you can count on flights and jets company gets account [laughter] I don't know if they actually do that\nBut I sure would be nice but you know we didn't intend to unite people who have this same common concern they feel like they're paying too much and you know world could patriots we love this country and the blessings that provides but at the same token\nIt let's not pretend that all of our tax dollars are used as efficiently as possible is a lot of waste and it it makes paying taxes so hard at least the way that's the way at least in part I look at it so I say that people listen\nYou have to pay your fair share we're not doing anything illegal here and I also want to make clear you know we're not going to replace H R Block or your CPA people still need to help you every single year with that basic tax filing and your generic tax advice the part of what it is that we do is financial planners as we can measure to some extent if there is a better path to take\nIdentify it for you measure it for you I mean I can promise you if we're able to save you substantial dollars in tax near future will become very good friends\nSo maybe we have it that we can call just a a friendship test as opposed to a consultation\nComing out of friendship test with us dial eight eight eight Arcadia make time to see us in the office for complimentary when our friendship test well we can determine maybe how much money in taxes we can save together that starts by dialing eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two again that's eight eight eight Arcadia\nThe website if you want to check this out just told you about the seminar at the dinner seminars they hold all throughout the year about for a month and\nThere are seminars that are strictly tax focused if you want to find out more about those check the website Go to on track and on time dot com or call them all the folks there at Arcadia financial group making Jess in the team will help you understand\nWhich seminar is best for you eight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty to like you said something earlier I wanted to follow up on you mentioned the software\nThat you had that helps people understand their taxation also risk\nOur people ever surprised when you use that software and you know it spits out your risk assessment let's say you have to show that to someone and they just can't believe it\nYeah I Would say that really is more so the case with our tax software only because I think a lot of people when they do any kind of financial planning it's it's mostly investment related\nSo most people released somewhat familiar in terms of projecting out a certain rate of return and how their assets can grow over time you know the the basic stuff\nBut in terms of really measuring how much you're going to paying tax and how much that liability a cruise to over time some people have never seen anything like that at all and for some degree like that's kind of the fault of my industry here\nYou know most people that you run into whether it be at the bank or some of these big brokerage houses they're they're strict focus their their expertise and discipline is just portfolio management\nAnd they don't talk about taxes and so the thing is we say to people listen portfolio management is huge I mean we say it all the time\nIt's one of the bigger cornerstones of financial plan\nBut how much of this money is going to go to Uncle Sam let's have a conversation together to figure that out dial eight eight eight Arcadia sit down with me and one of the members of the team will help you look at making that plan as strong as possible dial

blogs we had a conversation the other day about this idea of getting sideways with your family now most people realize that that term tends to mean that you're getting on their bad side for one reason or another but in the Geneva logical sense\nWe're talking a whole different way of looking at it\nYeah it definitely not getting on their bad side it actually just a different way of looking at it it's kind of a broader\nPerspective than just looking at that one person in the family that you that sense from you know I'm really into civil war research I just absolutely love that time period\nAnd when I discovered that my great great grandfather had served for the union out of the state of Ohio I've got a little bit more digging and found that both of his brothers had also served in the civil

France\nWhen they had picked up the last ... passengers before they were going transatlantic\nAnd it's post marked ... Titanic wow yeah so I mean we don't even think about trips now you know you get in a plane or a train or you just drive but think of the anxiety air ancestors must have leaving all that family behind\nAnd how are they detail in this I mean I almost feel jealous when there are people that have family that have come over the past hundred years because they have stories a majority of mine came over in the sixteen hundreds of Seventeen hundred right I don't have any stories I'm\nElle because the records aren't usually that strong the Mayflower is kind of an exception to that because there was a great documentation of the entire experience for the pilgrims and the strangers\nAnd all those who are with them but you think about it I think a lot of people who who say wow I I Can't go back that far because I have a lot of recent ancestry and it's tough to get things safe from Eastern Europe\nBut what a history you could put together if you just collected the stories of the trips across the ocean and made a little collection of that\nRight and not everybody came into the port of New York I mean they they think of Ellis Island they mean before Ellis Island is you know\nCastle guard hassle garden you through other ports Boston Philadelphia Portland Maine I mean all the way early white and I mean the ... the person that was tracing their research and thought that their ancestor was going to come into New York and it was New Orleans\nNew Orleans and and that's to me is a mind blower I mean it's rare right but it does happen head count on the wrong boat [laughter] I thought you said no you ... it was New Orleans ticket folded right [laughter]\nAnd it was the language barrier occasionally yeah maybe that was the case but nonetheless they had to find their way north pretty quickly\nSo I I guess our listeners if you have stories about your family coming over and it's not obviously written in the passenger list it's not written and the naturalization or I could have your written it down if not why not write so important\nTo share it with your kids I mean if you are an immigrant yourself and you're listening how did you get here sure you may came on a plane maybe did come on on a boat and write it down first hand recollections of yourself or your parents or grandparents that's a golden treasurer genealogy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Extreme Genes Family History Radio", "city": "Boston", "day": "21"}
