{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Of course is to think about health care costs and taxes neither two giant issues that I Know you address as you work with your clients let's talk healthcare first\nThis is an expense that I think sometimes catches people off guard and retirement ...\nCatch people off guard because there's a a fundamental misunderstanding as to who pays for who's responsible for health care and retirement and also a lot of financial advisory firms the banks are Wall Street out that's the kind of ignored this issue\nYou know just financial planning that term you know I work with a financial planner I have a financial advisors issue so loosely\nBut I don't think people know really what it is that it means you know so many times old and it really does mean for people is oh somebody's helping me with my mutual funds and my IRA but it's very rare that the conversation extends into well other you know just as important retirement issues like like health care planning\nOh yeah and that's a huge part after the mortgage your mortgages paid off our entire man healthcare is the number one ... focuses on and if you have a financial advisor and you're talking about and unity or life insurance or mutual funds\nThat's great but are they talking to you about health care about maximizing says ... taxation issues in retirement that's what financial planning really is to make and I anyways that's why we put ourselves out there as a whole list planners 'cause we look at the whole plan in retirement\nRight we have to coordinate all these various issues you know we've talked for the majority of our time today on the show\nAbout how it is that we have confidence in your income plan and how it is that we can have confidence in\nThe strategy and we have for our investments the right on the heels of that once we achieve that confidence and we have that part of your plan mapped out we're gonna have to talk about well what what else remains that could cause for war or goals here that could set things are skew in retirement\nAnd just yeah I mean that the biggest one of all has to be a health care is so I think what would be helpful is to break down what people should be aware of and maybe what planning still needs to be done in order for them to have a full spectrum plan\nYeah number one it's not cheap [laughter] that's the first thing I should be aware yeah so if we're looking at a huge expense for health care and retirement how do you plan for that how do you do that but still provide for income provide for the lifestyle you want and retirement\nWell that's a great question why is it a big expense Megan so I I think we should maybe just take a step back here and kind of break this down a little bit expensive come in two flavors number one is just that the cost of the insurance itself right Medicare which is gonna be your primary payer in retirement\nIt apart a is free but part B is not a nominal cost you're looking at about it's about a hundred and thirty dollars per person per month\nAnd that's not big money but Medicare doesn't cover everything there are gaps okay in those gaps specifically need to be addressed and that's why people will purchase\nMet a gap or supplemental insurance and the ideas of those plants can actually vary wildly and cause depending on how extensive your health care needs are I've seen people pay as little as like fifty bucks a month for a supplemental plan\nI actually random somebody recently who is paying over three hundred dollars for a supplemental plan wow so I'm going to cover everything yeah and then so if you're I'm In a marital situation where each paying a hundred and thirty bucks for part B and then we're paying way one or two hundred dollars each you know for a supplemental plan\nYou take all that into account throwing some prescription refills and co pays\nIt's not unusual for somebody in retirement especially if they're married to be spending you know upwards of five hundred to a thousand dollars a month on healthcare that's and that's just for the insurance itself that that's a that's a pretty scary number\nIt is and I mean a lot of people's bank once I get your retirement you know Medicare is going to pay for me it's not true non in total they're still going to be a lot of expenses so how do we ... a plan for that\nIf you have questions about health care and retirement if you don't have a plan if you don't know the best way to protect yourself\nThat's an excellent reason for us to have a constitution to sit down and look at what it is it you've done well but trying to find where the chicks in the armor might be for you it might be health care as a result\nIf we're able to help solve this problem for you well then maybe that's where your confidence will then come from so let's have that conversation today if you have questions about healthcare set up a consultation with the Arcadia team the number to dial is eight eight eight Arcadia\nThat's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two\nFrom healthcare Mike and just I Want to shift our focus to taxes now that's another enormous topic that must be addressed first accessible retirement right you don't make it I think we talk\nSo often about what the market's doing rate of return house my performance semi beating the market all these things and we don't spend a lot of time thinking about well when all is said and done we invested so much and now we have so much more hopefully right so we've had these games we've made this money\nHow much of it do we get to keep because for most people these games their performance it's inside of Iowa raiser for one cave or broker to ... it doesn't matter where the money is not all of those those rewards are yours to keep some of it belongs to your Uncle Sam\nYeah there are different types of tax classification for accounting without boring you're listening to us you know when the favorite phrases we say around here in the office is that an IRA it's an aisle you to the IRS\nMeaning one day that money sitting in your IRA you got to give a chunk of that over ... Sam\nHey and if you're up there bored and you can go back to sleep okay I mean I mean the IRS loves people who find taxes boring because generally speaking they the more you ignore taxation the more inadvertently at least that you're going to be benefiting the IRA\nThem or think that you make any you don't have to be tax expert yourself but you need to seek counsel and hate to tell you seeing a CPA it's probably not going to be a not\nWell the issue with CPAs are courses that they're looking backward right they're trying to help you file for what was done last year and what was you know what happened last year is in the past so what's more important where you have more flexibility is in arranging your affairs for the future\nYou know just one of our favorite attorney friends likes to say something akin to paying taxes in this country at least to a certain extent is optional man\nAnd what he means by that you know we're not talking about Al Capone stuff right we're not committing fraud I don't know I mean the thing is is that there are rules right\nAnd there are loopholes and there are credits and there are deductions and their shelters and there are all these things that you can do that you can utilize to help reduce your current tax bill your future tax bill\nI'm all sorts of tips and tricks\nAnd so the idea is have you identified all of those that would be appropriate for your situation or you just hoping that maybe somehow you're stumbling into them\nBecause I promise you the difference between taking advantage of all of these techniques versus just leaving it up to chance can often sometimes be tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in unnecessary taxation and retirement\nAnd like we see a lot of people that the ... education works out so we have and they say well retirement I'm going to mean a lower tax bracket anyway so I shouldn't be asked concerned about it but they're not taking consideration they're going to be collecting Social Security or you know for one case or IRA\nAll that stuff they're going to have to pay tax on so do you think you're going to be in a way smaller tax bracket that cannot be accurate\nYeah in for a lot of our clients it's actually fall since so just as an so it doesn't feel like hyperbole all given example of how it's possible to pay more in taxes and we believe is necessary let's say that you're approaching\nAge seven day so maybe you're sixty six or sixty seven something like that and you're trying to wind things down come up with an income strategy\nWe also know that come age Seventy and a half of those four one K. is an IRA is they're going to be subject to the two are MDs you're required minimum distribution so and just a few short years the IRS is going to force you to take money out of those plans\nWell here's here's a a an idea\nFor the next eight years we're going to find ourselves Mitch sees Trump's tax cuts meaning that you're in a lower tax bracket now then you'll be in eight years and so the IRS is going to force me to take distributions in eight years at a higher tax rate well maybe I should just pay some of those taxes now when I'm In a lower tax rate\nBecause the taxes the taxes the tax in other words I can pay those taxes now I can pay them later I can die my kids are going to pay the taxes I mean there's very few ways to actually of aid the IRS entirely at least as it pertains to a ... retirement accounts\nSo what we have to do is look at what's available to us very closely let's look at these Trump tax cuts let's look at the tax code the shelter is the ... the credits let's make sure that we're utilizing every single one\nAnd weighing the differences because the great news guys is that yeah this is confusing in a little bit boring but the idea is that the technology can tell us\nIf we should be taking advantage of those Trump cuts are those Trump tax cuts now\nOr just ignore them or if there's a certain credit that we should be using or not in other words we can figure out relatively quickly what tools we have at our disposal measure the impact and if they make sense to put into place hey if it's going to save us money on our taxes\nWell we should just about be able to be best friends with that software because any opportunity to save a buck is an opportunity we want\nTo try to help our clients take advantage of if you're interested and utilizing every technique and tools to try to out Fox the IRS as best you can and your retirement future give us a call today the number to dial is eight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight

renowned story Taylor Kim white camp\nAnd Kim this past summer just had her audience in the palm of her hand she's having a laugh at one point and literally in tears and another time talking about her family as she was growing up and and also discovering her birth family\nAnd a Kim ... as you go through your stories and I know this is the case quite often where you know you need to exaggerate for the purpose of certain types of stories but when you tell a real family history story how much do you make up how much to you enhanced it\n[noise] well if it's a family history story or a story that's really important to the family history that you're trying to preserve a you know it's important for me to make a distinction that I Am an entertainer\nPeople pay a price and they come in and sit down and expect to be entertained\nWhere somebody that studying genealogy and wants to make their stories attractive to their family but it's really two different things and yet there's a common place where we all should try and make a good story better\nRight and so in that vein I you know I just wanted to say that when it's really important thing I don't embellish greatly I may I details or historical facts that I found out that kind of fill out the story and I kind of view it as a tree you know the roots are the unshakable thing\nThe roots are names date times occupation\nAddresses yeah children children's names and so for sure and then it comes up and branches out and the branches are the stories and all his treated as been told to this point and it's somewhat maybe twisted\nWe know that all of it and he had it down through the ages edited sure depending on what's happening what you know culture or whatever\nAnd who you are right [laughter] you know it's amazing if\nYou look at a text books on now compared to a textbook in the sixties it's shocking some of the changes that are made history is literally being rewritten\nI don't at all but a branch at twisted branch coming out of those words well that can just be because uncle how our dead but then when we were living and she\nTold the story to make herself look better sure it's human nature yeah well her children heard it and they passed it on so and I say branch it that's what I mean as ... things that twist it part of history that just a natural evolution of the history of the cabinet down\nSo that these parts of the stories then far I think as we've all seen somewhat like a game of telephone right\n[laughter] that's [laughter] that's a very good analogy\nSo the roads aren't shake up on an changeable\nThey're kind of the bones the accounting of the story and yet the branches which has been passed down and then what you're gathered yourself but if you build your story and you want to build on\nThat history that you know and the and shake roots of what you found hiding in and leaves and the food and the flowers on the train is what makes people stop I had never once during the season\nHeard anybody say oh my goodness\nPull over I have to take a picture because the branch on that tree is stunning right\nIt's always believe it's always the beauty of the leaves at the for the flour and those are the little tidbits you can add that in Bangladesh\nThose are the things that you can kind of talk and read and do your story that make people stop\nAnd want to listen that make people stop and want to say hey why we're here at dinner how that story again about your great grandfather and what he did when he worked in the minds and you know I'm just pulling hair so those are the things to add that our lovely for instance I'm going to give an example\nI have a story called the sixteen dollar intense and shoot the true story but part of it happened in a different time but it kind of comes full circle and another time so I push those two things together they are historically accurate and the timeline does not matter it's about a suit\nAnd it's the teach a lesson to my grandchildren plus it's on an album\nBut my grandfather he worked in the coal cars\nAnd he would take picks she did this extra during the holiday season and he would get along pulling up pick the get the ice out of the bottom today the trap door cup and dumped a coal\nWell that's great right but I went and did research I found out about what train went through where he lived I found out exactly how you would do that I found out that they actually have patches of calcium that they would spray and I added that to the story\nRight because historically it's correct it to the embellishment that does not shaker towards the branches or trying to dig up words but it adds to make people leaning in\nSo when you talk about embellish meant then you're not talking about making things up what you're doing is you're adding things that were part of their lives at the time that makes them a little more human\nExactly now let it be clear if you paint either an amount of money I Will make things up [laughter]\nYeah and I have known\nAnd unknown for ... ... talk about my uncle alarm and applying sled and I'd say a third of it is true that people know straight out\nBy the time we get to the and this is an absolute tall tale sure I Would never make up a suppose it back to stick in the story and make it better when it's about my family when it's something that's going to be passed down in history and and building upon the genealogy I Would not do that", "show_name": "Extreme Genes Family History Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "28"}
