{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Anything we're missing in this puzzle Mike\nFor sure um I think when it comes to planning for retirement and I think it's been the theme of the show today is that we have to expand diversification and its application certainly beyond just how it applies to the stock market\nYes you can be diversified by owning a lot of different companies a lot of different funds that counts it's diversification but if that's the only diversification you're engaged in are you truly diversified at least as far as the retirement plans concern\nJust and I will continue to always make that argument that the answer is probably not because there's a lot more to retirement planning than just what your portfolio is doing\nThere's all sorts of things that are trying to separate you from your retirement income once you've retired we like to call them the bogeyman by just these forces that are you know hey there are things we want to spend money on\nSandy beaches golf dining out right having fun spoiling those grandkids around the holidays those are all cool for the most part right but then there's those bogeyman\nWe don't want to give the money but they're looking to get our retirement income anyway and they come in the form of tax health care expenses and inflation and so when we talk about ah when we talk about diversification the question is\nHow are we prepared and what kind of tools and strategies heavily diversified ourselves amongst to actually keep those ... men at bay and I think that's where for some people that trouble starts especially like take for instance healthcare plans\nHow often just do we run into people who have actually considered you know what happens in retirement as related to health care net not nearly enough and there's some reason for that there is like this pervasive myth understanding that when we retire Medicare's going to cover all the bills\nYeah I'm not a lot of clients we see are weighing retirement age to be once managed care kicks in and they think they've reached out ... and it's great that we have to eliminate well this is what's going to pay for but you're still got the last time I look for you know X Y and Z and they don't realize that\nYeah it was just last week that we ran into this really really nice couple right so I think that she was a former schoolteacher and our other friend he worked for I Want to say was re fi on but he's also been a volunteer firefighter and continue to do that\nIn retirement which I thought it was fantastic right just good salt of the earth hard working like almost like Norman Rockwell type of people right\nAnd the thing is being a teacher and a fire fighter they're going to have pensions right and they're pretty humble they're not big spenders and so they're saying to you know to me in this meeting\nYou know Mike we don't have a lot of concerns and so this nest egg that we've built in you know to their credit they had built up a couple of hundred thousand dollar said for themselves we don't figure that we're going to ever need it so why don't we just take that money and hide it someplace for the benefit of our ... of our kids\nAnd I said boy guys I really wish like a fairy tale over that simple but the thing is if something happens to you from a health perspective you might need that money man or if medical costs a housing costs property tax any number of things happens in your financial future that funny money because that's how you're looking at it might\nBe like very needed money for mom and dad never mind the kids so we need to think about that differently and it was interesting about this conversation at first they were totally perplexed what do you mean like\nYou know having worked for the school system um it looks like for a number of years are going to stay on the school system plan but I had to point out well that's going to become your supplemental planned Medicare is primary and Medicare doesn't pay for everything I had to describe for them the circumstances under which Medicare bows out of the situation\nAnd there we had to introduce the concept of diversifying ourselves against that particular risk\nIf we know that we might have to pay out of pocket for things that Medicare doesn't want to cover well then we know what our options are we can maybe by some ancillary insurance maybe we can self insure and position certain assets that you have against that rests maybe we decide at some point to do a reverse mortgage against the property\nIf we ever and current event like that maybe we try to hide the money so that Medicaid will foot the bill maybe you do some of these things some combination maybe you just do one of them that's their choice that's your choice everybody has a choice but I think what ... like the the take away from this little story is that\nThey didn't even know there was a problem\nAnd I guess that's what I'm trying to get to I Wish that retirement planning where's the simple as looking at that portfolio and putting all your mutual funds and the right place\nBut there are things that we're going to definitely want to spend money on and retirement and things that we don't but if we don't want to spend money on things like health care or taxes or other unpleasant things you're gonna have to get educated on what those risks look like and more importantly what good Americans are doing every single day to protect themselves against those risks\nIf you need that same protection it's about time maybe we had a conversation called eight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty to see what the Arcadia difference can mean to you today\nMike ingests this show today on diversification eye opener for me especially when you were talking about taxes there Mike I wondered if you had any final thoughts you\nKnow we talked a lot about taxes today and um it's it's kind of central the some of what's been going on in our lives lately just we just took the boys are down in Virginia [noise] we'd never been I mean well actually you've been a couple of times right I have I've never been out of jail [laughter] I Know how very few jerk\nSo we did some kid related stuff we did Bush gardens but then we got away and did some like stuff for a mom and dad of course with the kids into we went to a colonial Williamsburg which I don't know if you've ever been there Megan\nHave yet have you had to have the pleasure I've never been always wanted to some of our listeners already know that it's like a a place out of time right so it's like I don't know like a hundred acres it's huge\nAnd it's it's a town that operate the same way that like it would have been in days I think in Seventeen Seventy five specifically right at the dawn of the revolution right\nAnd uh the people that work there I mean literally that's not their ... it's not they're not actors like when you go to the silver Smith shop that's what they actually do their silver workers right and if you go to the cobbler there or like the guy the wheel right who makes wagon wheels they legit how to know that stuff and and the town south is actually very prosperous today\nBecause their resumes look like you have learned [laughter] um yeah\nI Can't imagine but like as an example some like well to do like dignitaries is ordering like a like this like silver tea set they wanted like five of them and so they're literally making it all by hand and there's only I think they said like\nFor like silver Smith worldwide that do handcrafted like silver work and they're one of them and they were describing what they charged on my guys you get you make good money by colonial standards right so\nThey're very successful and it's cool because like I said it's not just people playing a role and you know using old Tommy language that they're legitimate mentally immersed\nIn the Seventeen Seventy five an era\nAnd when they they talk like you know Americans today I think that the Americans have Seventeen Seventy five lived in the stone age right like life was totally different how do people possibly get by without iPhones and air conditioning right\nBut they were trying to describe that people really haven't changed at all\nAnd what caused our country to go to war literally to shed blood was over tax and what's like well I Want to use the word hilarious but it's really not\nWhat King George got out of the colonial's is far less than what we voluntarily give our government today far less\nFar far less okay\nSo it's amazing how our government over the years has really just like you know pigs to the slaughter ... very comfortable with separating ourselves some are hard earned money\nAnd I walked away from colonial Williamsburg with a bit of heat stroke 'cause this was the week of July Fourth is really hot and the kids were miserable and all this other stuff so it was definitely an adventure but I walked away with this like when new spirit\nI'm going to do everything possible\nYou know take the spirit of the colonial's there who fought against you know tyranny and oppressive taxation we're going to do everything possible to help the people that we can touch\nKeep their hard earned money for themselves I Love this country let's make that clear but is there a lot of waste in our government spending\nYou bet and do we need to give them any more money than is necessary absolutely not so if you're feeling that Seventy and Seventy five spirit and you want to do whatever it is it you can't peaceably right to keep your own money in your own pocket\nYou've got to start investing in yourself to day and go through a process that will help you keep that money for yourself call let's let's see if we can be bugs here and help you on that class the number to call his\nEight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two [noise]\nYou've

welcome to the extreme genes great to have you\nGot a pleasure to be here thanks so much rapidly\nSo you've been in in the photo business for like thirty three years and I know your partner's been in for like twenty nine he's an engineer he's got a hundred and fifty patents and you've been doing this product from vivid picks called restore for like the last six years and this is really fun stuff\nYeah picks we've been around for six years we have been selling a software to improve underwater photos since we began or we sold that over a hundred countries courts store which pixels old photos and document has been all over two and a half years\nAnd it started going to get a little bit of traction so we're looking forward to sharing it with folks so having them give their excite\nYeah we're going to talk about this little thing we're going to do in just a little bit but I Want to talk about all the issues people deal with in preserving their photograph now you're in the process right now you've been telling me off the air of downsizing and moving from Atlanta to Charleston South Carolina\nAnd this kind of creates little problem for you doesn't it for your old photos\nSo it took a bunch of stuff so as you accumulate ... life and you go from a larger home to a smaller home\nWhat do you deal with all that and then we know from a photograph and document perspective that we need to be stored in a certain way and I'm going from the environment of having a basement\nAnd a freezer where I kept everything properly stored a new with a plug Devin book properly stored and now I I literally have a hold on\nA need to be able to buy your stove top and a half feet off the ground so that's funny oh I okay no gas mental are\nNo basement there so yeah I mean I'm eating and make sure that I properly store my photos\nThey don't have an addict there either do you\nWell we do and it might be warm up there which is not very good for storing photo sure I Want him to earn a yellow interact and not look so good\nYeah well you know we talk about this on the show all the time you know you got light and humidity and then the big variation from heat and cold because we are going into the cold weather now\nAnd this will cause another contraction of the materials and this applies to documents as well and then the expansion in the heat I mean it's just a really nasty things so what's your plan now in Charleston South Carolina after what you've done in Atlanta\nYou get crushed up so we move I stored every single one closet so at least I organized by possessions and the one place to going through the full scale\nAnd a little cough so and making sure that they're properly\nBacked up in multiple locations right Ben hurry cobbler son I have not improved all of my photos and I'll buy document so All right I've heard him to restore and now I've got everything in good solid digital back up\nAnd then I heard some of the things about photos are so many years we ordered double ... well you know I've got tons of double envelopes time to get rid of some of those I've got tons of images that just aren't that great so now they're going to get rid of the ones that weren't so great\nSo it's a process for ... like it's really the memories along what\nYou know it's true and I must tell you I kinda cringe when I think about the idea of throwing away any photographs but the reality is as time has gone on we have gone from oh you get a few pictures maybe in a lifetime right in the nineteenth century and then it kind of picked up in the beginning of the twentieth century and by the forties and fifties\nA lot more pictures sixties seventies eighties wow the duplicates like you mentioned in the bad ones that just come out those don't need to be saved there's no benefit in that and now of course we take photos digitally and we can take dozens if not hundreds in a day if we choose to\nAbsolutely and we are taking more pictures than ever before and we're not having access to them because they're trapped on our phone over Ninety percent of our images that we are taking her on mobile devices and then some of them were posting up on Facebook or really hard to be able to pull those things back down again\nSo the organization and it's important for the current stuff and then yeah really getting a handle on all the different photos years\nYeah it's a real challenge and then recently you told me about this you're visiting your mom who's a what like eighty seven or something now and you did this great project that I think makes so much sense involving a camera over your shoulders and a photo album\nYeah so what I did this I set up a tripod I put a standard digital quaint and shoot camera weighing down at a photo album so it was over our shoulders\nAnd then we just swept through page by page by page and she got during numbering relive all of those memories and now I have all of that recorded so now when I go back into the photo albums I Know the stories behind the photos\nYeah I Love that and it makes a lot of sense you know there are a lot of photos that have people who are not even related they're just old friends or college people you know somebody like that it's it's good to know who you've gotten those photos\n[noise] well yeah and you're able to get to your mother better than you knew before I mean that was just really following\nYeah it's a great time All right we've got to talk about this great deal you're putting together for people to get ten free conversions on their photographs", "show_name":
