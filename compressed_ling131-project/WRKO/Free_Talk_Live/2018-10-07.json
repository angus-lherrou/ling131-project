looking cigar [noise] you know I\nI guess that would probably call this a medium scout um you know it's it's certainly fuller than than getting a sin and more alcohol\nAnd don't you know going back to literary stuff that we're talking about there's an old Kurt Vonnegut book and I can't remember which one it is where he talks about his grandfather being a brew master and how all brew masters have a secret ingredient\nAnd so back in the day we always used this Italian brewers licorice and making Kalamazoo stout and we you know if you don't know that it's there you probably wouldn't pick it out\nSeveral years ago the government decided that we had to start putting that on the label so we do use a little bit of the spurs licorice not really for flavor but more for ... feel their\nUm so

John shook secretive we have a great new\nHere you go here's your Fifteen dollars an hour and no more Christmas bonus no more sales bonus no moral whatever generally the bonuses\nWould be like quarterly based on profit and uh or at least the companies that I've worked for where they've given well I'm kind of ... that was quarterly\nBased on profit and then there's all kinds of calculations ... if you are you not meaning you specifically but you being the employees met quotas\nAnd this that and here's rocket wait a minute bonuses that it appeared from when I was reading that they were talking about the money that interpretation of it was that their bonuses like every two weeks like what like just like basically I'm a only pay schedule you\nKnow is it or is it employee that gets the most or is it only the one for the ones the my understanding is that we're talking about at least with within the ... says it was a\nFour hour early employees\nYes so so it sounds to me like a warehouse workers there were basically they were referring to where it was it was might apply to other workers but most of the warehouse workers\nWhat I mean is do the bonuses apply across the board to all employees or is it only on the departments to get you know certain hold any facing the bonuses out for hourly employees at my ... that's not that doesn't answer that question let me see if I can ask it in a different way what I'm asking is\nWhen they got the bonuses the hourly employees that got them where they\nThey've been across the board meaning did everybody in a department get the bonus or was it only for the employees that actually did something out of the ordinary that that actually ... of a certain\nWay and the way and again I'm basing it only on the companies that I've worked for where they have given what are often referred to as quarterly bonuses and yeah but sometimes was referred to as profit sharing but it wasn't based solely on profit it was based on a bunch of other calculations\nAnd the percentage of profit but it was to everybody it was everybody okay and that was a percentage of what you had earned I see in the previous quarter based on this new calculations so the people that made more per hour so the supervisors\nWho were getting you know like one and a half two times what the lowest level people were getting I really\nThey were getting like two and a half three times per cent as much and the ball as because it was based on weight\nEarnings yeah my my understanding of it was that there were it was basically how efficient you were that during that period of time so like if if you were you have to I mean there was minimum like there was a minimum threshold but then there was the more efficient you were over that minimum threshold\nYou would get a bonus based on that so what you're saying you think that it was an individual incentive was individualized okay individual incentives sort of like a sales clerk a sales person might get\nA bonus for that is what you want your bonus to be\nKnown instill that they may as long as they're describing doesn't reward the individual right eroded reward but everybody for sort of generic target whereas with the individual you're going to get better performance on an index which is better for the company and the difference is what they were after from uh from from what I was under my interpretation of what I was reading right\nBut how are you going to give a warehouse worker a sells ... they're just put anything\nIn the ... if ... if not sales bonuses efficiency by ... you get paid if you're the top or or whatever right so you're picking and pulling and brave and things around and if you can do it faster than the other ones you get the bonus that kind of thing so there are ... and I never\nHeard of that type of bonus ever go out and I've worked in a lot\nOf their house and it's interesting um actually it's kind of surprising that you haven't seen that kind of a bonus you worked in a warehouse\nYeah they they pay hourly okay cause some places will pay by the the pick too\nSo you can like get paid based on your actual performance rather than just you know ... around for a half hour and then doing a little bit of work and getting the same amount of money so Amazon is known to do stuff differently though so it it doesn't ... really surprise me too much if they were to pay less uh editing NATO or the news articles\nNone of these articles that mentioned that they're getting rid of the bonuses explain exactly you know held the\nBonuses were the term but either way I details and even though the two types of bonuses you guys are talking about here are different\nThey're both still better than no bonus because you're still incentivizing at some level of performance if the whole team doesn't make you know make the uh the performance school\nAnd the whole team doesn't get paid versus the individual doesn't meet their performance will get that either way if you cut both of those types of bonuses opposite me it was one or the other right you still are just now you're just down the hourly employees\nAnd they have no incentive to be more than an hourly employee which is why hourly employees are the worst way to go because you'll always see\nThe sort of this natural incentive for the employee to do as little as possible right within that\nHour in order to secure the job in order to secure continued pay ... step out of work I can do to not get fired yep that's basically that's basically what you're dealing with\nAnd then the only way you get anything better than that is if their employees who seem to value their role better than the other ones right and go above and beyond what the the sort of the bare minimum is\nSo is there more from the story for the you know interesting detail about this what are some of the outrage statements if there are any I don't know if you happen to have is a detailed story with like you know some labor organizer complaining\nAbout this this is what I Would predict I actually got when I was reading comments and stuff on line now it seems like people were in supportive and saying something to the fact of well they're still they're still better off without the bonuses\nI Wonder about that because if it holds Amazon or does it really all cost Amazon more would they make this change I

decentralized money it's taken it out of the control\nOf the bureaucrats and the bankers and put it in the hands of the people go to our so again we were just scratching the surface on what it can do go to bitcoin dot com get started to learn more about it\nNow as we continue here Daryl you had a part of the story about the employees upset\nThat right because you you had asked the question of you know how are the employees responding and most of the articles don't really say anything about what the response is\nBut there is a very brief brief brief paragraph in a Bloomberg article\nThat says that workers who are already making Fifteen dollars per hour or more\nWill get a one dollar per hour wage increase according to a couple of people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified\nA I guess for their own protection because they're not authorized to speak to the press on this at a lot of companies will have that ... you know put in some kind of agreement of you don't speak to the press on behalf of the company blooded out it up\nA and says here that\nSome longtime workers have expressed frustration that their wages\nAre only going to increase in a very small percentage compared to new workers ... or you know like brand new plus those that have been there a relatively short time who are saying hourly pay increases of forty percent right\nIf you are getting paid ten or eleven bucks an hour and then you go up to fifty are screwed me Fifteen dollars an hour yup that's where you're forty to fifty per cent pay increase is if you're getting Fifteen dollars an hour and you go up to sixteen 'cause they said it was the one dollar increase for anybody that already was making Fifteen\nNow six point seven six point six percent\nThink of somebody that and I don't know what the current starting rate is at Amazon but let's say isn't it very into having on the area hold on but let's say that somebody that works at ...\nDon for say three or four years is making fourteen dollars an hour\nThey're only going up to Fifteen dollars an hour and it's an insult somebody that got hires or gets hired tomorrow also making ... dollars an hour what the hell did I bust my ass here for the last ... years for what I'm getting treated the same way as the guy that walked in or yesterday\nYeah this is one of the reasons why the minimum wage increase hurts a people and it is a insulting to the person who has ground there a way you know year after year after year climbing their way up through the pay scale in whatever corporation they've got all of a sudden\nEverything changes and then all the kids that came in you know within the last six months or making the same amount of that you mention it when you raise the prices of you know or raise the the wage you also lived in the minimum wage you also raise the cost of you know purchasing goods from\nYou know everywhere so right so you end up actually not doing it and then the people above you know who are making more money they're going to demand the increase in the wage\nAnd at the end of the day you end up basically everything just goes up but I think you'll demand it but they're not probably going to get it I mean it might not have tossed him a dollar just could say they did something\nHere's the question so well a lot of those people\nA wind up leaving and frustration I doubt it or are they going to guess what it was yeah I mean they're still most of them are going to want to leave the job if they like it I mean\nThis could be the straw that they write the camel's back and then they go somewhere else it could be but again what does the Amazon care if their plan is to replace all these robots sell it winds up saving Amazon money\nBecause now we are not given this guy that made twenty bucks an hour we're not giving him a bonus anymore or he's not getting stock options anymore right and he just walked out the door so that we're saving a bunch of money and we'll hire semi hiring in some of their Fifteen\nBy you know it's it's actually interesting because it's a low skill jobs to begin with so they so that's actually probably in Amazon's advantage because if you're if you're getting your higher paid unskilled workers ... guess what you just get to hire new workers and pay them less that's correct they did that uh when I used to work at\nKmart back in the late Nineteen nineties they had all these older women a woman is doing it now I Believe I'm sure it's the same you know same a technique\nYeah there's that guy that we do that works at the Wal Mart here in king where he said that some of the longtime workers are being offered ...\nCorrect that's exactly what Kmart did they came in with all these older women in their fifties and sixties that had been at Kmart for you know more than a decade or for a long time they were making decent money for a retail job because they were doing good work they worked there for a long time they knew what they were doing\nAnd they offered him a decent severance package to say say goodbye and a lot of them took it and then uh you know they hired some kids\nUh there's or the editor in chief assistant and six copy editors for people from the department are also being let go roughly one hundred workers will remain after the dust settles down from two hundred and forty to one hundred\nHow much of the copy editing work heads to defend employees in Denver and ad sales increasingly it will be handled out of low Massachusetts where they own the low sun meanwhile what's left of the tabloid team heads south from seaport to brain tree\nBy year's end printing has long been outsourced first to the Boston Globe then to the Providence Journal\nThe company's top Boston area managers would probably say these cuts are about ensuring the Herald long term survival yet another painful downturn in print ad sales is sweeping across the industry and nearly everyone is scrambling to control costs including the globe\nPrint circulation is also dwindling as readership moves on line the Herald for example ... only about forty thousand copies the date now\nAnd they don't give us a comparison of what they sold in the past but regardless uh yet another cost cutting measure at yet another major newspaper that was in bankruptcy and got snatched up we're going to see this story over and over again\nIf you want to comment You're welcome to join us here in related news this is another one I'd had sitting in the inbox playboy\nStripping down as the New York in their headline down to four issues per year in\n... really Playboy's going to be a quarterly our Haitian\nNow maybe you didn't already know I didn't uh but apparently playboy is already at six issues per year so they've already done that either yeah they've already cut back by half I honestly couldn't tell you the last time I even looked at a playboy I Would have probably been like\nFive or six years old or something like that but I remember I remember slide and walk around on the school bus we had a you know back when you go to school in school but he was you could slide things under the seats so some do brought a playboy in a and we're a sliding it back and forth on the on the bus checking it out\nI don't remember looking at ... I'm sure I've seen since then but that's the most memorable time\nA recording to the story here at the New York post they will become a quarterly magazine in twenty Nineteen\nAnd apparently they're planning to open a club in New York the re entry into the brick and mortar club business is the brainchild of chief executive Ben cone whos trying to re brand the empire founded by Hugh Hefner for the twenty first century\nAnd then they go on to brag about their new offices and all that apparently they brought back the nudity I remember seeing a few\nYears ago the headline I think we talked about it here on freaked out why they got criticized for it and then they dropped it and it's like well wait a minute what are your customers want right I think I'm pretty sure that was what they want it not\nJust people in your article you aren't right into their customers are listening to it like you know some lack that wing activists and it's like they're not your customers why are you listening to them well Cooper Hefner the son of\nThe magazine founder announced the move to bring back nudity this is actually an old story from February of twenty Seventeen\nOr that's when they made this announcement they published he says quote I'll be the first to admit that the way in which the magazine portrayed nudity was dated but removing it entirely wasn't mistake he said they published their first non new issue in March twenty sixteen and then prior to that had launched a safe for work playboy now app\nBut as of march twenty Seventeen students is back\nWith playboy now apparently it wasn't enough to save them and keep them from going ... six this year right now one more I Wonder how that safer up actually like\nHas it succeed or has it failed here anymore yeah I mean how many people actually the old joke about playboy who reads playboy apparently some people do\nBecause they are articles in playboy but I guess there are and they're actually not necessarily that bad um I have actually read the article used the gateway to like yeah I'm a law that says reading playboy I mean [laughter]\nNo but seriously they actually did have um my you know people really writing stories and stuff for a play by other sort of known for good journalism didn't want to her yeah yeah I'm the journalism wasn't bad it's just you know obviously that's not what attracted you know you're there they're audio they build a may ... right right right so\nSo those are some updates for you on the latest failures because the magazine industries had the same difficulties we haven't talked about it as much because you know for whatever reason they don't get heralded when they fail is often but\nYou know the hidden time basically go all digital not too long ago and it was one of your time and all digital ... there was one of 'em one of them did I'm sure wasn't Newsweek is ... you'll have to find out why is it up which one it was okay yeah there was a big\nThere was a big ... one of the big news the publications had had gone completely digital and that was a couple of years back\nUm and there was I remember a story about the printers\nOf these magazines losing out big time and scaling back oh yeah and so like there are fewer and fewer actual printing a houses or manufacturing facilities\nTo actually print these magazines that so the whole industry as a whole is is contracting and if you're working in that industry man it was a good luck Newsweek or you can twenty twelve stories from orders after Seventy nine years in ...\nNewsweek goes digital openly and they're still there I mean they haven't gone out of business and so I I've actually known that the printing industry um some of them have actually gone out of business so what I'm Talking to a ... yeah yeah yeah um but they don't have enough business coming yeah great great to sustain them so they're consolidating and selling and yeah I um\nI Know a magazine twenty six hundred um the ... the border hacker quarterly and they had a problem where they were punishing a you know what perjure and they took the money and buy three ... and I guess the way it is somehow they get the money they get the money back\nOr something like I guess the the money comes in through the sue them like ... yeah\nAnyway so they knew they were like um three months behind and basically they the publisher took or the the printer I guess yeah took their money and so they didn't have money to actually operate wow like to come out with the next issue and they had to find another printer and yeah\nUm I guess I guess the way it works is something to the fact of um I guess the the printer like distributed distributed the magazine and collected the money for and I never really the money back\n[laughter] um I go to the magazines and so they did is they basically so everybody has their way out printing yeah as ever going to business they took all the money from all of their exits you know everybody who was yeah printing a with them so the big\nNews for time they're no longer part of Time Warner split them off I didn't even know what our media even though it was a reporter time winter\nTime what the name

R. K. L.\nVoice of Boston you walk about one hundred and twenty seven to UCLA eighty to Boston and heart radio station [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI taught at at a political rally in Kansas Saturday Night President Trump and formed a crowd of the good news just a\nBut said the female on the side was not Kavanaugh's daughter she said it was echoing a cartoon by ... of the Washington Post which as you pointed out came out in December of twenty Seventeen yes long before the Kavanaugh nomination a controversy hubbub\nEven so Miller's Facebook post drew attention to Stanford and her son prompting countless reactions including does that called for her to be arrested on what grounds a great question police did show up at our home some say she was told to remove the sign or it would be confiscated\nCity officials said police visited Stanford's home and she asked them\nTo take the side\nI Would she do that\nThe ... I don't I I don't believe that she asked them to take this ... I don't believe that when I think yeah Robert ... and ... and they said\nYou have to remove the side and she said I'm not going to remove decide\nOr else we're gonna XYZ and she's like oh just take it down or something you are saying you take it but I'm not taking it down or if you want to remove you remove it the story is pretty fresh it was up day to just three hours to go on Star Telegram\nSo I'm interested in hearing the the homeowners a you know the sign owners here is a Stanford\nWhat is her explanation because all of this article here from Star Telegram says his sons say\nWell who the hell is that [laughter] who's saying she was told to remove the center of be confiscated city officials against St police said she asked them to take the sun either way the signs gone and Miller posted again on Facebook that he's happy with the result\nHe said quote the offended bureaucrat I'm Glad that I called out this offensive campaign sign and employees that hundreds of others did so it was well it's Boulder and does it matter and just plain wrong doesn't matter and it had no place to someone's yard visible from the streets\nAre private property she couldn't whatever size you want\nAs long as it according to what the Texas code which I have pulled out\nThere's not more than thirty six feet of signs and they are not that big it's not more combined nasty she does have other side\nBut still she don't have more than thirty six feet aside I see I see not sides are more than eight foot tall none of those signs are eliminated a lot of those have any moving element\nCorrect I see three signs here for signs maybe of like the standard yard sign size right and then this larger signed with the uh the iconography with the elephant with the ... going up a skirt maybe is about the size of three yard signs combined\nRight well in with I I thought about the same height I've found something from and I realized that this is outdated ah from two thousand eight from a group called the international municipal Lawyers Association that had a conference in Las Vegas Nevada\nIn two thousand eight and at that time they put out something called science wars the first amendment and political science ...\nAnd his isn't the first time these sorts of things that I Know a on page nine they talk about signs on private property mhm which is what this was on private property and again this is designed for municipal lawyers city counselors\nOr bureaucrats that and so I'm a hoop published this I'm Still in her national municipal Lawyers Association OK city attorneys yes okay for municipal attorney but here's what you can and can't do about things on private property\nOn private property you cannot prohibit all temporary sides\nIn a content neutral matter\nKey words their content neutral\nYou can limit the size of yard signs both individually and by total square foot\nYou can play is reasonable restrictions on the shape plight spacing condition and composition of signs you can place reasonable restrictions on the location of sides especially if it interferes with public safety\nYou may be able to place reasonable restrictions on the illumination of temporary science\nYou might be able and again this is from two thousand eight and things have changed since then\nYou might be able to play some reasonable limitations on the duration of temporary sign posting that is not tied to election dates and you might be able to limit the number of temporary science per lot to one per political candidate and issue on the ballot okay\nBut you said things have changed since two thousand eight wasn't there some Supreme Court decision there was that to basically throughout designed Gilbert\nIt didn't completely one of the dissenting judges that I forget who it was I'm thinking it was Sonia Sotomayor said that the a a logic\nUsed by the majority could be years to invalidate every sign code in this country I'm interested in hearing a little more about that if you if you have a summary of what the the case was involving because you were told me that you believe that it could indeed do that\nIf somebody were to actually challenge a local signed ordinances which are very restrictive in many communities restricting businesses restricting in Rangel's from expressing their opinion in this case this woman was fully within whatever\nRules right or for science ...

ordinances a woman in Texas a little town in Texas called Hamilton in the middle of nowhere west to tear up a Waco\nShe got in some hot water with police where they confiscated her Stein cops are saying she told them to take the sign which seems highly unlikely given that she actually spent time creating it a hand right I I think most likely\nWhat happened is they said either you take it down or we take it and she says I'm not taking it down I guess that means you're taking it and they're like All right you said we're taking it\nYeah that is a clear violation intimidation of this person if that's how it went and we don't have the story from the ah the woman at this point did right but it's pretty much a breaking news story um but it was ...\nMe if there's something from the uh Texas any or Texas ACLU and the next couple of days I sure as hell hopes filing suit against the power of Hamilton\nFor violating basically every rice ... beach right because political speech and this is the thing that changed\nWith read the town of Gilbert, Arizona okay\nIs that the various types of side ordinances were considered to be content restrictions\nAnd\nThe Supreme Court basically said you can't\nA a ordinance based on restricting conduct weight\nWhether they were saying that signage size restrictions were also content restrictions 'cause there's plenty of size restrict them\nNot the size ... the actual content of the side so in this particular case the town of Gilbert, Arizona placed restrictions more heavily on the duration of display of temporary signs\nFor events to where the town's said you can't put up a sign more than twelve hours before the event begins and they must be down at least two hours after the event in ... there was a church ... did not have its own building\nAnd so they changed locations every week right so they would float between different places that they could rent for a Sunday and so every Saturday or friday I forget exactly when they were actually putting the signs up\nBut they were putting them up definitely more than twelve hours prior to the start of the church service\nAnd the towns that you can't do that are or that says that it can't be up for more than twelve hours before your church service storage which basically says if you've got church that starts at ten o'clock on Sunday Morning\nYou can't tell anybody via sign age prior ten pm Saturday Night ... where the church is going to be so they went to the Supreme Court and the Supreme\nCourt essentially said that limiting the a type of a sign based solely on the information on the side is a ... a restriction I see so what I mentioned about political science\nIs still fairly accurate\nAs far as ah the size restrictions are legit ... can be as long as they don't wind up saying no more than this size for this type of side and this size for this other\nSo as long as it's across the board all sides meet\nVis right then that say content neutral restriction\nBut if they say political science can be this size but other signs can be this size\nThat say content based restriction\nIn this case um she was in\nThis case they're just saying somebody found this offensive right and he's got to move it that is a content based restriction you can't do that well they did it\nWell yes you cannot do that legally government had like you are not allowed legally did it on and does things as they do whatever it is they want to do and then the only way that it\nStops temporarily is if like you said the ACLU or some attorneys willing to take this gays take this all the way maybe to the Supreme Court in order to get the same damn results that have because this isn't the first time some you know a trigger happy copper whatever's them or write or ...
