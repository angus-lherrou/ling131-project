O. as we continue here we were talking about rights\nAnd a food not bombs Daryl you did a little bit of research turns out it goes back to the Nineteen seventies or and I was Nineteen eighty actually uh when they are maybe it was you Chris yeah\nUh when they did their first protests at the secret nuclear power plant in New Hampshire ... I was searching the history of the anti nuclear movement ... okay and that dates back to the fifty is among scientists or the forties among scientists they adopt discussion among\nQuote unquote ville public in the fifties and then the first actual protest in the sixties I was saying the anti nuclear movement dates back to Nineteen forty five amongst the Japanese yeah I'll give you that\nYeah yeah and and I am I'm not against nuclear ... there was probably an anti nuclear movement both before that as well during the the first test um you know people were horrified and then I talked to my my father who was alive at this point and\nAnd when the Hiroshima and Nagasaki happened I mean they were horrified at the power that was the comment on I think both sides of of the war that people were like what have we a least and this was a common thing up among scientists to\nThe idea that this kind of power and I think a lot of people realize that it couldn't be contained just to the U.S you know this was going to change the world forever and it certainly has [noise] I I'm not against it\nThe clear power but I Am against nuclear bombs yeah yeah uh I I think that if we had a true free market in power then you'd find safer smaller less you know radioactive a nuclear facilities\nAnd then you do today which is very heavily restricted and you know you can't build new ones and the old ones can't be retrofitted and it's just\nThere was a mess yeah and that's out there and there are so many\nRestrictions on research and things like that you know I'm the there been people that have been playing around with ideas for cold fusion and\nAnd you know salt reactors and all sorts of technologies that could really help but then there's a story him reactors which are much safer forget or stand with us to all things oriole and has a much shorter half life\nI don't recall I Know we've talked about the differences between uranium and tore him and it's like a night and day difference between you know safety\nSo anyway uh back to food not bombs in this court case or living circuit court of appeals saying yeah it is first and then it protected action to distribute food\nThey say here that do not bombs believes that food is a human rights not a privilege well not a problem with the statement like that is that it sounds nice on his face like oh well I mean who could disagree with the right to eat\nBut the problem with that type of right is it forces itself upon other people meaning that if you have a right to food then that means that you have a right to somebody going out and picking it off the vine and bring you know putting it in a store or giving it to you\nAbout it all depends on whether you mean positive right or negative right right what does that what he's learning problems with the English language that I was trying to point out to where the right to bear arms is not construed by anyone as the government must give you all firearms\nRight or that you have a right to go in and just take a firearm from a gun store or something 'cause you have a right to it right if you have a right to something\nThat doesn't necessarily follow that means you have to pay to exercise that right like if I have a right to free speech a on public property I don't have to pay anybody to speak\nSo when people ask for a permit to engage in their so called free speech\nWell they don't have a right anymore they've heard of that right into a privilege right so we get into kind of a real sticky situation here where people have the intention of doing good and helping others and they believe that food is a right but ultimately it's it's not I mean if the\nIf a bunch of people eat all of the food on the the vines or whatever then\nYou know the food and just go pop right back out to you know provide itself somebody's got to plant it somebody's got to go until the land somebody's got to go\nAnd uh and pick the watermelons or whatever it is that you know food that we are talking about here there's a lot of work that goes into getting food packaged and shipped in and sent to your plate\n... I mean I can see businesses doing this to garner good press right and that doesn't make it a bad thing as of yet that same reason\nWal Mart sends a truck full of water down to the hurricane victims\nFar why ah the the one ah horrible beer company a Bush or Budweiser they will also right or like a week right after some disaster only put actual water instead of beer flavor of water and their cat [laughter] right and then they send that down to the places\nYeah and that's all fine and and those are good PR moves they garner good press and I and I\nDon't see anything wrong with that I just find this idea to be somewhat disingenuous and and we'll we'll watch that on\nWhat what about instead of the pay as you go bottle or the pay it forward model well to where you have to pay full price for your meal\nAnd if you want to you can buy an additional meal and then they'll put a little sticky note on here's the prepaid mills and then if somebody comes out and they don't have money for food they can pull one of the sticky notes off the wall\nI think that's fine because then there is a scarcity if you are out of those then that may prompt more people to put sticky ha ha okay and at the same time um you know if if you're hungry and you have an eating maybe you got to get up a little early to make sure you get a sticking out\nAll I Know is that we talked about a couple of days we talked about same cafe in Denver and we talked about ... he's an affiliate ... in Philly\nAnd I tried to do a little bit of research is to see where these where they're getting their funding from right and the first thing we looked at was eat and it looked like they were tied in with a college Drexel University in ... college fund which right there's probably some state money coming in there somewhere yeah\nAnd then I go look at the one ah same cafe in Denver and it doesn't take a lot of lives a private college oh really okay but the I don't a lot of private colleges still take state money\nBecause they say if I take state money I mean that they allow people with student loans and Pell Grants that yes they take state money right but I I'd be funded the same way the ... State University system is funded by the state all keep\nDigging into that but when I look at the same cafe in Denver a day except donations and things like that but they also get donations through their community partners like certify bleed green Denver which if you click on the link here it takes you to the city of Denver\nIf you go to Denver botanical gardens a which is another funding source then there's no ties to local government they they they just got a Seventeen million dollar bond to expand their parking through the city of Denver\nSo it doesn't take too many steps before these things that sound really good really um you know sort of homegrown or subsidize they are subsidized at some level through government and that means that people that may not approve of these same programs are actually funding these program\nAnd it also likely means they're not sustainable if they need to be subsidized that's usually why yeah I'm so\nAnd yeah and most restaurants are sustainable\nWell that's true that's true but the ones that are they work out and they stick around for a long time yeah and these habits so it's interesting it's interesting and maybe if they were doing it the way Darryl suggested or maybe there are ways to make it right\nThere there are restaurants that do the pay it forward\nNow there's a story from CBS seven out of big spring Texas\nAbout a restaurant out there the Mayo sauce family diner they got the idea after reading about a Chicago pizza parlor that sells one dollar slices of pizza and they encourage people to play it forward and hey I'm paying for three slices I only want to get yeah\nThat makes sense and again I'm not saying it's impossible for one of these models to uh to work out but it's interesting to find out whether they do or they don't and these are the things that can be tried in a if there's a free market right you know where you don't have a insane government regulation standing in the way raising costs because it's not cheap to start a restaurant\nRan a lot of that cost is because of the government and all of its mandates that they put on restaurant tours and start ups from you know getting started it can prevent somebody from being able to let's say open up a restaurant in their own home for where they would be able to serve people for a much lower cost\nAnd a ... you know an ... an add more competition into the marketplace right um unfortunately the government stands and the way and ultimately protects the existing restaurant tourists who have put in the two hundred thousand dollar you know vent hood or whatever it is they have to put in these crazy mandates on her\nBed to upgrade an existing kitchen to a commercial kitchen cost about half a million dollars yeah\nThat sounds about what I've heard from saying I've never actually looked into it and imagine all the uh just uh just so difficult and choir and we actually\nKnow a guy that he was trying to open a restaurant that\nIt was going to be a pickled style restaurant where nothing was actually going to be cooked I saw him recently and he still after spending like a hundred thousand dollar you know oh I Am doing all kinds of stuff to meet some arbitrary decisions\nWound up realizing that he was never going to get approved ... he gave up yeah they told her that you have to put a double firewall between the kitchen area\nAnd the serving area you'd even I'm not cooking anything nothing at any time it's ever going to be producing heat and they said well you might use the microwave it some time so yeah let's just do a single firewall instead of a double\nI saw him actually at the bit clean heretic spent the night that uh the the last night out of the ... she actually came out to that and then he was telling me about 'cause I'd asked me like how's your wrist restaurant going to go yeah that didn't work out after I spent my life savings\nAre trying to make it work out 'cause he bought the building that they were rented any right 'cause you can't just easily go in and renovate somebody else's building right without you know some serious negotiations so they own this property and now they're renting it out to some other whatever it is that they're renting it out so it's like\nYou know it's not a total loss but ultimately they lost a ton of money via a trying to jump through the regulatory hurdles to ultimately no avail yeah how many times does that happen to people that you ever hear about right there's all the you can see all the restaurants that open and fail but what about the ones like you're

care of these people if\nOnly you are free to do that sort of thing but they don't want camping camping is not allowed ... people just camping on property that they own because reason someone well\nWhere did in like a ... a don't we know a state\nRepresentative who is going through a similar situation involving himself we do um Michael Sylvia\nOh oh oh All right he had the audacity\nTo stay in he has a camper right throughout argued hang our hat or at a fire on his property prior to him purchasing\nIt prior ... down the house yep so garage left right and the state or the city in this case so they're not alleging that he committed arson to burn down a building he wasn't even there at that time but ah yeah OK I'm Glad you brought that up because I thought you were going to be referring to the state representative former state rep here in Keene who actually has used his property\nA behind the hand for a grocery store to allow homeless encampments basically ran up against this exact same problem but I don't believe took it to court where this guy in Akron is taking it to court or but the guy you're talking about that's involved in an issue right now is not only a state representative he's also a listener\nAnd longtime supporter of free chocolate yes and an amplifier we gave out a couple of nights ago and uh and the top a number one most liberty oriented state rep according to the New Hampshire liberty alliance he won the a representative of the year whatever award for us\nAnd and that was after years of getting a pluses so he's been amazing the whole time I go to weed out here's a resolution to his thing because I got airing a few weeks ago\nA ... he did not tell me and I asked ... to keep me in the loop and he said that he would in that particular case but to\nTo recap what's going on with him the house burned down before he bought the property he bought the property probably at a pretty good deal\nUm and a lot of the house and they had a garage on it and he parked in our view there and the town government even though there's no neighbors like immediate ... he's in the woods right there's no like neighbors immediately around at least from what we could tell by like a satellite photo\nUm somehow you know the town decided they didn't like him probably because of his politics is he's a liberty guy\nAnd they targeted him they specifically asked the zoning enforcement officer to target his property when this guy came on board with the job that he ... he told the news media that it was the town selecting who had instructed hip to go after my Sylvia property\nUm and he did and he threatened him and he said uh I Believe that you're living on this property in violation of blah blah blah whatever ordinance or zoning\nEt cetera now we don't he doesn't do for sure then my living there right he only saw Mike exit the RV Ron occasion he saw smoke coming from a chimney in the garage so he believes that Mike is living on the property he saw shoveled pathways or during the winter ...\nThey do that Mike lives on the property because that's what he has listed as his dome asylum and has a place for where he's a registered to vote\nYeah I don't think it's going to likely when this on a argument over the facts um but either way you know this is a fundamental attack on the right to\n... question is whether or not he is living\nPartially in the RV and partially envy\nA garage type thing without some kind of an occupied the life that that's\nThe legal question and play but the real question is\nShould you be able to do what the hell you want to do on what is right purported at your own property what exactly is an occupancy license to live on property that you were supposedly all it's crazy yeah it's insane which is why I suggested to make that maybe if he gets re elected uh here in November\nThat he should he landed ... will to abolish zoning entirely can we just had that please\nTo where it just because New Hampshire is a state\nRun kind of government there's no home rule the towns can only do what they're allowed to do by state government\nAnd obviously the state has allowed for zoning well it's time for the state to disallow zoning and abolish it entirely from across the entire state of New Hampshire problem solved there you go yeah unfortunately I don't know if he's going to I Hope he does 'cause it would be awesome I Would love to have that conversation because in New Hampshire every\nBill that has put forward by all the four hundred state representatives editor for senator there's hundreds and hundreds of bills every uh every year\nEvery one of them has to have a public hearing and I would love to see the bureaucrats come out and make an argument as to why zoning is necessary to do that oh they'll do it and I say that they will yeah\nI'll say that as a member of a planning board yeah um they will tell you that you know without planning um then you're going to have a all sorts of crazy businesses next to 'em\nYou know residences and it just ends up being insane and you can but I have\nAnd I have a phone call not yet mayor of Houston how's that no zoning thing work out of the largest city in the United states you might be the seven ... good okay thank you write\nA how about the ah the cities or towns are all towns but how do I don't have as owning a graft and doesn't have it lends to or doesn't have it there's others I just don't know what they are everybody else with their ... and say they had one problem ten years ago so we can't do it either you know what the real problem is is all the bureaucrats who are the city planners get fired\nBecause it was necessary anymore and the code and for they're going to fight\nAgainst it tooth and nail more coming up\nWe have some good
