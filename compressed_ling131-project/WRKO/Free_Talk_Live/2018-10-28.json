Twenty one trillion dollars over a decade [laughter]\nDepartment of defense as far as I Know still does not even know how much money they have or how much money they're spending right [noise]\nSo [noise] Grassley went on he uh he says paying nearly seven hundred dollars for a single cup is bad enough\nBut it's simply beyond reason to continue to pay ever increasing prices for something as simple as a coffee cup is so fragile it needs to be constantly replaced this latest example of reckless spending taxpayer dollars gives me no confidence that the air force is taking real steps to reduce wasteful spending practices\nAnd an October seventies letter back to Grassley Wilson said that it it is simply irresponsible to spend thousands of dollars are manufactured parts when we have the technology available to produce them ourselves\nOnce the supplier either stops reducing those parts or goes out of business\nI wasn't said that in July she ordered a new air force Rapids a statement office to be created to find ways to develop and deliver parts at a fraction of the cost of traditional manufacturing methods this officers recently shown that it can three D. print replacement handles for the re heating cup for about fifty cents\nAll right so they're just going to three print the handle not the entire caught\nOne of the handle is the part that's breaking right but they can't order replacement handles anymore for\nGod only knows what reason 'cause they can order a replacement cubs and there are ... replacement cubs have a handle right I I don't know what's\nGoing on there I'm guessing the reason they can't buy a replacement handle is the company decided you know what we can make a lot more money if we just tell them that uh they can't buy handled they've got to buy a whole new cup [laughter] and then they Jack up the price because of whatever reason\nAre basically that whatever reason as they can All right\n[noise] so these cups or insanely expensive to begin with why why we're about to sign up back to the air force times Wilson told Grassley that this cup especially manufactured to plug into aircraft systems and because it connects to the aircraft replacements need to be certified as air where the by the CIA [laughter]\nYes I've heard of [laughter] as long as\nThey're there there is there is some truth to this every uh every commercial and military airplane has what's called a minimum equipment list I mean you know uh pilots will know exactly what this is it's a list of things on the aircraft that\nTells you if you're allowed to fly if that part is broken\nAll right so apparently this coffee cup has gotten on the minimum equipment list for these planes [noise]\nRight and so we can't just have a lot you know something a pilot flying around in an F thirty five with the coffee cup without a handle right [laughter] you sound like it does make sense that you want a handle on your coffee cup\nBut at the same time it's just ridiculous that some company found a way to wind up charging almost Thirteen hundred dollars for a coffee cup and then not selling replacements for the one part that keeps breaking the handle right yeah\nSo the FAA certification for this part has driven up the cost of buying three hundred and Ninety One of these cup since two thousand sixteen to three hundred and twenty six thousand seven hundred and eighty five dollars Wilson said or about a hundred and thirty six a piece on average\nUh the water heaters are used on fifty nine Casey tens fifty to see size and two hundred and twenty two C. Seventeen swells instead but with planes aging and the average Casey tennis thirty four years old it's harder and harder to find a replacement parts for those aircraft she said\nAnd the price tag for raw materials for those parts is also increasing a Wilson said with copper and Crump played in costs have increased a hundred and eighty percent since two thousand sixteen\nNow what's caused the copper and chrome pleading cause to go up is that more regulation\nTo argue they hadn't just add that they their article doesn't get into that at all okay it'd be something that the one of you whose board didn't look up and give us a call and let us know\nEight fifty five four fifty free is the number that you can use to call and there's also the disc or to call in lines available at discord dot L.

N. dot FM\nNoah listened told Grassley who is she in chief of staff general Dave Goldstein have orders and uses statement office to look for other items in the ... process then it can self produce or other overpriced items they can stop buying without hurting the forces mission\nGrassley said he was dissatisfied with Wilson's response and said he will keep digging quote the leaves me with more questions while I appreciate that the air force is working to find innovations that would help save taxpayer dollars it remains unclear why it cannot find a cheaper alternatives to a twelve hundred and eighty dollar cup\nGovernment officials have the responsibility to use taxpayer dollars efficiently too often that's not the case\nRight like when Congress winds up giving the Pentagon even larger a budget than what the Pentagon even request [laughter]\nYou know and then they wonder why are they spending so much money on coffee cups well because you keep giving them money and if they don't spend that\nThey really can't justify having a bigger budget next year but you're going to give them an even bigger bigger budget this is talk live eight fifty five four fifty for eight five five four or five zero three seven three three\n... what is it costing us vet bills for that convenience of just calling open a bag of formulated\nExtroverted trashed cereal pitch that cost a\nTon of money anyway how do you feed your dog to derive not only energy but a good coach bright eyes and I hate to come to ... for help\nAnd I don't yeah I ...

hello yes there you go ahead oh okay\nI got cut off early you know I got cut out right away\nThe because you called in about two hours earlier than you normally do and we answered the phone [laughter]

to\nGoing to have their thoughts their\nOkay I Want to know that our\nMayor of American guy\nAnd it has made it but when they try and only and that there are bad that we really I think that's the only started that\nAnd then we had that too I'm\nLocated on a regular basis in about four years ago\nThat it probably five or ... or you haven't gone now we have\nMade on that come over there and you know you know what the right\nIt's a thing that has a list of all of the candidates some of them will have statements from candidate now is this something that's put out by the ... like the secretary of state or is this a privately done voters guy because I Know in some states the league of women voters will put something out\nBut then in other states like California the secretary of state actually publishes a voter guide\nPainted are done by a dire need of what the lady said okay\nAnd then and then one that actually\nThat made it to 'em right\nOkay so they translated it from English into a language that you know somebody might be able to read if they don't you know fluently read English I I think it's a great idea what are your thoughts\nOn\nThat that may not make\nIt's the only\n... pretty much pay so much that they gave up on that\nMoney and they like they're happy with the fact that it I Know that we got that are like that they're there they found her on there\nI Would love that the whatever statistic you are supposedly siting on that because there are a lot of the groups of minorities that can be seen as apathetic just because they don't vote because all of the candidates suck doesn't mean they're apathetic Sarah thank you for the call\nSo thoughts on voter guides being translated into languages other than English\nI like the idea perfectly fine with me that there's got to realize is that the United states has always had people that speak every different language under the sun right you know\nIt's true but I'm kinda curious like how many people are there that\nDon't speak English and the Native American community in that area\nI don't I don't know I don't know what I Would like not the official language of this country despite what some people do your country hasn't gotten official\n... absolutely right it's just you know I I've I've been through different tribal a spots and\nNever noticed but again I that's my perception not necessarily what how things are a\nBut a they might be able to speak English but maybe they can't read English maybe a there are some reservations that I've been to where all of the road signs are written in whatever the native languages because interesting the the reservations are legally\nA semi autonomous now I I think the federal government might say autonomous but in practicality semi autonomous yeah definitely something and\nYou have to remember that the Native Americans weren't us citizens until citizenship was boy stood up on them in the Nineteen twenties\nI Believe the U.S constitution refers to citizens not or a Indians not taxed as being exempt from the census\nYou know I actually once asked um I ... which part which tribe or you know where where exactly it was somewhere out in front of the Arizona area and um do they have a currency because usually when you think of a\nAutonomy is some sort of economists right you know there's some sort of currency or or similar and um I I guess they don't that they did in that case I I'd be curious if any\nUh you know a\nSays Carl Davis is one of the authors of the study the reason states with low or no income tax me their budgets Davis says\nBy taxing consumer goods property and certain services and items since those items in services are taxed at a flat rate everyone pays the same rate regardless of income they add up to a bigger chunk of poor earners income then richer ones he says\nFor other people who choose to live in states with little or no income tax might find they end up paying more than if they lived in a state with a higher income tax\nThoughts so far\nI I Would love to see their methodology on this because we've seen\nWe've seen fifty state analysis of of people's overall tax burden and New Hampshire where we have no income tax and had no general sales tax is consistently at the top of that list of all it's the most least expensive places to live as far as taxation\nThis is this is an insult to it's a total evidence here um but I certainly when I moved from New Jersey which is one of the higher tax states certainly uh certainly and I I'm Glad that I have no income taxes in Hampshire\nAnd there's and there's a general her sales tax but a property taxes are about the same right about the same little I think I was paying a little bit more improper ties to New Jersey I'm so certainly I'm doing much better in New Hampshire\nRight so whereas somebody that lives in say Florida where the property taxes are lower and there's also no state income tax they might not be you know as benefitted by\nThe moved to New Hampshire because property taxes are higher but they do have a sales tax down there\nRight a bit you know the property tax that's the one that is sort of the most visible right because you get that bill once a year or in some places twice a year ... and you know you're writing a big huge giant check whereas when you go to the grocery store oh you're just adding a lizard is diming you\nKnow there are there are some things I Will say um the New Hampshire has tax wise that New Jersey does it so they're ... it's not a wild things that I've noticed but little things that\nI can understand do add up um there's are a vehicle registration tax 'em or I think they call this the but it's a tax ... I'm from New Jersey was five bucks in New Hampshire I hundreds a year I'm\nRight because New Hampshire taxes based on the value or the estimated value of the vehicle\nYeah so like minimal you're probably going to pay hundreds a year I don't know what the a brand new vehicle is I haven't had a brand new Hampshire but it's at least hundreds a year I'm and\nI'm trying to think what else we saw um there is that there is a prepared meals tax which is ... percent New Jersey has assembled in tax write so it is a little bit higher for for ... and I like to eat out a lot so it's it's certainly a does does have a a bit of an impact there too I'm and I'm trying to think what else um I think I read\nYour clothes aren't packed so when you go to New Jersey either okay I Know that there are some states that they tax they ... the New York it was going to ... rebuild yet Alabama's one of the states that still taxes groceries\nUh whereas the other states they don't tax groceries but then they write the rules in such a way as to where ... may or may not be taxed based on the child ... it is there [laughter]\nYou know I I I've been to places like Chicago you guys still you've got an income tax new annoy you got property taxes and you've got a twelve percent sales tax it's it's white twelve percent sales tax in Chicago\nI guess in the United states was like ten percent uh other than like any New Jersey in various places where it's Thirteen\nYeah it's it's twelve in Chicago have not seen in the U.S I'm\nGuessing ... special ministry of districts in New Jersey I'm I'm In Chicago that's probably one of the states where there's the state sales tax ... ... yeah well so what you asked\nAll of those together yeah yeah it's ... yeah you're right you're probably right yeah I think in Birmingham is ten or eleven whereas there Adam unincorporated parts of the county just a few miles outside of the city\nWhere the tax rates like five and a half or six oh wow that's a huge difference yeah that's a big difference a continuing on with this article\nFrom US News Davis again who is one of the authors of the study on taxation says it's a common belief that states without income taxes are universally lower tax states but the reality is that low income tax people living in Texas which has no personal income tax pay much higher taxes\nThan if they lived in so called high tax states like California or New York\nNational eight people living in the bottom twenty percent of earners face a state and local tax rate\nThat it was about fifty percent higher than the top one percent of households\nAccording to the study that does not mean that low income people pay more an absolute dollars only that they are effective tax rates are higher percentage the national average effective state and local tax rate is eleven point four percent for the bottom ... taxpayers\nCompared to seven points for that for the top one percent of income earners according to the study of Washington state is the least equitable and the nation with the biggest disparity between effective rates were low income people and the rate for the wealthiest\nRounding out the top ten our Texas Florida South Dakota Nevada Tennessee Pennsylvania Illinois Oklahoma and Wyoming states the authors deem most equitable\nThe ones with tax systems in which the top earners pay more our California Vermont Delaware Minnesota New Jersey ... New York Montana\nMaryland and Oregon the differences come from the widely varying ways that states raised their money\nThe federal income tax for example is progressive banning people earning more end up paying a higher portion of their income in taxes while the auctions can lower the ultimate tax bill the basic format is intended to ease the burden\nFor people with at least with the least ability to pay state however do things differently some have progressive income taxes some have flat rates for everyone regardless of income and others have none at all\nAll states however have to get their money from somewhere\nI I Want to pause there to say that uh this priest opposes that states have to exist and have to pay for things are bad you know through the popular narrative is yeah governments half the tax people and there are certain things that they have\nTo pay for and they have to do this or their\nPrey that we have for his civilization you you know it's you know what I find it funny is we all use all this money in taxes and then I so I drove from North Carolina the other day too well actually I didn't try my partner did but\nOnly from North Carolina I'm sure I can tell you how many pills we went through went through probably doesn't hold its like isn't this supposed to solve those taxes isn't that supposed to solve these types of problems\nAll you're trying to live Jake here there's no logic government [noise] know your calls and thoughts welcome eight fifty five four fifty free eight five five four or five zero three seven three three this is where you live [noise]\nHas unleashed a green gold rush across our nation is creating ten point eight billion dollars a new well for a year and every day is transforming more and more Americans into millionaires in historic event former speaker of the house John ... reveals how you could become\nJoined him on line for the American kind of some attendance is one hundred percent with space is limited to secure your spot checks to join before for zero five five\nDisadvantage to first of its kind ever Sean Bean or in in a steam or veal which kind of sucks more time to deliver in life changing ... in the weeks and months plus they will shows you how to become a cannabis angel investor\nBacking the hottest startups before they potentially become worth billions of dollars to join American kind of a sudden it takes two to four four zero five attendance is free to join the four four zero five size\nMessaging ... guys this may be the last time you ever have to think about hair loss 'cause I'm telling you bosley he's the real deal they're given men their hair back permanently\nThere real natural hair all it takes to get started on the hair gain train as a single text message you'll get an absolutely free information kit and a free gift card when you text gain to eight five eight five zero bosley will show you for free how great your hair good luck\nThey use the latest technology and the results look completely natural you wash it you're caught it it's your own real naturally growing hair\nPeople all over the country trust bosley because they're America's number one hair restoration expert and the permanent solution is protected by the bosley guarantee every day you wait you're losing more hair so drop what you're doing long enough to send a text\nGet your free information kit and gift card for two hundred and fifty dollars off by text and gain to eight five eight five zero that's G.

at tax policies\nOkay so that's that explains why this is All right well this sounds like basically I mean if they're just manipulate the it's the way they're using it's being manipulated the data\nThey're only looking at tax policy when I look at\nTax policies and the cost of living is sky high because of the tax policy which they are ...\n... you wouldn't want to live in California if you are poor I wouldn't want to live in California in any way I think I Know I Know Chris okay there are things called single issue advocacy groups okay this is one of them okay or groups that only look at the marijuana policies\nAnd they don't look at taxation they don't look at anything else okay they only look at certain\nThings in this group the Institute\nTaxation and economic policy is only looking at taxes and the numbers that they come up with it I can go over these ...\nI get my bracket uh lowest twenty per se that has a much lower\nTax rate on income but a higher effective tax rate when you look only at cells excise taxes\nThan the top one percent seven point one percent of the tax\nBurden for a or rather a I think that's seven point one percent of the income for those in the lowest twenty percent get paid on cells in excise taxes whereas for the top one percent it's less than one person that goes through cells into excise taxes\nThat sense the top one percent has four point nine percent of their income going to income taxes and again these are only state and local\nThis is not counting in federal\nUh whereas the lowest twenty percent point one percent of their income is going to income taxes so once you\nAverage it all of these numbers\nThat they're saying that the lowest twenty percent pays a higher effective tax rate than the top one percent and then they're looking at the various states again only on taxation not overall cost of living\nAnd they didn't figure in federal taxes with these numbers correct but the federal taxes are going to change from California to New York because it's the federal rate now yeah your income bracket might change yeah average\nIf you're in California they compared to taxes but again the tax\nRate itself just by virtue of living in California versus taxes isn't going to change the federal tax rate\nYou know if I Lived in California I'd be porn probably homeless because the cost of living is so high you have to make a hundred thousand dollars a year just to read and then the ... more of your your money basically the federal government\nSo continuing on and they say Nevada has no income tax but Levy's taxes on consumer goods tobacco alcohol gas and notably gaming this study does not take into account the impact of lower personal income in corporate taxes on overall economy\nUh that according to the main Brady research director for the national taxpayer union foundation\nWhich says the whole study has basically biased against consumption taxes\nThe metric that it leaves out is economic growth generated by the appeal of lower tax rates further Brady says income taxes are a volatile revenue source\nSince wages and employment rates go up or down user fees and consumption taxes are more predictable\nHelping states plan their budget he says states are trying to build a structure to grow the economy well I don't know I I think you know at least from my experience not that I'm a fan of consumption taxes but from my experience consumption\nTaxes are also going to fluctuate yeah or if everybody in a given area wind up seeing a boost of income than they are going to go spend more money\nIf you live in a tourist destination certain times of the year you're going to have more consumption in Cobb man in the offseason\nContinuing on a Michael each man of the center for budget and policy priorities says the lure of low income and corporate taxes is over rated California after all is the location of super successful Silicon Valley he points out further California voters passed a new tax bracket a higher bracket\nOn very high income people around the same time they had this implemented it's big tax cuts which disproportionately favored the wealthy leach says California since that time after twenty twelve\nHas far outpaced the national economy while Kansas has fallen behind Congress last year passed a law capping the amount of state and local taxes people can the duck from their earnings\nFrom for federal tax purposes\nAnd leads Mendez given how high inequality is there's good reason for states to require high income people and corporations to pay a quote reasonable share\nOf their income to support services your calls and thought well call the eight fifty five four fifty free that eight five five four or five zero three seven three three this is talk live\nWe

T. L. to register or see Fifteen Percent off\nAnd are called pogo dot com code F. T. L. so let's step back into this article from the New York times\nAbout why schools are still teaching children to read the wrong way and some of the uh people quoted here we are saying well I just put a book in front of the kid hill figure it out\nYes there is a ... they will learn to read through exposure and this is this is what teachers are being trained in their teacher preparation programs and universities [noise]\nWhat what's going on is that instead of instead of what science has told us that children learn to read through phonics and that's pretty much et cetera how children learn to read the there ah teaching teachers\nThe wrong way to read what they're teaching some strange ideas in these ideas are rooted in beliefs about reading that were once commonly called whole language in quotes and which gained a lot of traction in the Nineteen eighties and I'm so glad I learned to read before that and [laughter]\nWhole language proponents dismiss the need for phonics reading is quote the most natural activity in the world and quote Frank's Smith one of the you know intellectual leaders of so called intellectual leaders of the whole language movement wrote All right no\nReading is not one of the most natural activities in the world if you know how to read that you enjoy reading it yes it will be natural for you to\nRead but if nobody's ever taught you and somebody just drops down or you know Warren ... or some other really long boring big on red or you're not going to want to pick it up and flip through all the pages and figure out what all the words\nMay yet whether we're all these symbols so oh his his quote gets better he says quote it's only through reading that children learn to read trying to teach children to read by teaching them the sounds of letters is literally a meaningless activity and quote\n... and no I Know yeah it\nIt's absurd you know\nHey here's a list of all the letters Chris said here's what each of these letters\nSounds like so that the letter a can sound like a or a depending on where it is in a word they'll be makes up blah sound et cetera et cetera and once you know the sound of all of these letter [laughter]\n... you can see a word that you're never seen before you can sounded out he's saying that that's not the right way to learn you ... you know you know\nI think of a this is my kind of reminds me of ... and correct me if I'm I'm thinking about the strong but how the Chinese have ... ... well I I don't know that there's any similar system it's rock memorization that's why they're very good at certain\nUm but that's what makes it the English from Latin Latin general different\nFrom other a\n... one of them's\nEven though there are some really alphabet which is you know what you used in Russia you're talking about the uh like the the I don't know the ... I I hear that there's a certain term\nTo describe like Chinese Japanese yeah ah to where it's it's all characters right\nTo where you know just a slight modification will make it a completely different word right uh but things with written alphabet is the easiest to learn to read by knowing how the alphabet works\nRight and it seems like that that just kind of passing over this at this huge advantage a that would make reading super simple\nOr learning to the intellectual leader behind whole word a yeah he's like yeah you don't need to know how the language works just to know that it works\nYou just need to you just need to like\nMemory and all these symbols and and whatever\nYeah it's kind of like a year there was some computer programming yeah at least you know more than I Do like I Know HTML which is not computer programming by any stretch of the imagination\nBut when you're programming a computer you have\nTo know what the different things do not just oh if I typed this it does I think you need to sort of understand\nI I guess the philosophy behind the times and I realized philosophy by you know how to set it up you know to really understand the language you need to understand the concepts of here's how words are structured in this language\nYeah the language doesn't actually matter it's the concepts in there that's what they're ... they should be teaching any kind of computer science class and it's the difference between teaching creative programming is using somebody\n... you know computer science right and you know that's one of the reasons that I got better grades in Latin that I did an English because I understood the concept of how words and sentences were structured in Latin ... I don't remember that now twenty five years after taking lab and that's why it's a dead language\nWell know there are multiple reasons and it's not really a dead language people still teach it and learn it and know how to read it and write it if nobody could read it right it or speak it vent it would be a dead language it's just not anyone's native language", "show_name": "Free Talk Live", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "28"}
