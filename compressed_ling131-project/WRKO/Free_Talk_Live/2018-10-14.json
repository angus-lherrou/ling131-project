... the voice he'll Boston\nAlong song like that everybody\nHas their own\nRowing one on the science of brewing we're whatever group company downtown St Petersburg with Jeff Keller the owner and proprietor master brewer counter Meyer now recapping here\nThey're eight actually nine steps to creating beer first is your ingredients by the way all these are cigar Dave dot com the second is managing of the grains deepen grains in hot water for an hour between a hundred and forty due to a hundred and fifty nine degrees ... wrenching the sugar out of the grains creating the war boiling for about an hour\nNumber five is adding the hops is where we left off and counter you just gave me and Jeff you just gave me a half a glass year of hops and these are what ... ... this popular up very okay\nEspecially among the idea is that what that was one that sold out because everyone wanted it last year I'm getting notes pining this fruiting is floral little ... very credible now these kind of like little pellets is that how they're grown or they created and ... they're\nThey're grown in these little cones but pellets are easier to transport because an ounce of of a holy hops can actually go out a lot quicker and that it's about you know a lot larger so they they they just pulverized them and put them through an expert or that and put some of the ... gotcha so this is a system in either about them all to\nThis is what gives the beer a lot of flavor a lot of the various tasting notes whether it's real happy those bitterness units or the other case that you would get on the ballot right now we go to chilling show the beer is boiled for just about an hour and you're adding hops throughout your adding the hops okay then you go to showing\nNow as I say about earlier or with the hops but when you add them changes whether you're going to hit bitterness from it aroma from it or a flavor from it so if it takes you an hour or two hours to chill down all those Roman hops you put in\nHave been in hot water for long enough where they become very hops so the quicker you can chill it\nThe more you can retain the flavors that you want also the less chance for infection you have\n... and below eighty degrees mhm what's the rough temperature each other that I usually go for about Seventy five Seventy five yeah ... ... if you'd still how you're going to kill the east it's too cold is just going to keep these asleep you got to your friends you you will you want to make the environment for them really ah I'm happy well and it comes to beer obese does your does your friend not however\nAll right so the next thing is pitching they use this is what you give life here\nThis is where it becomes clear ... well yeah that a living thing I mean east is is is a beautiful thing and you can make alcohol you can make CEO to me it's just this is where the the life comes to come and they're different types of used there are there's different\nStrain yes range from different regions and they have different quality you know qualities each each one might produce same with water water water and\nThese are are um you know related to the regions they come from [noise] okay so then you pitched used and how long is the only time after you've cool down sanitation is a very key okay you don't want to infections of other bacteria is a wild geese it's where you can get really bad off flavors\nSo once you show that you've sanitize everything that's going to touch your beer at this point is still considered ward until east is added but\nSanitation is absolutely key okay so you've pitched used then what happens stepping you close it in ... in the form mentor and you add an air lock or a year yeah you you should have been drinking the whole [laughter]\nFor a you make it so that nothing he can get into it so there's blow off to basically or an airline which just bless the CEO to the east is creating come out but nothing coming okay\nSo fermentation how long about a month among so basically you you when you pitch the ... you then are you're putting the east into a new container and ended up from it ended up from mentor gotcha so you take the work world wars\nThat has the hops you show us down and you put it into the for mentor along with the used for thirty days now difference between a lawyer and a nail involves the field back\nTemperature temperature temperature um loggers east typically ferment around fifty five degrees and alleys typically ferment between sixty two to Seventy two degrees\nAnd one of the top fermenting and the other's bottom fermenting for the most probably for the most part okay gotcha so thirty days is now gone by now I'm looking here you've got beer ales sixty two to Seventy two degrees two to three weeks log or fifty five sixty degrees two to three weeks\nNow the term logger actually logger ring is aging and cold temperature ... a logger you'd ferment at fifty five these fifty seven for two or three weeks and then you would log or it for up to three months and that's actually the process of law governing is about thirty five degrees and you maintain that for\nFor two or three months national clears the flavor it clears the beer out for clarity\nSo loggers or longer ales about thirty days absolutely ... require a lot more patience to correct so thirty days have gone by with your ... your ... now what do you do comes out of the front runner so you put\nIt into another container that's also sterilized or you as a set amount of sugar and then you read what now a set amount of sugar a landing on how much carbon nation you won so this is this part of the east so alive\nOkay so you put it another bucket you add sugar and then you put it into each bottle and Catholic okay and what that sugar to the east will eat that sugar inside the bottle and creating a C.

Chicago grow their meat up um worked with a big win foundation in the early days on some education initiatives you just started networking just started getting connect yeah network and getting connected and really like\nI went right to the people who didn't know anything about it in my local area and you know got merchants on board and and really you know just use whatever\nIntellectual skills I think I had at the time to to get people to make the jump with us and yeah it was great we had weekly meet us we had twenty to fifty people every ... days in a mall is rust belt city you know in the mid west Milwaukee so\nUm yeah I jumped in and through that I I started doing some research and a little bit of writing for different projects or\nI found I become friends with some of the people in the industry and pop away and I were friends with ed ... yeah\nAnd uh he hired me um and I worked there for two years and then left at the end of twenty sixteen like January twenty Seventeen and were you in California at that time yeah yeah so everyone on the team lived lived in San Diego to work to work at it so we move made the move across country and everything [noise]\nUm yeah so that's kind of story I worked for a number of ...\n... my way through 'em and now you're doing your own thing right yeah but he told me ... labs yeah so tell me about that I've moved back to Wisconsin about a year ago hence the name yeah hence the name you know the badger state\nBadger honey badger of course to so adventurous studio it's my ... you know I have a lot of a\nDeal slow on my desk and job availability job opportunities that come across my desk that usually refer out a lot and I just decided you know I'm I'm I'm collecting myself from the fray of the whole year you know twenty Seventeen and I'm working at start ups for a number of years and just\nTrying to cool off a bit um but\nThe universe was telling me there's tons of people\nWho who needed to be inspired the way I was back when I first found out about you know when I first took the plans to learn about it\nAnd they're ready they're ready now in Memphis structure is much you know the industry and the infrastructures mature it to the point where can handle you know more people and there's a hundred thousand approximately available jobs in the space so out\nUm so yeah I I I could cure a talent in uh the mid west in Madison, Wisconsin specifically which is where I live now and\nFind creative spine developers engineers technical people I'm legal legal people uh who wanted exposure to this even just to moonlight and it and I can give them that exposure so I'd build the teams around some of the projects that come on my desk and\nAnd people kind of you and they they are you kind of helping people find help basically is that what you're doing\nSo I find freelancers who have skills are programmers programmers and ... and creative marketers copy writers um you know again like a business developers are legal professionals and\nThey you know I come become aware of them because uh you know they come through different co working space is that I frequent in Madison or something and we you know you never find out about them and place them with the opportunity so you're kind of like a head hunter but not really\nWell I Want it to be a home for them so we have our own projects and I encourage people to like work on those but yeah if uh if I'm able to bid for a contract for some consulting work\nI'll need to build a team around that to provide the service fill out a curator talent for the team and be able to kind of manage it or just oversee it and let the talented people become leaders\nIn the industry in in ... most people only need three weeks maybe three months\nOf exposure to this content to realize they can apply their skill somewhere and so that's I I Want us to be that curb up for them and you're specifically focusing on people regionally like people in the Wisconsin predominantly yeah that's where I look first but again we have freelancers from all over the world do okay yeah and of course\nPeople who are native to Wisconsin maybe you don't live there anymore or people who went to school at U. W. and don't live there any more of course I'm it's great to have that kind of local\nA local culture involved and my idea is that um we're gonna drawing a lot of\nEconomic value from outside of our region sure and that's going to go in and make people's lives better and maybe make the community and you know the town better city better also\nSo uh it's badger labs I was asking if there's a website there apparently isn't one so you're really know where people were kind of felt the we have some projects that we're trying to keep a little bit low key I'm doing some really cool things with the lightning network and um yeah so there will be a website very soon and there will be more announcements and we'll be talking about in the ...\nWe're talking about like you know like what would you want to reveal to our audience in a very short time\nI think uh you know of course I'm all these chains have a you know have an application for certain people you know use them in different ways I gravitated to lightning I think that's where a lot of\nThe interesting um energy\nIs right now and the lightning is a future kind of here now but sort of futuristic products are coming onto the bitcoin watching we talk more about uh can you hang out with the second ... with us here from ... labs and this is ... whereas the free state block chain digital assets conference yesterday\nFear for my sister has really mellowed a lot\nShe is a hundred and five pounds of shiny happy dog for life the shedding staff itching and stopped\nSince two thousand and one we've held more than a quarter million dogs get over their nutritional deficiency misery and saved our customers billions in sales\nAnd we tried failed except of come to China by drought and now if you want to talk now you got to see how I Am a legacy fatty I think the guy that are cooked out regular dog\nIs Tricia dying to fight for life\nYour dog it scratched bank or shed like crazy competed either by for help\nEight five four to eight eight five nine four one K.

out here doing bonus or extra interviews we just had so many great people to talk to\nWe filled up two full days of content day three yeah I Know and and it's it's like a man or from having a every five minutes somebody goes by and I'm like oh we've got to talk to them just like dashed back is like ... from heaven where you can actually spend a dash in real life\nIn New Hampshire and actually received dashed back to well balanced whale or a big fan of dash you do a lot with the dash crypto currency I think it was yesterday shall we had Darren tap or no sorry was our first or for shows a Wednesday night\nWe had there and tap on a who's more into the technical math side of things and you're out there you're in the streets you're promoting you're you're getting out there you go into conferences or you're going to local businesses what else are you doing with dash these days\nJust so I'm Still the co editor of the um chief editor of the desperate news which is the the only as far as I Know that dedicated news outlet in the world and we're starting to do a lot of big foray into PR outrage for example getting into major publications such as going to ask yeah we've gotten a couple of Forbes articles lately to\nSold on about that are yeah ... was purchased us\nThat's awesome uh yeah somebody actually the radio station that were running ads\nOn in Keene now the talk station and came running ads promoting the bitcoin embassy my sales guy saw that in Forbes and sent me a sales guy at the radio station sent me an email saying hey I think he'd like to see this and I hadn't seen it yet so so it's definitely a getting around out there um and you mentioned dash ... news you also hosts a podcast we ended up letter gentleman\nA that is called ... news three and he goes broadcast it precisely and that is what once a week every every Friday at three PM eastern also available on A L are endowed at them as part of our regular rotation of great uh liberty oriented podcast\nSo ah Chris yeah I Know that you wanted to talk about you know bringing business owners on board with\nWith crypto currency it's something that we all have experience in um you've been downtown famously on CNN actually you know purchasing for businesses are here in uh in Portsmouth and so you know what it's like being there and interacting with these merchants and sometimes things go wrong and there's some bumps in the road but you gotta\nThem on and the first place um and we're seeing a huge adoption of dash in Venezuela where Caracas we talked earlier it was yesterday I don't think you were here for our panel but we had a panel\nWhere it was people from Ken in Fort Smith talking about why New Hampshire's crypto mecca and why people who are into crypto currency ought to come here and help augment and make bigger and more effective the already very effective movement that we have because Portsmouth in Qena are the number one and two cities from what I can tell per capita\nAs far as uh crypto currency adoptions first use in businesses in real life\nCaracas, Venezuela is number three and they have way more than raw numbers they've got like over a thousand I as from what I've heard taking dash uh but uh if you do per capita actually Portsmouth thinking actually beat Caracas but crowded Los or not either way\nIt's a I Believe that they're they're going to ... thousand that's accepting businesses in Venezuela okay as of now called all of us when all Venezuela Caracas accounts for a more than over Fifteen hundred yeah so for for ...\nI I don't remember the population of the city it's over a million yeah but so it's I think it's the oldest two it's still it's getting close to where we we will have\nThat as the highest density unless it's going to happen yeah yes probably going to happen unless we get off our liberty loving\nBooties and will do something that actually get anything done over here well I mean we are getting things done I must say for instance there's there's ... there's levels to the games and figure I thought that we were the hardcore people but then do people with an actual hunger for ... better known literally hunger\nRight yeah that's what makes the difference because and it was one of the critiques that was leveled at uh at at the sort of the New Hampshire movement in any pay that I was defending against and some of these are the ... the master notes have conversations with dash about how they're going to vote on things or whatever\nAnd one of them was being very very critical the guy from KUVO cash actually who it was\nA very very critical of uh of is saying that well you know it's needed in Venezuela what's there really isn't this you're never going to be able to get people to spend crypto without subsidizing it so it's not sustainable blah blah blah\nI mean what do you have to say as far as should all the effort to be focused on Venezuela or is there a value and doing what we're doing here in in New Hampshire\nFor us to be fair the person giving that comment is also levy criticisms against Venezuela as well oh yeah he gets ... any of that project a lot of grass [laughter]\nThe real question we have to ask ourselves the so the the short answer is yes absolutely this works everywhere this is valuable to average people everywhere the problem is\nWe have not found yet how to walk backwards from the ... product\nTo where it actually makes sense in dollars and cents what do you mean by the end product and we know why crypt those great we always permission list it fast\nIt has a decentralized network it's decentralized all this kind of censorship resistant whatever else you want to call it we know all those things that why it's all your minds the banks of the eyes of God we have all that in our brain is a theoretical concept I Want to just tell merchants\nAnd they often use fake accounts to generate fake like then fake shares that's artificially inflates engagement for their inauthentic pages and post that they share misleading people about the popularity and improving their ranking and the news feed\nThis activity goes against what people expect on Facebook and violates our policies against ...\nTo claim okay so if it's true and then obviously\nAren't going to prove their claim here right they don't they're not going to show any evidence because again they had eight hundred or whatever five hundred something pages\nUm but if it's true that top block or the free thought project\nWas using ... armies of fake users or hiring a you know some India Company in India with a bunch of people sitting in a boiler room or just clicking like some things or whatever 'cause you can do that right or that so if they were actually doing that which I highly doubt because let me tell ya cop block\nA basically had no budget ... when it was sold or buy a demo Freeman to the highest bidder and we still don't know who that person is the site continues to operate I still have an active blogging account there so I still have the ability to post\nOn top blocked out or in fact if you go to that site you'll see the last five posts were from me nobody else has been posting their\nUm you know I'm just sort of try and I don't know what I'm trying to do you know keep the flame alive to rise to some extent but I remember talking with a team of freedom in about the site when he was selling it when I found out he was selling and I talked to him I said well hey man why don't you come to us and you know ask us if\nWe wanted to buy it because he said well everybody who was active\nWould decide because I was never really that active with it right or he said everybody was active with the site they turned it down and and so he gave me some details at that time about like revenue from advertising in\nThe ... barely paid it's hosting bill right so they didn't have like a bunch of money or even a little bit of money to go and you know go to five or or wherever it is that you hire these you know fake likes 'cause I Know you can get them on line and you can you know pay somebody and then somehow whether it be through some kind of a script\nOr actually have some you know Nigerian guy in a room somewhere clicking creating new accounts and clicking lights on things or whatever\nYou can get these things but I don't buy for a second the claim that caught by any other crazy thing is that it's it's it's basically as you said it's been dead for six months at least I mean since the ... I mean it was sold ages ago he said that the Facebook wasn't dead\nA demo sold the Facebook to someone else actually so somebody bought the website but before that a demo had sold off or a book\nAnd after that happened the Facebook\nOr for ... started to promote another police accountability page which is fine you know whatever hey\nIt's an old brand you got a new brand do you buy the old brand up and use it to promote your New Britain that that makes sense yeah um so I just wanted to be clear that even though the site itself wasn't a that content creating the Facebook page purportedly why not that I was following it because again I haven't been on Facebook\nRight and I do know that there are people that will share things in or attempt to share them in every group there in ... and I would share only in the groups I thought they were appropriate for\nBut I Would share and more than one group prior to that would pose that there was a candidate and I'm not going to specify in what state or for what office but there's a libertarian candidate that I Know\nThat he posted a few days ago that his\nOf posting in groups was restricted for twenty four hours because he tried sharing the same post in every group he was at and and you know there are things if you a post too often that Facebook says this looks like it\nThe robot yeah it is ... ... yeah if you had to have like a robot it's understandable why company wouldn't want to throttle you in that particular case\nI mean it just does this just make the argument against Facebook in Huntsville is an issue and against I mean why is it up to Facebook to decide what people can share and publish it just or their platform they can decide where am I I understand it it's a platform\nBut why you as a user would anybody want that well so the users are just people who want to connect with people right that's why people got on Facebook in the first place\nYou oh I can connect with my grandma round the Florida it sounds like we were like the evolution of how social media came about so hey wouldn't hurt for people who you know or maybe go at one time\nOr do you remember geo cities or you're too young for that young for are you kidding me I was like the first users\nZero cities used to be a thing and then there were ... free way of life but he will let people here say ... but yeah\nOK what does that that's not the original name there was SARS the original name I don't remember yeah anyway he was right but there's no like now can I knew that there is some data that but you know like that's the earliest one that I could remember where people could\nMake up a page and post whatever they wanted and then they would join these things called Web rings yeah yeah where are you know you put the script on your a page and then to help people find things\nAnd then I remember ... I had one on one of my first website we all did I doubt yeah evolved into different things and then\nYou know something happened something happened and here comes my space and then it just sort of like further centralize as the host staying\nAnd then people for some reason what from my space to Facebook and\nWell there's nothing wrong with the idea right like of a hey here's a place where you can connect with a bunch of people that was the original idea behind Facebook which was originally it was a college platform remember it was for college students to be able to kind of find one veteran once it opened up to the general public\nIs wet it seems as mass migration from my face to face but\nWell I think it started targeting when they opened up there basically targeting high schoolers and all the college kids were on board with Facebook so already\nUm these that had been restricted they've college kids and so then they go all the high school kids on and then and now there's all left\nYeah but but prior to that then all the parents and grandparents got armies they wanted to see their kid right and I read so we ended up with this month and you can find all your body is like you know get Twenty years later or whatever you could go on Facebook and look up your old high school they see where they are now\nThere was another ... for that back in the day before last forever either before yet no classmates I think it was before there was also a friend finder it's the one where you have sex with people there are no that's I don't [laughter]\nOh by the way I pulled it up a so geo cities according to ... uh was apparently originally called Beverley hills Internet\nFor a very short time yeah change ultimately member I don't I don't think anybody and I think I'm the only like one of the only people in the world who knew that like I've never heard anybody else called UCs anything other than just that he's right so um and so so then what happened was once they created this platform\nWhere everyone to connect with every one or at least it felt like there were a lot of people on these platforms\nDidn't started to add more restrictions making it more difficult to actually reach the people with whom you want it to connect by using things like normal post you could still send a message directly to somebody else and it still can do that\nFine but uh but you know the idea of a a page that has people liking it in following it will now you can't actually have your followers see your post unless you pay Facebook to reach them and so others will come up here it's the talk live\nFolks this is very important information what's to be said about CBD\nAncient life well dot com are CBD is made from him\nAnd has point zero zero three T.

next door to that places where I have my dinner last night after the convention wrapped up and I paid well actually I had breakfast for dinner [laughter]\nBut ah I paid whiz crypto currency and any makes that possible in fact they made it possible that a few dozen different establishment here in southern New Hampshire recently expanding out globally uh they've got a place now ... pub in Bristol, England that's using any pay and they've they've done internationalization\nTo make it so that you can use different\nFields currencies within any base if you're in a different country like say Venezuela right or you can try to use the you know their currency to calculate actually I don't know if they've added the boulevard I think that maybe one of the ones that have an added\nBut they're working on a cause they I think they added the old boulevard not knowing that there was because the government of Venezuela was going to replace the boulevard wherever they are around us\nBut regardless anybody's been working on adding new currencies are behind the scenes to make it so if you're international if you're outside of the United states you can still use any effect you can use

people would avoid it work at the airline\nBut yeah there are people that I've worked with that they would just walk around instead of doing what they were supposed to\n... ... yeah yeah I I can relate to that I had a guilty that myself when I worked at the airline I I always try to avoid work but uh every time they set their head in the cockpit and I wasn't there they they knew right away I couldn't go to a bar or a hall\nOf fame yeah Facebook all the spin on my list for quite a while and you're talking about it now so we ... throw it out there\nOf course first of all the uh the relationship between you quit your government and who is your\nAh companies like Facebook and I wanted my my allegation is that the hand and the reality is already to a great part that Facebook and companies like Facebook um they're intended to be or government now in in the future and they've already succeeded to some degree\nAnd and then on the exact a part of the problem that you're talking about right now I'm first of all let me ask you a ... a ... well I guess I already know the answer to it but mastodon is an alternative to\nFacebook and but but now that on is\nMore of an alternative waiter I'm Facebook for instance has features are that are like groups and put it into a Twitter doesn't have that are Facebook pages are probably the most like Twitter\nIs on Facebook or so that's what I Would say you know your personal a profile and whatever pages you have you can sort of duplicate that with Twitter\nOr if you watch and it's and that's like what you were talking about earlier Chris Twitter did it the way you expected to which is where if you want to have a business having a page it has to have a separate account okay so you've got to have separate accounts for that yeah um go ahead\nYes to the next it on a in theory any practicality is good because if everybody goes to mastodon that is not as controlling at work or controlling at all\nNo it is our massive oceans de centralized unfettered rated so these terms mean that anybody who wants to can download a copy of the mass did on servers software I've done it and install it yeah you guys have like a national survey for just you and ... yes [laughter] oh and so you can install it and limited to to users\nOr limited to two thousand uses or our big you know you want it to be\nAnd people can use that server you get to set the rules for that server\nUm in fact yours is kind of locked down if it is I'm friends with ... I was able to connect with him\nBut his post we normally would be a private so like the average person can't just find Bob and find his post\nWhereas I've got my post on delivered on server and mine are all public so anybody that wants to see those you know can do that and they can follow me there but the different servers so if liberate on where to get a hair up there bud and decide they don't want me any more they could kick me off\nBut I could just joined a different message on server or start my own and so that just centralized aspect means that it's not impervious to censorship meaning that the owner of a server can still decide the real it's actually got censorship built into it I'm potentially but at the same time\nIf you know other like minded sorts you're not going to be censored from correct so you join us or whether you feel more comfortable or more at home on and then you're much less likely to be targeted by some sort of ...\nRight and that answers my question and that and I wasn't sure exactly if that's how ... out of work and if it wasn't that's what I was going to suggest and ask 'em if it if that could be done exactly what they are doing\nSo you know to eliminate the problem of having 'em half a dozen big companies that everybody must joining one or more of them in order to communicate with other people if it could be an open source a a a code for right these things so that that anybody could uh uh create a", "show_name": "Free Talk Live", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "14"}
