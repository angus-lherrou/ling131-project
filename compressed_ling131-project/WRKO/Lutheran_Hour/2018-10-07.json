all of those whose work makes it possible for us to gather here today to sit\nAt your feet in your word less us and keep everyone in your care through your son Jesus Christ star lord oh man\nIt's right there at the start of history the start of it all the genesis as it were in the beginning God created that is our heavenly father will to create\nTo give life where none existed or exists it's there where God for nothing brings everything into being\nYou know the history you've heard it many times before from darkness comes light\nThan water then land than vegetation then sun and moon and stars\nThen see life followed by life on land we see God's handiwork bringing life into its very first existence and God made the beef up the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds and everything that creates on the ground according to its kind\nAnd God's saw that it was good\nThis accounts alone would be a magnificent event to watch ethics for sure but God wasn't done\nNo his crowning achievement was still to come then God said let us make man in our image after our likeness again God brings to life that which never was it's the creator the one who is life bringing into life\nOr is\nIt begins first with one man than being the loving father seeing how sad man is with not having a fitting partner he puts man to sleep and takes from the man a rebel and from it\nMakes a woman and the man said this that lasted bone in my bones and flush of my flash she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man\nHere it is where to become one again Adam is completed as his wife who was made from his side is\nAt his side again and God Bless them and God said\nTo them be fruitful and multiply instill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the or\nThe giver of life now gifts the couple with the ability to create more of what God loves so much and let's not misunderstand as even though man and woman have the ability to create a life together is only one God gifts to them\nThat all life is actually created he is lord after all [noise] so we're wants no lights existed now life in many forms exists today and God's crowning achievement that of mankind has since grown to over seven billion people\nIn such a huge number it is hard to not feel a little in significant I think families who are blessed with three four five or ten children and how some of the siblings feel as if they aren't even noticed among many others in their own home vying for the attention of their parents\nAnd as a parent it can be challenging to give equal amounts of time to each child something demand more than others\nAnd it isn't wrong it just is what it is that said though our heavenly father has no such limitations no he is greater and he has kept a watchful eye on his entire creation and each individual he's created with\nThe attention is if we were the only one on her before I born Jew in the womb I knew you says God each life\nBefore even coming into existence God has cast his gaze upon delighting in having hear his voice and that we would be led home to him\nNow if you don't know the story it isn't only about the good stuff\nNo there is the part where death entered where God had created so much life\nGod's enemy the devil the great liar and deceive her chained to destroy that which God loves the most you see the devil cannot be God nor take his place in fact when the devil tried\nGod banished him and send him away from the heavenly places hating God as the devil does though knowing his powerless a beating God one on one the devil targets God's crowning achievement seeking to hurt God by hurting\nThose he loves\nJust as he did with the first man and woman in the garden the devil continues telling lies that\nWe can be like God creators of our own destiny is that we should focus on what we want and try to get it at any cost don't worry be happy for that is what you see you can trust me I can show you how to get it\nOnce created in the image of God our lives got twisted and turned upside down and where once we walked with God now are natural inclination is to walk to the beat of our own drum\nWhere before we would have seen the value in every one who was created in God's image\nWe now see them as a means to our ends obstacles to our goals or simply inconveniences wars now exists among people's tribes and nations as we seek to get our own wants Matt\nWe may lie and cheat or speak poorly of others to get the promotion we want or something else of value that we place the lives of others over\nWe may see those who are born with physical or mental challenges as of less value them those born typical maybe we think there must be a curse from God at play there the parents must have done something wrong in their lives to be given such a great burden\nYet to think this way we'd be wrong the disciples were so you'd be in good company and the gospel of John we recall the account of where Jesus healed blind beggar\nIn their travels de Jesus and the disciples pass by and saw a man who had been blind from birth and his disciples asked him\nRabbi who send this man or his parents that she was born blind and Jesus answered it was not that this man send or his parents but that the works of God might be displayed in him\nThis account serves to show how wrong we may be in our thinking for this man had a God given purpose\nWhen a life is created when we are blessed with such a great gift we may see it as nearly inconvenient", "show_name": "Lutheran Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "07"}
