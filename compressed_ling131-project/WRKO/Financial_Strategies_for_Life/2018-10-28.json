read all ... it would create some crimes up north when it was warm weather but not never been happier limited to the south the uh um the uh that\nArea is a interesting because it it's always been a

also\nMany um religious\nMovements from the banking century actually I'm a native from that part of the country I don't know what it has to do with my book but uh it is a very interesting area and I I'd like to know more about it\nYou know there's an argument and true crime that the the ... the ... murders and unjust unsolved\nCrimes like that seep into the soil and I and then did they tend to

and ah along the shore on this one particular train ride like came in and out of this yard um\nThey had four or five of these uh ... degenerate hobo is that stayed there in the yard that were actually killed\nAnd they found out that they were all killed by actresses they were they were chopped up the axes were supposedly taken off of the trains\nAnd as it was I Believe a total of five bodies found and um I Believe at one point Eliot Ness when he was first getting in to his position he\nWas asked to go ahead and look at this and this was one of the things that he had never solved and they said it bothered him greatly till he white you know till he retired do you know if that has anything to do it or are you familiar with that case at all\nYeah they um uh I I I Know exactly what it is not

on the name by which the yeah Brian is\nCrime series is known but they've actually started in Newcastle Pennsylvania Nineteen twenty two and then spread the Cleveland in the Nineteen thirties I\nWrote about that period of the crimes at some length in in a popular crime but that is ...\nNot it's not it it it they were they were acts murders they were connected to train the but it it's twenty or the

killed or a she if she did it she used to play to the act and you said the other guy used the blunt end so that would be I guess that'd be something else against it but I Want to ask you real quick\nDid they ever have a picture of this guy somebody could have had to if you're given a description of them that you know we had newspapers back then\nYou know we had a you know we had a Morse code and teletype and stuff like that I mean there had been some sort of a picture circulated or something of this guy right to the people knew about him later he just\nBlew into and out of town and do whatever I Want to know who he was you know when you're when you buy\nBuy it that's a really big on the first crime\nEverybody knew everybody knew what he looked like it it was a very unusual looking man\nBut for some reason that we can't figure out no one ever did that we can fine no newspaper that we can fine ever did a drawing of\nAnd then posted it and I don't know why they didn't do it it was common practice and and the wild west in the same era the it was ... it was common to drawings of criminal in that case there are drawings of\nThe a police inspector who was in charge of the cave drawing\nFor the house and he's tried to use it all can set the house on fire and there's a drawing of the oil cat\nBut none of them are very ... it listed Bill James I Would just running out of

I should say most of the more educated and try to be more accurate also before really continuing today I wanted to reach out to and I hope this couple is listening hey Susan and Walter\nNormally I wouldn't do this on air Lou uh but they're from the northeast I won't go any further than that and they had reached out to me um before one of my travels and I believe I took down their telephone number incorrectly\nAnd there were some important matters that they wanted to discuss with me and I've since tried to reach them in vain\nAnd I don't know if they just continue listening since I haven't reached out to them that's unusual for me I must admit low because you know I'm very diligent about taking down a telephone number and returning the call\nSo if a if there was a Susan Anna

that is and that is eight seven seven seven to zero nine\nFive zero zero so I Hope I Do hear from them and my sincere apologies for not having followed through in ... due to my error and perhaps having transposed a couple of numbers so I just um I Would like to hear from them um you know here's a\nA something that occurred to me when you're ready to retire\nHow about retiring your risk as well and things like that\nYou know isn't isn't that the prudent thing to do quite frankly\nUm think about that if you can if you can retire what if you could retire with all your risk at the same time\nAnd you don't have to be concerned about risk and volatility and the potential of loss and you know when we speak of guaranteed contractual lifetime income\nIt's not difficult for what someone you with whom you might be working now or have it in mind well I'll always have retirement income yes but will it be\nNever ending never diminishing and we'll talk about that in a little bit and I'll explain to what I'm referring\nUm as a matter of fact that that leads into a um a particular article that was um that I came across this just this week and it's it was about the money recovery after the market collapse and um it\nWas it was authored I don't want to take credit for it uh it was authored by a let me see if I can come to it a Steve savant\nUh and uh you know if I'm going to take some information a that's a bit specific I Want to give appropriate credit and that's that's important Lou and there are a bit of in a bit of offhand that comments in here that aren't mine but bear with\nMe and he starts out by saying it's not that the public has a brain dead just vacant on the proper use of money [laughter] fat and he continues to say you know it's kind of powerful bite a welcome your audience [laughter] yeah that's ...\nBut the reality is most people aren't aware of Lou and and and you know we you and I we talk about the the old paradigm and how people are often not receptive to saying well why don't I explore what might be to my benefit if you will hold on something else\nThey don't even know because most of the time when you present these problems to them like for example inflation or like the volatility of the market they look at you and go oh what am I going to do that and even ... sing it being opened alternatives they know China does exist\nYes and and you know it's coincidental I don't know ... times today that there was another caller another article I read that was maybe not as direct but talking about the lack of financial awareness at an education of of people today in America\nSo it it you know this statement maybe as a little bit strong and he goes to talk about the worst demographic about the country's population are senior citizens\nThat that aren't aware of of what\nUh what can be done or they know what's occurred to them but don't know how to remedy and it continues here you this is the article you would you would think that when you live through a crisis like the great economic recession or seniors\nSeniors to be or seniors at the time last thirty to forty percent over the last decade by the way we tend to forget easily don't we Lou yes that last decade two thousand and one to two thousand and ten\nOr you would be shaken out of your left her gee that you would suddenly awake out of your economic stupor\nAnd rebalance your portfolio you would think with more conservative investments as you drawn nearer to your retirement date but the article continues but no you were cheered on by your financial advisor that says your financial advisor with securities that is and the\nFunds et cetera you were cheered on by your financial advisor to double down on your risk to make up for losses the very last says that um that position due in and exhorted you to stick it out during the market meltdown of two thousand and eight\nNow it it gets a little bit more interesting many ... baby boomer portfolios finally gone back to par\nIn two thousand and Fifteen I think most of us at least those of us those who I should say those who stayed in the market right and and didn't jump out because they couldn't take it and they missed the market run up but when you think about it that's as the article states\nThat wasn't that decade of growth blew it was a decade of recovery\nSays catch up right yeah they will catch up\nAs a matter of fact I I found this out you know when the market drops forty percent you'd need sixty seven percent to recover\nSorry 'cause he lie all the girls in the meantime yeah it it's\nIt's rather amazing so and and to add more insult to injury most people who are in the market we're paying fees and management for this\nFor this breaking even advice at least as the article states if you will so if you take exception to what I'm bringing forward I'm not the author but I found that\nThe way he position that rather unique and put it very simply a and here's it continues a bit\nThe baby boomer generation is often referred to as the sandwich generation caught between and here we are paying for parents long term care costs and tuition for their children's education right or the squeeze was on for such a long time that they fail to pay off their home mortgage\nWhich is a first an American retirement modeling\nAnd this is this statement is making reference to again in the old days if you will you you did have Social Security or covered by a pension by the time you're ... you're retired you'd have your mortgage paid off you maybe had a little bit of savings you didn't live that long and everything was pretty golden\nWell we know that's not the case and it and that continues here what's a baby boomer to do a that they're they talk continued about you know you can continue with assets under management with securities\nUm but even though the vast majority of seniors need guaranteed income that they can't outlive\nSo if you don't have a particular plan or a strategy that protects a this is my um editorializing now if you do not have\nA a um a plan to protect those assets and most importantly provide that guaranteed and I'll add never diminishing income\nOf ... really what are your prospects for having a comfortable secure retirement\nAnd the article continues as we know Social Security benefits\nTend to help pay some of the basic living expenses but rarely can a pay for all of them and sadly many people as we know Lu are relying on Social Security right um and it continues here the article I'll I'll Try to put in the interest of time here um [noise] let's say\nIf I can get to it um and it talks about for the last decade financial advisors unregistered representatives have touted the bull markets earnings the sustainability in contrast to the so called negro returns of lifetime annuities wealth\nAnd then it continues and it states how you need to have at least some of your assets in in the fixed annuity which guarantees you a principal and most importantly again protects\nProtects your income but I Want to focus for a moment if I may where it talks about let's see uh where was that um the the the uh the statement about the so called Amigo returns of lifetime annuities well\nLet me state this open openly and proudly ... what what is um\nWould you qualify a meager return with full principle protection and having gained twenty F depending on timing over the past couple of years not just gained\nThey're insulated from economic and market downturns oh and Oh yes if you're not sure if you have enough income with which to retire\nAnd what that income is going to be you'll eat in a moment we'll hear how you can reach out to me and we'll sit down with no fee remember I Am your financial practitioner who makes house calls\nAnd we'll do some forward income planning\nSo that if you're unsure of gosh I've got to stick it out I got to go another five or six years I don't like what I'm doing I've had more moral responsibility thrust upon me in the workplace and I don't know how long I can take it\nWon't you have more peace of mind knowing\nThat what your savings are really worth to you what your your income benefits are\nMatching them to Social Security if you're eligible for Social Security\nThat's the type of income planning we can do and Lou more often than not when I sit down with our our callers and and we go over that and I put together the the financial security and the income planning scenario\nI can tell you the peace of mind that most people have knowing that you know what I don't have to work another eight years as I thought I can do it in three or four years or I didn't realize how much income could be generated\nFrom the asset or the money that I have now and that's what most people don't know\nI mean you know yeah and again they had this is what this is the big enemy for a lot of people in this instance as they just had no awareness of the possible alternatives there you've got it so they keep hitting their head against the same ... all\nThe up then you know what the heck can get a little numb to that and maybe you get it or or it can really continue to hurt either way it's uncomfortable Lou how are we doing for the first half of the program\nAbout three minutes okay\nSo I can kind of fade out with so again and we'll get into a women in retirement and the and the concerns in our second half\nBut again keep in mind please the perfect way to have a financial financially stress free retirement is to protect your principal a lock in any gains that might you might have the opportunity to make\nAnd that is gains linked to the stock market and on top of that\nTo have a guaranteed never diminishing even possibly increasing lifetime income for you and your spouse if you're married and that's what we provide Lou guarantees not guesses gains and no losses\nAnd I I think that's the ... the those are the if you will the financial tips of the day ... and and speaking of being married\nAnd I've encountered with I should say it this way when I sit down and we do this income I call it the the planning narrative if you will which is in twenty seven pages which charts and graphs right it's just a couple of pages very simple and straightforward\nAnd anyone can understand it so it it puts everything in perspective\nAnd people appreciate the completeness of it\nBut the simplicity of it as well\nAnd having said that what we also look at is the survivor income gap another words the often experienced decrease in income that will occur if there was a married couple to the surviving spouse\nSo we look at that upfront because that if it's not explored\nKen ... can be a very very significant can have significant impact\nTo a surviving spouse for the rest of his or her life\nSo again keep in mind what we discussed if you wish to reach out to me we've got the website through which ah or on which you can download\nOur my book a which is more of a pamphlet really the swan portfolio allowing you to sleep well at night which is the name of it\nAnd that set WWW dot income for life planning dot com that's income for income for life planning dot com

or in most instances are asking to be seen\nAnd and I welcome that opportunity to be sure [noise] so are we we still have I I didn't know where you know where\nWe had to sign up for the first that
