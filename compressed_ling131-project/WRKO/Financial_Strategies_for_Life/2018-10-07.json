that than those of us who are approaching are in retirement with with parents that are still alive or at least one the likelihood we've got some longevity genes\nAnd we have to make sure that it's it's going to be there for us and the other part of that equation if he wanted to call it so that's wonderful I Need income I needed for the rest of my life\nBut wait a minute I don't think I've saved quite enough and we're going to get to that a little bit later in the program today\nUm but I Want to make a ... because you know we have to frame what the circumstances are because people are are pretty much involved in their day to day activities and don't really have a full picture of what's confronting number ... ... will try to present a bit of that picture today\nBut I Want to go over a few things especially in the first half of our program I'm about I'm virtually all of our stations cover and most of the stations cover the full hour so you know buckle up and um and get ready because we're going to discuss\nFor some listeners may be a few things they heard before but it never hurts to reinforce and the reason I say that I received calls each week sometimes from just someone who's just tuned in\nAnd something strikes them and they haven't heard any you had\nHave not heard the program before but often it's from people who have been listening over a long period of time and they might have heard the same thought or the same strategy may be set in a slightly different way\nAnd suddenly it resonates Hulu and it prompts them to call so I'm just like learning a line for a play or a production for repetition is the key until you get it\nAll you know the other thing that happens too and you're right that's absolutely the way it happens where something just gets presented in such a way so it rings true to you it it it it's splitting the way you can make use of\nBut I think what also happens quite often is that people\nAre listening to the program and don't have a particular need that they're listening for the all of a sudden we touched on something\nThat came up as a need this week all of a sudden they had a question about long term care all of a sudden they had a question about survivor anyway and gap or and all of a sudden that's prominent in line and they met and not listen to it before because it wasn't on their radar and now all of a sudden it's like oh yeah I just talked about this last week of and do something about this\nWell yes and that's another factor when the when the timing is just right if you will um I I've you know ... that's such a cross section of of people that are that are calling and I I Want to emphasize two things one is\nIt doesn't matter how much you have it's what you do with what you have so I wanted to I Want to make that very clear as a as a as a reinforcement\nTo our let's call it regular or longer term listeners and especially for those just I'm just tuning in if you will it it's not about how much you have although\nObviously the more you have more you can do the more income you can generate but it's what you do with what you have and having said that I also want to impart something\nThat please don't feel intimidated with what you hear are thinking well I don't know if I should call I don't think I have enough money it may not be worth steps time I'm thrilled that excuse me for the expression out the window or what ever the circumstances or what ever the\nFinancial assets are um I don't care whether it's through thirty seven thousand and I'll give an example in a moment\nOf of that or or three hundred and Seventy thousand or more of retirement assets\nUm it it doesn't matter I can sit down and we can discuss and will work within whatever framework there is right and remember I Am your financial practitioner who makes house calls\nAnd there is no fee for my services I Want to repeat that I come to where you are most people feel comfortable with that I have a very flexible practice I don't see 'em you know of six people a day in an office and\nGive only Fifteen minutes each and then take a ten minute break and go into another office\nI have a number of associates around the country or what colleagues I should say\nWho have their practice set up that way Lew that's not as you know who I Am right I I like to keep things flexible I don't restrict the time let me bring this forward to now that I'm kind of on a roll I don't restrict the time that it takes two\nTo visit with someone I'm and I'm into it turns into literally I call it a visit a and the and the first meeting is usually to get to know the individual\nPresentation of what their circumstances are and then I'm a within a few days and taking the time to put a plan together you have to have a plan to put it very simply we look at what the income sources are\nWhat the assets are and then we look at what is the individual or or the couple trying to achieve and then we work towards finding a solution that can best fit that particular need or go who is that simple enough\nThat it should be anyway I Would\nThink so so I haven't spoken about that in a while so I just wanted to bring that forward so there should never be a hesitation to call\nFor the regarding the the the asset amounts or the individual circumstances I'm you know I I Want to speak a little bit for a couple of reasons about\nA existing ... retirement plans or I should say and of course most retirement plans are really savings plans to put it very simply write it it's a pile or a pool of money and I I don't want people to be allowed into complacency\nWent to I mean by that it's only in the past couple of years or so\nThat people are smiling about their four O. one K. or IRA account balances\nMost people have been in the market\nMany people um well went through two thousand and eight something got out of the market and have regretted doing so ever since ... I'm ... and then you have a choice that well many didn't have a choice because it only had had a little time on their side\nFigured you know what let me hope that it comes back and it has\nAnd people now are at that historically the highest um equity account imbalances an account of values that have ever existed isn't this a good time to take a look at that\nAnd we'll get into a couple of articles later in the program that talk just about that\nThat isn't it isn't it at a time to consider at least taking some of those assets and putting them into a financial strategy\nThat not only guarantees that amount guarantees you a principle but still allows for the opportunity to for growth in other words we can take away all the risk all the volatility and still have the potential for growth\nSo doesn't that make sense to lease explore what type of strategy exist that can allow you to do that especially whether you're in retirement or maybe have a few years to go before retirement quite frankly and remember let me emphasize something\nMost retirement savings plans are simply that their savings plans at some point you have to turn that savings account into a pension plan\nTo create the lifetime never diminishing income that you will need going forward and Lou on that note might you consider the drop at this point that let people know how they might\nWant to consider contact lenses grounded in your financial protection against mark and lost both providing you with a lifetime guaranteed predictable and sustainable income\nGetting started today with your income for life

planning dot com [noise]\nAnd went back\nAnd we are and Lou if um [noise]\nYou know so far there may not have been as much of a reason to say\nOr to give a call uh let me let me give a very specific reason why a someone may wish to call and I've been honing in on a four O. one K. and similar programs and participating employees over the past\nFew weeks more than ever and in just a brief moment or two I'll explain why in particular although I've always been discussing not simply put particularly if there are employees and participating employees who are listening\nWho are at least fifty nine and a half years of age\nAnd you're currently employed\nYou're currently participating in an employer sponsored\nAnd that's what we do and that's why people are calling in each week they either ask some questions and the majority Lou say we need to get together and again there is no fee for my services\nI give both of my time and it's as simple as that so having spoken as we did if you want to find out\nWell show me about ... thirty nine percent yield or how to secure my assets so I don't have to worry it's very simple all you have to do is reach out to me at eight seven seven\nSeven to zero Ninety five hundred eight seven seven seven to zero Ninety five hundred and let me get let me also bring up my website which I often don't do as much as I should my website is income I don't know if we still need the triple W. today I'm at\nThe end image assumed I think\nThat's pretty much assume that by most people remember um the technology buffalo earlier so in any case the website it's very informative\nAnd it is simply income for income for life planning dot com income\nFor life planning dot com and you can also email me and reach out to me through the website if you're so inclined as opposed to a leading a message through our toll free number I Would like to answer live but I'm not able to usually\nAnd in fact speaking of that Lou I'm One of one of my callers this past week and in particular regarding\nThe one K. concept which we talked about the four at length marrying the first half of the program I'm getting so many more people calling in each week about that but one person in particular who called\nHad been listening for awhile and said we knew we do need to get together I Do feel that the market will correct itself\nI still have a few years to go for me to buy to retirement but I Want to secure what I have and are there were some other assets as well but um this person wanted to discuss\nBut the reason I'm bringing it forward is this\nWhen I returned to call you know what the what her the response was oh I didn't know I'd be getting a call from Hugh staff yeah right I thought someone else was going to be calling me\nRight this is not a big company no high school kid no college graduates going to come out you're going to contact that if I'm\nGoing to be the one that does the follow up I'm going to be the one that does the planning and I'm\nRight on

M. E. R. T. O. N. by the way another Nobel Prize laureate in economics\nQuite frankly um and he said it pretty well and he's been very open and receptive\nA very openly and local you know when ... about what I'm going to bring up and just a moment but I I just want to not digress but I Want to reinforce something we have several of the brightest most articulate\nA economist individuals in the world Dr Robert Shiller Dr Robert ... whom I haven't brought up in quite some time and they all focus Hulu on taking steps to protect\nAnd putting monies or assets into these principle protected strategies who are in order to not not just to protect\nBut to create the income that people need as a matter of fact Dr Robert ... openly states you use the fixed index strategy and you apply what we have available if you wish\nOn inflation protected guaranteed lifetime income and that he's he suggests is the remedy for the wall\nThe cancer and and what is that Wall Street cancer it's the risk it's the volatility and it's the potential loss\nThat we eliminate\nTotally eliminate so that it doesn't infect or or spread to your to your portfolio to put it very simply and what is the biggest fear for most running out of income right move we solve that it's it's a non issue\nWell wrinkly let's look into that because of the year for fear is running out of income right mhm why you run out of income obviously depending on your assets and things like that but obviously in what we're talking about as longevity here right yes of course we've talked about the way things have changed over the last thirty or forty years where it's no longer a ten year retirement it's a twenty five year plus retirement\nAt this point so what if we could make ... ... it's based on how long you live as but what if we can make that a relative\nWell let me also brings something forward that I'm seeing increasingly and that is the best the income continuation if you're married to the surviving spouse\nRight that most people don't even\nAnd even many advisors I Would dare to say aren't even taking that into consideration you know you know what I've seen most people are looking at most advisors of handling a pile of money give me a pile of money and let's see what we can do with it\nWhat is that what is that what's the purpose of that pile of money you've got to to to determine\nWhat it's going to create as far as income in the future because most people have it and are accumulating it for income if it's for a legacy purposes\nThat you don't care about income but it's to get it to the next generation boy do we have some strategies that can multiply the value of that asset 'em and remind me lose so maybe I can touch upon at the ... the end of today's program\nBecause it was not my intent to talk about uh you know leveraging and and I'm getting them on the multiple of value to the air's\nBut uh the increasingly I'm I'm realizing when I sit down with couples\nAnd I bring up the the the income continuation to the survivor and in many instances the what's called the survivor income gap I don't create that it's it's there for most couples they the you know the their eyes wide and then they say I didn't realize that\nAnd let me tell you something else that I'm experiencing", "show_name": "Financial Strategies for Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "07"}
