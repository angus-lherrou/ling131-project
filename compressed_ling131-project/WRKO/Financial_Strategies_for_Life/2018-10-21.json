I Believe in his seventies or\nThomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point and obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be um the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts in time and um you know I spent ten years researching all this stuff\nAnd you know FDR not quite that much for sure but um there's this the information in the book is is pretty compelling I Will check it out\n[noise] uh east of the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi Maher said good morning welcome to coast\nTank a rancher thank you for taking my call my state I Do know that that did pont originally made their money to the science trade them for a day a wet I'm more a humane way to make money and the Rockefeller ah\nStarted out our lighting novels with kerosene but boy that combat stumble engine that guy's a ... like a byproduct then that can End Days ran they got down nice guy that I never have no idea how the relatives out well and you can be\nYou have a clue as to how they made their money ranching right\n\n[noise] well I Know that I I yeah I Do\nActually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business\nSo I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in the in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's where allegedly there and when he came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion\nAnd they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the stock market was not as big as it is today\nAnd they were only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influence things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with a new can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly\nAnd Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the you actually see the security Exchange Commission and FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote fix the courage to crush across\n[laughter]\nReally interesting stuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I Love to hear it but their their their money came from summer\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family uh probably it's money so you know just kind of a ... to me elation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those they used to call them the Boston brain in those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be some of that as well yeah\nI heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging these guys are never written a book\nOn let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour I'd be lucky [laughter]\nBy the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach names who wants to\nBe as best they can you know for them as\nFar as like the I I still get fascinated by stuff somebody will call in and say that you know the ...\nAnd because it wasn't that

again with Dr Shiller York City or in a few weeks I've been invited to a very small business conference in New York City\nAnd he is going to be the keynote speaker and um I I as I've said before he may not remember meeting maybe some years ago and I'm Out in on the west coast but um I I think it's going to be not I think I Know it's going to be top notch\nUh because he among others ... is a proponent of what we talk about our planning strategies and our our platforms where you don't have to guess in retirement but you'll be guaranteed\nThat stuff is I don't accept any risk I Can't make any deals that's a necessary component right to have to risk money to make it to to make gains\nKay what if what if I'm using this as an example because of the amount which is not a huge\nAnd it was the actual and I've spoken up before in our unique strategies not only is your principal protected\nBy the way over the risk of loss no risk of loss and of course were linked to the market and we need the market for growth ... what we don't need from the market is the risk\n... and the potential of loss but that's how you get grilled the need risk to get growth below what if what if and here's an example actual client and and I bring this with me and other statements all redacted so sure it doesn't matter who's it is\nThirty seven thousand dollars was deposited in June of two thousand and sixteen two years ago\nAnd by the way I have other a climate counts that are now coming due so to speak to lock imperative to the last ... in in in June of this year two thousand and Eighteen the thirty seven thousand dollars\nHas now become a rounding up there was thirty seven and change and\nThe thirty seven thousand had now become just shy of forty nine thousand dollars in a two year period\n... not a theoretical on paper value a new locked in value so if the next day the market dropped\nThat account was locked in at forty nine thousand right by my high school math that's thirty three percent well it's it's actually I Believe or even a bit beyond that that at least and unable to in that neighborhood\nYou know a lot of these are you how did you do for us now it is easy it's easy for someone who say well I'm I'm In the market and I've done pretty well\nBut are they real gains\nIt's on paper for most people\n... are they real gains and be with you expose the risk this person ... risk\nAnd now imagine if that were a third three hundred and Seventy thousand dollar accounting and Lou I have clients who are hundreds of thousands in these particular strategies whether they need income now or the growth is is being earned\nAnd from which to take income at some point later but we have\nTo dispel people of if that's the word I Want to use a of the myth of the old thinking that you can't have yield without risk that's\nThe old ... right and and many things have shifted these days\nWe have longevity we have strategies in programs that have evolved now too to a ... to dispel using your term the old paradigm that you can you don't need you can dispense with the risk\nOr dispel will use that again we're going to kill that we're in today you can you can dispense with the risk and still get the games if you will\nBut I get concerned for some people some times every time we say is there a risk of loss yes that they turn right off because why why do you say that thought processes without risky ... well I understand they they said well I can get their risk of loss and make you know one point five percent that that's not what I Want to do\nHave to get people to understand that zero risk of loss does not mean you can't get significant gains\nWell let me let me also mention something else not only what we've been discussing a gains without risk literally or elimination of risk and the and I'm remove all of the volatility and that's where\nParticularly I mean we have other uh index type a strategies which work\nVery nicely but in particular with Schiller\nA and when the market drops are a ... study I mean it's rather dramatic but what we can also do and I liked touting this because it's provable\nMost advisors if I may because accumulating is great but ultimately most people want income where you agree Lou yes and the the the percentage of the\nOf the of the period of time in which we are today\nFor a withdrawal rate or in other words a ... percent of your assets that you can withdraw so that you don't run the risk of running out of the income is generally considered today to be three percent right\nNow maybe or at four percent but most advisors are looking at the it's it's an old four percent rule ... they're looking at three percent well what if you could take out five percent\nAnd never not a risk eliminating the risk that you'll run out of income quite frankly may not sound like a lot\nBut that's what forty percent increase in income so to put it together how would you like to eliminate risk from your retirement or or other assets still get growth if there's growth to get right protect at all if we have the adverse\nEconomic and markets circumstances and increase potentially increase your retirement income by\nThirty forty percent right and those aren't just idle statements and to make sure that if you are married there's going to be a continuation of being come to the surviving spouse to bridge that what we call the survivor income\nAnd attention like former last as long as you let them as long\nAs you live on and I'm going to speak of something income lasting to the next generation will get to that and just a couple of moments [laughter] I I just met with someone in their brought to mind what I haven't discussed in a while\nAnd it's one of the chapters in my book this

and security mean to you is it as we've been been discussing participating in stock market a link to games\nAnd not giving back locking in those games is that freedom from stock\nMarket losses is it not worrying about economic and geopolitical events and in some of those can can decimate assets almost overnight right\nWhat if you could not have to be concerned about that\nIs a peace of mind knowing that you will have never diminishing I used to say just lifetime income but we provide right never diminishing lifetime income and they've married to make sure it will continue to use the
