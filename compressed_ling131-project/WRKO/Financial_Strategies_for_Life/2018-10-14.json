now well who hundreds more call your favorite ease and all your favorite stations Paul free\nSo boy so Boston do you think about one hundred point seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd I've shown on previous programs um and discussed how we can actually increase people's income from the same assets\nBy forty percent maybe more yes I and that's not you know it might sound startling but we can do it and\nIt's at the interesting part about that is that forty percent increase in income is just it it's the most important part of it but it's just one of the features\nRight and we'll talk about this a little bit later but most advisors will say take no more used to be four percent will say take no more than three percent out and so you don't run the risk of running out of being come there's that were to get right well we can make sure that if you're a mid sixties and if you're let beyond that\nEven more income take out\nFive percent per year\nAnd will guarantee that you will not run out of the income that difference between three and five percent doesn't sound like a lot that's forty percent more income right so I don't care whether you have fifty thousand a hundred thousand two hundred thousand three hundred whatever it is\nFrom which are on which you are going to be relying for income\nFor most people still feel they have not saved enough understood than we can make the most of it and make sure that you can we can increase your income by forty percent of and\nAnd the the the fact of all that's um you know maybe not having saved enough well we'll make it worth as ... make it act as if it's more and\n[noise] pardon me are you worried about running out of money we can create guaranteed\nLifetime income never diminishing that you can never a live and you won't have to worry a any further oh and by the way it will continue if you're married till you're surviving spouse\nSo that eliminates the concern for what's going to happen when I'm not here\nBut that gets back to that I was talking about as your your assets that you normally have three percent you can take out in LA I dedicated to that income that's what they do that's right and do anything else but these programs can in addition to print presenting forty percent lower income\nCan serve other needs like survivor you know finding a survivor or perhaps legacy perhaps long term health over there is that it impacts\nYour eyes Lou or you know I'm kind of looking at it on a on a single dimensional basis and it's huge that forty percent increase in income is huge and very significant what it can mean but don't overlook the additional features oh which yeah which\nI ended up bringing forward on an individual basis difficult to touch upon everything on on the radio program and and\nAnd the the one of those three greatest concern is most people no longer covered by a pension plan well we can turn those retirement assets we've already touched upon it into a pension plan income guaranteed for the rest of your life\nIf you if you're working or have been working for a company with a dedicated pension plan and it's well funded you or you feel probably feel more secure and why would you go anywhere else\nRight they don't even if it in and I've I've been told of instances where people could have transferred to another position with more income and ... they didn't write the reason is they knew that they had were covered by a well funded pension plan and at the end of their work period\nThey would have a couple of decades and retirement and know that they'd have that retirement income and make salts and it's very significant\nBut I think people should realize at this point that if you're working for the government that's one thing if you're on the private sector pension not is rock solid as it was in the past\nAs we know yeah you know speaking of increasing income uh what about increasing your returns from your retirement assets without risk two principal having said that I Want to I I have a question for you Lou mhm unrehearsed\nWhat would you consider over the past two years a reasonable rate of return for someone\nBut let me add without putting principal or the assets had at risk yeah let me think about think about that and I'm just curious what your record ...\nSafe harbor strategies without risk or a yielding I mean it was a big deal and short term interest rates went up to three percent recently okay so let's let's go nuts and say four or five percent\nAlright and somehow more people would probably say well that's pretty respectable given our what what has been our lower interest trough over the past several years and one would say without risk the principal if I could get four\nFive percent I'll take it yeah\nWell I Know this is going to sound amazing and and when I say it I get ... and I'm I'm Serious some people can see it almost a little chills but the reality is that I have had accounts that are now not maturing but locking in over the past two years with our very unique\nStrategies and programs and I don't care whether there's thirty seven thousand in the account or three hundred and Seventy thousand more and more as there are in client accounts\nThat over the past two years have earned and locked in depending on the timeframe anywhere over the past two years without risk two principal twenty four to thirty of of all round it off twenty four thirty to forty percent\nAh yeah now when I Am I don't know what you're doing you know what is your yeah how ... how how have you done well I did that too is that locked in or does it just looked good because you just received your account statement and it showing significantly greater than where it was before\nThat's extremely impressive but let me ask you this question yes these types of programs in two thousand eight and two thousand nine when the market dropped forty percent how much are they lose zero yeah that's\nThe other benefit right I mean we could talk about this and have an entire workshop or seminar right but the point is today we now have these ... safe money safe harbor protected principles strategies where we need the market for growth\nThat's understood by virtually every one\nBut we can eliminate the risk in the volatility and the possibility of a loss or I should say the likelihood of loss and are in and and or in the interest or gains linked to the market with our special index strategies with many things to Dr Shiller one of the most brilliant economic mines\nIn the world quite frankly and thanks to him using it on a proprietary basis you just can go next door and say I want to I I this is what I Want to do with my money but the point is without going too far afield [noise]\nBeing able to prove\nAnd show that type of a real return with no risk the principal think about the impact if someone has a bit of time on their side Lou and hasn't saved up enough to date right that we can take that pile of money\nAnd put it into the special program the person can literally sleep well at night SWAT in just one if if you will a special sworn portfolio now by doing that\nWe don't know what's going to work or going forward share the likelihood is that there is going to be a market correction\nWhen that occurs whatever Weaver and we'll be locked in ... so to say gosh another in another two years can someone earned again another thirty thirty five forty percent don't know but those that have well habit locked in\nThe way you do now is they'll have the thirty thirty five percent they just gained\n... absolutely and regardless of what happens going forward there some special income enhancements income account enhancements what that meant by simply without going into a lot of detail you can guarantee that even if the market doesn't perform\nYou're still getting growth for income purposes and we can turn that account at some point either immediately or at some point in the future into a guaranteed never diminishing possibly increasing lifetime income\nSo what if someone were going through their financial sites they're managing their assets right and they came across the bond that would pay you ... percent a year and after a certain period of time would yield\nA five percent annual dividend okay for the rest of your life no matter how long you live\nI think most people would probably say that sounds pretty good\nYeah no risk of lost like they're going to be years when you're going to make double digits in interest and then at a certain point you start taking out five percent a year as a as an income dividends for the rest of your life no matter how long you live\nThat's pretty interested in that I think the I I think there'd be a a smattering of interest perhaps the ... yeah that's ... essentially you're right in fact to allow people to dwell on that I think it's time to let people know how they can reach us if there are of interest\nAstounding as an option and to be disgusted individually we can enhance that account by twelve percent overnight\nYou know so a hundred thousand is transferred in a welcoming gay it is now worth a hundred and twelve thousand and that amount is there for the growth and the man by the way or step for what happens if everything seems okay and I die well it all goes to your beneficiary\nI mean it it there's so much here Lou that that we could discuss the points I Want to make is people need to as we discussed\nMake most have been saved enough most concerned and worried about running out of money and most are not covered by a pension plan and want to in their minds say I wish I could make sure that I have a pension plan from at least whatever I've set aside right and I think over the past\nClose to thirty minutes we've talked about how we can\nEliminate those fears that we can make the most of what someone has that we can give them market market returns\nWithout ... without the risk and the and the likelihood of a loss at some point it's going to be guaranteed\nDecided to get close to retirement and you want to reduce risk that you're caught in a bind because you don't want to give up your position in the market and you don't want to give up the gains this ... we're talking about\nA ... and you and your wrists the gains of the market without risk and whether you're looking at six months to retirement more immediately or whether you're looking at six years these strategies will work\n... if you need income now we can create that\nBut if there was a bit of time on your side all the better because that's going to allow for you to get older a larger percentage of income you can take out and the potential of greater growth\nLou how are we looking on timeframe side of the rap for the first segment

better than it would but this is a period of time with people or off the beaches\nAnd a lot of people are off the beaches of their some of ... and who are regular scheduling activities right back kids back in school and as a little bit of a break here before we start thinking about the holidays it's a really good time to start thinking about your [noise]\nYour ... your assets your retirement plan your your big financial picture is this is a really good window of opportunity to do\nWell interesting that you brought that forward because it falls right into what I wanted to\nDiscuss for this first half of the second half of the program but let me get back to and reflect on the first half\nI I think we covered I feel we covered quite a bit\nIn that first half of the program ... talking about the major concerns that people have whether they are in or approaching retirement whatever the timeframe may be\nSix months to three years to ten years to retirement in fact speaking of ten years what if you have a ten year timeframe and you don't feel you saved enough\nI'm ... and you want to try to continue saving more what if and I never say what if unless we can and I think people know that now what if we could take whatever the value of that retirement ass it is and for future income purposes absolutely positively guarantee\nThat we can double the value of that asset double or grade or had a minimum you know at a minimum in ten years mhm\nSo if you've saved managed to save a hundred thousand and and you can save any more but that's not enough on which to retire but you've got a ten year window you can you know and if it's just eight years it's going to be eighty percent doubled not doubled but\nUh eighty percent of that goal but to state whatever the amount as we can absolutely double that value\nIn a ten year timeframe from which to take an income that you can never outlive that's pretty dramatic I think\nLet's let's do let's say the quick math on next to this one is always fun I was like us when I ... and this type of program the traditional thing over ten years if he gained like yeah let's let's\nYeah the eight percent ... ... what do you want to get five six seven eight I was going to save five percent ... percent of simplicity at the end of ten years it's worth a hundred and fifty thousand died in that simple interest but keep it simple round or if it's worth a hundred and fifty three percent is forty\nFive hundred dollars a year in income that's right right that's right under this program a hundred thousand dollars in ten years it's worth two hundred thousand dollars for income purposes you can take five percent out that's ten thousand dollars\nI think that's a that's about doubling the income more for its I ordered to ten thousand\nYou know again it it and I talked about increasing income by forty percent and here we are increasing it by over fifty percent white or am I right no higher gives me a hundred percent a hundred or more than a hundred percent right in\nThe data in print out a matter of ram is forty five hundred dollars in income a year or ten thousand dollars and then coming here by the way contractually guaranteed with absolutely no risk of last we're talking about you that a hundred thousand being a hundred and fifty in ten years it could just as easily be eighty\nThey could be blind because where are you going to replace it and by the way if you said I don't want to put it at risk okay you'd be hard pressed to get a five percent return right and you're likely would be taxed on that as well right but anyway taking all of those issues out the point is\nWe have the programs\nAnd and they work\nAnd which one we use depends upon your timeframe your health your goals\nYour objective is this is the same asset and we're talking about a difference in income from forty five hundred dollars a year to ten thousand you know that is pretty dramatic as simple as that example is that we like it and you're right you're right and I know optional you could do it with fifty thousand dollars you can do twenty it's with three hundred\nThat you're right it's all proportionate speaking of that down a speaking of that I Want to talk a little bit about spending down retirement funds which fold right into this little\nYou know this is an address to each of you out there you're one of the lucky ones well maybe luck isn't the right term and it really took a lot of hard work to get to to the point where you think where you can think about spending down your retirement nest egg\nOh and by the way are we haven't talked about this for a while\nA go climbing a mountain let's assume you're on a mountain climber right there's difficulty going up the mountain love this city yeah I Know you do have bought the greatest ... even though there are difficulties in danger of climbing up the mountain most deaths occur when you're attempting to\nDo send the mountains right when you're climbing down the mountain so think about that\nTheir retirement plan analogy is here so much about retirement planning is based on accumulation which is obviously important that's right but that's everybody ... focus
