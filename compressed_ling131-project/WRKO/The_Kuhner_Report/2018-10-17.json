know uh sooner wasn't with the Astros at the beginning of the year lightning he was a Toronto blue Jay he has a very bad domestic assault situation going on and\nWhile he's a flame thrower he's got a temper apparently allegedly and whatever the blue jays trade um Houston Houston not happy at all the ...\nThe city doesn't want him right air\nBerlin they're publicly states this was a huge mistake I don't want to him on this team this is not good for the team that we have and I'll do the best I can deal with it but we don't love him\nHe gets brewed roundly when they introduced him the first time in Houston so they're ... years on the mound last night we need you to step up and hold the Ford\nAnd the crowd tries multiple times like you can tell he's hitting the guy on an oath to pitch like you can tell he doesn't quite have it right but they are going to try and cheer for this guy that they never wanted than the first place but they need him now\nWhile we got our guy who's never really delivered even though we go in London so much bang yeah and ... everything leaves you write down there\nThey're done and I I mean if you heard everyone you know it was a knockout punch in the game but if ever there is a moment that outside of boxing that describes what a knockout punch right that kicked Houston in the gut for a number of reasons and\nFor us it was like oh my God we get to carry the guy around on her shoulders that we've been you know that's really trying to put up on our shoulders lover a couple of years now and he hasn't done it\nWell to that you know that whole deal with say get hit with a pitch that was pretty wild huh goes back into the dugout says they hit me\nAnd then I have to go back and watch that everybody knows what they did but I didn't get to see that 'cause I was there was literally you ... what I\nLike I told you forever make me commissioner of the league in Barnes says it Barnes comes in and watched the first guy like any really watch the guy dining I'm finding your but if you had a guy to he hits him on the sports which is always a bad sign but like your girl bender and ...\nBut the next guy up a ... a night forget a Marlene Marlene he's got them old too when he hit some in the show in the elbow but upper body\nThat's when you're not to because that's a straight basketball just show up and end up pushing back so then you throw the outside corner and ... what's supposed to happen there and he probably would've yeah he had some\nBack to back guys to lead to the granny I'm telling you for Houston you just you don't even want to talk about\nIt yeah of course you do to look back and say well we should have and of course at that moment choice after I had sat guy after he gets more land and get right then is when you say why why didn't they pull him\nBecause he's the guy but he's you know an idea right here yeah he threw the one I go to is like almost like a perfect pitch who's getting mad nevermind Mormon who hasn't been swinging a battle steps up in there\nBut then he had some and then Jackie hits them even that's where he's you know you don't pull them because\nI ... jacking right absolutely yep well he's your guy on the war in a lot of learning track on wanting to go in\nAnd then on top of it all the Astros maybe we gotta Spygate where the\nHeck is going on there now is there I haven't seen is there a video that guy\nThey're leaning oh you're going to resolve it yeah it is I mean he's standing right there like this in Cleveland and he's got the phone up and then they move because he doesn't have credentials to be there but it's right up their dog yeah\nAnd they said that they removed them in ... here in game on which we lost right and he's so that lead taking pictures with a doctor and then he's texting furiously so the question it's like Spygate areas like ... yeah do they have the can they get the phone and if they can get the phone what are those\nThat well yeah what what is it that easy to what is it getting from\nThat when the guy goes to his knows they're going to have a pitch out already yeah last time I got that right sales fast ball is O'Hare one finger down to patch to decide something like they have it out the cold and so in theory\nThis was a rumor in New York too that the Sox new to this the Yankees signals yeah they were ... they were shipping their pitches but

I'm sure we're going to\nHave been said the word yet for thirty five minutes but yes we'll talk about horse race why a lot of noise but then there are real things right and so this is a pretty big test for the president and I by the way I don't know what the right answer here is no one\nKnows what how do you handle this and what do you do and what should happen and this is very complicated one thing that does seem to be clear consistently is if they're if the president either has done business or sees a business opportunity with somebody\nGenerally like to give them the benefit of the doubt so in this case Saudi Arabia may have just absolutely bludgeoned in Texas Chainsaw as a journalist who by the way it works for an American company and yeah you know what though\nThis feels a lot like guilty until proven innocent he says meanwhile if it was a Latin American country nah will be cutting funding than anyone Simon yeah if you use to the border like\nIt's a it it's just you just know\nHow ... how and why\nHe's handling this the way he's handling it what do you like that or not but that's when you say you know we need a businessman and White House will businessmen think like businessmen right ac business opportunities first and we do an awful lot of business with them so we're not going to we're not going to mess with that\nRight yeah and when you say business now I mean the Trump Organization certainly does a lot of business although the president last night tried to separate himself from any kind of business dealings with his um personal uh companies he said I don't have any kind of financial stake in\nSaudi Arabia but I I'm not I'm not sure that's fully true as well but let's\nSlip separate this the U.S has a lot of business dealings with Saudi Arabia so we as a country have ... ... it's much more it's much more complicated for us as a country not just the Trump Organization\nI'm president said that right off the bat he said that it in the sixty minutes interview look we've got this deal with them and he he walked through a list of companies that would be effective obviously um military uh\nCompanies and that the bill military equipment Boeing being one of them and ... and you know these companies they've got a huge deal with them and we can't just cut that thing out and we can't just sanction\nThem where that goes away because they'll go elsewhere so Howard a is I'm In Boston this morning morning\nOr good morning Kevin baby a everything you said is true because in the end the president's going to make sure that uh this thing is er swept under the rug there's just too much of money involved or what I read last night a knock knock the deliver the point but uh I Believe what the\nTurkish government said a ... body was cut up all live with a bone saw and then make disposed of what the aspect that that's what a what I read last night and that was a pretty reliable source\nAnd of course the Saudi Government at the most to benefit or by his his death actually\nA ... so that's that's the gruesome details right up to Fifteen a member of touch squad or there was a forensic expert and had a bone saw and they they are and the Saudis of costs of vicious ... and they're ... so they cut his body up alive yeah oh okay so that's pretty barbaric\nBut that's the top of the costs for them\nAnd then like I say they use apps and to uh get rid of his body\nSo desserts and I am the Turks are also saying that if you go in there there's a big portion of that\nHas been re painted in the last week\nThat it is there's issues in the woods you know be if you believe all of that and that this isn't there first rodeo and all that it is amazing how\n\nIf ever there was the wrong term but I don't know what else term to use it how unprofessional they handled this whole ... you mean to just go in and said we know the cleaners going yeah have pictures of them coming out with these two huge bags the Turks walk right in and say this looks repainted ... this looks right under this pain but yeah\nIt's it's really\nWell I think it's it's it's an ... well ... ... talk about small there's a camera outside just thing we see the guy walk any never walks out there there's there's a death squad that sent in there and there's records of them flying in and out of the country he said\nThey will I I don't know enough about this story and when this story first came I wasn't as interested in it I Know that the show he was very critical of the crown prince but what was there anything but like\nAre three course dinner event one could a discussion focused on taxing retirement strategies\nFor high net worth investors knowing some of your most critical risk factors in retirement is important\nAnd knowing how to dress improperly

W arcane go [noise]\n\nWants to have been too thick thick sixty eight sixty eight that either number we're talking about Saudi Arabia bruises in ... good morning you're W workout\nLorna guys yeah it is getting chillier ... but\nIt's just really cold um it's it's no no big thing for um Muslims to kill journalists especially ones that that guy probably found out that Saudi Arabia was responsible for the straight nine eleven\nOr something along those lines something really nasty and he did yeah\nI don't think they're going to give anybody up I don't think we'll go and get anybody but somebody I mean these people are ruthless we know that\nUm that's really what what do we really can't do\nIt casually jak\nThat's that's sort of the way I see it to burst I don't know what we could do\nI Want something guy I Want I don't like these people I ever did\nI have Muslim friends but the Saudis there we should or should bombed them and knocked on a man to Iraq or Iran have ... or Afghanistan was she had gone into Saudi Arabia I hate those people\nWell or that there's a couple of things here one is the guy's been number two guy in the ... he's going to be the leader of Saudi Arabia at some point if the Turks can definitively show you that he ordered him execution over a journalist\n[laughter]\nThis isn't just a U.S problem that's the world like what did you what are you going to do that Saudi Arabia leads the region and he's the number two guy also you know we can get as conspiratorial on this one would it feels like to me is that the guys only been the number two guy for like a year or a little over a year\nShe seemed like a ... what ... what did with the Kagan come and some people go to develop some thicker skins I think that this guy\nEasily just one of these young guys that doesn't like being told what for doesn't like to somebody else's snooping around and he decides to flex its muscles that he doesn't understand quite yet how things play out in what the ramifications are because he's number two guy so what do I care but\nNow he's finding out quickly that this was a little bit much\nYeah well that that may very well be true but the other problem that might exist here\nIs that this number two guy is has also painted himself has some kind of reformist is as a guy who's\nGoing to bring in Saudi Arabia into the twenty first century and I'm not so sure that he didn't get too close to the media member which again is also learning the ropes and said things and then suddenly whoa oh we got a problem\nBecause you just divulge that\nAnd this guy knew this stuff and this is a man again this reporter by all accounts I mean none of us knew who he was\nThose two and a half weeks ago let's face it but the fact of the matter is\nHe he had been reporting on Saudi Arabia for years he had been involved with the the royal family for years he had been a trusted confidant or you know when it came to journalism and somehow some way he suddenly knew too much\nSo you know I don't know if the the crown prince just went too far I thought he was you know he thinks\nHe's changing the world one step at a time but really doesn't want to or suddenly his\nDad said no you're not gonna do that and this guy paid the ultimate price\nIn the smoke and fire type thing comes to play here where the the Turkish investigators immediately mentioned fourteen guys eleven of them are intimately yeah and it didn't do very he's got his guys and he told his because hey going in there on this day\nTo get a wedding certificate or wedding ... pay whatever papers at our 'cause he's marrying a woman from turkey and they need to get something from the ... he's\nGoing in there yes what fellows he's not coming out of there and then we we've all seen these movies yeah close the door and they close the door and they said this is how it's going to go and this was going to happen and they probably at some point or presumably I don't know but\nWhoever takes the lead on this thing tells the prince to get out of here because the less you know the better but everybody knows full well what the princes telling them that certainly this well the prince leads scenario in\nThis race wasn't there at the at the council was there no I Know the ambassador essentially\nWhat I'm Talking about when ... when the plan is put in oh yeah oh yeah right right right not literally the ex Russian\nRight in that case yeah and they told him to get out to\nI don't whether he knew or whatever his role as a I don't know but at some point\nThe word comes from the ... that look this is what's going to have to happen here because I've had enough of this guy in theory this would be one scenario another scenario that was real killers who somehow knew this guy was going to the Turkish embassy and for some where he can just thought that he was too close to that a\nFamily just through this to impress but\nAnyway at some point you know you\nLook he wants to done this is where the guy is going to be this makes the most fans and by the way nobody tells him anything because he doesn't need to know anything about this 'cause he might be shaken the secretary's day from United States has and British or Mike\nRight well and I I think they were wearing a lobby about it well this is where they went wrong\nWhere they went wrong with the video they the camera outside I think they thought that was the perfect place because no one would even know he was coming there but what I think the interesting is that how did they know this coming year\nI got to say that it's it has something to do with the ah the consul general right now is back in Saudi Arabia who had fled the country\nAre just as they knew this guy's whereabouts for the last several weeks like that but they've been watching the guy and they they have a pretty good idea where he's going to be in one who's going to be and they determined that this was the easiest clean of some quickest way to do this and they made a major miscalculation it\nWhat happens in the movies is that this thing crumbles quickly and there are ads that role luck\nI gave you an assignment you didn't get it done properly and you're going to now pay the consequences but no one thinks that he or do they\nWell I Would be very surprised I mean you were saying somebody's going to have to go down I ... ... is it going to be the royal prince his bodyguard I don't think so I don't think that the the\nSome of it's going to be All right over here and I'll write somebody does love you better figure that out then because boy ... what are we on that you want to be on the net next to death squad [laughter]\n'cause then you're the guy you're your budget director of a choice I don't know if we go over this right I think if there's one group of people that know that if you screw your job up you get killed it would be the death squad\nGas for the past what maybe well maybe they did screw their good job of it maybe they didn't they just sorry I forgot to tell ya\nOkay I also feel like if there's anyone who knows that sometimes people die that probably don't deserve to die it's also the ... well that's for sure [laughter] that is for sure let's not feel too bad for the ... you're right\nYou're right I don't feel bad for anybody [noise] what a story of starting a it's six fifty eight here on W.

investigation the announcements will reportedly focus on the to keep playing to the investigation whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia and whether Trump himself took any actions that

three episodes which were fairly liberal leaning any way probably will continue watching it well the whole idea\nThat that that show was an incredibly right leaning show I I mean I watch the entire season I didn't think that was\nTrue although I don't have that first episode ... only one rally enemy sort of\nEnergy usually they would have some you know discussion but it was ... it was certainly not leaning out in the last man standing is more way more overt about their politics\nYeah which also is\nPretty good the season like I'm enjoying that are you I I haven't been watching it and yeah I

I I Can't see any upside to this I literally think it is\nWhat Jim said and also she's not a gracious winter in any way shape or ... and he got a mild this was a kind of tweak that's going to come back to haunt you generally write this\nThis isn't the case this was a small attachment to the chase that got thrown out K still does All right that's the Texas thing that he's talking about\nAnd this is kind of like Aaron Judge plan your New York after one one like can't you see a scenario where I've been ... reading this and just with a smile or ... something down the road why\nWell and you know regardless of the ... even the lawsuit it's just\n... people people don't love and women don't love Stormy Daniels don't get me wrong and women don't love her they don't think that you know they think she sort of fitness off and this is her issue\nBut the president is known to say these kinds of things in judge women based on their looks and knows that she doesn't look like a horse face number one that's just it's just it's like being on the playground and beans second grade and when you do get your way you to shell out horse face\nAnd I mean it's just silly it's just it's it's just a terrible\nYou'll tell me I'm reading too much into it but I'm not this that one line tells you everything you need to know about him and how he values people\nWomen are objects she's a horse race men are business success or not he's a two bit lawyer right he doesn't it'd be wondering if he said horse face and donkey balls or something I went to some sort of right to knock on him I don't know whatever would be\nHe never goes to the physical with the guy he always goes to the size of his wallet or the amount of ratings or in ... so he did it here where is worse she's a horse race and he's a tuba lawyer now and whenever you think of the validity of those two statements\nThat's how he views women and that's how he abused men end\nYou know what I can tell you this right now I Do believe this you know the president may or may not have been thinking that way that's just how these things and you can you can look\nTime and time again and his ... you know people love to say oh he attacks everybody you're right he does the attacks them in two different ways and go through you know and go through it and look at it and you'll see Ted Cruz's wife was unattractive Ted Cruz was a liar\nYeah I Believe\nThe only you know I mean we look see hit and the Republican primary was Carly Fiorina\nCorrect It's it's it's it's just time and time again so my point my point is just\nYou know he knows it's been pointed out time and time again but he can't help himself he just keeps doing it and you just said yesterday that was a rally cry for every woman who heard that they were like you know it just infuriates them should be a good thing\nA summons him for the same people complaining over Trump's remarks will be silent over TIs video uh what's your take on that is what's happening some for [noise]\n\nI I assume you mean to say that what she I did with the fake malaria and ... video was outrageous right so are you\nGoing to do than in admitting that what Trump said was outrageous or are you not where wherever you want to look to see our video\n\nThe ... video bothers me a lot less than for example this new video where snowball actually puts a gun door clowns and wearing a mask and been fake pulled the trigger this is you can argue this is a dire you could argue would make some sort of show ... social statement on whenever there's a different area rapper and a video and the president\nI Am and where we can do that all day every day you can act like there isn't a time there is and this is a guy that had everything going great\nAnd he decides to throw this Molotov cocktail right into an otherwise joyous party for him things were going great I would've expected this the day after Kavanaugh was defeated\nThat's when normal people do really stupid things because they're in the heat of the moment they're just I got to give somebody some crap and then you do something that you regret he does it at the height of things are going good\nYou does it all the time it's so weird\nOne one one thing I Will say and I'll give our texture this this when it comes to the TI video [noise]\nTheir hearts lady didn't ask for that first lady in asking I mean she as she was wearing a jacket she not asking to be you know ... put into these videos and she's not asking to be a portrayed in such a way so I'm going to give you that that's disrespectful but you know this is a world in which we live\nIn Stormy Daniels has put herself out there I mean you know she slept with the president and she took money for it and she and her attorney are loud and whatever\nSo directing something negative way toward Stormy Daniels look they're tit for tat here they're going at each other this is this is the game that they've all decided they're going to get into the three of them\nBut I'm just talking about in general the presidents\nLike what you said the president sees women immediately and attacks them for their looks or what he thinks about their looks or comments on their looks and he he these men completely differently\nReaction right of course what what do you think Sarah thought yesterday thank God I don't ever press [laughter] thank God what do you think Kelly and thought I'm not for for Fox that is a good ... nobody wants any part of it is [noise]\nMillennia she just was on friday night saying cyber bullying is something that I take very personally by the way I Do tell him periodically to not do certain things and then what is it four days later five days later\nHe gives the most egregious example of what it is that she's talking about that he's not listening to he said he saw that interview he said she did great he clearly didn't hear any of it and he does the exact thing that's her number one cause\nAnd Roma he sometimes she just remind you that and he wants to remind you that I shouldn't be that guy just so we're all clear don't think\n\nI the benefit of the doubt guy in me wants to say that he does does specifically to keep you off balance but I don't think it's that clever and all I think it's his nature to be this kind of guy be I think he is now getting to the ... he sort of showed you this on sixty minutes where he's pretty comfortable in the\nGay Oh absolutely well he yeah he's he is a well\nDid this bill weld for two years was the best governors commonwealth Iraq and then do wild got really comfortable\nThere and he actually got bored and he started writing books and he started reading books on the job but he started playing squash on the job\nWhen Trump gets to a certain level of comfortable with this for this comfortable ... with this he I think opens himself up to doing stuff like this is really a problem\nI think that's true I think it's clever yeah he was the but the bottom line is he that's why every time things are going well he messes it up because he gets very comfortable it gets very cocky and then he does things like this\nAnd you know he goes after and a lot of our tax dollars are riding a sin and uh he he throws these kinds of insults because he goes for the drug dealer and that is for women there looks are or that\nThat that's why he does that answer to he's feeling really good about himself and then that law suits gets dropped in that portion of it anyway and you feel good about it and he gets cocky and he throws that out there\nBut it but within this one alone like why did he write horse race was it\nA\nHe doesn't like her and he just want to do in Salter is it be look\nHe's having trouble with is Saudi Arabia thing and we're like to distract people from a little bit and the best way you do that is you make some outrageous personal attack on someone you don't care about\nWhat is it see\nI like to remind people every now and again I can be a ... because it keeps them off balance was it ... D all of the above like what do you use the motivation\n... I think he didn't like her because he doesn't like what she has exposed he has caused her a lot of headache at home in the public guy in a lot of places I don't think he likes her I don't think he likes to have an ID and\nThe reason and it is you get actually being treated as soon as he did it because she said she said he has a little dinky mhm and he can't\nGet over that and he just he did this just in theory this whole thing infuriated him and Everytime he thinks he's won something related to hurry wants to remind her how much she didn't like her and he doesn't like ...\n... as they call them again or at least he rarely as a ... has trouble with his name\nWe've got a numerous helicopters flying over the city is something going on I that's there's one in the distance there and then when that just flew over building right here\n\nYou're on TALK in the city and you know something going on and give us a call\nSix and seven to ... take\nMy answer to my question is all of the above I think he thinks he's being really clever year and he he will explain this to people like I needed them to not talk about ... whatever the question what that is what is the X Y or Z because if it was Saudi Arabia you don't wag the dog but then go out and talk about that thing that you don't want people to pay attention to what she was doing\n\nIt would be so much easier if he did this even was it friday where we've been down Thirteen hundred points and he was picked\nUp the market was correcting quote unquote\nAnd so he lashes out against somebody like that you could explain doesn't make it right but you could explain it like I think it's kind of a better yesterday\nThe Pocahontas thing is sort of falling apart on her and is not going well for I Would argue and he has every reason to think that the Washington Post has a thing today saying she's she's basically doomed her own chances by doing what she did and whether that's true and I will see but he's read that he's got every reason to feel good about this why\nDo this well he had a great day yesterday in the market was way up and which owns personal barometer as college presidents he is going that's how he sees it Scott he's in wait a minute Hey Scott morning\nWhat's up guys two quick points that people don't realize is she's about Trump I feel like a beating a dead horse here this is why he was elected he is not a politician he's a real man so he's a person we have a ... by the way by the way\nShe is one hundred percent a two term president so called or horse face or they could recall the people who want to over analyze it and go that's not presidential\nFU you're an idiot you would you rather a fraud and why does that the politician in a just a does everything to his constituency second of all\nOn hold on do you want to leave it doesn't do that what'd you do you think Trump doesn't do things for his constituency\nOut on the level that other politicians do\nOkay well they really have been a resident when they admit that he only cares about his base and no one else in the country matter\nStudy did he did something for his constituency like you yesterday when he when he tweeted out horse space\nHe's doing it for Saudi Arabia writer now right do do do that if there are are they the bushes or Obama whatever\nDenial or not and I I don't remember and I don't think Jim wood and quite frankly on\nMe to the wrong why because why would he do it what's the point because\nShe doesn't care he's a public servant really not a politician\nAnd be happy that he doesn't care and yes there is a lot of truth to the ... coup is just very kind of wild hair doesn't mean they get a pass on everything right you don't have the\n... the President Trump I'm not joking when I say that some stones serious she is right on line to go down as one of the best president from this country's history\nYes Yvette twenty five percent of the country believes that and what does that have to do with him what I mean I think Jim that he's a joke\nWhy why is he a joke I'm going to call you or why is he a joke\nI mean I was like yesterday for the black guy and he's in a Twitter war with a porn star over the size of his penis and motor vehicle that how about how how about how what you just asked why people think he's a joke that's exactly why Scott\nJim what\nThey are on the air sponsored may ask you what\nLet me ask you two questions why as President Trump done or not done that you vehemently disagree with them in the past two years\nIn the ... impact twenty four hours I could name multiple things one uh he provided cover for Saudi Arabia without actually knowing what's going on\nWithout actually know what's going on that's a little that's a little vague no\nHouse gym you're you're I like like you know I Do\nBut you got to buy things I just did he attacked oh he attacked a woman for her looks because he's angry that she said he had a small penis out is\nComical\nWhat what what about those kinds of last year president doing that you can't well I disagree with the other may maybe president attacking private citizens in this case yeah ... I think\nYou're using a word they're\nAttacking\nYou okay you want your president commenting on the physical appearance of\nPrimary care of the economy is through the roof unemployment's down you were asked somebody you don't care because the economy's through the small peanut that's like saying if you get mad at Trump because he criticized the pizza joint in Washington\nDid you say this or did you cities with stormy\nSaid they plug Scott that's a good try if not as a bad drive but you don't have to defend everything you don't and not everything is great he may talk from the hip and you love that about a break sometimes when people do that they do stupid stuff this was clearly wants\nTo be nice to have you weren't\nThe voice of Boston New York about one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA eight feet to Boston and heart radio station [noise]\nVW are kale new secretary of state Mike Pompeo is in in Colorado where he and Turkish president aired on met today to discuss the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal ...

A. it's got to address this we there\nAre schools in the D. one category that are\n[laughter] they did that heads are turned 'em\nAbout who's playing in and how old they are and where they live or how they started living there you know there there are programs that are very strong\nAnd it been known to be and kids like to play for those programs because they get attention for collegiate purposes my saying that his diplomatically and possible mhm\nUm and I think everybody in ... who's been involved in sports in this state knows that so every eight under any circumstances would be frightening for a whole lot of schools\nIn in one of the issues that football in general has been especially in a bicycle number which is that the gap is widening now where because you don't have their participation that you used to in because parents are going luck I'd\nRather just have Johnny plays soccer run track or do something different because he's not going to have had issues for the rest of his life ... this is not unique I don't yes it's unique in it it's I've never heard of this happening but this is going to happen more and\nMore I agree where what are we doing that\nWe all know who the factories are and why are we planned in fact I don't care what traditions and it's like why are we doing this because kids kids can get\nHurt he messed up when we go to John he's in mold and hey John good morning\n[noise]\nYou don't want to go Jon go ahead well for one talked to the show John you got to buy to\nHold on John ... are you are you sitting still you got a bad connection\n[noise] [noise] hello yeah can you hear me okay now yeah I hear you better go ahead\nOkay I I just think that um two coaches for me\nEither side should it talks about about it in the army first when the ... are they going to play the freshmen straight through\nThat's crazy that's how I Know that they're going to win right they can run the risk of this very we're playing football or not and if we're playing were bringing our team and we are at least going to put up forty before we think about calling the death penalty either\nYou know nothing up and maybe I I I work for a school right now and they're in the last call and they\nSome some of the school is the veto by forty points [noise] so it is it you know I still say sugar and played a despite you know how many people are you know you know who are freshmen they should have been like more first went on each side plane instead of just\nOne of the Asian is I think you know ever doesn't play a lot of their freshman on their varsity team because they've got a JV team that they play most their freshman I don't know why I'm old and he's having a hard time fielding a mom's been like\nThat for quite a while um you know it's just it's just it's just like schools school system I don't know where it's going yeah you know I don't know what they're trying to do whatever but um those are the things in the past that you know ... a great at school but it just you know now it's like it's like ... you know it just\nMarcus coming soon to a theater near you it's one of those phrases I like to use but this is [noise] this is\nThe new normal you know what I was starting to what's the deal with take this away from our young are gentleman wow look you can walk away from anybody now I'm going to be\nWas going to have three ... and his game my career stats and my seasons that and all that not a big win and we get to celebrate with our parents over our big win over mall then\nThat more than ever games thing I mean ever going to get plenty of opportunities to do that\nI went to animals in college and Hamilton union big rivals but at some point I when I was there halfway through my term\nUnion decided that they wanted to go big athletically is was mostly hockey but it was also football\nAnd they started mall I'm Hamilton and at some point you say guess what it's time for new rival were not Hamilton is not going to go there with you union and if you're going to go there\nWe're going to be in different leagues and in different categories anymore and eventually we're not playing union anymore because you want to be is an athletic school and we want to be a real nice ... school and those are two different things and you can't\nStop so the big tradition was oh we played helping and union of played forever and football whenever but now we're not\nAnd guess what its okay what I was talking to a buddy of mine who has kids that play high school football right now and he said look\nFive years or ten years and I agree with them a hundred percent of five or ten years from now you're going to have half the amount of football teams that you have an\nPrograms are going to emerge you're going to have much smaller numbers you're going to have a lot fewer conferences and or divisions mhm because they're just you don't have the years I've been seeing this it's been slow but now is gaining steam the snowballs moving down the hill and it's become more ... more rapid rate\nThe big issues of just the money you're going to have really no one in ... a money maker forget in high school you'll have an average in Brockton but who's playing them is going to be a bright mold and I said like where I live you're gonna have have almost ... Georgetown or whatever whatever those merge\nEvery smaller town around you is going to yeah they're all going to come and it's not going to be a\nRegional high school it's going to be a regional sports program it's the only way and that's the only way that ever it's going to survive too because there isn't there isn't enough of\nTeams that actually want to play over it because you're getting killed yeah uh by the way Hamilton as we can for you you got ... not much of a shock but Asia nervous shot mhm Hamptons we can but you're going out there oh yeah oh are you going to I'm often are you going to Colby Colby\nDirect you would have enjoyed that trip although I made a ... year I've been I've been Hamilton beautiful\nI won't be making that trip but I'll I'll root for the cardinals and I won't give you my ... right now but uh\nOh dead commit [laughter] Maria is in Boston Good morning Maria\nGuys I'm a I Am in the whole football thing but it's you know sports in general my son played basketball\nAnd some of the kids on the other teams are bigger than him and you know he got shoved around but my daughter also figure skate it from the time she was from three to ...\nAnd people don't think the figure skating as a sport she you know there's no helmets is no pads and she had concussion ... concussion\nBut because people don't think that as a sport\nThey think you know all you know they can jump higher and they catch him or and then there's never any talk about it\nAnd now she is she's twenty six and her her needs a shot she if she bangs or had she's out of work for you know two weeks right because she's had so many concussions but my point is\nIf she loved it\nAnd she was pushed by her coaches and lie to me that's what made her what she is today\nAnd I I\nAt some point we have to say you know yeah you know I came to you know they're going to get hurt but what are you know what are we supposed to do just the end sports altogether\nRight I'd look there's risks with everything in there is an easy way to not get hurt don't play sports but if you want to some of us we value when it's on video gamers again I don't get in a day at a younger age now they do have a more helmets and whatever\nThere there should be mandatory headgear for this stuff I don't understand it what's the ... we have to see her faith as she skates across the ice because why\nBut whatever fine if you're going to still do that there's plenty of benefit to it and yes it's like skin anybody think scans a good idea for your legs\nOver time you're gonna have some injuries there that's just the nature of that sport but there's enough reward to it the Joel roll the dice and you'll live with it and you'll deal with it football for a lot of people is just\nIt's it's gone past that point of no return and we're just like the ... the rewards aren't possibly worth the risk and in ... case this is it they played the game last year\nWhich is when I we can't do it now you you gonna kill us You're going to kill our kids and it's just not worth it we'd rather forfeit and have the shame of forgetting a game then then have Seventeen kids come off on stretchers and suffer potentially permanent injury\nWell again I stick by the fact that part of the problem here is that there's not enough policing of these leagues I mean honestly mold and would not have cancelled if they weren't up playing the likes of effort\nI don't think they they haven't I haven't no ... point and they're gonna play again next week\nThey would not be canceling they're not it's not that they're trying to be snowflakes they just recognize that their program is not in the same league\nUm as them all as the effort program and they're very few that are in a ... the superintendent has made the decision that he's going to protect these kids\nI don't think it's because he's trying to be some kind of a porous border we try to bubble wrap anybody I don't think it's any of that there's just such an there's such a difference between the two programs that it's just not you know you just don't do it\nThere's a reason why there is a phrase you're a victim of your own success sometimes which is that at some point so there are these times when you get too good at something yeah no this has been in boxing where I live like there were I remember Tyson before about Saddam was finally did it but\nThen they're not a lot of people that want to get in that room because you can kill somebody and you're just not good at this sort of thing and\nAnd this shouldn't be the case by the way if you're if you are in a a a you know division three\nA high school a division and your your opponents are designated as such you should all be in about the same place there's going to be years at some are going to be better some are going to be worse you're going to have coaching staff that are going to be better and some are going to be worse\nYou shouldn't have this discrepancy there's a reason there is a discrepancy when it comes to average\nAnd almost every other team they play short of the area and there's a few of them the very end I Would argue that\nThose ... and you know those will but what's the difference there what's in their private run right\nAnd and ever it is not and so that's that's not right and so I I\n... I don't blame us you can play by the same rules replay why are we so good we do we work we dream where you have a culture here they're saying all these things and yes that's probably true and so now we got to eat it because you guys sock one yes you do in this case because you're going to kill them you're gonna kill them and I know you're going to kill them you do have to\nEat it you've you've essentially by beefing up your ears are programmed away you have um and I'm not talking about and I'm not talking about lifting weights and having good coaches I'm Talking about leaving it up in other ways that probably are not following the rules as closely as they should I think that yeah you put\nYourself in a different while you're ... or charge here that I'm I'm I'm just saying they have really good program I Know people and their ... and that way there's no doubt about that that's what you should say [noise]\nIt's a fifty eight O W our jail\nThe voice of Boston New York or Boston one hundred point seven deadly UCLA HD to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise]\nMorning on NATO VW are KO news Bloomberg is reporting that special counsel Robert Mueller is ready to deliver the key findings up his investigation into Russian interference in the twenties sixteen election like our reports\nTo unnamed U.S officials said Mohler we'll divulge what he's\nFound shortly after the November midterm elections as he faces growing pressure to produce more indictments or shut down his investigation the announcements will reportedly focus on the two key planes in the investigation whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia and whether Trump himself took\nAny actions that constitute obstruction of justice Mueller's findings won't necessarily be made public if he doesn't secure unsealed indictments and you can present his findings only to his boss deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein\nEven the closest the President Trump's allies are not supporting his tweet calling adult film star Stormy Daniels or space South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he was turned off by the remark\nHe's a street fighter [noise] elevate him does anything good for the country\nIn a tweet yesterday Trump called ... a third rate lawyer and Daniels a total convert Trump was celebrating a ruling by a federal judge that dismiss Daniels has claimed that the president to fame tour on Twitter\nYou're already doing pizza you're like okay I'll have\nWhat is coming but I'm going to triple that the dish is like Sicilian across but then there's extra sauce on it ...\nIt actually is a ... right well it comes in a day that that you know that's how they make it and they fill that thing I mean I only think of Chicago as having that kind of\nThat right or ... yeah ...

Susan morning Susan solutions which has brought to us by Robie now and laying and Susan a you've got a topic this week that I\nThink I've heard a number of people\nTalking about this obviously in the media we're talking about it a lot a lot of people talking about it for the reasons that you're going to bring this up Sears filing for bankruptcy what does this mean for me as a consumer\nSomebody recently just said to me and the last couple of days I've got like an extended warranty with them what happens now so we're glad you're talking about this\nGood I'm Glad and um I Hope ditch Alaska any questions that I'm not good that I don't cover here but first of all let's just clarify that when we talk about ... we're talking about the mother ship but there are other companies involved as well like Kmart and some of the others subsidiaries but\nFor the points of clarity we're just going to mention fears I mean here's this thing right now that even though they announce for bankruptcy protection and they have plans to close nearly a hundred and fifty stores across the country that it will be business as usual\nSo maybe it will but maybe it won't when companies filed for bankruptcy that's usually what they say because when they filed for bankruptcy it's for protection while they reorganized some do summer successful some are not so in the meantime\nWe hope there is the best but we have to protect ourselves as consumers so if you had a Sears or related gift card or credit redeem it immediately do not wait for a special occasion don't say well I just couldn't use it for a holiday shopping\nOr until you're ready to make a very big or special purchased because if you don't use the gift card at the credit now you risk losing it\nBecause we really don't know what's going to handle it is you mentioned the extended warranties Kim at the same exact thing you have an extended war now that you purchase through Sears and if in fact your series stays in business we made solvent they had nothing to worry about but the chances are that if they don't\nThat extended warranty will just become null and void and so for that reason I'm saying\nDon't buy an extended war tape because like I said it could be\nAnd void down the road if Syria is not able to reorganize and then it was shut down entirely and you'll be stuck\nPlease folks understand I'm not saying don't shop at Sears at all that that's not anywhere near what I'm saying I'm just saying that this is it's a fluid situation it could change pretty much it anytime and ultimately it will be up to a bankruptcy judge to determine how and\nSears creditors will be repaid and generally what happens in cases like that that consumers are the last to be considered obviously series has a lot of big debt with a lot of major companies\nAnd those are the ... who will be paid off first consumers very very rarely get any satisfaction at all so it's really up to us to protect ourselves if you see a big sale it's here's something you could look for\nAn appliance I'm not saying don't buy it I Am when I Am saying that was don't buy the extended warranty through Sears number one expecting that it's going to be good for ever and do not depend on the seams warranty\nEven the word that comes with the purchase because its ears is not there to stand by it then you're stuck as a consumer right to do take advantage of the good sales and all that but don't think long term and if you happen to have a layaway pay that off as quickly as you can to be the same thing with gift cards\nAnd credits and lay away even if you've paid you know four hundred dollars into a five hundred dollar layaway if they go belly up close that you've lost your four hundred\nDollars sure yep yep yep out\nAnd I mean that's pretty much really covers and yeah it's it's a tough thing and let me let me just ask you real quickly ... it's a little bit off of this topic but on the same topic I mean when you have these give cards and you have this issue period is there any recourse at all ... you know if you have a record or if you have a\nA gift card or if you have an extended warranty and the store or the restaurant or what is the Massachusetts law about that\nYeah it's true you know that's a really good point um generally you're just stuck I was thinking of another s word but it probably would not be appropriate but you are I mean you're just stuck you you you end up with a card that is worthless if\nA store or restaurant closes suddenly the only time a consumer has recourse is just say and the example of a restaurant um it closes suddenly and you have a hundred dollar gift card that you had not ... and then the ... pilot proprietors reopen\nIn another community under a different name if you can prove that it is the same proprietor same people who have simply opened under different names Ben by law they are mandated\nTo honor your gift card or your credit but otherwise you're just it's you you just screwed\nSo that's the only word for it Susan was here's you know they have a Sears is filing for bankruptcy but they do have a bigger a umbrella will any of these things possibly be honored indifferent stores like you said Kmart or somewhere else\nUm possibly that could possibly happen but again bankruptcy filing is so complicated and it's all on a case by case basis and while there are federal\nLaws pertaining ultimately it's up to the bankruptcy judge who takes a look at all of the facts and figures in circumstances and make that determination as to who gets paid when and I mean not just say the cheers will do it\nThemselves as they realize that things are starting to fall they may say listen folks we were close to the k-mart stores but you can take those credits and you can bring those cards over to Sears we will honor them there but there is no law that really says they have to do\nThat part about this I mean you know outside of just a sentimental thing for a lot of people about fears filing for bankruptcy and maybe ultimately closing all the doors ... that's far that announcement hasn't been made but the tough part is that you know people have bought", "show_name": "The Kuhner
