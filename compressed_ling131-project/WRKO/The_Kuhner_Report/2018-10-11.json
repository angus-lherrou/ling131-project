to six six sixty sixty five and seven zero for seven zero Kevin is in shelters for this morning morning Kevin\nOn and I don't think\nI think Trump's got no chance of winning over women that are going to vote for him anyway I don't think and I believe he's tapping into something that\nMight have stayed home had they not yet gotten some honesty from a candidate I I mean I Know a lot of strong women that I think that's me too movement to the joke like my mother in law you know she's not elderly or anything she's probably from the sixties and seventies it she she asked me you know a couple of weeks ago during the cabinet stuff\nWhatever happened to weigh a woman and the roar you know what I mean all these women wanted limited lip and they want to be treated they all of a sudden now they want to be treated with ... gloves\n\nI'm not I'm not sure I think that's what the me too movement is about but okay that\nThat's how it played played against Donald Trump but at that and I mean how Trump deal with women in the last election better than most any ... any Republican along\nOkay All right well and again like I like I said this morning Kevin I We'll see how the boats and we'll see how it plays I don't know what I'm saying\nIs most most women that I Know that a strong women find that made it through a thing as a joke\nI don't well that and that's the address those that\nOkay ah I don't think that uh it's a joke I think it can be pushed to far uh and I think women have to be very careful about that I don't think it's a joke I think\nThere are a lot of women through the years who have kept their mouths shut because they were in positions of lesser power and men were holding that over their heads through different a\nSexual harassment means ah but I don't think it's a joke but I Do think women have to be careful but I've always said that I think you can't I don't think that you can let the idea of a\nYou know every time a guy looks at you oh my God I've been I've been across the pond that's ridiculous I think that's outrageous and I think women some women are taking it that far and that's ridiculous\nBut I think there's some very serious ups in parts of that that uh it's about time that people pay attention to and I just to me I just don't think it's a joke and I think that's because I've known to many women who have\nYou know I've worked in media [laughter] I Know a lot of women who have endured a lot of stuff over the years and so I don't think it's a joke well let's see if it was like how it plays for the president I don't know\nFor president maybe we'd be on went into that one I Would advise that among multiple things and he weighed into him and he does fine with it so the thing he he's pretty good about himself right now there's this kind of dark you mentioned is this concept of the Kavanaugh bumpy one that fight he feels really good about it um\nHe also knows that it's a winner for him to do anything politically correctness with political correctness if you just railed against political correctness he's\nHe'll do it all day every day and feel good about himself\nI think he loves this in with that and\nYeah it's dangerous it's tricky he can get himself into real trouble here I I don't expect that he will because he never does somehow he he does just fine [laughter] so I don't know why this one would be any different\nLet me go to Mike in rent them hey my morning good morning how are you I'm well thanks I I'm just\nGoing to the state that the the\nNo matter what Trump says or does this funny he's not going to wait over a female order that doesn't like the beginning was in my house ... on the conservative and my wife so liberal and she ate for and no matter what does it ever going to change look like that across to marry my I'm In\nNo matter what as far as I'm concerned this is all just father\nWell I think to in some ways I think you're right I I don't think he's gonna especially women I he might be able to change some men but I think if women don't like him he's he hasn't been doing things that are going to make it any better\nYou know you keep doing it like ... it's on the women here there's there's two ways of looking at it as the other is that these women are going to change him\nNo I ... you wouldn't get it right at you know for a lot of men in the country they looked at this and said okay we gotta kinda rethink who we are that the way he delivered that last night it is a change in Egypt like that but again he puts up to an end to the old way of obligated such nonsense\nOkay so both sides are that way neither of them are really listen to the other one at this point and here we are we'll see if we get into a huge brawl about it or if he's just gonna periodically just do his little digs and that's where my guess is going to happen but\nHis argument is you told me I Can't do this this and that and I won yeah oh yeah that's why I'm telling you I don't want to be much different\nUh Bobby Jindal Raqqa good morning Bobby\nThe morning I just felt like thank you know I I just\nI you know I think what they chose a credible and that you know there's ... they should be prosecuted I don't have any problem with that that's the way it should be but I think it's being used as a political weapon at this point I mean it got this guy the Alison there's not mature man in the Democratic party you don't hear\nAll about him and they have a police report they have you know a doctor's report and I think you don't ... silence its absolute silence this guy still in Congress okay and so it that way to do with him\nI Know this is kind of unfortunately what happens with the movement to start with a real or true the co opted by people who want to use them politically um and then they become somewhat marketable\nBut you can't lock them if you're the president and you know when you're sitting around having a beer with the guy you're like oh my God oh another meet Joe moment\nYou know what I mean or whatever but\nYou can't do that when you the ... unfortunately I Will say we're following were into two years into a presidency that followed an eight year run a presidency that has not gone\nWhere they thought it was the president of everybody you know last I checked the IRS on his political opponents and up to that time\nWe used to the president just to get in and say you know what I Need to bring the company country editor president left in the rye and the softer wants to orient you know Bill Clinton did George Bush did\nA ... all these guys when they got in and they realize hey you know what half the country didn't vote for me but I don't need to take care of them to\nUnfortunately we're in an era where that's not the way the games play anymore and you know I don't know how you change it and it's going to be hard to say hey you're the one change when you're like wait what about black guy\nAnd\nI pull you over the last one is one of the things as you said that you know as as the president you can't do this\nBut he kept\nMe out as in this ... year ... army I get it right which is this is the new normal\nHe can just speak to however many whatever the percentages forty to fifty one whatever ... percent of the country years and he can ignore the rest he can and he's been doing it for a long time and it's been working for him\nAnd so just because it's never been done before doesn't mean it can be done now and you may not like it or you may like it I actually think you kinda do like a ball that is what's weird about yeah I think you're struggling to express it because I don't think you're telling your true feelings I think you like that he does this I think you liked that he speaks like just these talking at a bar\nAnd ... why don't I don't I don't I don't think you should put words in polls now I'm telling you all have a whole is called and said that before okay I Want to he's had already on battle expressing that really isn't that and I think rise 'cause he kinda does like if\nYou keep saying it works for him you don't know yet again you don't know how much it works for him I mean we'll see we'll see if it's working I don't know your your adamant it works for him it works for him with the people who like him is that is that enough I don't know yet you don't\nKnow either well I don't know what to call that for me you you call that when you go back to the\nPolls again oh so it's a little actions the important when my last one\nLike every time he's done this and taken on something he's not even taking this on he just made a joke or an off color comment and if you think that is not that every time he's done it it hasn't hurt them it's never hurt them\nI don't understand how you keep saying it hasn't hurt and what do you mean what has not been able to do as president and how they will be some Congress in ... okay well it hasn't hurt them he's been doing this stuff forever you said I like to\nSee because it ... first time that combination is on November the sex you we'll find out if it's hurt him at all because that's when people who were either independence before\nOr or did and voted for him or people who could despise her and voted for him for anything\nHer now they're going to make a decision as to whether that bothered them or not and maybe it hasn't I don't know or\nMaybe the stock market has another five days of eight hundred point losses and none of this matter is it's just noise but people vote on that I mean may knows what these elections are going to be and why they're going to be and people are gonna make stuff whatever I'm just telling you he's done this forever and there have been no consequences for him none\nAnd there aren't good this is nothing and the ... on the list of Trump swelling lobster bad bleep hole countries that one sort of as some consequences this is nothing\nI Know this is nothing you're right but what is it something is that it all adds up to the idea that again that he's just sort of ... mocking women\nBut again I for him if everything's a calculation you can debate that or not I I'm going to go with Mike and Bobby which is women have made up their mind on Trump and not changing\nIt it's the reverse here I'll uses analogy but\nIf you're the woman who knows that I shouldn't be with Trump periodically I start to come back around and go I get and every time I'm almost ready to go there he got up and does this\nAnd then I back right away again I just don't think that women exist you either taken him on for what he is or you're done with them and nothing changes so that's why I keep telling you there's no consequences but as for him on them to go on when I did last night I don't agree with you\nI I think that they I think we don't know yet\nI I think the consequences are the beat Taylor Swift twenty three year old girls that probably aren't going to vote and every once in a while he reminds him they probably should yeah I I I'm not\nOn the latest lack burn up nine I she's gone up since that happened if you believe what I mean that type of females maybe\nHave is a I generally don't vote but I keep getting reminded all I really don't like this guy is probably should go vote I probably I mean I have a lot of friends in their twenties that you know they keep saying they like they see a political posts and they say I don't care I don't I don't follow the stuff that slowly but surely are kind of ongoing or write final vote this time\nThe one that the one that came up yesterday that a little bit I maybe it is maybe it isn't but but it's similar Trump where you if you like him you laugh and if you don't like him you're like oh wow but this is what's trickier the thing that he did in the White House yesterday they ask him about the ... case which\nWherever we stand on that fine but\nDid you get that clip lightning just because this is the one where\nYou go yeah that that's ... ... so he's talking about this Saudi reporter journalist who's been killed in probably been killed by the crown and where do we stand on him he says\nI don't want to make I don't want to say that I always thought\nHave to find out who\nPeople so I'm going with it and see them come out as they understand that and we're going to take a versus look at it as a terrible thing [laughter]\nRather not say what the answer is yes [laughter]\nWell I have used the Saudis I I'd rather not say but\nThe answer is yes yeah well so I laugh\nBecause obviously that's barely you rather would say because you just set it on the other hand this is sort of tricky foreign

private conversations here to anybody but then he just doesn't even take a breath I'd rather not say yes I have to go\nWell for me that's to be perfectly honest with you I mean I you know maybe you can call me shallow but uh that's a lot that's less an issue for me with Donald Trump than the fact that he attacks half the voting [laughter] that he mocks half the voting public\nYou know I mean look like you said it's the stuff that hits me at home that bothers me the most it's a if the stock market keeps dropping out that will be a problem with gas prices keep going up that's going to be a problem if you keep mocking half day\nThe voting public that's a problem when it comes to stuff like that well we know where he stands and we know who he is for that\nBut it's this program at all and

Germany out which is how you argue with you [laughter]\nI I was willing to to you because I I have nothing else to say I mean I but I don't know why you get Charlie gets under your skin and I don't know why the Trump or how to use you know what he does or doesn't do what I heard you and that's how I we just heard that segment you when you engine both got for a job with Charlie what I Want to do is play the holders down\n'cause I Want to hear it again because I didn't share the same way Charlie hurt it\nOkay so we'll do that in a second but I my cards on the table or this I Am used by the ... and Newbery who tell me specifically that the reason why they voted for Trump is that he pushes back and he fights dirty\nThat's a phrase I heard over and over and over again you light that he fights dirty and the second that somebody who's not Trump says I'm going to fight dirty you go I Can't believe how awful this is and this is\nBad for America and I I don't know how you will do this\nFor a while where are you guys can call in and you can tell me I'm Crazy on it but you must see the inherent\nComedy\nIn your position on this the Trump is awesome but holder is so low brow for saying that he is the only way I Would tell you that he's not saying something that Trump would say is Trump wouldn't be the softer by the Trump would never say when they go low we kick him what Trump would say is when they go low we kick them writing the balls\nThat Trump would say and you would go\nYou would and now you're acting like holders off you can now as of twenty sixteen you catch it can I think you could always use\nA okay let's let's hear what holder so for those of you who are just joining us here at seven thirty five and by the way in an hour from now we're going to give you a chance to

all know [laughter]\nThey go low we can [noise]\nWas his new democratic warnings about crowded hell Democrats will fight on the ideals of the Democratic party were proud of my history will proud of our president what part of the future that we can create for this country\nIt's a thing about the United states in twenty Eighteen is is the only way you can show you're proud of something is by talking about violent or assaulting or draw when something like is that the only way you can do it is to be bombastic I Do you think Hillary\nIt didn't fight for ideals I mean Trump Peter fine but was she not does she not right believe in I mean\nI mean it's nonsense but the the concept now is you have to go like this you have to throw your arms around otherwise you don't care\nAnd I think that's probably true yeah\nI think that's true I'll let me go to bill in separate good morning now\nHello good morning Democrats the arrogant at the loans that they think it ... it looked to me it's not easy to ... ... ... and also look at the same time he had a lifetime of you to light and to be courteous\nSo what do I tell you what the bill Neal bill what do I tell you at the top why did I read why did I turn on Kavanaugh\nBecause it's not easy and Kavanaugh this isn't any him to be like that and so when he tried he didn't do it well and that's why I got to go out these guys I okay I'm going to go at the woman that was that was stupid and that was the wrong thing to do but he doesn't know how to do this well because it's hard to do it unless you've been doing in your whole life\nExactly waving your show the king but you write that phrase\nI mean I I Would argue and I've said this over and over Donald Trump is a phenomenon it's I'm not I know if people think that and BP says all the time all this is the way the future I don't know if it is we'll see because I don't know that the Democrats can do this very well I I don't know if anybody can do it as well\nThey're offering to bail you know this right Hillary Hillary\nSet in essence I mean everybody will acknowledge that makes some sense but the problem is she didn't say it's hard to be civil when other people are just attacking usually see it we won't be civil and until we get back in power we won't be\nThat the line where she missed it and this is another one where when they go low we push back is one thing instead he said we kick them and the good news they're not doing it right\nThe good news is that is pretty thin skinned and he hates the sort of law or the Democrats have that going for them ...\nHe's gotten better with that though he has not taken any of the ... I Would argue a are almost any other and we'll see so far he hasn't dreaming about older today which surprises me when the when the chips are down like if the market keeps cabin that's when it's\nWhen he's going to have to uh Michelle as in New Hampshire go ahead and show\nHigh I can hide anything um I just wanted to say I think that it's not going to work with the angry mob and thought that you know the ... the con man and the halo a con man I think they should\nGo about that and be nice and that was because I think what's gonna happen as they look and I got to allow and that going to be showing them out and do it that way with with everything and I understand what you're saying about child you know the way is\nYou know which crowds and his pension and the face and that's not right either but I think I don't know why\nDo they show it away in may that was that a Democrat\nIs it just don't lose the money dot com just don't lose the money dot com\nGetting started in the morning with Kim don't make me slap you\nBaby wow I thought I thought that was it gave me a human baby Boston's morning show that you are\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd I have an aide says thirty fighting is ... game not [noise] reading some of our tax here\nHow is that true\nHow is it not Trump's game he will bragged to you right to your face and [noise]\nI don't mind fighting dirty I don't mind pushing back I don't mind doing whatever it takes and again\nFor a lot of people in the country that was one of the things that they love most about a ... an hour ... that didn't happen my question on all it's sort of like the NBA question right how you beat the Golden State warriors\nSo there's there's a number of different approaches the Cleveland Cavaliers let's just stay with our one guy and much just try it again in ... how did that work for um there are other team to the Celtics would slowly but surely a mass our own talent and will play a different style a game and we'll have a much more aggressive defensive game and it will show them\nBut we didn't get to him then there's the Houston Rockets used in rockets said specifically we're gonna out Golden State Golden State we're going to do what they do but we're going to do it even better than they do it\nThat's hard to do yes it is it can be done in you could argue the rockets were doing it up until Crist barred am stringing game six last year\nBut in the end Golden State held the trophy ... is that Trump here I mean the analogy is only the only gets you so far but when you try to outdo somebody it's something that they do very well\nMan you have a very you've got a thread that needle so fine in order to pull that off that's a tough directed bathroom older if he's right that that's what the Democrats are going to do man they had better not\nIt can go terribly wrong\nUh Gary is in North settled barrel good morning Gary\nGood morning actually I got to go with a with Charlie this is a false equivalence here let me tell you why first of all Trump goes at ... ... talk show but against people who are one adults who have inserted themselves into\nThe political arena by one method or another if they've gotten themselves involved in politics okay the left and and you know by extension Hollywood's a lot of these people they have gone after children there are people that are saying you know it's okay to harass when their wives or their\nYou know you you don't do that you like your mom used to say you know there were there that are non combatants you don't go after a non combat and that's what the left has done the other thing is is\nTo hold on to say for you make your second point could you explain exactly when the leftist encourage violence against children\nOh how many attacks against Baron\nReally go read Twitter to all the things that they said that should be done to Aaron\nOkay oh talk okay we're talking about what random people on Twitter are saying Ben bender getting really into that's not the Democratic party encouraging violence really lousy\nO'Donnell Rosie O'Donnell making fun of making fun of of of barren prompt\nI okay on clearance pointed edge a conservative making fun of a democratic kid you want do you want to go back and see what people sort of a choice and\nHe showed me an example that was world on the on the media like this one has been okay they have made they made they have they don't restrict themselves too scary\nYou're better argument would be the cheapest thing in Portland where they chase the old guy down the road who just wanted to get down to the place and he was had and then they chased him out of their\nLast year there are there are a\nI'll give gym is that if you go to the fringe on either side there were two guys in Boston that killed a homeless guy and they claim they did it for Trump not whether they did or they didn't they bad happened so you can act like one side is just more crazy than any other\nAdults or they they sit there and they demanded an apology\nYou know in some cases they actually get it with some of the cross his wife and then they go from past to apologize she has to denounce pilots then he'd been out since violence and they say oh well you know\nThat one was about ... here was announced biology operas to pay the legal fees for people that get violent or Alan was the announcement of violence I didn't hear\nThe when when that whole thing in Charlottesville happened okay\nIs that there were people on both sides not sure how that is denouncing and I mean\nThey're okay you know you guys have got your minds made up that\nThey you have a child\nIs different first of all for okay but again let's let's go let's go to the actual anger issues okay when these people when when Trump comes out\nTo to to talk about you know sure and and attacking people he actually sounds like it's natural like it's flowing yet I mean the Democrat yet that it didn't it didn't come across as being a sore loser and being whiny and it was ... that that went through in this business\nAbout delivery of the violence you're actually ... Democrats are faking Illinois you never know when I was like this wire resonates\nBetter with the public because it it seems like it's something when you look at it with war and making a joke it's like somebody you know you could almost see the script or I just thought oh she didn't do it she didn't write it she delivered correctly the other thing is to say you just keep talking about dirty politics if you want to tell me what politics was actually a clean gentleman's\nOrdinary now you know the first thing you said this whole time that I can agree with you a hundred percent it's not clean it's not\nIt's not even the violence will only way for instance that they kept it behind closed doors and now it's out in the public's eye and down the guy who decided he was going to stand at the podium and sailed the dirty things that they say behind closed doors\nThere is a difference between a businessman saying something of the\n... but I don't know why the way I yeah well he's not in the you know ... ... or ...\nOr as a write noted on doesn't president Eric Holder's a private citizen mhm\nOh okay but he's still a lawyer is basically that we get you ... lawyers if they went outside and said hey you know what let's go I keep in mind that he's not just saying go after the any individual or we're going to kick individual this whole thing is also predicated on the fact that oh it's every Trump supporter\nThat's one of the things to where Trump has been very specific all the people that he has gone after whereas the left to spend like anybody who voted for Trump well they're fair game\nGary ... and I'm not sure I heard that in what Eric Holder said when they grow refers to the Republican Party ... they handle things ... rain ... on it and make reference to but he's right on\nWell you know but the thing is is that this stuff's stops at the top and these people by the way the Democrats were supposed to be so much smarter and better than the rest of us but yet now they have to come down to this level what what\nHave they lost as what I don't either I normally you would appreciate this from them is that they recognize their shortcomings that we're tired of the ivory to Iowa holier than thou high horse people they're recognizing that that's not working so now they're going to get in the gutter with you but you hate them for that just because you ate them\nNo I don't I don't have them for that I just think that that that they're comparing the way that they conduct themselves compared to the way that that Trump has conducted itself is a little bit different now that will tell you when it will end it will end when Democrats that doing this against all the Democrats in their world is primaries that's when the calls for civility will actually\nCome out you're not if you're like you mentioned last time I mean the Sanders people almost burn that plays down they had a huge\nProtest that was basically blocking entry into that arena in Philly\nThe day the first day of the thing and many Democrats were not happy about it and you know what those people said too bad and then I Would argue that had Ted Cruz gotten the nomination on the Republican side it would have looked exactly the same from the Trump people\nI maybe I mean when the when it looked like Trump was going to lose they were threatening to burn down the country because Hillary won Gary the trick with you is for me is that while you're right it's never been any different\nIn the past but then you say but Trump is different and\nI think it's all the same politics ain't bean bag for some reason Trump can say that in his school but then when holder says if we go you know that you've just taken it to a whole new level it's a fascinating thing to see how this plays out seven fifty eight here on ...

Mike Tyson's in your hotel room of those sort of things about ...\nBrittany spears did it did and she really for all intents and purposes yes she does her Vegas got drunk and married or high school sweetheart or whatever and they were forced well Jim fell off a roof\nI mean that is true Jim one Arab ah no I fell off the side of a building it was not a roof thank you it was a ... [laughter]\nIt was up and in my defense with all the owner took fault for that\nYeah it was a rally around some wraparound balcony that had a piece missing on the site and I did not realize it just continued walking and walked off the ...\nI only saw ally blamed the owner of the building there if sober are the same would have happened right by semi air was a gate that was supposed to be locked that was not locked\nYou would have ... you would have noticed that under different circumstances I object to\nOh why oh why are you are certainly played a role in the oh he was asked to ...

I was shocked to jump said yeah well what do you expect with the fed needed the thing that we study by but fine but Fox does I think\nThey don't just just as fast they do I think they they asked him stuff like that I think where the ... that line is drawn is at once the answers they don't follow him up they don't follow up they don't argue with him about it yeah and they asked him the hard questions and then except his answer All right ... right that would be the only play well they didn't win Rosenstein I told you that they didn't this morning they give you time jumped\nIn and did get after I Am but they like they're not gonna jump ugly with him obviously but now do they do at least get them on record oversight\nUsher me you have to be careful jump I leave with the president period or something I'm not sure that I mean I loved her all jump bogged down with them but that's not necessarily\nYou know that's not necessarily right Reagan jumping agua our talking about millennia Trump for a second here can we yeah yeah because she's got this big interview that's coming up tomorrow night on ABC she's in a while she was over in Africa\nAnd we've all a timeline us as the one who's doing it and we've all you know said well why do they hold it there must not be anything there they you know they must have just held it because it turned out to be a died but they've turned dribs and drabs throughout the week of started to release a little bit of the information less than what I Would have thought they would\nUm but some of the stuff that she has said and they have released in the last twenty four hours would be the issue related to she was asked about me too and she said that she was asked do you have these women's backs and she said I had their backs but they have to approve\nWhich I think went directly at what we just watched transpire on national television the last\nTwo weeks but what's interesting is that she apparently also said that she is and I'm going to get the exact\nQuote and the most bullied person in the world\nI could say that I'm most bully person on the world is so\nUh is that true I don't know because she followed it up by saying I Am certainly one of them if you really see what people are saying about the\n...\nI mean I don't see what people are saying about her meaning she seated writing she sees that kind of thing I don't hear people saying a lot of bad about\nMillennia Trump I a lot of people I I Know like Melania Trump think that you know she's a great first lady and most importantly some have at the level of sympathy for her because of a you know some of the things have been said and done\nWell they've been in office and I'm Talking about other women\nYeah I wouldn't think of ... in the world quite the opposite I think she's treated with\nKid gloves and people don't you know push when she says give me space they give her space and all that sort of stuff but then when I Do think about it I'm like I don't know how you would rank this sort of stuff I'm sure she\nHas plenty of negative comments written about our online every day I mean we know some of the Baron stuff and whether you've got illnesses or not and whether they're good parents\nFor not I'm sure that stuff written every day so anyone at a high profile level is going to be pretty bullied and\nYet you or that you know I mean some of the stuff I saw that was written about Michelle Obama was hideous I mean every one of those people indoors that kind of thing I mean if people\nSaw some of the things that are written about me every day here on the line I mean that that is part of what you take on so I don't know if she has anything to compare it to she might compare it to her life prior to being first lady and I would imagine if you are\nTo compare it then you feel pretty bullied\nIt's a very interesting interview frankly because she is she's not waiting in lightly into this stuff in this isn't it doesn't appear any way to be a fluff thing they asked her about\nYou know a lot of things have been said about your husband in the White House and buy a lot of people within the White House do you trust people there and she says I I don't trust everybody and I mentioned it to my husband and he\nSays door well what happened with those people she says well some of my there anymore that's that's much more\nHands on any I guess for lack of a better term than I Would have thought she'd be willing to share\nShe says um it's hard to govern and says that she doesn't trust all of those around him\n\nSo pretty interesting pretty good stuff from her [noise]\nYeah I Am very anxious to see um I gave it she says I give him my honest advice and honest opinion and then he does what he wants to do\n\nShe is going to talk about that jacket I I I Know I'm so obsessed by that but I I ... to me that's the most mysterious thing that millennia Trump is done since they've been in office by far\nEverything else I think you know she wore the white suffrage thing whatever you know all that kind of stuff was sort of understandable but the jacket was the most\nI had the biggest head scratcher and the most fascinating thing that she's done and I'm anxious to see if she just says it's a it was a\nFashion thing\nI think most animals everything she does is mysterious like why is this trip solo what did you run in by anybody that when she did that jak a trip to G run the trip by anybody or did you just up and say we're going like it appeared that she did who who are these people you didn't trust to determine or in the White House I mourn left to speculate on all of this sort of stuff\nAh now there's a lot with her but the jak it's obviously pretty good I mean I don't think any of us believe if she says that it was not from there it was going to leave a charm she seems to be in the clips that we've seen being pretty honest\nRight oh is it no I thought it was interesting because it was it no holds bar interview they had no restrictions what's that that in itself is pretty unusual\nAnd they've posted about that all week that she could she would field whatever question you want it now I don't know if she answered every question but boy\nResemble the questions might have been answered with we're going to I'm going to move on from that or whatever what was the phrase in front of the things move off and we're going to move off\nOf that ... could be that we'll see but I looked as an important 'cause this is a test right\nSo for the next two years anyways what millennia are we going to get are we going to get them on who wants to be a little more active and a little more public in a little more go get 'em or is she gonna recoil fishy start campaigning I think so [noise]\nBut [noise]\nThat can change and we don't know she talks about the infidelity and he asks her has this put a strain on your marriage that's when they're not releasing so we don't know what the answer to that is\n[noise] eight fifty a hearing
