with carrier or I Would say you know you introduce something and they do it every sport now you fool around with someone season tickets you're gone so I\nThink I did back in my day hunting over he wants to go back to those days where that guy taking on to the stadium [laughter] she's just ... kicked out of them then he's gene to uphold it\nInto the ground for about twelve hours before you sober

he just threw it like he didn't think anything he just didn't say well here's my question for you that reason I'm a little sympathetic\nOr should drink hill take action\nI Hope he doesn't I really do I mean his agent got involved in that you know had a\nLittle rose announced likes to make a lot of noise and it's really knows those enough patriots under oath and I was like ... is a big dolphins guy yeah so of course you'll take shots at the patriots but\nI mean I don't think ... it's going to mean made on every what is the child that you know yeah I mean that when you have damaged\nThe guy you get it in his eye and\nWhatever but but did know nothing's going to happen there I mean the ... and everybody ripping diary killed because of his past save that nobody wants to that's got nothing to do with this okay right right patriots fans in India\nOh well you remember old friend ... ... oh yeah so he tweeted off of our Kelly financial pole and he said look\nFind them and then make them clean up Gillette after the next class game a good idea but as often the case one dog is a good idea I make it better how about this find them also he's got to pay is way unlike the father in law or something\nTo Kansas City for the next chief some game theory and achieve Jersey and then you're going to clean the stadiums after the chief's game when you find your own way home too\nI was just looking it up in Kansas City a paper because I wanted to see what Kansas City fans you know in Kansas City star what they had to say about it because I just had this sneaking suspicion that again this is a way to just really hammer\nThe patriots young people that but actually that this was an opinion page in it they they were pretty reasonable there as well I mean you know they were saying patriots have taken the steps that they need to let's say the security they have identified him and so\nLook to pay just did what you're saying but it was three were ashtrays right how do we make it go away quick right so you immediately go a good night's done when you put up the public statement\nThis will it's going to get this done for the patriots now when the kids in court everyone's going to stick to give way to use the the perp walk on this guy I Know I'm not kidding you're going to think he's burning made up that's my thing is like look there are those people in society where I Do want to see\nThem tripping over TV cameras while they're struggling to get to their car and then the car doesn't turn over and people are in their way\nThis kid just as ... as you do did something really stupid late at night because he's so into sports that yes for for a brief moment he lost control of himself but he said it's just a little bit of barred man here you know like\nI should like be ruined because the guy returned foul ball like we all would like I don't know I\nBut don't but what'd you say that I mean he should pay the fines right but don't don't you think\nThat the kids should also I mean there should be a little I'm not that he's not allowed back in I I wouldn't\nDo that I I I'm legitimately like you've got to clean the arrowhead stadium multiple times and you're that you're on you to get there to\nVisit in Brockton Albany let's get let Tom in Hey Tom good morning\nGood morning Kim how are you I'm good thank you send\nThe kids the spoiled brat growing up there and some space I'm Sorry I don't cut this kidney slack ... football players that fear of the city was charged salt is what he did\nOkay and as far as I'm losing losing his privileges to get the Patriots' games ... who I have no slack the kids' parents should have done a better job raising them end of story thank you Bye bye\nI I Can't put any of this on their parents' ... not one iota well\nYeah I think it'd be the best band in the history of your eyes are open today do Twenty one year olds do stupid stuff didn't we just go over this\nAnd they really do stupid stuff when they're in like a whole\nThere's this whole mentality going on here I mean you know I look at the picture the the Kansas City star with the picture in the paper without the die without the whole thing so you can see and I mean you just got a whole group of knuckleheads here\n[laughter] you know I'm not trying to laugh it's stupid and the kids should be made it only one that gathering arm extended finger in these faces like\nBang and that's aggressive yeah my ... my problem\nIs that we've got a guy in the middle of this whole thing who looks like he could be about forty five years old who is also oh there are only a overgrown knuckleheads and I'm with\nYou in that if this person who is through this there would've been him I Would have said hey dude you're an idiot you're out\nMore more aggressively than how I feel about this kid\nUsed to be at Fenway now we do this we still didn't even work but you put up netting to protect the people from lawyers about it you know now we got to put up netting to protect the players from the idiot fans but there's the famous picture Bruce ... ... it was that famous dolphins game where it's snowing and Bruce ... does the pick six\nHe throws up the snow and then all the fans are in front of them and they run up to snow too\nLike that's what the league lives for yeah that\nLax and a lot of man cave this is the downside to that well let me add on democracy will lead to things like that\nBut here's what we have to ask ourselves if we were at arrowhead and this was grown how would you feel about that whole Gronkowski caught the beer and probably drank it\nDid have hit the up and\nThen\nWatson a couple of years ago and I haven't seen it but the the Jackson next door's reminded me of the Brady ran over and waved to the guy like throw some beer on me too yeah and it was like a fun thing yeah\nWhich I don't also necessarily encourage let's not encouraged these people to throw stuff in Boston I hate to do the rip awesome thing we have a long history of as we used to throw back the famous battery throwing a loop and Allen incident uh at Fenway\nWhen we were losing to the ... when the Yankees was it was oh to what whatever\nWe're getting smoked again and they everybody started ... and they had to pull the gap the field like that you got to be careful with the Yankees that\nMean that gets into a whole nother right that's a whole different realm even you know gosh\nWe we have had our share of bad behavior and it's you know you've got to rein it in and this is going to be the new face\nPartly because the guy the bills game last year no one can relate to that

I Do think she's won so some people are voting for most people say well which is ... ...\nYeah the only thing is I think both sides need to be treated lightly you know we we've got Cherokee Nation coming out saying they're offended by this and not so much that people do have this kind of blood you know but they're saying this doesn't really prove\nAnything which she says I understand that she does she said that\nShe said that this doesn't prove from which tribe she might have derived or you know that this ancestor did [noise]\nUm but I also I I really do find it interesting that\nThe president now is sort of changed his charity thing\nUm which is an interesting take on all this which could make him not look so great to be careful Mr President because now all of a sudden you're saying and he actually went so far yesterday as they say look it up well people have looked it up and he didn't say\nIf you take the DNA test and you win the Democratic nomination he just said take the DNA test and a million bucks from Trump goes to your favorite charity much\nLike in some of his ... he has very little wiggle room but he has some\nI think the comment was if you're on a debate stage with her what are you going to say oh I don't know I'd probably turn and say if you take a DNA test I'll give you a million bucks meaning his his defense of it is that in the context of a debate I Would say that we weren't in a debate so it was it\nLike I said it's it's living we'll read ... ... do you have the uh\nGive me the warrant on ... show back in the old ... 'cause this is another reason why this hurts or so\nI'm not playing this to be a smart us but one of the things Elizabeth Warren has done over time with is is\nIt is and didn't flowed on the importance of it in her life and her doing this the way she did it yesterday brought this clip back and it got retweeted by her I think Don junior even retweeted this ... and she doesn't want this back in the east coast I don't think but here it is\nHe right or wrong about what it is I Believe was started there okay\nMom and dad all were very much in love with each other and they want me to get married and my father's parents said absolutely not [laughter] you can't marry her because she's part Cherokee she's heartfelt\nUm [noise] after fighting as long as they could my parents went off they loved it was an issue\nI just can't\nBe true it cannot be true based on a these results if you even believe these results\nBe\nIt would be it would have been her\nWhy would you not believe these results because she would've doctored it in a better way ... maybe I mean that's the one argument for gosh I don't believe that it's ... I mean when\nYou don't run up against an Indian databases you're running against south Americans so there's that issue went to the guy tells you right up front looked as what I got to do because that's all I can pass but\nIt's so for example I don't know what that get to the Delaware issue the the Delaware Indian drive I don't know but that one is so definitively\nIt is her on not only an audio video within lightning put that clip up on the website and\nLike this style coming back now and that one's really damaging because it's hard to go from one potentially one one thousand and twenty fourth\nTo my mother had to a low because they would not allow them to get married again I get that you're trying to make your mother seemed like a hero and little she do anything for love and all that sort of stuff but it doesn't make a true\n[noise] well I\nI don't want to defend Elizabeth Warren I'm not willing to defend or because I I think that she use something here that I think was wrong but having said that I don't know that that's not the story she has always been told that doesn't mean that wasn't folklore you know in her store in her family\nOh I agree but what's the problem with that but the lightning do you have the other one from the remember what she said in her five minute video right she specifically calls out Trump for calling her mother a liar now\nWants to call my mom a liar what is the sad thing is yeah this is what we have a Native American ancestry and your editor\nI mean ... the wedding story ... someone's lying it's either your mother or you are so if you if you're a big claim as the Trump says I'm a liar I guess he's the one I don't know because they I who believes that wedding story they had to do a low because of the Cherokee blood I\nI ... I Believe I don't know I I Believe she ... she could possibly have been told that all of her life I don't know\nBut I think this is all way too far in the weeds already in its own irrelevant the only thing that's relevant is whether she got ahead because she said she was a minority that's all that's relevant to this conversation her family to me and the stories they told to one another\nI mean my my grandpa told the story that he used the when used to blow so hard in Oklahoma did he put his head against the wall and the wind held it there and he swore that was true\nHe also said that his neck or lawyers were you know a twins and their names were I met in Europe hog I mean he you know he had all these big stories that you know I guess you could buy ending believe for a Oklahoma\nI again I don't know do you do you really want to go into it I don't I don't particularly either the story would be that\nIt's the best they got to use and when I was a six thousand years ago or something when\nThey sing the Indians migrated over they first went there and then came here which is why there would\nBe some sort of trace similarity that was the story that the guy bust amount they put forth for what it's worth it's the best they've got the ... or so\nThat is in Boston Good morning bath\nAnd where are you good\nThat's good oh I totally believe Elizabeth Warren on this one she's from the very beginning the same story over and over that the grandmother great grandmother\nEverything seems to be lining up have no idea what people are now arguing about it [noise]\nWell I think the only thing I Would say is that she told the same story over and over but I think she thought or the story she had told it was someone who is a little closer to her generationally which would make her more legitimately\nOr Native American this proves there might be some of their heritage but it's pretty far back\nFor me the reason why we're sticking my ... always as the like Jen it'd be wondering if it was a grandmother\nBut this would be a great great great grandmother right also when you're talking about paw paws high cheekbones will pop out couldn't add that ige bombs you just couldn't of when they just may have a minute didn't have anything to do that I made out of it to do with it either but so so there's a number of things that she's done\nThat are murky enough around it that leads me to go I'm a little bit suspicious here\nAnd then what happens is when you don't like somebody it's important for you too thank wish them\nAnd that's what the rights trying to do is usually been doing it for a while now with her on this and we're doing it again because she decided to push back\nAnd in ... in in my opinion it's backfired the globe ...\nThe globe really did or a disservice by having the numbers wrong I mean that that you write inexcusable\nBut it just you know for me the problem is just that we can all traced back to somewhere to some things\nAnd when you start talking about six generations will trace back all of us are from somewhere else six generations ago it doesn't mean that we can we ... we are\nNot as common right right it doesn't matter what your blood tells you you're not a ... year you're not on a reservation you haven't raised lifestyle you have an embrace that if you consider\nYourself a minority or a member of that community if you can trace back and individual six generations ago so this is why for me it all circles back to just one thing\nAnd that did you use that in some way because that's not what the box or the ability to say that you were a member of some kind of minority community that's not what that's out there and that's not its purpose\n[noise] a crusty isn't it's which ... the\n[noise] hey guys how are you I Love listening you guys again I'm sure that I'll tell you a lot of islands [laughter]\n\nOh Christie unfortunately we got a bad cell line here hello it's getting worse yeah ... I'm Sorry we're gonna have to try again I'll let me go to Jim Jim's insurers very this morning Jim good morning\n[noise] I guess I think everyone us remember Elizabeth Warren as it is I'm a lawyer a smart lawyer she was you know a law\nProfessor at the time she knows what she's doing they don't make mistakes you know what they do things her purpose everything they say are down with a goal in mind they question properly she knows her and she checks the box were doing\nAnd what irks me the most is very similar to when Clinton said he was on that\nWith ... Lynch talking about the grand kids is they're playing pool she knows exactly why she checked the box knows exactly what you got out of it\nAnd to say otherwise is really demeaning to any I mean she's a smart lawyer she knows what she's doing it's really it it it planning America for fools\nRichard what Obama did according to John it's in a a all what was the Jonathan\nGruber I guess the guy the guy you know the guy that I don't care guy who said that the health\nCare a guy that said yeah you know what we can push this through because Americans are are just to pay the ugly Americans is why we can push this past them and that's what a lizard vets warns doing fake it\nOh well but there's a double edge thing if you're going to say she's a smart lawyer then she's a smart lawyer in what she's doing here would be smart right and that's one of the quiet that that does the driving question now is\nMost of it was a made up her mind on her in this story long time ago but what do you make of what you doing now is this gonna work can she owned this and can she sort of put an end to it but really\nWhat happened when this for you you remember your government when this first came up when she first ran for Senate it kind of hot for about two weeks and then people didn't want to hear it anymore and for people like me were like she provided no answers I don't know why people\nAre now giving our pass on it but they did so is that going to happen again here where look I made my big thing you've got the kicking around for a couple of weeks and now let's move on they did move on in Massachusetts so will they move on\nThis round on this that's the million dollar question right that's what she's gambling is going to happen right and and I mean if you're that enraged that you feel like she found a way to get ahead but she should never gotten been clearly you're also enraged about Trump lying about we're all his money came from because that's pretty much the same thing that unfair advantage that they do I let you know about\nRight and that is that that is the tough thing that you know if they're running against each other and I think that the dirt\nI mean if you're really make the argument of the two of them but she had advantages that he didn't growing up that's crazy\nBut that's if you were looking for intellectual consistency no one has that in this world anymore that don't nobody does you know just whatever fits for you you\nRight which which brings us all the way back full circle to the question\nDid this move the needle you know ... who's winning and the answer I think is probably no nobody because I think in the end people who've already made their minds up about this woman now the rest of the nation does not know her as well as people here do so this is\nYou know I think if you were asking this in Kansas that might be different right now I'm than asking it here are Christians and if so which let's try again Christie good morning\nSorry I can pick it up quickly I'm so glad you guys again I could still do that because you're dynamic I also gather there are so keep up the good ... thank you and I'm Still\nFor a little bit more and I know like like\nShe is really stretching the truth and like the other gentleman said it's an example of yet ... says something about his well but for her so poorly undoubtedly on applications for when it should be saying\nThat they really true cases like that the woman the lord claiming great when it wasn't really wake people up to stretch the truth especially at politicians and lawyers and I think that's why so many people do not have been away\nA breath of fresh now he lost some competition with these ... ton aspect but isn't the fact that she would take advantage of that\nJust for her again when other people to eat that for college applications or or or or jobs you know it's just not fair and she\nWants to be blind people taking advantage of some of these people that should be taking it back and I mean I just wonder Sosa skier and swore me I just think it's like Hillary\nWell you know there's a number of things are good for you and I would say to you is why I'm fascinated with Trump and I have this argument or brother all the time we thinks that Trump's most on fascinating person on the world but why why I think he is fascinating is Trump not only gets away with things that other people don't but we actually\nPretend that it's not there so when Rubio does the Trump thing in New Hampshire we kick Rubio down and he actually has to drop out of the race but really it was really good at that but we don't want it from Rubio Trump does it and we pretend like he's just being open and honest\n[laughter] and I think the same and may be going on here where warranted he's doing a Trump thing you said my mother was lying about this\nBut we may not want it from her because only Trump seems to get away with this stuff sometimes\nI don't know why he does but that's how history

Mars that I wouldn't know what I observed no but ... said if you do what I Will he did it you won't Trump said if I was on a debate that she wasn't on the base\nHe didn't say I I he I think he just said if I was debating her he didn't say if I was on a debate stage which I mean again it's just a\nFraction teeny little teeny bit of wiggle room but\n[laughter] I again I I I Know more fascinated by this than you guys\nBut\nYou gotta understand there was a board meeting on this they sat down as in Elizabeth Warren enterprise and said okay we're going to do and they decided okay we're in thinking about how hard that is because you\nAlways when you decide on something but you can't know the unknown but when the unknown is Trump you really can't know it well and\nShe's a ... again you're looking at it like Trump is her only thing her and it and maybe in the long run it is right now it's too you know get this this off of her back in again to neutralize that question when it comes to the next upcoming debates and some of\nThese other issues in the short term this is a neutral as Asian for her in the long term I think she sees this AS number one very first thing she did was okay now pony up your million bucks so now she's going to go after him over that over and over and over and she's got a hammer that over and over [noise]\nYou know and and she's testing the waters but in the short term she did probably I don't know because we weren't in that board meaning that she did accomplish what she hoped which was to neutralize the question for now\nIn the short term\nI just I don't think the general public really cares about this I think this is an issue that is like the Fox news vacation of you know they're going to make it a big deal and if your Fox News person you're going to care the general public I don't think\nThey care I think the public doesn't know what most of the nation doesn't know what's behind this they think she said she was Native American he says she's Pocahontas and she's not and so it looks like the two of them are just battling this issue out\nYou know if she was to really run for president and I do think that's what she's trying to figure out here and then it becomes a little clearer as to why this was an issue and they dig into that I think that will become a bigger issue for the general population\nI have to prove that right like if if they do today as everyone knew suggesting is they're going to admit that this happened that way then they're going to have to produce the body right\nWell I think they're going to try to say that they buried him because\nYou know but you're going to do his fame and his family gets it right from even then even there like they don't get to decide that\n[laughter] you know again I don't think his body exists 'cause I think he's been put to her grinder\n... was so rude some but it's it's true\nWasn't there there was a reason that we never got to see bin Laden's body right that's like an Islam thing I Believe is it that have to be buried immediately or something yes I Would\nSay they're going to stay for religious purposes they have disposed of his body but like you said the question is well then dig it up show me where you disposed of it because for religious purposes would not mean put put the body through a grinder\nLook this was interesting because it's right out of Hollywood right it is something has happened this is Michael clayton where you get the call\nOkay we got a big problem here and we have men George Clooney watches okay here's strange things are going to right now give me your phones yeah you upstairs shower give me your clothes and you know they do this thing yeah do you saw you whether you\nBelieve this is what was going on yesterday about use other cleaners going in there where they're going in there because of this or was it was something else\nThat matter the fact is forever going to be that they went in there to re scrub the walls again and\nThey were going to make sure that everything was going before ... or the Turks\nGo in there and so if there's\nThe old line used to be in like in this country and have you know what I mean if there's nobody there is no crime all year if there's no evidence right you're going to have to break the story we put forth in the story that we think is going to be the best that makes us go away\nEventually is that this was not supposed to happen and it certainly wasn't supposed to happen like this and we feel awful about it and some other people are going to eat this now there's going to be punishment and then I'm going to be pretty and it's going to go away and my guess is it is going to go away\n... ... that's why he's there how do we do this what is the story let's make sure we know exactly what we're going to say and how we're going to deal with it\nI mean is there anything this is gonna be the start of an international movement incident you know screening of relationships and the and I know they said ... who can he gets\nTo now decide whether you go on and now we're going to reevaluate in his arms deal with them or whatever but\nI mean again we know full well their water fines of level in\nOur Saudi relationship isn't going to change or is it well not with here's what I said or\nI think that you're naive and I don't mean you I mean in general you're naive to think that this is the first time some kind of incident that\nThe rest of the world Americans as well would frown upon uh that the Saudis had been responsible for that we haven't cleaned up the mess because of the very complicated relationship that exists\nAnd I mean the irony about it was turkey of all places where there are what are they act like several hundred journalists in jail right and I ... that they're holding without any ... to know what's going on with them like it's kind of funny to work in the old Saudi Arabia accountable for that because turkey has ... with\nThe soil I mean the bottom line somebody said it yesterday when they called I mean there are ... they're criminals and I do believe that's probably true and we are\nI'm not going to say in bed with them but we have to deal with them as does the rest of the world and so you say to them look these kinds of things happened and I don't know what you think we're going to do about it or trying to cover for you but you can't let a guy walked by camera
