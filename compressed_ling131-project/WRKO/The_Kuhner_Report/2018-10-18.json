[noise] [noise]\nSo he financial for questioning going up ... yeah and what is it the ... you can tell what the question is\nAnd then we'll let you have a [noise] a Charlie bigger seemed a waiver last night on who he was voting for on the warring Baker the wind deal racism\nWhich Baker do you believe the debate\nCharlie Baker who said he hadn't yet made up his mind or the post debate Baker who said he's voting for deal\nIs that he misspoke and that he's in order for Dale [noise] so you have to hear this this was their second a televised\nDebate last night Charlie Baker or was there a against ... and this was the exchange or that had everybody scratching their head\nGirl for Tara polio and I'm going to um [noise] vote for a series of other candidates as well I don't know what I'm going to do younger speck of that one I don't know if you vote for the guardian endorsed Minnesota\nSo you're asking people in Massachusetts to vote for Jeff deal and you're not even going to vote for him\nI said I was going to support the ticket and I do but you may not vote for the ticket hoping that decision eventually I'll make sure people know\nI I Can't I Everytime I hear it I Can't believe it I cannot believe he said that well we have to follow it up with after\nIt was over a than Charlie is asked in an interview about it again and his response\nTo that was um I actually I misspoke yes I'm going to vote for Jeff deal\nThat's where the whole thing went off the well the whole thing went off the rails for me I I don't know what in the world he was thinking there but uh he flipped flopped at the end I don't I don't know what's worse\n\nUm rewarding question but what do you think Charlie bakers true feelings are in regards to the Warren bakeries I\nIt's I mean I keep saying that the Warren deal race I think he's undecided I think he and I think he might blank the damn thing I think it'd be blind to the Trump claimed race and I don't know how you can blend that race but it can blanket ... is it possible you blank on this wouldn't do\nWell he's got a problem with Jeff deal and he he did make this very clear a and this this was also part of this exchange during the course of this debate is he ... he has come out and he has endorsed Jeff deal but he and Jeff deal don't agree\nOn a lot of subjects that are very important to Charlie oh social issues\nPro choice gay marriage\nHe said these are issues that they don't agree on and this is why he said last night you know he has to think this through but my question fraternity would be well governor then why did you say you endorsed him why are you telling them you know people of the state to vote for him\nAnd yet you're not sure if you want to vote for him because you don't agree with him\nAnd these aren't surprises to the governor Jeff deal has always stood in the same place\nOne of the things that happens on ... once you start to be too clever by half than you are too clever by half and this is one of those where\nI Am so consciously trying to walk this line that I've got for myself that I have to be as Democrat as a Republican can possibly be that sometimes you will out thinking and you know I think it when either\nYou are genuinely not sure or you'll I Would think it when you're comfortable and we know he's up thirty something percent in this race in you know we know that everybody thinks it might think anyway it's still a foregone conclusion that he's going to win the thing\nBut you'll I think it'd be given those second debates sometimes after you've had the first one and it's gone just fine you're just not you didn't prep is hard for the second one because you know you got this and then he totally got caught that he was being to\nClimate yeah Jim that's what you sort of said before he said he just didn't think this through because I didn't even worried about it\nIn his mind both races or foregone conclusions why would anyone asked me who I'm voting for that Senate race we all know I'm going to win we'll know she's going to win let's move on\n\nWell they did what he meant and that's ... that's awful\nYeah and that's that it is that any any and I believe and everybody on this station knows that I'm a Charlie Baker supporter but I Believe Charlie I I Would believe Charlie to be smarter\nThan to just assume that that would never come up so you are going to vote for Jeff deal a guy you've indoors but you don't have a lot of the same\nPositions and stances with when it comes to social issues I mean he had to have known that was eventually going to be asked and it it was almost as if he didn't have any answer for it I'm just really really surprised by that [noise]\nBut I'm going to be one of those types I'm going to be one of those people that vote for a dollar\nAnd you're going to vote for Gonzales because you know in the back of your mind that Charlie Baker still going to win\n[noise] it's got to be very close I think but uh I think of a lot of us that they like like I Do and do that so um yeah\nIt's a I don't know ... as soon as an economic regions of the day idea here is that\nYou don't care if Charlie wins but you would like Charlie to lose and much more important to you is that so you're\nVoting for the other guy but you don't care you can't stand that it's going to raise your taxes and it's going to spend money but I get it look at some point it does come a point would you like it's enough already this happened when Trump a number of for for women they all had to look in the mirror and say well what point do conservative women at what point do I say I can't do this\nThis was a humongous blunder last night it is what he said when you're a nickname is Charlie Baker and then you say\nThis last night and then right after you say you misspoke\nYeah but I don't understand I I don't understand that protest vote idea except that I think that people like a rich you say I'm In it it's going to be a protest vote because he knows in the back of his mind that Governor Baker is gonna win if he thought the Jacob Dallas had a chance of winning I don't think he'd vote that I think you know I think he just wouldn't vote\nIf he was Joe mansion and look it's huge oh you're going to be the deciding vote she would probably walk up and say Gonzales when you look right a Baker when he did it just to make sure that Baker knew why he was doing I don't think there are a lot of those guys\nOh and I think I think people then then I think you've forgotten what the state can be\nOkay but they are ... and boy that I knew somebody off and there\nI don't hear anything else and what Baker did last night his\nMind boggling I don't know how a seasoned veteran like that could make that kind of mistake that that was crazy and people aren't going to forget that let me go to Paul Paul's and rain I'm going to call\nMorning Jim I Can't believe that you would be given Joe hard times um after the last presidential election I ate however I don't agree with Joe I Am now\nI agree with Joe sentiment I agree that I Would love to hold Charlie makers had underwater Tilly woke up but that we have the opportunity to do well I have a choice to do is vote for somebody who is off all governor\nOr somebody who would be worse as governor and those are my choice so I Love all our local work every time but\nI got to say every time I have an opportunity to talk about Charlie Baker is going to be derogatory he is awful and he has I mean he's really a Democrat in the other guy's not going to raise taxes much more than Charlie\nCharlie hasn't stood up hardly at all you didn't stand up for my daughter not having to worry about whether the gym is going to go in the bathroom in school\n... or or anybody at any minute you're just a new solid yeah\nWhy would I be in your daughter's bathroom yeah Paul because you because anybody can be an anyways bathroom now Charlie did what is your night he said he made some sort of comment up front that said yeah I'm not sure I like this and then the second there was any sort of push back he ran back away from it and then immediately did not believe me still\nKind of thing why does he do I mean this whole thing about oh buddy\nCharlie hasn't done anything to stand up for conservative principles heart any and the only time he even comes out and says anything is winning know that it is pointless like the pay rate once they had the veto proof majority maybe it was like\nOh you know this is terrible I'm thinking about maybe vetoing it really Charlie\nHatch what you got that short big hit it now you might be something that the meat don't mean nothing\nI'm Sorry but he is he's been he's been awful and you don't want the thing is I Can't imagine somebody question somebody like the previous caller was saying I'm going to vote the other way or vote or\nIt might vote at all that's where you where you are wrong with me because I liked your\nI voted for somebody else I did not vote for her\nAnd that's what I don't understand that he says I'm going to vote for Jay Gonzales really why why would you vote for Jay Gonzales if you're a conservative just don't again or I don't I'm I'm In but don't get why would you vote for Jay 'cause I didn't vote for Hillary Clinton\nAnd I wouldn't I wouldn't it and I didn't vote for Donald Trump but I didn't vote for Hillary Clinton\nAnd I don't understand I don't understand that concept of well I'll show you Charlie Baker I'll vote for Jay Gonzales now I Would I wouldn't do that may not\nLike we need to send a message to the Republican Party and the state that we're done with and the thing is I've had to start donating my money not in Massachusetts\nUm other than directly to a kid you know to a candidate because I don't want a nickel of my money going to Charlie other than what he already out of my paycheck\nUm and that's just the way that that has to go I don't I don't have any other choice other than to be used as adamant that that that we're clearly not at his side\nPoint a lot I mean to sound like I'm Carrying bakers water here I'm not I'm Still gonna vote for Charlie but Charlie has disappointed me periodically this was a big one last night\nJust because it's so it's so unnecessary Charlie has one issue right because all this is one issue they can get them on deals shrimp and you are voting print this come out of\nIf you're driving because this was the only thing he said the in the first debate and you not only do you not have an answer but you have a worse answer now I agree I Can't it's mind boggling to me but Paul ultimately what\nYou're gonna say you said oh look he's not going to raise taxes much more well here in theory ... if you watch the whole debate and I don't know why you would frankly but I just

have it on and that is we're not getting a conservative governor governor anymore I mean I think the bill well they have out there not coming back\nThe best we can hope for is Charlie Baker I mean I I

Trump to do something crazy today and what's just spent all conversation on it but\nI mean we're we're going to go crazy on this and I'm I'm certainly upset about it but I Do does it make much difference I mean ... just to get him quickly into like the deans right now\nBut it is it going to happen this Charlie favorability go down really\nNo I don't think so [noise] I don't think so because I think that part of it and Jim is said this that you know a lot of people on the television or if they were watching the televised version of this\nThey like what Charlie said they don't they don't necessarily want him to be in bed with Jeff deal\nAnd then the fact that he changed that\nAfter word may not be as widely reported as what he said during the debate itself\nSo\nIt it may not bode well and I are both uh negatively for him I think I mean I feel bad saying because I like Jeff but I think the biggest advantage Charlie has and this is that a lot of people don't know who Jeff deal deal is he doesn't have great name recognition in the state so they don't really know\nWhat level of Republican he is\nSo for people who don't know Jeff and they hear the governor say well I'll support the ticket I don't know specifically but like they don't look at it and go oh he's supporting a Trump Card 'cause they don't know\nI think at the end of the day he like just biggest issues name recognition and if\nPeople don't know what who do who truly is talking about they don't care like in the middle ... let me go to a Mike the morning\nYou don't want to you guys are you doing good [noise]\nUm I'm so tired of Charlie I really am is sent it to me on the attitude\nAnd it just it it is regard for us the Republican\nThis big you know we do have some good hard worker the Republican Jeff ill is wonderful show and you're right it doesn't have the name recognition that he should stay I Would have been more than happy Sean O'Connell is running but I think she got more pull than Jeff ill does but you know we do as a Republican and this\nIs a sheep democratic state of Massachusetts it just makes me ill\nThat we can't find leadership in our own government that's what our ...\nSupport the people that that are running or try to change the ... it makes me sick it really does I'm going to go to the polls and I'm not critical for trolley and I'm not going to vote or dollars will just leave a blank I would've Scott Lively supporter\nAnd I wish you had one and a very you know Charlie better watch it as a referendum on it and it's all on him\nWell be careful because if you had a referendum on him and then he wins by twenty evolving that referendum completely validates may not certain that seems to be what's gonna happen\nIt's kind of an ... and I'd rather have Charlie in charge and Jacob dog that was really I don't want to go a year and I don't want to be although the socialist policies you what did\nYou know I definitely will take Charlie the lesser of two evils but I'm going to obey knows well he's governor and the and I'm just so law when he when he does something stupid like\nHe's got to come in and we got to have money walk him he's right there when I was coming number two what how we said a lot of a couple of weeks ago but it is absolutely proven to be true right which is that if Charlie had a real opponent\nKnow knocking Jake and tell us but it certainly to the more he was running more hughley would be winning right now\nAfter ... ... yeah probably ... I think that's a hundred percent really lucky yeah that it's J. Gonzales that he's running against because if I hold up a picture of Jay Gonzales to the first Fifteen people that walk by our building that I most of them would go\nI think I just saw that guy yeah does he the guy that I got my ... and they don't know who that let's be honest we were having a conversation about the man while he was sitting across the window from us last week and we didn't know if the whining wanting to know right now if he just sat in but she does know who did just sit down oh\nI see the bad guys when you walk down a little a little cage here the ... you know are are All right ...\nAt my going bald for just one day in October Nineteen you can show the world but there's so much more to their story and raise money for cancer charity sign up today at ... ... or ... ... dot org\nGame and maybe Boston morning show that you are [laughter]\n[noise]\nGenerally\nFinancial off they get back to the always great because you want to ...

I don't I just don't think the key to me\nI think it he ah I think he's a leave it blank\nHave not sure I Believe I blanketing I don't think I don't know that he'd ever admit it but I could see him voting for her yeah I could do oh who couldn't I think you are I think he works well with all the Democrats that are he works well with a I mean\nBecause the only reason I say that I don't think he would vote for her because why did he endorsed him\nBecause he didn't want ... Republican convention and there there was a little ... there was an issue as to whether lively was going to get a certain amount and when he didn't Charles sometimes you're in a room of\nPeople and they want you to say something and you do it but when you do it and then there's cameras on you and people remember that's a different thing and Charlie didn't realize at as grand but when\nYou do it and there's cameras on you then ... ... there's\nAlso something to be said for national Republicans saying hey Mr Baker you're really popular in Massachusetts have you ever want to run for anything other than governor Massachusetts You're going to need our help and you need to get on board\nWhat do you think Charlie family is I can you guys are okay but what what was the calculation last night even because it just wasn't necessary\nAgain he can say whatever you want to thirty points up and if he needs to say whatever it is that he needs to say to appease the Republican National party why didn't they just do it and then vote for whoever whomever he feels like I just to me it just isn't\nThe whole thing doesn't jive I don't understand what happened there\nAnd being thirty points up is because he hasn't given the Democrats in the state or reason not to vote for him\nHe wouldn't have ... ... ... ... okay but before last night Democrats in this state assumed he was voting for Jeff deal the night I didn't\nYou didn't because ... when he endorsed him that immediately was going to that was what he was saying I mean I think it's more shocking that he said last night actually I don't know what I'm going to do he was thirty points up and he had already in\nThe fall of the ... and what has changed since the time that you endorsed him to now the now undecided when you weren't then because nothing has happened to Elizabeth Warren did resolve a DNA test and the results were went there were like what what does that adage in changing of the ...\nBut what does your I mean the the question really is what is Charlie if you could look into Charlie so right now what is Charlie consider himself\nDeep down is he a Republican be a Democrat or the undecided\nWell I think he's a I think he's a fiscal I think\nThe hair of it even I think he that he is socially\nA liberal more liberal it's hard to call them fiscally conservative funniest governors record I mean there's nothing conservative about any of it\nWell more fiscally conservative is when I said I ... I was so good at it that doesn't make him any more than probably\nYour average Democrat or met keeping in mind that he is in a very democratic state\nBut one more assess whether he thinks deep down that he's a Republican\nOh now these people think that there how could how could he yeah I'm Sorry I I I got distracted you missed that they think they're under the impression that they're [laughter] although the Patriot\nThat I got to come down here cuts sometimes you just gotta let us know ... let me tell you let me go to Colleen she's in North Andover morning Colleen\nMorning\nUm I find myself very rarely agreeing with Jim but I think Jim is right it you know the Democrats are really holding it for Charlie I work Charlie can't you can't do that when he lost and the one that why and when I heard him\nI I guess you could only call it alone during\nLike allowing them to win a quote you played earlier with in the debate I felt\nI felt like I I had been betrayed by a friend that you can't do it yet ... may I and I think there is more to it I think that somehow tied to his side and I think it's got the goods on it and I think they're telling him that often get in\nAnd out of work that we're in a stack and he he I guess that I\nMean they just had something about it I think Charlie lost his all he is not that man I met and that I really was the real\nTo work for his not the same person I probably will vote for him because he is a ... about the lesser of two evils but I Am so disappointed terribly disappointed [noise]\nYeah so I don't buy into the conspiracy theory a for for me one to ... there may be more to the story I don't for whatever reason I don't think Charlie loves Jeff and I don't think these guys are the best of friends but I Can't for the life of me figure out why Charlie's having such trouble with is\nThree I don't think Charlie's losses soul\nI Know Charlie I like Charlie Charlie is a good guy I think Charlie's on okay governor ... we do get carried away with\nThis stuff I think we made a huge mistake here I'm positive the Charlie knows he made a huge mistake here but I think Charlie\nCharlie really likes being governor and he's trying to make sure that he stays as governor and he's trying to take the path of least resistance on the thing about ... and he he literally got too clever by half he just made a huge blunder\nBecause it happens in this one did happen and now he's going to have to figure out how to undo it and there's how could you ever believe anything he says about that race and or Jeff at this point can't\nSo he'll try and he'll look I'm for it right I don't really believe that and I'd like to I'd like\nTo be able to um help together out on this one but I did when I Can't because he has left me a bit baffled I just I'm not sure GM\nSyria's number one thing that you know again what I'm looking for with these guys and Charlie ... part of gyms theory talking about well won the the theory that you know Dems love this and you've got to be very careful well why doesn't truly just say you know what I'm retracting mind or some of them because that would play a huge with dams wouldn't ... does he still has to tow the line to some extent for the party I don't know why\nThey did that again I go back to you know he he didn't he didn't have to say that all he was up thirty thirty percent before there he ever sat down at GBH last night right\nAnd his other ... and the only thing the only possible thing I have to attack him on his tongue into Donald Trump which in this state is telling him to Jeff deal\nAnd his response to that would be exactly what he hit the rest of his response short of Jeff deal was which was I've been very clear about my position on different policies I've been very clear about my position on the president and I've been very clear in my position on other because they were asking about other issues [noise]\nAnd I'm going to vote the ticket variants [noise]\nYeah so it's time for

stadium because everyone was like there are forty points and it's freezing and snowing in October Eighteen were there was no one in that second half\nI remember vividly leaving at halftime and watching the fourth quarter from my living room sure\nOkay that's the most clear example of the time when a professional teams were not plant but yeah I did want to read part of that now and that team and they just said when I plan\n... but it was a bit I remember because it was pouring rain for six hours before that game started so everyone was so and then it turned to snow right as the games started or how you're drenched and all of a sudden you're freezing\nAnd then there are so far up it that's a reason to go home that's when you say to yourself can I trade this ticket in for a better

being Christian belles that the animals in the jungle book do really talk either\n[laughter] but no they do in that world then that's fine I however while they're talking let's evaluate some of the things they're doing like I just don't I just I don't understand this concept that all that you you're not supposed to talk about what you're reading with your kids that's the opposite lesson of what is supposed to be going off\nI just read this book not question anything and go boy that's awesome and losing wouldn't it be great if we lived on ... that's the dumbest thing I ever heard well he cups of\n... that you know what my response to that is that we don't have to take everything to the level you know if it's a three year old why you know the Christian bell is apparently taking this was that you can talk about it but the whole idea of\nDon't you think it's strange this is her words strange that he walks up and he kisses her and he doesn't get permission and you're taking that into a whole\nIf you're a little girl you know now [laughter] 'cause he saved her as he woke up I mean it just went on to say that that's the conversation like everything's not an attack\nWhen someone says to me don't you probably right everything is in Iraq what am I on line with it that's the whole point everything isn't an attack it's not you know not everything has to be it's it's make believe it does everything doesn't have to be analyzed in today's society of\nYou know to me too movement which is what where she is with this plan isn't bright and good morning Glenn\nI Love this conversation I mean your corner Kim was telling your producer by the way I wanted to see maybe a question in a minute but this week conservative civil libertarians have a saying for ... you know there's a Democrat out there a person with Joel Brenner\nThat wants to ban this thing that would be the next step either from the library of put like uncle Tom's cabin in Huck Finn Huckleberry Finn I mean you know I'll bet you watch any way in the world any restaurant you want over this\nFine but so what\nWell try it and they won't or you'll keep it in your house and others won't but that's fine well my\nQuestion the UVB is what's gonna happen five years from now ten years when your daughter says you know my girlfriend's dad didn't censor the part about the guns then you're going to have to explain why you thought you were protecting us I mean I don't care I mean you're right we have a right to raise a kid as a way you want to get me wrong I'm just saying I'm just curious how you're going to handle that\nI'll handle it then when that comes up but I'm\nNot only going to war I Need to have that happened or I'm what I'm reading that particular book Dr seuss of the easiest one for me there is some doctors are books that I absolutely love and we read them and there's some doctors whose books I don't read it all and then there's some where are we do sort of this thing where we ask questions about it\nI think the Grinch is coming back in a couple of weeks the new Grinch movie which I think it's terrible but that's just me\nBut I've had these conversations and my daughter about that book and I've asked them with my son why is he whipping that dog and why is he so mean to that dog and they've asked me and we've started that conversation\nOh he's just the Grinch and he's not that mean to that dog he also feeds him and he takes care of them you just don't see it and that's how we do that thing but I liked that they're asking those questions I like that they're thinking well\nThey are and you're right and that's different and she's also six and that's different this is a three year old and she is claiming that she says to them\nDon't you think it's strange don't you think it's weird that their prints kisses no white without her permission because you can kiss someone if they're sleeping\nWell again I don't you just you just said your daughter when they come to and they go hey why kissing Snow White when she didn't say it was cool okay then you talk about it she's taking\nInstead of just having a a a lovely little fairy tale that you know once upon a time as I said once upon a time she's turning it into a political let's talk about this and let's turn this into something three I think there's a big difference I really do\nOkay but I don't I the Grinch is a burger example like if you were the ... would you take him in like they do I wouldn't I'd be like no there's the stocks put your adamant we're gonna throw some stuff that you liked my first call I don't mind waiting these\nBut my first question that that's the case would be well what is the Grinch 'cause I've never seen one that has and we know are these people who have all these crazy things on their head I mean why do they only won Grinch\nMake ... I mean look I yes and so sometimes the answer to these discussions is\nBecause that's what the author wanted you to know and that's all he wanted you know and that's okay it's not combat it's instructive it's educational and its let's kick these things around and maybe sometimes you are right or maybe I'm right maybe you go too far maybe I'd go too far but it's okay to evaluate these things\nI I agree with that I I think ... is a little more combat though because if if we are to believe the story that has been told to us she wants us all to know that when she read this she immediately said to them they didn't ask her they didn't find it strange she was the one who who plant that I\nDid at some point if this is gonna be like something\nThat is still part of the fabric of society it was written at a time when you yes we were all encouraging women to wait for that guy to come sweep you off your feet and take you off to never never land\nAnd live happily ever after well we are teaching our kids now that maybe there's another way which is that you can just take yourself there and you don't need the guy or the girl or what or acts\nAnd that's okay and so if she thinks it at three and you think it at nine well that's for the individual to do I just want people to evaluate stuff and if she's doing it a little too early for your liking okay but what what age is that okay that that they have that discussion for me with the Grinch\nIt's a three 'cause my kids love that story and these things come up and my seven year olds and stuff to my three year old now four year old and so we talk about it\nMy God you're the guy that told me that uncle Remus rides going to stay open forever at Disney like okay sure but I don't mind it closes either because I was a terrible ride like it's okay to evaluate these things it's okay to evaluate them over time\nAnd it's okay to discuss some too and it's okay to not love 'em as much as other people um like we all don't have\nTo be the same and we can all look at them a little bit differently and we can all kick 'em around\nThey're not ... not for this generation anyway\nAnd if they do is find there's a million ... million fairy tales so it's okay\nI did put up to ... just mhm and for a Steven Boston to use the exact phrase but your thoughts on Christian Bale under Snow White views a she's a pompous asked I Believe that's what he called her [laughter] maybe she's a good parent which is what I've called her Seventy five percent early just put up two minutes ago Seventy five percent of ...\nAnd I was er most people think that she is but I'm not I just I don't know I'm not so sure why it's so pompous\n[noise] well I for me it's it's [noise] I\nDon't I just I don't I'm not a real believer in a grandstanding you want to teach your kids or whatever you want to teach them you do that because you're a good parent you know I'm just not one who would go to ... magazine and make some kind of big statement like that and\nWhy is all ... doesn't it though awful when in doubt to only one that's the first lesson that it teaches you go hide we don't teach that the people anymore\nWell I understand that but again you know that's just there's if we take a moment and we look at all if you wanted to take a moment and look at every Disney movie that was ever made to this day\nThere are issues and there are political statements\nBeing made and there's there they can be problematic and I'm not saying that I think people shouldn't question things it's it's in it's the fact that Christian bell\nHad to tell people magazine that she asked her three year old's not whether they thought it was strange that seven or nine or whatever little men lived in the woods together\nBut whether it was strange that a man kissed a woman a man by the way as I said earlier who was in a relationship with a woman and she had made that quite clear\nIf he if she thought that was strange and then she had to go to I mean ... if you want to have those discussions are your kids are talking about that stuff I'm I of course you talk about it of course you do it is that those are the foundations of where kids learn lessons\nBut it's just that it's the whole premise of Christian bell going to parenting magazine and trying to make some big deal out of the prince kissing Snow White turning that into some kind of assault on winning\nAgain but it's just one thing that it's always it's always interesting to see what becomes part of the fabric of society and one thing we all do this with Disney really why why is that our Bambi start\nAlmost you just said it all of Disney stuff has something to you like one so why is that and why are we just accepting of that and why can't we do better than that because\nQuite frankly it's because I think their purpose would be exactly as I said they making a fairy tale by\nFairy tales also aren't real and there are bad things that happened and so they put them in a fairy tale like atmosphere\nBut bad things happen and that sort of I think how Disney has approached every single solitary\nBut if we agree that every lesson in Snow White is terrible except\nFor the end which isn't even ... which is what she's or again\nThe first lesson is the second that someone comes after you you run from\nThem and you hide I don't know that doesn't seem very empowering in twenty eight team maybe it was a Nineteen fifty but it's not now that that's one lesson\nTo is you know\nIf some strangers shows up out of nowhere and says does your dog you haven't had an apple\nIn a while sure I'll I'll have a bite of that why not that makes no sense like you just go through it everything\nRudolph is another one of these wipe my son's in Snow White that are not negative summer and I love which exists between ... and ... and Snow White and\nBetween the ... and you know I mean you can go on and on I mean they're they're\nThe decisions to take her and I find very odd I'm not kidding it said what are they doing here don't you find it odd that they ah\nSome of them are dopey and some of them are ... and ... I mean all of it is it again you can't I Love ... I Love Rudolph the red nosed reindeer we\nOf all sorts of Rudolph stuff in our house my kids have dressed as Rudolf we played Rudolf we sing Rudolf ...\nWas a horrible story really when you look at it and each character makes really bad decisions it's but it is on the air in treating them badly that's among other things right but so we discuss these things\nAnd we kick them around and then I don't say we're going to burn all real sports are we going to ban that from our house\nWhich is kicking around that's all it's not an aggressive thing it's just so we're talking about this that's all\nI understand that nobody said that's the problem the issue is not kicking it around it that she is turning it and she turned that into\nA again this whole knee to thing she didn't say she just kicked it around because things aren't as she kicked specifically around and then was so proud couldn't get to parenting magazine fast enough to tell him and I said\nTo my daughter who are three and five\nBy isn't it hurt or how many is a fair one where I don't you ... when when you ever tell your kids it's three five seven nine I wouldn't\nTell them anything they didn't she says she told them they didn't ask her I Know she's she's turning it and then she can't get out there fast enough to make that a political statement that's where my problem with it\nWhy would it ever be okay to have kids thinking that you can just somebody just because you want to catch them\nLike you do you know the story [laughter]\nThat is in the story that's in fact she's she's she's presenting it as a false uh that isn't even with the story they are in love\nThey are in love she's in love with him they have a love story going on throughout that entire thing he comes out to find or because he's in love with her and he can't find her she's hoping he comes\nBy the time he gets there she's what he thinks his dad he kisses her one last time and he brings her back to life if you're not\nReally that's why I'm going to keep bringing it [laughter] I Know but I'm here but it's nice to have that conversation you guys think this is\nIt's awful story that she's presenting it as as if this woman was laying on laying there and some stranger walked up and decided hey Alex like a good look and chicken out kiss her that's not what the story is so again I just think it's a it's silly it's even to lead to be having the conversation it's a fairy tale\nAnd she's trying to turn it into something else and that's I just don't get that but that's again I wouldn't even be questioning this cause that's her business except that she ran to parenting magazine to make it out when she was some kind of hero for the women's movement because she said this two or three and\nFive year old\nAbout a story that isn't it's not even really it's not right she did she read the whole story look\nI'm with you on this that is the story and that's why I like it and that's why I'm Still reading that to my job\nI I'm all for okay with evaluating its so sometimes when these so called do gooders or passes\nI'm times when they make a point rather than just yelling at him and go you suck you're a ... All right let's kick does around for a minute and then do what you just did kind of ... [laughter] you not understand the concept here do not understand what's going on here this is what's going on just so we're clear on this and if you still find a fence at the end of that well I guess we're just gonna have to disagree on this\nBut I just I'm happy to do that with her much more than I Am do you ... [laughter] well look I have a lot of I don't even rose I actually got a lighter\nI I think she's you know fine but I just think this is this makes this thing that I just winning I Can't see this\nOver and over again there is a reason for the me too movement it's out there it exists I don't get ... dream did get loosely militant in these kinds of ways to make women like me go stop it\nAnd to make a whole lot of men go what are you doing you just make us look\nBad like we've done is our whole lives I remember as a kid talking about Huck Finn and or Tom Sawyer and go on the guy is tricking the guy into doing his chores right like why is that cool or were you up where we download that order like I have that conversation with my mother like this is what you're supposed to do with books\nI thought [noise] nah\nI'm Still waiting for cat in that show up at my house on a rainy day and I don't know what the heck is going on\nSome issues that are that they're going to do what I understand it and a dog and a cowboy hat because I have one of those ...\n[laughter] it's a fifty dollar do you are down\nA little boy so Boston New York about one hundred point seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise] more trouble USA Gymnastics morning ...\nW.

looking for me mhm so something was up he knew something in the the scary thing is if I'm the fiance are on the friend\nI'd be very nervous as well though now it'd be hard for that to happen but I'm just wondering what they know that he knew\nThis is a mystery it's a movie in ... this this isn't a plot that could be any more intriguing to me\nThat would be written by Hollywood it's just unbelievable ...\nAnd then did you see his last filed his last report or his his assistant did and it's in the paper today related to Egypt right in and you know as much more ... yes right\nIn the

and we have a pretty good handle on what it is\nA you know are we gonna know specifically what was said at the moment or what am I mean are we going to know why he\nThought he was at risk that's what I that's the question I I Would ask\nYour pretty I mean we know he'd been very critical of the crown prince we know that the crown prince doesn't like to be in most of these types of guys and every time you're the leader of a country\nThat sort of operates like that you run a risk when you take these guys on as a journalist and you can tell you a journalistic freedom and all that but these guys don't usually respond a journalist freedom a whole lot and this this brands is not in the mood at all because he's sort of\nBut why do you think he was in trouble going to that that kind of keep\nProbably felt the was always am\nIf he you know unless he told his fiance is going there for this reason and he wasn't yeah they're they're maybe they're giving out of all of that where I\nGot to come to some sort of agreement these columns aren't helping what I mean let's let's meet will meet here on safe ground\nAre safer ground and he's like yeah I don't know how safe is but I doubt that

back in ... you know people do do this stuff and maybe it was something along those\nLines so let me ask you the other the other question I Would have for people is how many of these Fifteen just

huh\n[laughter] 'cause I D D I mean I don't know any that we don't know any of the details of this car accident but isn't it strange that already one of these Fifteen has dies or accident\nShirt is [laughter] I mean that's suspect oh\nThis is it's\nLike we've already moved I I I think we've already come to terms with the key questions here which is where what anybody's going to do about this and the answer is not much right and so we're number on that level so now we're watching it for them the movie and I ... yeah mhm I Hope I'm wrong I Hope there is something big that comes\nAs a result of

all ... and this case I think he's just doing would come to natural which is when in doubt let's go back right back there and say huge crisis and I'm going to kick some ass fair and everybody goes yeah\nYeah but he's gone from the flu an honest with you into the who in ... years now he's the greatest hits some stage because she didn't have any new material\nLuck I'd that's hard to argue right now I'd that is how I read this one yes\nWell he doesn't have any new material because that material hasn't been fulfilled yet right at that have been taken care of any would\nSo you know how does President Trump won Colin Kaepernick on an NFL team\n[laughter] think about it I guess you probably right how badly does he ... he might call craft and be like hey dummy assault pick 'em up [laughter] ah Dennis\nIs in is in Hampton New Hampshire morning Dennis I'm we're that I just had a quick comment on um\nIt would be nice if there was somebody on the show there that's never always against Trump and my other comment is on a\nWell that would be used right now I'm ...\nI'm an old are that would be you right\nNow I Do right now I I think that's why when he has to do OK okay\nIf you let me finish I think he's doing what he has to do the way the beef edited that he's turning around saying that um the people of trying to cross the Mexican border and tromp adapt in tough on them because he doesn't want to do anything in Saudi Arabia or not tough you\nKnow uh it's almost seems like Monday quarterback and you know what I mean it's a tough situation that's going on in Saudi Arabia\nAnd it's also a tough situation that goes on in the border and what you're supposed to do he's not supposed to act yeah I mean that's been his stance the whole time is to say that he's going to stop anything that goes on there until I lead is doing why she can make some type of by\nYou know laws were where it's not just this craziness they wouldn't be coming if they didn't think\nThey could slip and somehow I Know they would stop the last time but this has to be something done where they just can't answer and then they go off on their own\nI agree Dennis that's why I told you last time I looked it doesn't bother me if he wants to put troops on the board of ed that works totally fine for me and yes there is an issue however I mean you must see done is that he's not being as tough as he could be with Saudi Arabia right\nAnd he is getting plenty of criticism for that\nPeople keep asking why are we involved at all one to why do you keep giving them cover and keep saying things like roads killers and while they've told me knowing if such tape even exist when other people have said they've heard the tape that that have credibility why does he keep giving them that ... that kind of cover and yet in this case\nLike Mexico for example they cover that these guys aren't from Mexico but your rip and Mexico and you're threatening them in your threatening them with military and was first strings but you're not doing either of those to Saudi Arabia\nBut I I think I think that the reason is pretty clear out the president money money money money money money money president does not threaten anybody who he thinks is an economic force\nAnd can have any kind of influence in our economy he's not worried about Mexico he thinks and he's right Mexico needs a whole lot more than we need them and we didn't care\nThese people aren't coming here because they think they can slip in here legally they're coming here because we have the legal framework for them to petition for amnesty\nYeah and that and what they knew how to do is they're not coming here and trying to sneak past us but I mean we can all 'cause you don't pass with there's four thousand of them coming right they're they're taking the chance that that their story will grab get them rented amnesty and some of them are and if they turn around and go back like they did last year some of them are going to\nStay in Mexico and some of them are going to keep moving this direction and hopes that that's what what ultimately happened I wanted to go to Adam Adam is in a north Andover a whole by your Adam ...\nGood morning talk with you you do do a couple of things\nTake it acts and again the Caribbean and then not taken action in Saudi Arabia I think that's a little misleading um I think there was a\nA lot of news out there already within the best Asian has just started I think there's some anonymous sources from the New York times that are reporting on their Saudi Arabia and if you look at all the players and the situation turkey Saudi Arabia who the truck more in this situation I don't I don't trust either will tell you the truth\nI'm secular off we've got a caravan that's taking handouts a at multiple checkpoints along the way up north which\nJust happens to be a or should it ride rate in time for election that doesn't seem like too much going so that they um it's just that all sounds a little fishy I I I don't understand why you would take action in Saudi Arabia when there's very little information known and\nThat got fishing to where I Am to me if you're doing this right before the election the one that does benefits is the guy who won primarily because of this in the last election which would be the Republican this issue number one or two for Republicans is this issue ten or\nTwelve for Democrats mhm yeah I mean I don't know how you know I'm a graduate think this is a good idea let's do this caravan right before the election and\nThis is going to help us at the polls I don't know why that would be the case\nI think it's a just struck a a distraction I think it's a disruption it it's a taken full\nBut Adam ... distraction India over of the president because again that this this is what he phrased what people live with that\nJust don't want a distraction right now they want to be on point on right now that distraction doesn't help them\nBut I Do want to say one thing at I'm I'm with you on the president and Saudi Arabia I I think he's not saying very much because I think first off I think he knows more than what he's saying that I think this is so this is a very complicated one I don't know what people want the president to do ... they're they're going to have to\nYou know there's going to have to be more evidence brought forward that he can bring forward when this investigation is finished here said if there's an issue here he's going to address it but he wants the investigation to be finished\nNow much more complicated thing I I this is one of those that I really have to give he Andy administration a break in that this is something every administration has dealt with in some way that most of us don't want to see the sausage being being made\nYou know we don't really want to know what's going on with Saudi Arabia completely because if we did we would be very unhappy about it\nUh I I think there's a lot going on but and Saudi Arabia and in Turkey as well for that matter", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Kuhner Report", "city": "Boston", "day": "18"}
