Saturday what I Walk a press conference I remembered thankfully thing there is no place for anti Semitism in this country\nI'm paraphrasing but ... there's a liberal route by the watch true good now a bad mouthing the caravan and and the ... a so called ... I mean yeah you know\nIf if the guy from the synagogue or temple wants him to come there and I think he's got the final word I really do\nAnd as far as Trump and his support for Israel there have been any president since ... given Israel will support the president and unfortunately a liberal Jewish people\nDidn't it doesn't matter to them so you know here we are at this point in in this country\nAnd a\nTrump doesn't play that need to get him either and and they can't handle that they're like a bunch of ... the ... thing for me the ball drop me the ball and he walked or on the ball\n... am I wrong ah no I mean I I get where you're coming from yeah that's that's true that why\nYou have to admit that he won't play their game\nYeah um I just uh my ... my thing about this time is just an e situations let's not play a game and all this is this is not I I Am a political a chess game and this is my understanding\nThat but the media is trying to make it a political chess game where they're trying to portray him that he has some sort of\nAlliance with a white nationalist he said a week or two ago that he's a match or were you know but why does that mean I hate black people does that mean I hate Jews no of course not but it's America first I'm tired of globalization\nAnd I really am and I'm One of those blue collar guy that got affected by blew up by globalization I've worked in eleventh states steel mills automobile plant paper mills powerhouses\nAnd you don't see those kinds of jobs anymore why because they want the China and Mexico\n... you got him right on pissed off and and and\nJust sit there and how liberal progressive is telling me that well if I vote for Donald Trump therefore I'm I'm sort of closet racist\nNo I'm not and and it it it it's\nJust unbelievable the social media right now that if you disagree with somebody on the immigration issue all of a sudden bang you're labeled as a racist I got thrown out of the Fox or political discussion group because I have a an opposing view\nOf a ... immigration policy for this country\nAnd they ... they started in on the well you're you're obviously a racist\nBut I have to put up a photo of my first wife who am I met thirty five years ago at my mother's house\nTom ... but anyway she was from eighty alright alright so sick of this All right well\nLet's get back to the Trump or a second let's get math Pittsburgh for a second where\nHe's not playing the media's game sure but he is also playing a game at times right like let's be clear on that like he was so quick to come out and say that he's been doing it right from the get go this is this is the media's fault the fake media's fault\nWe were doing this where it is a game it may not be the media's game is Trump's game\nAnd they're playing two different games in their use in each other for their ends the media's CNN can't stop ripping Trump six ways to Sunday right now Trump can't stop ripping them six ways to Sunday right now and this is what you're going to do so you're going to go there and he's going to say they sucked but I'm great and I'm here\nAnd that is how it's going to go\nI I felt his uh words on Saturday we're very we're very comforting to mate with regards to what had happened and we haven't had an attack on Jewish people like this I I Can't I Can't remember\nHe had some comment there about will deal with that later or whatever but otherwise\nHe just didn't say you went there he sat in a round table with the first responders then he went to the hospital and he talked to some of the families there was that image of Milan and yet at the bedside at one point and then we came back and that needs to be the blueprint\nWell this president is capable of this because believe it or not because remember that he has in the in the darkness of night going out and met caskets and bodies and families with his wife with his daughter you remember right after he got into office he did that\nAnd I mean ... and never talked about it publicly and never made a big deal of it and consult families and he can do that he's capable of that the problem is that it is a week from election day and it's Pennsylvania so I don't know if he's going to do that we'll see\nWe'll see how it all goes\nBut I'm Glad that he's going I think he should go I I I reiterate that I think the president belongs there and I think he I think he'd get more criticism if he doesn't go if he just sent millennia or he just sent it you know as long and her family\nYeah I Love my feeling on this originally was he could have just Santa Monica and at ... and I would have been fine also\nThere's just been so many of these over the last ten years that the concept of the presidential visit I think it's overplayed for me personally um and it's not the be all end all if if the president\n\nIf the president didn't go to Pittsburgh today it doesn't mean he doesn't care about Pittsburgh it doesn't mean he's a white nationalist that doesn't mean anything like it means we're really busy there's a lot of things going on and he doesn't have to be there to show that he cares\nFor me\nOthers it is a big deal and optics or everything so again Hillary didn't show up in Louisiana and I'd really earned her\nI think you would be in the minority I probably saw him to be honest I'm and I'll tell you another thing I Know that right now\nIt doesn't mean you know it doesn't mean all that much for some people but it means a lot of the people he's going to touch today\nAnd really that's what this about if you really strip out all the politics of it it means a lot to those people when he sees that rabbi and he gives him a hug and he tells him how Brady was and he sees as police officers and he goes in and talks to those people who watch their\nTheir dear friends be mowed down\nIn their place of worship that is going to mean a lot of those people and that really is what it's all about\nThe rest of it they will always remember the president came and gave them words of encouragement that's that's what he's supposed to do so\nIn in the end and it was one of these families is somehow made to feel a little bit better for the most horrific circumstances high\nRight who cares right and that's how the president you look at it and that's how his wife I'm sure does look at it and I I think that's even our von ... probably looks at this I mean it's just if if one family feels a little bit better knows that we our hearts are code going out to them then that's what it's all about [noise]\nAlright six one Seventy six six sixty eight sixty eight so uh we are going to kind of slowly but surely change gears here but you you just pointed out a new story for us that ah want you to share\nWell that I mean there's just not enough going on and I know some of you know\nGerman one now we have caravan to we have the Pittsburgh shooting we got the guy in Florida we've got elections coming up fast review a World Series parades we've got all the way we have plenty going on so the president apparently\nHas given a interview to act CEOs on HBO\nOr and more just getting dribs and drabs of it this morning one of the things he apparently is\nAnd there is that a [noise] he's very much consider actually sent out to different ... the first was said that this was definitely coming and then the second one when the clip is that he's considering it\nIn any case the story is that he is either very much considering or is in the process of doing an executive order that will and birthright citizenship [noise]\nWhat I mean by birthright citizenship I think you know but it doesn't matter how you get here or what the circumstances are if you were born on us soil your United States citizen\nHe's talking about executive ordering that to not be the case or if your parents are here illegally and you're born in this country too bad you're an illegal to\nNow my first reaction to that was I thought that was the constitutional issue\nThat was his first reaction to in the interview he actually says something like I always it was always told me that you would need a constitutional amendment but guess what you don't there's there's clearly legal debate on this\nAnd I were going to do a showdown on is my\nQuestion simply for you then we can break this down all of a more after the news break at the top of the hour but like do you want them to do this that's the Kelly bondage abortion that just gone up right now do you want the president to use an executive order and birthright citizenship [noise] my guess is that his calculation is\nI can I just can't lose being harder and harder and harder on illegal immigration for me I'll stick with the founding fathers on this one and ... birthright citizenship or I'll stay with it so I don't want 'em to want to but I fully expect that he will cause I think he's going to get a lot of good feedback on this from people that love um\nI I Do not want him to do this I don't want him to do it because [laughter] number one this is going to turn into such a battle this'll be a court battle royale um and in the end if for some reason\nThe courts would decide that he could do it\nAnd then another administration comes in and they overturn it then we're going to be in this place where we have all these people and these kids who are they American citizens are aren't they American citizens and we're going to be in just that's just going to be chaos\nSo my answer is no please don't do this [laughter] [noise] not to ... and and I'm just looking at the procedural part of it I'm not even looking at the human aspect of it I'm just looking at the procedural part of it that is a nightmare\n[laughter]\nSo that's where we are six one Seventy six six sixty eight sixty eight possibility that the president had signed an executive order that would take a weight birthright citizenship un you out where do you come down on this\nDon't you get the feeling that he has to be talked out of this and who's going to talk them out of it\nYou ain't going in and he calls him tonight is going to say a bad idea I think Laura Ingraham last night told them after the interview like I I don't know if you should do that like the people that he listens to or that he hears from on a regular basis who's going to tell him don't do that so\nI first I Want to find out who told him he could you know I it it's very odd that everyone thought this was a constitutional issue and then all of a sudden but they told me no I don't like that actually\nThe borders are very murky illegal thing and again what always comes down and executive ... if the president decides it's a national emergency than apparently it falls under the auspices of executive order\nSo if he thinks this

Cotton\nFor example I'm sure I bet he could approach this with them sessions easily and if they talk at all could have said something along these lines you don't need a constitutional amendment that's where we fought but you can do it that way you can also do it this way\nI I don't see how this doesn't\nHappen [noise] I don't see how this doesn't turn into the [noise] six in the age here you are

Sarah Sanders is defending President Trump's blaming of the media for fueling anger in the U.S\nVery first thing that the president did which can Stanley attacks in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blamed the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous acts\nThe fourteenth ... is pushing the fourteenth amendment was put into people who are massive paid in the south which suddenly become citizens which was the right thing to do that that was the purpose of the members of the things that Trump did and said during his um during his campaign\nWas a it was going to go to this portion of the fourteenth amendment never been decided by the Supreme Court joy portion of the for the man there's never been decided by the Supreme Court\nEvery other one portion you an amendment there was five of them every other section has been educated by the Supreme Court various things as they said it's one of the most educated man it's we\nHave done research to say that when our forefathers put them together perfectly meant a lot of people who are ... to become American city\nWas not made for somebody came over the water had a baby and certainly there are citizen ... free commonsense point it kinda makes sex or privacy Trump has not cat\nHas been that she should he would direct attorney general\nTo finally have this portion of the fourteenth amendment Judy Katie by the Supreme Court and my guess is exactly where he's going to go\nWell that's that's just it I mean it is it's come before the Supreme Court in the past but never a case that specifically involved undocumented immigrants well I mean oh this is this would be if he in fact scientists\nSay they were trying to do when I'm In the courts have ruled on this is the famous one case if you look at Eighteen Ninety eight or Nineteen hundred something like that\nBut the guy was in San Francisco to Chinese parents who had been here but then we're not doing business for the government and they laughed and actually tried to come back and we're told you can't come back the kid then sued saying look I'm an American I was born there\nAnd the court ruled six to for him and it is very unusual for the court to overturn itself and I get that it's a hundred and Thirty years later and I get that it's a different court or whatever but\nThey have the question you ask is what what cases are we talking about and how are those cases going to be different than that one case and whether you want that to be the president or not like this stuff always gets complicated there were dissenters they're two of them\nBut they there is sort of legal precedent for this sort of\nLet me read you again ... after the president made these comments they did some research on it let me just read you what they are saying about that\nAnd they said that there has all the Supreme Court has already ruled the children born to immigrants who are legal permanent residents have citizenship but those who claim the fourteenth amendment should not apply to every one point\nTo the ... not apply to every one point to the fact that there has been no ruling on a case specifically involving undocumented immigrants are those with temporary legal status\nTo the bottom line here is this if the president followed through with this executive order the court would have to weigh in on a specific case\nYeah if I Know we're up against a break but if this is specific to these caravans for example yeah then I think he has very from legal standing all explained why when

argument quote or a colon build ten cities for migrants and birthright citizenship here the caravan send active duty troops to the border refused asylum if you ever doubted that immigration is the animating force of the Donald Trump presidency look at the last few weeks\nYeah wait\nMy buddy doubted that right this was that was my what\nPart of build that wall there was that every single rally he ever had while he was running for president did you not here in Maine we just are not surprising we started with a rapist and cry on day one absolutely day one when he announced what whatever you think of him and whether he keeps his word and whether he has a core and whether he cares about the one thing that has been\nSemi consistent as\nI'm going to be tough on immigration and whether you believe that he's doing it because he believes that or just because it's politically a shrewd move or some combination narrow\nHe's been when when he needs something he usually is going to go to immigration and I'm going to be tough guy and this is no different yep and because they're just worked for him before and it's going to work again let me go to Brad in Winthrop bread good morning you're on W ...\nGood morning Kim gym maybe uh I Love Tuesdays cause I ever they actually get all this on the whole show\nGood man thanks for doing so [laughter]\nAll right that the caller prior to the break ah mentioned creating a section of the United states soil that was not a mhm United States and that brought up a question in my mind I Want to ask you guys um or if you're on on a Native American reservations\nUm that it's within American boundaries but they also live by some ... right and and I guess that was my question what were your thoughts on that\nYeah yeah the course of the Supreme Court's sort of ruled on that ah that one to me is a little clearer uh I actually I don't think this one's that unclear but [noise]\nFor me [laughter] for me it's not clear but [laughter] if he does this and\nWe're going to have to decide and once and for all yeah yeah are are not even ones that are all just within the scope but uh I\nI don't think the Indian thing to me I don't think it would apply as much uh the Indians are while yes there are there are a sovereign people with sovereign rules but they still do operate\nYou're right and they are subject to\nThe standards of practice and base standards of um law enforcement let's put it that way\nI mean ... when push comes to shove if there's a murder on an Indian reservation we're going in there and we're going to find out what it is they don't get to just say sorry you can't come in well I I'm\nI'm looking here real quickly how I I Would I Would I actually Google was Native American reservations and the fourteenth\nAmendment and it does say that um they they\nAre still subject to the jurisdiction of the United states that would want any kind of constitutional amendment that the whole argument there making North Dakota right now that they just changed the law so that most of them can't vote anymore\nAnd that that then they have a real problem with that up there right now right let me go to Alex in wall for him this morning Alex good morning you're on W ...\nGood morning all you all say super thank you sir right\nRegarding the immigration situation I uh I Do agree with President Trump is and the reason I Do agree with that I think that's just one of those things that can can happen because or has got a Little America\nHave a baby the baby's automatic citizen you're all set that I can remember in the early or late seventies early eighties early to mid eighties there was a situation where foreigners who want it to become Citizens United states yet or\nWhat find someone to marry a ... a U.S citizen the automatic came to us that's at I Believe that walk that change that will\nChange ah and I mean I and obviously why because people are taking advantage of that ... says let's just do this they'll let you go up trouble so\nI think that makes a lot of sense to me that just all ... states American citizen I mean that's gonna be the trucks that they want to lay on then\nAll of the babies an American citizen because he or she is on you then the parents need to come forward the illegal for a path to citizenship\nGet them out of the out of all we bring the fall\nI guess that I Will try to try to make all that\nYeah I looked at one of the things for me on this is I said a half an hour ago it would be just a lot easier if Congress did it first and then the president signed it\nBut they can't Republicans don't know what they want here we act like we do but we don't caught and had\nThe rays act earlier this year in for a lot of hardcore conservatives said man this covers all bases one of the things and the reason I was you are not entitled the benefits for a certain amount of time until you get here and has to prove worthy and all that\nThey can't get it through they can't because there are a number of Republicans that aren't they don't think that way Republicans aren't unified on this you know if they were this would be done already\nWell we ... that I mean look the dreamers are still out there trying to figure out what's going on exactly no one knows exactly what's going on there\nIn Trump would be easy to do a better way to do this really I think would be fine dreamers stay birthright to over ... you want to take that deal like you can do that but he hasn't yet maybe that's still come and I don't know but [noise]\nWell I don't think that's going to come because I think if the president thinks he can signing executive order and make this happen he not agree with you and you guys why you don't need to even talk to Schumer\nBy a conservative friend of mine who's in our well how and why are you against us and that's why I Would rather see it go through those channels I think they are the proper channels and I think I think there's other better ways to do this then by executive order I don't love the precedent that\nWell I don't like the precedent the because number one as I said before it did this will turn out to be disastrous no matter what there will be people in this gray zone\nBecause this will ultimately be overturned there's no question in my mind if he if he gets this through resigned just as an executive order it stand is through the courts it will then be overturned by another president\nAnd then we have the same thing that we've got going with these with these dream or kids and the president was so unbelievably critical a bronco bummer for signing an executive order that he swore was illegal\nAnd then he then he's going to do that in the same same manner I mean they you know again they they all do this sale criticize one another and then turn around to the exact same thing\nI don't think it would be I don't I don't see the kids who you're talking about because the day he signed the executive order until that's over anyone in that period from whenever the data is November twelve\nTwenty Eighteen until further notice you're not a citizen period and he went up until that point is except that every executive order he's tried this with so far has been struck down by a judge within a week okay so until it goes into effect\nThere or if you're going to be in or until I somehow a president that the ... another president comes up with some way to say okay this is retroactive\nI now that I don't think you can do right or how would you do ... I think because he would argue that it was unconstitutional and take it back then argue it's unconstitutional the court rules on it which they would of course have to do so you can't go retroactive on it you can just stop it and do your own town of Seventeen Ninety or on\n... the voice of Boston New York ... in one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and my heart radio station\n[noise] for\nMorning I'm Bovey W.

today will be going to the polls\nToday you get to be a while that's a truth right ah with this early voting a and are there are a number of uh you know we've talked about the governor and we've talked about certainly the Senate race here in the state and we've talked about a lot of national races that are going on but there are a number of of races that are going on here in this state including\nUm that of the treasure and joining us this morning talk a little bit about that\nIs dead Goldberg and she is the state treasurer running again good to have you along good morning\nWell can they be thank you so much for having me this morning\nIt's great to have you I was just looking back I couldn't remember how long um is this the second or the third time you've run\nThis is the second time I've run and in fact I'm for treasures before me ran for governor and ah it was very important to people when I was running they said are you going to run and leave or are you going to run and stay so I Am running to stay\nFantastic somebody what the state treasurer does I Know that sounds crazy people don't really lousy\nNobody knows what the state treasurer does and that's part of the\nChallenges when you're trying to run for reelection and there are so many different people in Massachusetts that much greater profile on the state treasurer runs sort of the typical things that you would think like management cash management the pension signed\nOn I'm a claim property which makes me very very popular had to check your name lately\nI have and it never seems to come up\nWell it will just keep on trying\nBecause we we all lose track of something we out at some point and I get it back to you and I've got to tell you sometimes it's really life changing I was out of the senior fairer one day and we found Eighteen thousand dollars for a senior who was on fixed income that was\nQuite a fine for that person\nThat I'm sure it while\nI don't claim property isn't the treasures office\nThe retirement board isn't the treasurer his office deferred compensation very importantly veterans coming home bonus veterans' benefits and then I created the opposite economic empowerment\nWhich is the first of its kind in the country and we have our college savings plan which we started as a pilot and then announced\nThat it will be going state wide and twenty twenty\nWe have our programs for a for a ... financial literacy starting with kindergarten children\nAll the way through seniors and we've done an enormous amount of work around breaking down the wage gap and creating opportunities for women and people of color and men and their families all over the state\nStarted well that's just naming some of them they were actually twelve departments\nYou view from money for an elderly as you just mentioned you're also apparently found some money for kids because you've got this program now called seed my baby which has become a thing and I'll ask you about the humor side of this hour ... rather\nHumorous side we did in ... on ... and twenty people signed up on this that we did not know that it would actually go viral but this is not a bad thing because this program came from our\nI said a program and saw any programs which have been pilots and the last couple of years where\nWe at no cost to the taxpayer at that we have created a nonprofit within the treasury office that works with public private partnerships in order to fund our programs and in Boston and months and we funded every ... kindergarten child's\nCollege savings account which gave us access to the families and wrap financial literacy services around\nAnd their families not every child family signed up but it was the two year pilot\nThat gave us the opportunity to work with nonprofits local partners school systems and figure out what is the best approach and what we learned is the best approach is to see these college savings account at\nBirth and so beginning in January twenty twenty every child\nBorn or adopted in Massachusetts will be eligible to sign up for a seeded meaning we put the money in\nCollege savings account\nAnd then we hope to teach families about saving for college avoiding debt I'm\nBanking some families don't even understand banking and even retirement and so I'm very very excited I promised I Would do this college savings program and we have done it and we are moving forward so it's it's a very exciting program\nBut it's just my two parts one is how do I know that it's not taxpayer money I mean you said that put in twenty Twenty one nice thing to do now do we know definitively that no taxpayer money goes it is\nBecause our first funder was at the announcement with me and presented the check that will that will fund every account that first year and between now and then that's why we did not started in twenty nine teen our non profit works with\nFoundations all over the state and now that we're going state wide foundations outside of the state are interested when we were doing the pilot we were planning for the future\nAnd work and the reason why the pilot was so critical was that outside fame foundation said when you go state wide call us\n... and that money in\nMassachusetts recognizes\nThat we are a skills based economy this isn't just for college it's also for vocational and technical training and we did a job steady through last school building authority which is also under the treasures office which showed us where the jobs are going to be in the next Twenty years\nAnd it's a skills based even manufacturing is skills based robotics and the lake so we are this is our way of helping keep people out of debt create economic stability for them and create economic\nBy searching V. aim in England

show have believe I just thought that out a W arcane [noise]\nOf course this is the surrogate over tomorrow is Halloween and so we would be remiss if we don't talk about some of the crazy things going on around Halloween\nAnd blaming brought this up yesterday briefly a in our last word this is just\nA great story and I know you've put information about this up on our website right yeah I well by having already I Love OK and maybe we said at the time oh gosh I Wish he was here because he would love this restaurant but apparently there's a pop up\nRestaurant and Tokyo and um the the whole premise behind this pop up is that serial killers who have been put to death\nHave a last meal so you know they order all these crazy things for the last meal and this pop up restaurant now offers your favorite serial killers last meal on the menu\nSo let's give some examples of it uh I Know that a\nGilmore right Gary mark Gilmore he requested a hamburger baked potato hard boiled\nEgg and three shots of Jack Daniels so you can actually go in and order the Gilmore and that's what you would get\nOr the black widow who dined on asparagus broccoli tomatoes and strawberries\n\nThat's a smaller dish less well that's it but I feel your will be getting that one probably [laughter]\nAnd ... of the killer clown a John ... who had a bucket of Kentucky Fried chicken French fries a pound of strawberries and fried shrimp shrimp we were saying yesterday I don't know if when you go in there you actually order a bucket of KFC but you probably just get fried chicken right some [laughter]\n[noise] I think this is such a novel\nBizarre but kind of cool and fun and the ... that that's what pop up restaurants are supposed to be right\nYeah yeah I think this one is actually didn't adjust and I think it ended yesterday or me yeah yeah but it's that's about what it should have yeah we will do this for a week or two in there to be done on a permanent thing because then that would just get old\nBut it's catchy it's just you know it's fun I think and I don't know that they did it because of Halloween but it certainly would have been a perfect ...\nKind of thing here\nYou do a bunch of pop up you see every once in awhile different pop up bars that you know like the game of Thrones bar\nThat popped up I don't know Jim ... when was that or did you know there's there's a stranger things pop up All right now\nThe downtown they come up every once in ... what does that ... what so what is that I Would just do one of the boat one of the hotels in Boston they uh they converted their bar so that it looks like the eighties and Scott of all the stuff from the other side and the stranger things and you can order drinks based on a\nDay that's really cool I Would be a new pop up ever\nLike I don't think I ever have I don't I mean well this particular restaurant does a lot of poverty they have the space that sort of made for pop ups 'cause it's a it's a national chain hotel and they sort of go around the country with them yeah so they've done in four or five of them there at this point I've gone to a couple of their actual kind of phone that's all right I just don't I've never\nI've never been either I'm always finding out about these ... I Would have gone to talk I Know it's good I think it's close now or can't do it although\nI Will say this I don't I don't my last meal really would be I mean we can do that thing if you want I just I feel like I can say there is a hard boiled eggs not going to be part of it\nI\nI Love hard boiled eggs I'm not sure that would be part of my life you're never going to win in relation to anything like a I'm not like I Need a burger and a hard boiled egg\nYeah you just like hard boiled eggs for some reason you're not going to do just hard boiled eggs like me for our boiled eggs and we'll call it and I know you're not doing that like an omelet or something you know if that's your thing bad eggs or your thing you're going to do it differently yeah\nMm frittata or something or I'm never I've never ordered in my life I sighed hard boiled egg ... what ... what are you doing oh actually my remind me to sleep in another room than\nA rough and I was at the birds are being voting but hard boiled eggs for dinner you know I don't even ride in my car on the way home [laughter] oh my goodness [laughter]\nOh gosh guys I eat a lot of art boiled eggs in my life but I Would again if it's my last meal I'm not sure that's where I'm going\nI don't know what my last meal a day I'd have to really think about it oh you have time to time [laughter]\nOh I Would I Would go a big CD chicken parmesan immediately which you know made the way my grandmother makes it absolutely\nOf the well the problem that I have is ... I don't know I Need to see the full menu but so far I Am getting that you know more the burger it's\nThe most harmless of the ... just I don't mind a strawberries I don't need to strawberries with fried chicken I'm not that interested\nThere [noise] and uh\nThat asparagus thing is ridiculous I tried to say wants me to eat on\nMy lab yeah I'm not doing the fried chicken would be so good though because I I don't eat fried chicken now boy because I'm always worried it's going to clog my arteries and at that stage of the game I think you really don't care about your arteries to you [laughter] I think it's pretty much\nI Would like not that I Would ever want to see you put to death but I Would love to see you like to go go ham after you you were like All right I can eat whatever I Want and there's no consequence at all I Would love to see what that looks like\nIt might be fried chicken you might put like a second piece of bacon in that oatmeal got that right [laughter] at that point I'm not worried about clogged arteries anymore\nI Would be I think I Would go multiple ... it'll be so random it would be like all different types of foods that wouldn't go together would be like okay I Want a burrito and then I also want you know fried rice\nThey do they limit I mean do you have a financial limit when it comes to your last meal\n[noise] [noise] yeah I just didn't we go over this before every state does this stuff differently they all will generally try to comedy you within reason and they're also you can if you're going to say lobster Newberg that's going to be a tough sell\nIt and now the one the one had two shots are Thurman shots of Jack Daniels can you have alcohol\nI think it's different stage door differently but I think yes you can almost they almost always a beer in some fashion\nAnd we're asking that because I'm just wondering if does that have any kind of you know adverse effect on the drug they use on you I guess the answer must be no\nOr they don't care [noise]\nJoseph ... was just a two cheeseburgers a salad and I see that one you could do Victor ... do you see this one ... it's a single all of with a pit\nStop it get a ...

just deal and Elizabeth Warren [noise]\nGot a preview\nWhat's your advice for both of them I mean what would you tell Jeff you've done two of these and hasn't changed much\n[noise]\nI I mean I could I could say to him well you know take the take the path that Scott Brown did in the final one which is if you remember he just did it all bets are off and he just went after her it didn't bode well\nI mean he can back off and not do much but that hasn't bode well so I I'm not sure there's much I can say to either of them that's going to change the outcome\nI mean\nYeah but again if he asked you you're looking me advice so what I Would say to him would be something like ...\nStay true to your everyone is telling you to throw bombs and just scream and yell though ... ... ... obviously discourse is going to come up tonight so why do you do some of it so look up and personal against the senator I think she's a bad senator for this state\nIn here is why if you don't agree I'm not your guy if you think we should try something different just go down with who you are don't don't do something you're going to regret here lose with dignity and then running twenty twenty against Ed Markey when Trump's\n... that's what I mean I think throwing bombs is a is the worst thing you can do that is for him in and out to be\nAt work for Charlie he ran against and unpopular incumbent he lost he ran again four years later on yeah\nYeah I don't know if Jeff run again after this will say but I I think he thinks he's not but you never know people\nPeople tend to have this in their blood and it's hard to to walk away from most of the I mean who knows if if he loses who knows what is out there but don't you think like was it on channel five I think right yes\nStarts at seven eighty percent of this have to be Trump tonight I mean doesn't have to be this course doesn't have to be shootings doesn't have to be guns\nYeah none of this is local everything as local but none of it is local either right right\n\nAnd I assume if I'm if I'm Warren I Do the same stupid things I've been to one which is I just\nI talk about Trump every chance I get a by talking about ... what was the ... the woman's name at patties yeah\nDoors at ... or whatever the bartender I was I bring that up again just because of the ... the first time in order to throw us again\nBut she ... same thing with her just be just be careful be guarded don't pull the Hillary\nWhich every time she is in front of mine she says something that we just go crazy on\nDon't do that right [noise] yeah I mean that's ... ... ...\nI'm looking at the poll right now and it's like fifty something to thirty something mean he's\nHe's got a long way in a week to change the outcome of that and I think they would each of them would have to go they would have to do something unbelievable like he would have to come out and say I actually found out that you know she did something criminal and I approve\nYeah I don't know I didn't change tonight and they had\nAlready monitoring this whoever's monitoring it at five if you're listening the way they ended the third drum Clinton debate as you recall are these two aren't going to be honest\nDo you any more so before we go can you just say something nice about them that don't die ... oh I Would I Would start with it that will be right off the bat discourse has gotten so ugly and this has been no different words we've been attacked and be before we do anything people keep saying the discourse has to be a\nChange so let's start there and I might could you say something nice about your opponent before we proceed if I were these two I Would be very ready for that I Would expect that questions coming at some point but I Would do it right off the top\nI'd be anxious to see what she had to say\nI mean I I think you know he could say that she's passionate about our job [laughter]\nYeah I don't know if either of them would say to ask whether yeah\nI mean I think at that actually helps her more than him because her whole thing is it's not about helping anybody that's just what I when I was a model or whole thing is a vote for him as a vote for Trump I don't have anything I shall I say I don't have anything against Jeff personally he just aligns himself with a president who the state doesn't like\nCancel a thing has been attacking her directly well his response should\nBe a vote for her is a ticket to a president the presidential race but that's not something good about her now I Know I mean neither one of them has that I mean that's that's the stance that I Would have if I were him coming out tonight over and over again you vote for her and you're just giving her a red carpet\nI mean a lot depends on what happens today in Pittsburgh right if something goes wrong merit is a huge scene there or\nThe president says something or somebody else says something\nThat's obviously going to come up because you always do fresh and you do what's in the news or whatever I there's no doubt that should the president and executive action that has to be asked to these guys right there in the U.S Senate who should decide the immigration policy the side of the president deals going to have to say the president on this right\nI don't do you think he thinks that I think he has to go with the president or his line would be looking at ... in case of emergency it's the president's goal I feel like we are at this stage right now\nBut that's definitely going to come up well absolutely it's kind of come up but I don't know that he has to support him in that\nI don't know\nI mean if you're running for Senate isn't your feeling about this the Senate you take it out that's the whole point that's why I'm running that's what this is about", "year":
