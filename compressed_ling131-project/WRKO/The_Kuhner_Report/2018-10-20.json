H. P. financial ...\nFor the financials retirement roadmap show where you are rude to a successful retirement goldie as each team anytime in one eight hundred to two seven seven seven seven seven or visit them on line that S. H. B. financial done come no here's\nYour host dairy bread\nThe topic of the show was is the majority of your retirement plan based on the stock market and want to give you some idea of them how to change that if it is because that's a lot to rely on your tire life and work life in retirement life\nIs based on just the stock market that can be pretty daunting so he talked about that we also talked with attorney Keith ... man is to see how familiar you are advisor is with your state plan and trust plan to porn that they're on the same page your financial advisor in your attorney\nAnd we talked to keep the client who had worked with him still works for them but didn't necessarily work with us right away back in two thousand eight and the results were a loss of six hundred thousand dollars not because they didn't work with us but because they left all their money very exposed to the market\nAnd then during match market report we talked about why the markets dropping off or had to sell off it does and the volatility ... it has had over the last few weeks so that being said ... out of everything we talked about fear the listener and you can just remember one thing what's your take away\nWell I just think it's just you know having you know speaking of the volatility just if if your plan is entirely market dependent and you are and needing to sort of liquidate and take money out you know not just living off dividends that's one thing but you're actually living off the earnings and the gains\nThen volatility can be very stressful I mean stressful for us I mean this is Mrs ... you know our job and my job and I'm sitting here like looking at the computer screen like you know kind of like come on let's go down come out you know what I mean and I'm I'm sitting there like I'm stressed out about it and I couldn't imagine if you are retirements\nWas based on that was your retirement was based on staring at a screen and like yelling at it to to to kind of get better and to go up and to show green nuts\nAnd we need to withdraw money well that\nThat's what I mean so it's like it's stressful enough for for people that are in the business I couldn't imagine having to retire and rely solely on it and try to have a a comfortable retirement when markets are the markets\nWell I Know Keith take away is probably going to be similar to the volatility 'cause he had a client that necessarily\nAnd take his advice ten years ago\nYeah these are the times where when people come in again we've been in a\nTen year bull market run so complacency is easy at this point right you know you sit there you wake up every morning you look at the end of the year screen oh yeah you know gone to the next year onto the next year on to the next year [noise]\nBut ah you know ... does rear its ugly head last year we really didn't have much to lead off so that's that talked about super complacent right this year we're starting to see earlier the year we saw this and now we're starting to see it again and again this is why it's so important\nTo have a plan in place like Mark and Jean when they came in they had enough money to retire they had enough money to do everything they wanted to do in retirement [noise]\nTheir advisor advise him to keep it where it was and then that delayed their retirement you know almost five years the last five hundred thousand dollars over about over five hundred thousand dollars when again\nThey didn't that didn't need to happen they they had enough money to get where they want it to go that costs them five years of retirement to go with that from the time you see your point God Forbid something happened to them health wise me didn't get to enjoy retirement\nIs amazing and they came can you imagine that's a great take away keep because the people listening right now can you imagine like the second guessing\nIf you had the chance you had enough money saved up in a lot of you right now might be in this position like Mark a gene had enough money saved up where they could retire as long as they took a little bit of risk off the table and developed a plan their current adviser at the time ten years ago talked him out of the last five hundred thousand dollars\nAnd now they had he had to go back to work as a contractor for five more years when they could have been retiring and traveling and doing what they wanted to do in time and the ... when that changed and that change and that that we don't want that to happen to you\nAnd so I just think I Know a lot of you out there because a lot of you out there like my own family and like my I look at my parents and\nMy dad growing up when he went to work he was a plasterer he'd wake up at five in the morning he'd shovel the snow off of his truck going to work all day come home still have some energy to hang out you know play ball with me or whatever we wanted to do\nMy mom would then took us into bed and she'd go work the night shift as a nurse and the sacrifices they made it to get to where they are I always told them like his dad and mom we don't you want to get to retirement\nThis is your whole life all the sacrifices that we just talked about when it comes to going to work early ... shoveling snow off your of your windshield working nights come down to having enough for retirement why would risk that why would you ever want to risk that so if you're listening right now and you're not sure that you have a plan that's going to take you to into retirement\nAre you a hundred percent sure you have enough income that's going to be generated are you sure that if you ... if you have enough money right now do you want to risk it and have maybe that portfolio be cut in half if we have a market dropped down\nWhen you're building a home you need more

term elections in American history and I really don't think I'm overstating it when I say that are the stakes could not to be higher\nAnd so President Trump is now barn storming the country he's going everywhere he's going to be in Texas soon to help a Ted Cruz against beta or Rourke\nHe's in Tennessee trying to help Marsha Blackburn pullout that seat he's going to go to Arizona or he is going to
