H. P. financial and our retirement road map podcast you can you can subscribe to it\nAnd you're listening to all of our past shows current and past\nAh for you know maybe if someone I Know it sounds bad if someone's that something desperate right keep them at someone has to listen to us maritime hopefully we provided a few good at it gets here and there are any ways Keith without being said what was your number one takeaway on today's show\nIs part of our process and our retirement planning a program here we focus on the back end of it which is legacy planting and I know attorney McManus touched quite a bit on it earlier\nHow important it is to work with someone that understands you know your state and what you've created who's dealing with a couple of this past\nWeek they came into our office they had just created in state plan and they had been where they ... they were working with another advisor and they took their state plan C advisor new visor one didn't know you know what the estate planning was how was executed or how to execute it and then to fund\nThat estate planned so it's so important to work with people that are knowledgeable in all facets of retirement not just investments\nGood point Gees how about yourself and just to stay on that same theme of diversification you know we talk about tax diversification planning diversification kind of what keeps talking about and then also an investment diversification\nYou know and here there's a line when I read from a report that we had recently diversifying globally implies investors portfolio may not be the best performing relative to anyone market but also main means it may not be the worst performing\nIn other words when you have a diversified portfolio it it doesn't you know it's not the best performing in a bowl but it's not the worst performing in a bear and that is extremely important as you enter retirement\nAnd that's the way we see all the time and the first meeting with our clients I let them know hey we think it's okay to reduce your upside a little bit meeting maybe in a really good year you're only going to make twenty percent and not thirty percent\nBut in the trade off maybe in a really bad you're you're only going to lose ten percent instead of thirty percent or whatever the numbers are so we feel like if for folks that come to us you know we're going to mix different um portfolios and different instruments you know both market in non market to try to get our clients the best overall risk adjusted return\nBut most of what we're dealing with is trying to take on a little bit less ...\n... as you get closer to retirement and more importantly in retirement and my final takeaways or the story of Stephen Liz [noise] and I know they came into her office in a while back in their clients but when they first came in\nThinking about that he was four weeks from retiring and retiring for the you know he did not want to go back to our trust me in his wife Liz did not want him to ever have to go back to work they wanted to be able to enjoy retirement\nThey had an advisor for twenty something years and there are retiring and for weeks and there was NO PLAN in place there was just ... the only plan was yeah we'll send you money when you need it there was no written out plan\nAnd they were at the point where they had said one point five million and they had enough as long as they didn't take a big hit\nAnd so I think I might be Warren Buffett I'm not sure who I heard this quote from but I Love it and that's it's crazy to risk what you have in order to obtain what you don't need to think about that and I just want to tell a lot of people coming to our office as of late 'cause that's what people are doing\nThey're risking money to try to get from one million to two million or two million to three million but don't even need to get to that level to Khattab a comfortable retirement so it's it's crazy to risk what you have\nIn order to get where you don't need so is Steven Liz they came in we built them a obviously a plan that gave them a cash flow that they needed to cover their goals and dreams which for them was to get a motor home\nAnd traveled you know travel around the country in different parts of the world during retirement and then have enough to cover the bills that was their main dream\nAnd so if you haven't taken care of your dream planning or an overall plan or you're not sure if your retirement the next three to five years and you ... there's NO PLAN in place from where your income going to come from one of the tax from ... says there is an estate planning all these things that have to be thought about retirement\nTake advantage of what we've done this or we rebuild our from around the ability to help people

by the way you look at her tax returns she only began to make over a million dollars a year once she entered the Senate\nShe use the Senate to enrich herself and her husband\n\nSince this is the lowest they've ever made while in the Senate has nine hundred and Thirteen thousand she's usually a male or oh way over a meal and how did she make over a male and are almost two million a year while she was in the Senate\nThe books\nAnd in fact she such an impressive person she doesn't she got just write one book about herself she's had to write books about herself\nAnd you see you see legal to

Kavanaugh process to then destroy Brett Kavanaugh that's what this was all about from the beginning so the question now is is we're her lawyers in on it as well I Believe they were\nEither she perjured herself when she said she wasn't aware of a Senate investigators wanting to interview or at her home in private or her lawyers deliberately kept that information from her\nAnd I want to know if the lawyers were in cahoots with Diane Feinstein staff because I think Feinstein stuff along with Deborah cats and along with Michael rama which they were orchestrating all of this behind\nThe
