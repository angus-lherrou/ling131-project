really scary it's scary in that I just don't know how you can plot out the scenario where anybody looks good because he's in Dorchester this morning Jimmy good morning what should happen at the border\nShould bring in the military good morning Kim Phoebe Jimmy you know what the major problem is I don't know if you're aware of what's going on in Europe in here and to keep it quiet with the measles how bad it is there's no cure or the tuberculosis that these people might have a lot of small pox\nOr that polio virus but all of a sudden started appearing twenty seven states in the United states they have no cure for can you imagine that if these people come in and they have no documentation will provoke vaccination and all it takes is one person spread an epidemic you know many people you could lose in this country\nSo Jimmy yes okay let's let's let's let's stipulate all that time\nWhat are you going to do what do we do let them know that you're sitting at the gate they have no documentation or they have no proof of vaccination and then what they started pushing on the door they started pushing on gay they started pushing on defense than what\nBring the military you let me yeah now do they clash are you shooting that killed ... are you shooting you can't have that right you can have somebody shooting and you have the answer is you don't see the Israel situation from a couple of months ago and there may be embassy like\nThat that alone that was on such a small scale compared to what this would be after like you can't I Hope\nSo Phoebe so you're saying it's All right to spread enough\nBut nothing terrible you know and I'm Margaret ...\nI'm saying it's a bad situation no doubt about it and what I'm Wondering is what how does this go what do we do right I don't I mean\nNot signing off on shooting to kill I'm not\nBy right wait wait rebate you know what I think it is somebody put these people up to what somebody\nAsked that at your leg okay even if that at least people pay to counter\nThe Jimmy Jimmy that doesn't make any difference once they get here but we're talking about the actual situation let's put rubber meets the road and they're standing at the border in Arizona What what are we going to do about that\nRegardless of who put him there now what do you do 'cause you you've brought up a very valid point we've got the but we've got seven thousand people we have no idea what they're bringing with them we don't know anything about it what do we do\n\nIt just it it's a tough question I mean this is the\nFront of the one thing that you're going to hear me a little later in the show criticize Elizabeth Warren for for example is the cheap periodically throws out these concepts but there's never a until someone called her out on his last can you tell me your name where where are you saying it's racist who's racist whatever\nI didn't say it but the thing is the thing is just right so Wall Street's a thing what\nJimmy just did a version of that which is get the military down there\nOkay but what I mean what are we going to do like red rover and we're going to see if they can break the chain or not right and if they don't then what if they're not leaving what are you going to do and I we just going to have some sort of\nI'm not going to say that I'm just as a standoff we're going to be undecided border they're going to be on there were just gonna keep looking and then we're going away to each other out and see how long this goes or\nPeople think this is a ... I I Know that people just think well we'll just sit in the military down there and we'll just handle it it's not as simple as that if you are the president and you are the president's advisors and you're behind closed doors in your tasked with that what what is the answer\nYou cannot just opened fire on these people you cannot do that\nI mean there will be chaos industry to this country if you do that\nEven in Jimmy's scenario which is let's say someone's ear with tuberculosis Interpol or whatever\nAnd there are what are you doing Jimmy there they say they want to come in you say no than what right again yeah I Know you said get the military down there and what does that mean\nThe military has to have orders what are their orders what do they do let me go to Rick works in a national Tennessee this morning morning wreck\nHey good morning yell when he when he asked my friend\nI'm saying that uh ... yeah I agree with you it's going to be a very difficult situation or however you in the military will get orders but the military as well as the national guard which is the state\n... military but at the border patrol they operate under a a rules of engagement doctrine and the rules of engagement so you cannot shooter or not a combatant or or portion and I doubt very seriously if a a commander\nStop 'em along the way but I I don't know what that is either let me go to a scene in Boston hasty that morning you're a W ...\nHey guys how are you good it's really not that difficult first of all you need to stop sign up for the first three to any estimate of anybody who's funding them okay\nIf they do make it to the border you take it to point six billion dollars that we give to our doors it back every year and you set up a tent city in ... about with court okay\nPut all those people in there and say okay now that profit one by one where quarantine anybody yet if this check coming in the lead them that you know six eight months a year\nHowever long it takes to find out if they get sick\nAnd the people that I bet you do process you put them on a boss and you said if the ship it to go\n... or ... and the all camel putting in all these sanctuary city and let's begin with all these people I mean they won all these people don't want all these people I mean it just wasn't ready to go up quite a bit of illegal\nAnd you watch all the laws change but immediately have to talk to on guard and all those other countries with only got frightening\nTony any truth any military aid but given you if we have bases that patient that's why you have to send a message a strong message to the\nCountry is not allowed to be very the yard is second candidate what's going to happen when we had here in Fort the Caribbean and they get bigger and bigger and bigger as they go so it's really not that difficult to stop [noise]\nWell I'm In a vacuum everything you said makes sense in reality\nSo you just start pulling funding in military and all that from these countries and then how many Venezuelans are you going to have in your and how many how many countries are going to have descended into am total chaos like nice yeah I get the tough talk and that is something that's going to happen that\nOne thing that they haven't figured out yet is how you make Mexico do something proactive here they pay down a bit of a show to that bridge but then why like they're just marching all the way through the country and at no point is anybody being detained or stopped at any level\nMexico says you know because they offered them some of them as high on the whatever the ... or their offer that's what they can do\nCan we do that and we'd be like yeah we'll we'll escort you all the way up to Canada walk 'em right through our country and another one\n[laughter] Paul is in ... good morning\nCome on and you know be be I think you're mistaking a lot of those boats like I think this is going to get ugly although I don't think that there'll be a shot fired um you don't have to watch it for this this is going to get ugly [noise] um so even in the ...\nScenario they get laid in and get put into some kind of like camp where they're\nDetained in ... there aren't going to be ugly pictures ugly scenarios that are going to come out and that's what I honestly think is\nWhat we need to do you know we're all in this whole rash inclusion on the Russian a mess meddling with our election stuff with Facebook and stuff like that you know I don't think\nThat was effective on meddling and whoever's backing this movement is going to have some effect legitimately on our election this has been about six thousand ... thousand\nNumber of people trying to march to America this is how people trying to change the votes of American citizens based on\nStaying in the news on a bunch of socks stories that may or may not even have any ... that now that said we have to be hard but now that doesn't mean we have to be cruel or hurtful or what\nBut if these people even allowed in the process in age to be in a starkly mhm\nProhibitive kind of way to not be in a way\nThere even any a\nGray area that this is not acceptable in the show that\nIt is I'm\nA deterrent we need some

people at the vet them properly etcetera and there are I'm sure there's an awful lot of 'em\nEither the sickness is coming in with them obviously we don't know the character of these people are the thing that kept me the most is that it I I agree with him when it says in his being funded by some and I'm sure that you know and you can probably take a quick guess at that\nBut whoever that is I agree with that frees them money all them all I mean that's what they're doing\nIs illegal number one it's very very wrong and the fact that we know what I have a great with another call appalled and regarding\nA immigrant grandparents etc my grandparents came here and they shot at Ellis Island like most everybody did and they went through a specific cautious hey they came here a big big war here that nobody seems to recognize is legally\nLegally they came in this country legally this was a process at ... they went through it and they were released and you and look at what they thought these immigrants came here as they said they wanted to be Americans they can contribute and they have a look at what we've done a past\nFifty sixty eighty years having immigrants coming through they've gone to I'm a product of immigrant grandparents that I I'm very happy with what I've turned out the contributed I care about this onslaught\nIt's just and it's time perfectly obviously what he meant terms to make Trump look bad and I just think it's a it's a travesty what's happening and I I'd like to see something\nAlex told me to do things first off your your comments about your grandparents coming through and relating to what the caller said earlier I think that same color was the one who said why don't they stay behind and fight\nAnd point was well we didn't know stay behind and fight our ancestors came over because they wanted to be American so that that's number one and you're right they did come through uh the the legal channels\nBut number two I think that the broad brush I don't love the idea that we're broad brushing that every one of these people wants to come here and they don't want to contribute and they don't want to be\nThe Americans they just want to be gang members and drug dealers and they want to bring some kind of disease and be problematic I mean we're broad brushing that I mean\nThey're not doing anything illegal they're coming to the border patrol training for an island that ... as far as we know that our immigration system where the difference being your grandfather\nAnd these guys in theory and we don't know what the numbers are alligators we haven't voted him yet but your grandfather presumably wasn't seeking asylum he was just seeking a better life these guys are are you there actually looking to write their lives so that in that and doing it the way they are doing it\nIn their country has less than ... ... obviously out corruption in those countries are up it's absolutely phenomenal okay we\n... we should go after you know you got to stop it at the source I feel like President Trump should do something about that I mean to cut their funding on race country stop that\nI agree with that I agree totally with that and that maybe that will smart and some people say what we have to make change I mean there's this place for these third world countries there all the same it's just\nIt's just unbelievable what they do I'm sure they've taken away the weapons from the citizenry which is basically what I find that have happened in this country which I Do not agree with at all but when you do that\nYou can run hurt on anybody and just do whatever you wish who's going to fight\nThat they can actually my my understanding of the problem is that the citizenry has all of the guns right now and the government can't do anything to stop the gangs that are that\nAre that are forming as a result of it right it's related problems that they're killing they're threatening to kill I mean it's it's a it's a terrible situation but they've got to get the government's gotta get it back under control and they can't\nDo it the government is on is unable to do anything because the citizenry is more armed than the government is\nAnd then you have if they turn around and they they're threatening government agents or ... or ... how many how many people have tried to do something in these countries where they've been assassinated and it's all drug money that's behind right I mean it's it's just unbelievable so what do you have to do when you go to your right to the root of the problem stop it but\nThis onslaught just can't happen I mean what are we going to do with them\nAnd they say that that's a question we're asking Alex exactly they drink called ...\nYou gotta be careful going to broaden this stuff like maybe it gets back to like the two thousand election that was Bush's famous quote look we're not we're not nation building here we're not doing this of course even did do it and just how that worked and all that great because guess what that is a lot harder to do than you think and\nNo matter what your motives are and how much money you can throw it things if people are resistant to it take Afghanistan for example then it's not going to go that well so\nHow many Afghanistan's you're going to have down in Central America if they're not open and or are resistant to change for example you wanna fix Venezuela find well if they're going to be socialist how are we going to fix them they're not going to do with the way we want them doing it when I was going to pump money in there and have 'em wizard away et cetera et cetera\nWhat happens in all of these things as we throw up these generals well you gotta stop it yeah I agree we do got to stop it but how do we stop and we've got to fix the root of the problem okay but how do we fix the problem and then how much are you willing to do like one guy said on Fox over the weekend like why can't we just met them before they get here\nSeven thousand of them by the thousands migrate distraction I don't you know people don't typically want to lose leave their country unless of course they're\nBeing forced out for whatever reason or pay for would rather sarcasm or they don't wanna leave they'd rather stay but if you can't stay because you're afraid or your life being threatened when we go to bill he's in hang them ... no\nGood morning ally I'm super thanks\nSo I Want to see if we can help out a little bit\nI has been going on for the last ... three times a year doing a lot to do mission work and one of the most important one is that we did was um a coat on a nonprofit called ... and they can just look up the website I don't want to get into that too much\nBut I Want to help people understand a little bit more about what goes on in these countries and ... you know the little baggage that you're talking about with water and\nThat is really how they show watered down and all the little local school is a company lanes I was ... does that show that's not that's not somebody get put in water and back that's really what they do and you see it all the guy that got a little bag in the bottom and then they drink the water so that just an easy way to distribute and sell water\nThe biggest problem\nIn ... and I and I know for sure about under that have been going there for a long time\nIs um a lot of the people that are coming up have moved into locations in Honduras mostly and just outside of ... and an area called Lutz colonial San Francisco and what ...\nWhat happened is they come to that area is no property there's no anything and they basically just say okay I'm going to stay here and then they find all these materials and then they begin to build a home\nThere's no rule of law there's no anything so what happens is is that these areas then become a under the control of different games now the area that we I've been going through a long time we started it ... years ago\nAnd we helped build the church with his community there is a community of about six people right now which over a thousand strong\nWe are now back yeah with my youth group and everything it over the next three years we were helping the community build another church for another community and it's amazing how how how one to all these people on how much they really do want to stay in their own country and how when you help them understand to\nUm to develop and shells and everything else they fish they become so much the kind of the ones that we're we're working with we helped create Michael businesses for women and we've also help with the banking system ... modeled after the Bailey brothers building and loan so that they become self sustaining in doing so much better\nYeah although I Do listen I I commend you for the work that you're doing there and I hope you continue to do the work that I think that the source is where you have to go to try to rectify this\nI don't know if that's a governmental thing or if there has to be more people like him to go down and to try to help 'em these I Do truly believe these people are fleeing there\nFor\nA reason it's not just because gosh I think it'll be great to take a walk up Mexico to get to the United states they have a reason that they want to get out they they are trying to get out and it's not just because they live in poor neighborhoods it's because they have nothing in their fearful let me go to John in ... good morning John\nBoy again uh\nPlease please please let me just get the so I just got to be short a welcoming to the future labor force because they're so the reason why a lot of people want 'em up here\nAre the people who are fighting us some arrogance bad up here um I the only white Americans out of fourteen individuals work company\nBy girl worse for the same situation she's the only white American so a lot of people statue and these people up for a reason\nThey they take advantage of people like just being here and I believe it's got to be a lay of it\nAnd it's a little scary to see it habit because or notable people's tolerance\nSo this going on all the time and time again\nWhere the crossing the border unfettered or a you know I'd recognize\nThat's my fear right now is it just you know the people don't have the ceiling college but the oldest anymore\nAnd I think I've actually cook it ugly like you said on it\nYou know I'm I don't buy into that conspiracy as much as you do first of all I just don't see how they get in on\nThat it I just don't we're going\nWe know where they are we know there there are common if they don't get stopped in processed at some point along the route they're going to be processed when they hit the actual border there they're not just coming in and they're not just going to do seven thousand slowly matriculate north east south decided whether they're not ...\nThey're not going in all directions they're gonna be vetted\nIt's going to be a small percentage of this group that actually stays if there's any of them actually by the time they get here I wouldn't be surprised if Trump issues a blanket statements and there'll be no refugee status for anybody um but there will be there will be a percentage of them that will probably be given refugee status to rest will be sent back\nUm I Do Trump's been\nSaying Democrats comes at a table let's do some ... immigration reform I've always said like\nHas to be some sort of punishment for people that hire illegal immigrants and it has to be something that has actually enforce we'll talk about that but what is the enforcement on that like how many companies refined last year legals like we know where you know this stuff goes on and we know that the jobs is the thing\nBut do you think the president really wants to enforce that part of the law the gangs who\nDoes is it the Dems is the Republicans as a ... somebody's got to somebody's got to push that and somebody let's have some stats on like we know how many are in this caravan allegedly we must know how much the government\nKnows full well how many find they issued last year as a result the people aren't well\nWhenever I those are those numbers how much are those fine it's one thing to find them it's another to collect those files like ... what happens in these cases how many businesses were shut down last year as a result of hiring illegals like it's easy to say let's get tough down there well how about let's get tough here\nRight All right let me go to ray in Medford hey right good morning\nI'm ordering this this is like ... we got to shut the lights off or out of candy I think that there isn't the Democrats do have a solution at all I cheat plot I see my ... the the vet said I said what's what's weight immigration reform but they all come up with any specifics\nAt all by navy shower breaks he doesn't come rushing into my house and it was my shower or something my problem is Charlotte is broken at all it's it's not a\nProblem that they these were free so I went to high rank you wouldn't tell your neighbor they can come use your shower if there is our is broken\nThat you do it all my neighbor [laughter] I think I'm getting a sense of you know like I wasn't even in the offing theory\nThat's supposed to be what happens is you can use my shower in the short term in ... you know what I Believe they don't take a shower that's got to\nDo with these people so that was all the schools are overloaded with All right let's build a housing project in downtown north Andover and they can go to the schools get thirty kids in a class of ... and I speak English and my daughter's class it's crazy\nThat re do you think of a loaded red lights off right do you think seven thousand people are coming into this country you really think that's going to happen or actually no it's not it's not right it's not because they\nJust want a caravan coming this thousands coming every day coming over the border to border crossing from Canada and this is just South America that coming from all over the world they come in on planes on visas and stay overstaying visas or overloaded we have to shut the lights off and get this under control\nWell again that was one one possible thing drum could at least slow which he hasn't\nWhich is that because we can't get a handle on illegal immigration and there's so many illegal here we're shutting off legal and writing [noise]\nBut he hasn't bloated that for some reason I thought when the travel ban went down he was gonna say nothing to anybody no one's coming until we get a handle on it he didn't do that and so if you think that they'll do rotted candy rain we're letting in over a million people illegally years so we can't be out again but [noise]\nIt's seven fifty eight and you're listening to

R. kale tons having to take take sixty eight sixty eight that's our number you can Texas at seven zero for seven zero again what we're talking about there was a report in the New York times that apparently health and Human Services is knocking\nAround the idea of doing away with what the Obama administration had put in place when it comes to Detroit transgendered individuals in this country\nWhat the uh the current administration is considering the idea that\nYour gender is based on the way you came to the world regardless of whether you change your gender at some point or another so if you're born male you are male period so the federal government would in the end I guess make the decision as to what your\nYour ... says your gender and I'm just asking you know what is the impact on the federal government that this has to be changed\nWell for what it's worth they would argue that ... ... the federal government when the term limits a gun in their side again with ads have been given chromosomes and that's what do they accept\nThat science says gender just for you is the thing scientists on the side of the transgender movement in ... oh well that's one of the ironies of this is that what what is the science right\nBecause you know ... there's a sign in my community that in my town a guy's got put science Israel like OK\nBut in this case both sides are claiming science\nSo what does science riches in Westboro rich good morning you're W. R. kale\nGood morning you I'm great thank you\nSo it really that the government should do looking to do with just a plain and simple male\nOr female and actually if the government out of the equation because they've been involved with well what is the person in their transitioning or they fully male or female if they come out and they say however you worry\nThat you are that's it and it takes an actually out of the equation version of the equation and making determinations such as the exam or with prison and everything else and I just and I know that we're in trouble service though believe or transgender because I Do think it's something\nThat's more psychological than anything else\nAnd there should be some counseling going on that I don't believe they should be a leader I don't believe they should be made fun of but I don't believe also that sticks with surgery is really the answer I think there's a mental issue there because you are either male or female\nYeah you argued that is the comment that will get you into trouble you're right about that like look I just\nSo normally do how do we make decisions in life I what I Would argue is you try and generally find the path of least resistance role for the government this is the path of least resistance nope sorry that's how it is a long there's no more paperwork there's no more surgeries is no more nothing we're not involved and you can do whatever you want but\nNot for us that that always that the police resistance always isn't the right choice though and it always isn't the one that makes\nYou get to where you should go and you you can just gets to gyms point which is that if people are telling you the gender does for you is a thing I don't know if you have a new one in your life that has some version of\n... surety or surety I guess as to who they are well you know\nYou can say whether or not they should have\nCounseling like I don't know how long does that counseling don't want to know what\nI Know when it has been tackling change it doesn't have counseling\nTo actually live normally in the middle requirement but yeah to have a certain number of hours with a counselor before anyone will consider doing any sort of surgery right exactly\nSo but again that that gets to your original point of\nWhat's in it for them ... who's paying for their under Obamacare the Affordable CARE Act presumably the government's paying for that so that would be one thing that's gone well\nI don't I don't understand why anybody would yeah I mean I don't understand why anybody why would someone be concerned if you if you are against transgender ... transgender surgeries if you're against the government playing for paying for transgender\nUm medications and you believe that it's a mental health issue then why would you be against the\nPaying for the counseling because you're saying it's a mental health issue so that shouldn't be gone right that should stay in that should be part of health care because\nAnybody who's against someone changing their sex believes that people need a counseling Mike's in Boston he might the morning\nEvery morning how are you well thank you good yeah\nI wanted to I I'm a family and marriage counselor and my wife and I have been doing this for six years where I work for a number of people in the ... sexual community and\nI can get a look at the heart attacks or the forty percent suicide rate or transgender\nOr with your thoughts when they do go over to having the surgery or it's a mental health if you're old by race on that a little bit more but I mean let's face it I I Am a white person who I Want to be black black you're on a certain characteristics and you know wherever the government is trying to get her to\nGet rid of their ears and that is out there about transgender occurred at a tremendous amount of an area that's out there that transgender community\nAnd when you look at Harvard University workers are the four or five to operate as they stopped doing them and mass many years ago because they are in the book about\nOther people they were still depressed they were still suicidal holes in the apartment was that affect their basic stole who they are as a male or female because you're ... you're ... you're going nuts\nAnd they would argue the reason that they are so depressed and suicidal is because people in society like you are telling them what they are not what they believe they are that's that's that's why I started running against although there are number as that earlier on as absolute at all if you ask your horse and why they are depressed her suicidal they will tell you\nAre the most you know we were told that they're the most don't forgets and vindictive and we will make our enemy suffer kind of people in the world and they both worried that to each other and yet here they are going to have this big warm embrace\nIt's straining yeah it's strange I'm Christine is in Somerville this morning the morning\n[noise] I can hire everybody\nYeah I just wanted to point out that I'm that person from the family counseling and that to that is I'm a very radical position that hurts and talk at it they're they're going off all research from really like forty years ago that was done at Johns Hopkins and it seems to be the only study they can ever point to when they're making these points about um you know\nHow the transgender is not you know basically a normal way of being and that\nUm they should not be you know and courage to live a full life and they're on a identify gender\nYeah I'm a little disappointed they got on your show but you know that that up and I'm the one thing I did want to say when he was saying the suicide rate is forty per se that\nThere's a lot of other studies at point that's a very big difference in the actual suicide rate if the person is supported and accepted by their family or community compared to the person who is still struggling to live as they have a birth gender Sally I just wanted to make sure I didn't want that way or that\nThat gets to what I was saying Christian that I'd like to see polls and studies in whatever done now that I think that\nJust a society as a whole were a little more accepting I think people probably feel more acceptance and have less issues I mean I I was caught in this morning Jordan Evan she's twenty seven years old she's in Charleston Massachusetts she's an elected Republican in this country\nI think we're much more accepting um of this position and I think you know what I'd like to see these studies as suicide rates now and continue\nThis study should take into account whether or not these people have any economic resources at all to get a lot of times you're cut off from your entire family and retire financial support and then you can't get a job because you're that tradition and people have difficulty hiring people that are really\nGood point and actually I was just out of the aisle and equal workplace summit last week in Seattle it with a week on climate out of the fortune five a fortune one time then companies seven hundred company sent them you know people like a deck so won an award a diversity what point I Want to make it there were a number I met a lot like fifty\nProfessional transgender people very high placed in some cases engineers all different people and\nYou know it just so makes me feel good if companies are accepting then uh you know using that talent and they're earning a living and and I think that's more like the real to pass that we should be helping the people on not kind of like you know criticizing their so called you know people call it a choice so I just want to and thanks for letting me on the show to talk\nAbout that thank you very much let me get a to Brian Brian's in bright this morning morning Brian warning how are you well thank you sir I\nAm I'm really glad that you had that last caller on a I'm very disappointed with the two others before that and I'm I'm curious where they received their ah psychology degrees or medical degrees because they are way off base\nUm you know Jim ... it was not too long a since you and I the the medical professionals are said that you and I had a\nMental disease shall we say and other organizations all qualified being being gay as medical as a mental disorder um and now today that's not the case and that's still not the case for those who are transgender as well um\nAnd so for those who are um [noise] no wedding what they're doing and ... and also supporting\nA Trump when these policies like uh uh other elected officials um we have a couple of running for Senate here in Massachusetts there just perpetuating\nViolence against transgender people are in the old you take your community and it's it's ... ... ... is is a Jim you said a few minutes ago uh one of the main reasons that issue aside rate among ... people and drains younger people are as high or\nA so some of what he said I agree with some of what I don't I think there was some sort of veiled reference to jump deal we can do that if you want but I I just reject that hardly a as two\nI'll put it this way Brian uh gyms at something during the break I I'm giving them credit I don't know if you're on the ... Jim Jim's comment was one was from the Republicans won one of these culture wars why do they keep taking these on that's\nTrue I did one thing I\nMean at the end of the day people in their twenties and thirties are pretty much on the whole okay with the transgender thing so as time goes on this is only going to get more and more in their favor\nRight I agree now I don't find that Brian and Christine the last\nTwo callers that wanted to rip the previous two callers for not being open minded ... just\nBe warned or be careful that you didn't sound overly open minded yourselves just so you know like there there is two sides to this discussion or in this case there's probably if decides to describe it and you guys have carved out your belief in you didn't you sounded as open minded to this as the two that were before you that you were ripping\nThis is what happens in these once you decide where you are you're not really listening to the other either urine Neanderthal from the sixteen hundreds or you're crazy moon bad left who wants to just radicalize the world and there's ... no one wants to be in between ...\nAnd I I Do feel like those previous for callers kind of broke down that way where did you get your medical degree I don't know if that's where you're jumping off point is I mean is it possible that someone can just say look\nI think you should be male or female and that's it like without having then the the\nCondescending talked down in similarly people obviously on the right to do this too which is you go right to mental disorder mhm\nThere's something seriously wrong with you if you don't want to live your life the way I live mine that's what we've done and and Republicans have done that historically he's right that was the whole gay marriage argument right and the whole gay thing and we like interracial marriage argument was that we don't have a great track record on this and yet we act like we know definitively here too even though we've been wrong on this stuff\nIs in Boston hate Tony good morning\n[noise] hey what's up guys on a good thank you go ahead I'm\nJust want to make sure I was on um so yeah uh so uh my take on this is that\nI don't so the government should only be protecting a\nA beef on the founding principles like our our constitutional rights right so\nUm when a person is at the age of Eighteen um if you're going to do something that infringes on their what their pursuit of liberty and happiness uh I don't think the government I think the government is is being ... for when they do that um so my what I'm going with that is is that if a person who decides\nThat they identify as a different gender\nUm I don't think that the government has any uh it should be able to say whether that is wrong or right I mean whether it's a moral issue or not is is not really something that like I\nI don't care about that I just care about the government's saying that they are going to say whether or not a person can define themselves as that um I think there should be restrictions like uh I don't think you should be able to figure that out and to your Eighteen or so maybe you have this this thing put in place\nA that says that person is up their their uh their gender birth until they're like Eighteen and then once they're Eighteen they can really figure it out and then legally changed their gender they take appropriate steps to address to do so\nYeah I Would assume the argument against you right off the bat would be by peanuts over the the the issues with the repression that wouldn't be put on people if they thought by twelve is just so much and the damages so last thing that you're\nA there is no way teen would be to his point I think you can identify whoever you want but legal you can't make that change into aiming ... I I agree with that I think that's our that's sort of what the policy is now I don't like no no one's going to do surgery on someone who's under Eighteen there's no way\nAnd there is treatment and there is there a prize of trees and so do we get back to that like I\nDon't see how the Republicans win this idea in a short run if Trump does this and I don't think he is going to do it fine you've done it it will be done done over time right I mean you're not going to win national warning we made gay marriage illegal ten years before it became ... to just [noise]\nGo look interesting debate though that's for sure [noise] ah it's eight fifty eight this is Debbie ...\nVoice of Boston New York about one hundred and twenty seven till UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise] on the other\nGood morning I'm Nick ...

the economy is going to ask trumps the reason why it's ... comes down to the tax cuts so if you like dad why don't you have somebody at the table participating in that\nProblem is Massachusetts is even further ahead than the country not by much but three ... three five three seven so Massachusetts is kicking ass\nWe've heard they're not at the table so Jeff's arguments got to be like well we could be a\nTo point seven or two point eight or something like that but people are feeling pretty good about the moon when people feel pretty good about themselves they don't usually change stuff so that's one problem too is just just to just call numbers of Democrats versus Republicans he can't overcome that it will be one thing if the national unemployment rate was\nThree seven Massachusetts was five five well guess what the Charlie would be gone a little bit worn would probably be gone we'd be we'd be seeing some sort of sea change because why is Massachusetts not get and what the rest of the country is that what you would need to have some sort of changed because you don't have that\nHe's well the interesting thing about that the be actually is\nThat what you've said is that the president's\nThe presidents great economy could play\nNot so well with him in some places in that people just will it status quo people like where the country is so that means if you've got a Democrat in the Senate you're going to keep your Democrat in the Senate if you get a Republican this and you're going to keep your Republican Senate if you are voting for the president right now she has a good

president so I just we should just go run for president and so he can hand it to her in a basket polls no when ... like\nNo one asked me who I'm voting for and that's why wouldn't they be talking about the polls and deal is so far behind like and people are like me that support Trump and they can't stand Elizabeth Warren and see that she hasn't done anything for us so where are the polls\nPolls aren't always right that that Elaine they're they're pretty good at what they do and yet I find a representative ... you know our representation of ...\nOne thing if she's up five in the ... and he comes back and when she's up thirty something points and the whole [noise] yeah yeah but Paul\nThough that's what no one I was with a patriot fatty yesterday there was not one person that that supported Elizabeth Warren not one person was asked a on a pole and that's why I just doubted and when you watch her\nBut I I could say the same thing was I was at a party with ten people but all do support Elizabeth Warren none of us have been called for a poll or there's just\nYou know no but when you listen to Elizabeth Warren you hear her talk the other night and yesterday you come away with someone that is working for us absolutely you do you hear that I Do\nYeah I I hear it like like a brain freeze and it\nIt's a twisting of words and it actually hurts to listen to her and it\nMight have people can I buy you know with\nThese what's even worse it's not to people it's the entire state you're you are in the minority you can want an odd\nThat to be the cage and you're

week before the out of nowhere like watched Brown's winning one boy and then the globe tried to cover it by saying no our poll says she's up Eighteen and everybody laughed\nBecause you knew you could
