I was all along the one thing I could say for him during the course of this was that at least he is allowing this woman to speak he has called for a thorough investigation he's done everything that he needed to do as a leader\nI'm In this situation making it very clear that he believes that Brett Kavanaugh should be on the Supreme Court he had not heard anything yet that changed his mind\nThat was fine that was great and then he did that last night\nAnd eat it whether he believes her or not what he did was he needed so that anyone who is so frightened about coming forward about these kinds of issues now says this is why won't do it\nPeople mock you people make fun of you if you if you can't remember every single solitary second and ... and everything about it or some lawyer can pushed it in some way than than you stand\nWith the possibility that you're going to be mocked that you're going to be made up so it was the whole issue that he made fun of for me\nAnd that's just problematic\n[noise] I've told you before and then then we'll do calls are promised when are you guys are holding but he's the anti Obama they're the they're the exact opposite of each other so Obama sees the Trayvon Martin case and he goes to the microphones and said I think that could be my\nSon he's on that side of it\nTrump goes to the Mike ... says think about your son about your father thinking about your\nHe's on that side of this which is the opposite side complete op at no point that he has his daughters but at no point does he say thinking about your daughters and if there are because he's on the exact opposite side where Obama was on these things they look at these things completely differently\nIn both cases they're looking at him from a victim's perspective but they see it completely differently Trump seeing this is you know wrongly accused and how do I defend myself Obama seeing it as\nComplete racial thing right from the start and we're going to pass judgment before we know what's going on but they they're\nIn a way they're doing the same thing and in a way they're doing the exact opposite that Obama would've never said that obviously in Trump will never said what does Obama said about Trayvon Martin or about Skip Gates or any of these guys and\nIf you love these guys than you love what they say and if you don't like them you can't stand what they say and it's just the same whether it's completely different circumstance\nHeaven for says can win SNL mocked Kavanaugh did you feel the same way as it out if that's what they do you just turn it off\nThis is the president of the United states why people lost sight of he represents every one in this country\n[noise] she's the president this is\nNot some television show there are women out there who attacked he's got daughters and a wife and women who work for him he's got his sister good golly [laughter]\nThe idea that people immediately go to well when asked now who cares what SNL dead SNL is a TV show Nixon Wayne this morning Nick\nHow're you doing I'm just want to get your reaction to grassy brought forward or late last evening where I don't pass eleven PM he's received asylum letter rejected the person's name not anonymous ah ...\nOne of her former boyfriends mid to late nineties steady sat there while she coach someone how to handle a polygraph test name is Monica McLean I ended up on the other side of things she I and I saw this last night\nShe testified to Michel ... Michel asked her\nAbout the polygraphs and asked her and I'm paraphrasing here on whether or not she had a a a a sad to see how people\nYou pointed out the numerous inconsistencies and total lack of evidence that you in the media refused to acknowledge and your attempt to ruin a man's life for political gain look up the recent sworn testimony of her boyfriend up six years seems\nRelevant\nI Can't give you a better example and we're going to do this all day I can guarantee you in a lot of you were going to be screaming at Kim journalism allow their Don junior and this is where we are in this is the country right now\nYeah especially I mean I Would argue with a buddy of mine who's like you read the you\nEither love word for word Saturday you love what Trump said I I that's really are true that is that where we are and that's so wrong because\nI sat right here last Friday after that and in fact even more so than you I said I didn't I did not love what I saw from her\nI stand it I doubt I yeah and I stand by that I still I don't love what I saw from her but that doesn't mean that I think she should be belittled\nAnd I and Brett Kavanaugh is being given the opportunity to stand up and said that he did that he didn't do it\nAnd people can continue to try to back him as well and investigation is going on I mean I didn't I never said I think that what she said was a hundred percent right but my point is just that when someone comes forward\nAnd the president of the United states goes out and mosques in such a way\nIt's it it more speaks to not her it speaks to the idea that someone who came forward and ... and didn't have every single fact\nYou may think she's not telling the truth and that will be decided by senators but they didn't have every single fact\nIt that makes that you can mock that\nMy response to that as Mr President just push your candidate stay away from that that would be the classy way to handle it and it would be the more respectful and most importantly it would be the most effective\nAnybody who was on the fence about Brett Kavanaugh would they see the president do that and they believe that women should be respected in some way they don't like Brett Kavanaugh now just by virtue of what he has done\nWell first of all hands on the fence about ... about that how could you possibly be at this point that one to\nThe thing the thing about it all it is why I made the the Obama Trayvon Martin comparison so in that case what Obama said is that could have been my son and all he was looking at is that\nMy son could have innocently been walking down the street and then gotten killed than some of us at the time said well\nWe don't know the facts of what he was doing in the neighborhood and we don't know why he was looking in windows and we do not talking about that could have been my son to and you're only talking about this one specific last night's another example of what would it if you're going to be a unite or not a divider and we we do this thing right\nWell if you're gonna do that about\nHer than you might also want to say on the other hand\nMhm you might want to instead of saying just\nThinking about your son think about your father think about your husband because this is a very difficult time in\nLife really 'cause it's probably difficult if you've been assaulted two\nSo I\nCan hear my buddy already going but men are the ones that are under assault okay fine but are we are we going to deny that women are under assault and women are being assaulted and women are being raped and all this and that to me too movement is happening so in in ... in a drunk is\nYou pick that one lane that you want to be in while telling us Uri and unite or and then you you go with it they're\nThey're the same that way they see they see the world that particular way and they can't get past that and in Trump's case even more than Obama's case he likes throwing Molotov cocktails into that\nWorld which is it works good for him if depending on when you are but\nDid it in mocking way not only did he you know did he belittle the idea that\nSexual assault could occur and someone maybe doesn't remember all the details and I'm not again not necessarily her I don't know but that that certainly can help them but not only did he belittles that but then he did turn around and just a little this woman who came forward or Joe's in Watertown good morning\nOr good morning I Want you to do that a Trump is oh it but my our champion and the reason is is because the media the newspapers federal bank um every day the cartoon McKay mode against his family\n... every day in soap and so we tend to speak because we don't get it for anybody else and what he said was not mug Jean ... and the fact that nobody else was talking about ... the woman at one point I Want to make that much I as a foe a family\nWill to the Supreme Court and the Democrats and I'm a registered Democrat they back there is not going to vote for him all the goal in a ... you're in the same boat to fight against him\nOh I don't have talked about his family was going through what's happening throughout the country now with the video learn harder and she'll ... she'll only want to tell you we only that'd be for Trump when he's speaking the truth if he doesn't speak the truth or he doesn't balance out a problem to patrol we get very\nWe ... we all get irritated when we share the absence of the truth and balance is no balance and if we didn't have Trump we'd be in real trouble\nI mean which cover all many issues I'm not going to have that I like you and I like the ph or to even before but you have to think what you end up being a very objective but all I Want to talk about the support of his family\nWould I Want to tell you something here's a here's here's where I come down on that I don't want the president family to go through anything but having said that I Want you to remember he ran for president of the United states he's a public figure this is what happens when you run for president\nAre you talking about the last time I don't agree on on ... and ...\nSo they say the abuse it used to have been talking about the abuse to Jake\n... you know we we could go back and look at abuse it a lot of families when they sit in the White House take I mean that is no place to be let let me say it's not an easy place to be I understand that that's the scrutiny that you take their\nYou know the these are people who haven't asked for that kind of scrutiny but ... but more importantly let me go back to the idea that you said he just stating the facts and he's not mocking her\nThe way that I see stating a fact is if the president would have wanted to stand up there last night and say doctor for came forward and she stated that she cannot remember the date\nDr Ford came forward and she said she cannot remember the address\nDoctor for came forward and said that she cannot remember who else was at the party now that's stating what happened but that's not what he did he got up there and he made a voice that he was her and did he and he mocked at any laugh\nAnd he didn't like that that's mocking that's not state of the fact that the part that was so high on even\nIf it was criticized for all those points pardon milk pardon me when we were just up to just give us the fact\nThat that is her how about the president and I just gave me the facts and I sat right here and said I didn't like that she doesn't remember how she got home she can't remember how she got all of that\nBut you don't balance out what's happening to the family the gentleman or if it was so green court you don't talk about the guy from New York who says he's got to vote against Rome at all what happens there already lined up and up balanced on being rational the objective you're not being object though because you don't\nKnow how to use or is if I just say the ... and they probably already five Republicans that'll come

I I thought you said yeah the Clintons killed anyone I Do believe that Clinton organization\nShe was very corrupt misused money misused power so that they are I think they killed anyone now I'm not a big conspiracy theorists a type of thing do I think Ted Kennedy killed someone yes\nI Know that it's not on that front authorities Rick I got to tell you this I ... if it fits worth a try aiming in here um I can tell you I wouldn't care who the president was and I wouldn't care who the who the nominee was I really really wouldn't\nJust don't want the president up they're mocking someone\nWho um is coming forth with what is a lot of people believe are sexual assault allegations\nI I just don't want the president mocking that situation in the way even if he doesn't believe it I just because there are a lot of women out there who are not coming forward who have been sexually assaulted whether this one little what this woman was or not\nAnd the idea that the president would mock that situation is wrong it's just wrong\nAnd that I think we're headed and you know like I I and I don't care what it is and I don't care when this I think he was re stating\nThat you ... you know that and so do I he reached dating it would have been just presenting the facts she does it I I've already done this walk through it again she doesn't know what time but in when it was she doesn't know he can restate that fact that's not what he did\nWhile he would argue we I see I'm I'm not as strong you ... you are saying that he ... he is at the edges she's at the line on marketing but he is he doesn't do a voice and that that's where you do them All right\nThat's exactly that's exactly right that was not mocking he does it did exactly what the media refuses to do and simply run through the questions and her answer is\nBut he just what are they willing though Rick like he was doing something unseemly though one me uncomfortable about the whole thing I mean that's the way they were not vote for him yes it is I mean there's no data mining is\nIf you love Trump you're going to defend miss and if you ate Trump just makes you sick to your stomach and no one ever changes on these we changed the story whether it's Capra neck whether it's now it's lousy foreign and its Kavanaugh\nWhether it's any anything that Trump says if you love 'em you'll defended if you hate him it makes you sick to your stomach and no one ever changes\nThere's no one on pay cable we all know where I Am I'm like man\nI think the one thing\nThat isn't correct in that statement is I think there's a tremendous amount of people maybe the overwhelming majority of people that do not love Trump\nThey actually can't stand Trump in many ways what they love other result and the fact that finally someone is pushing back against the craziness of the liberal left that's trying to\nTake over the country but that's what they love if they do they loved him you're not the you know but I don't love him I don't I don't think that is ... feels about you guys yeah I think there's\nThis group of people that liked to kid themselves well I think down who loved him\nWell if if he hadn't gone quite so far if he was just said that there are people who love the results of what he's doing that may very well be true economy is strong that you know we've seen to be getting a break here and there and some things\nBut I unfortunately in these situations I can actually separate those two things because I still don't want a president who who I feel like alienates a portion of a big portion of a of the population seven Fifteen eighty car bunny what's\nGoing on around ... coming into the city can good morning everyone the merging bounce back up the roost sixty in review delivered downright filling in from top to bottom lower deck of Ninety three slow ride over the sake of metro west by you sound tired of forty five as the west and safely barracks once told route sixteen well north of town every cell phone but at least\nOne thirty three the end over ... ...

them even these rivers biased contracted guy on ESPN\nNow this is the world we live in where we want flame throwers that's fine\nGet it totally but one question I'm asking you is\nDo you have to be a flame thrower on everything and do you have to be a flame thrower when you're winning an argument you came out five days ago and said you know I thought she was credible I thought she looked pretty good and everyone who's this guy this was surprising and this was actually kind of refreshing\nTo not just leave it there ... or do you because you weren't calling me as I say I'm really took the Trump because he's not pushing back because you were calling me and you were telling me\nThis is going the way it should the Dems are falling apart the stories crap and he's going to get confirmed there was no need there was no vacuum near that wasn't being filled everything was going the way you wanted it and still he decides to crank up the flame thrower and now you're telling me yeah because he pushes back\nAny ... any cranked up the flame thrower for crowded who was already in his camp and he's trying to win over a group of senators who are primarily women\nWho have had issues because of just the whole subject matter and the pushback they're getting from constituency\n[noise] so to me it just\nIt's the ... many levels it just was not smart but we live in a shot and wrote a world where others must fail while we succeed and we much more would rather talk about their failures and are succeeding\nWhen this case it's not enough that you're winning that he might get on you have to start at some point it's his nature right he's the ... right you have to staying\nHe just has to take someone down on the other side and this was his foray into it and it just man you're getting a report today all indications are the reports gonna be nothing\nThe boats going to happen on friday in barring any miracle the New York times looked like they put everything they had ended that cabin our report that came out late last night that's in ...\nAnd that's nothing really you're all good\nA shame is in Boston Shane good morning\nI how ya doing good that they're just to show a couple of points of view let me get them through last\nOne is like ... you got to think that yeah I Do I think those comments last night were totally uncalled but not the right all my thought but your title to his own opinion which many of us I think so also I ... keeps bringing up the fact that Al Franken Al Franken\nAl Franken picture of him grabbing a girl who was sleep suppress so\nWe'll throw that out your way he's not all that on them these were grown adults that went throw that out the window and another thing is\nIf if if\nFrom both sides this president has gotten it from both sides Republicans and the Democrats have not given him one chance even going back as as close as last week even when Lindsey Graham was on his little tirade\nHe even didn't even address them as the president he says I have to go back and explain this to Trump you imagine if someone if one of the senators on either side said that about Obama not President Obama\nJust have to go back and explain this to Trump come on it's ridiculous what they put the media and the politics\nDoes that himself when he does yard person he refers to himself as Trump and that's not fine I'm sure he never wants to use the word president er into Obama in the eight years of on was president\nWho who didn't who job didn't and I don't I'm not a politician does this federalism accomplished people should\nSo strong that he's the president will search\nEveryone to a higher standard than him and what's that you're holding everyone to a higher standard than him\nSo Trump was not a politician at the time I'm Talking about the Senate ...\nGraham is like everyone jumps swimming or I don't think ... I don't think him calling him Trump in any way of some sort of micro Rochelle wasn't right\nBut my next point is to and if you don't think\nThis is an attack on a single white male I just think like no successful white male you're crazy she assassination of a white\nUp just straight white males especially if you're if you're in success we've had it over and over again by our local politicians get on a form and say that just last week they did last friday on Monday they did and it it it's just ridiculous people getting sick of it and there's going to be a wake up call people that people can sit there and see how they want to build up\nThe mid term elections it's going to be a wakeup call I think this whole thing is benefit ...\nThat we might be but it's not then will it be a wakeup call to the other side\nI think the other side is definitely did did did definitely not playing fair\nI mean I Know you know I think you think there's going to be a red wave\nWhat if there is not well that one call oh that just be a mistake\nBecause I mean everybody keeps saying there's going to be a wakeup call I don't I don't know I was going to be I didn't want to hear a lot to be read by that you know to be\nA wakeup call I think there's benefit I think his benefit at first I thought it was gonna be a blue way this Israeli even that up I think\nHe's out there and he's talking about the terrible and I agree this is a very very difficult thing that's happening to\nBrett Kavanaugh into his family it's horrific this is the whole thing is more to find ... I think everybody thinks you know this is terrible all of this and let's get to the truth of this let's get this vote I said that yesterday\nDo we got to vote no matter what does it got to come to an end the longer these kinds of things linger the more we learn about everybody involved and the more we start come to dislike and discredit everyone and that's what's happening in this situation\nBut the last thing you want is the president to do that\nMean that just that just makes it worse for everyone as if this this situation isn't bad enough let me go to John John ... morning John\nGood thank you sir\nList so what do you remember the story with a woman to the president do assault you're like\nYes what happened to the story\nThat woman is still out there I actually saw her being interviewed on I Want to say a it was on Fox\nI Can't imagine what you're just ... last two weeks\nYeah several women or that we're having a crisis other shows that are like why is it\nBecause they're not allowed to do anything about it while he's president really yes\nI mean I mean the question is it does come to the point now where our ... our ... I just like all of these stories go back so I go and again\nThere was no evidence no fingerprints roses staying a lingering Otis anything to prove this story but accept so that happened years ago\nYeah look I there's a lot of holes in her story Trump covered a lot of them and he was right and most of them it's the way he delivered it is the question\nYeah let me throw this out my girlfriend\nLost it by a brother\nFrom seven to eight she wasted no time\nTelling everyone lots of people didn't believe it or\nLeave it alone in a lever years later that it talking about it but the IRS she better there because it wasted don't write but something at all they are like ... years and I love this woman because we talk about this all the time\nBut the fact is what something is from you what are you waiting for why are you living in the beer summit that something happened to all your life\nBecause everyone's different right on and John I'm Sorry that happened to your girlfriend and I think it's terrific do you support or in that and I'm Sorry she felt\nThat there were people who said to her now that's not true just get over it which exactly that you've you've sort of made the point where a lot of women do come for people just say you get over it you're fine get\nShe came back years later or sexist and when she went to meet some friends don't let you really didn't recognize that showed that girl look I don't know whether\nIt after that girl was standing up much much longer it goes on and that's what you remember about me that's what's your story ... ... you don't even know what happened but that's the story got all ... building it up really was\nJohn can use the only reason why people don't ... do you see that that you've just actually verified\nOr the ... and you've a\nJump ordered the idea that women don't come forward for that reason years later who was the victim your girlfriend not the guy who did it to her\nYou know I mean she's keep these people coming forward and saying those horrific things about or is it is and that's why I Am so this goes back to why I just under any circumstances the president doesn't need to be talking\nAbout that portion of the story talk about the facts if he wants to talk about the facts although I think the facts are out there and everybody knows just talk about your nominee Charlie is in ... good morning sir\nFrom wanting please give me a few minutes to get 'em as like what um what for I make my statement the other day and then now Jim you said you didn't know about stories are going to tie into what I'm saying about the media and\nYou know Fox has that story how he had it and they checked it above them Feinstein show for five years ago\nFor the prior twenty was her show was a Chinese nationals and all that information you didn't know that both of you at maybe you went there and you should know that it's tacos because that's a major story that's not getting covered by the media that's my\nThing as far as\nThe women I agree that women will be afraid to go forward I understand that a hundred percent\nBut the media is also complicit in Keith Ellison girlfriend has charged him and has police reports to back it up about his assaults on her and then eight major media is not going after this like they would if this was\nA Trump supporter of Trump himself or whoever and knowing it and just like they did with Juanita Broadway sat on that story for over a month they say we have to vet it then that it now journalistic integrity has gone that's why you all have to watch the fast forward to the sections you don't like you have to watch all the media that's what I Do\nIs plenty I don't like but we have to do that can get to some incredible tool and that's really what I have to say\nOkay that's how I look I did there's a lot to chew on when it comes to the media I we've talked about this the other day with the MSNBC and Kate Snow running that sweating to interview I've never seen before where someone starts in an interview with saying we have not been able to corroborate anything that she is about to say in this interview but here it is anyway\nThat's that's an interesting standard now going forward um\nDo they cover everything you want 'em to govern how do they pick and choose do they not like this president certainly\nBut all all of this stuff to me is is ultimately noise because this couldn't be clearer you have to decide for yourself whether or not you think Brett Kavanaugh should be on the court I'm pretty sure Charlie things but he should be\nI'm pretty sure that drum thinks you should be then within that how do you get your message out and how do you handle it\nI mean ultimately Keith Ellison doesn't what what did or didn't happen with Keith Ellison and they are slowly but surely looking into that and I went to predict that that's not going to go off key Palestine but who knows a\nWhat Keith Ellison did or didn't do doesn't play into me whether Brett Kavanaugh should be on the Supreme Court and All right so if I don't talk about that enough for you Charlie that's why\nThere's a lot we don't talk about enough Charlie I mean there are ... we do only have so much time here and I don't think that's ...\n... in in this conversation I understand what you're trying to say there but in this conversation that we're having right now I think you have to we we can keep spreading this out but I I'm just for me I'm just specifically talking about what occurred here in the last twenty four hours\nAnd be the one thing that you've said morning that is so true yesterday was a pretty darn good day for the president in this whole situation and I don't understand why\nHe just can't you just can't step back and\nHe just can't keep himself from doing this I think I think that Brett Kavanaugh was in a pretty good path I think Kavanaugh in the end was going to get not was going to end up on the court I actually question now whether he will because of what happened\nBecause the Trump yeah Trump doesn't have anything to do with him he doesn't get to know for me with a flake or call into the you\nYou may not like Trump but what Trump said last night has nothing to do with Kavanaugh it in this this charge like it doesn't Trump shouldn't be the lawyer litigating this and if if he can affect you that way then you're going to look in\nThe mirror that that's that is part of the big problem with is that is what people on the right claim anyway the reason that this is even happening is because people don't like Trump [noise]\nSo I don't keep adding to it\nThen it doesn't help Kavanaugh situation [noise]\nBut if you're if you're at that level as senator and some of them probably are\nThat that's a problem well you got to Maine senator who who's got people calling her isn't voted yet I Will ... right and then we'll hear why she says she did was she didn't [noise]\nSeven fifty eight year end up your calf

I I a woman in America always uh you know I mean in that if we're scared about you know scary things that are out there\n... I I have a concern every time I Walk into a parking garage or get into an ... an elevator alone there's a man standing in the elevator and I have to get in and there's nobody else around\nYou know I I fear a public bathrooms when I have to go there and there's nobody outside of the public restrooms and I don't know what's in there I mean we could go on and on about fear that exists for winning but there's fear for men always there's always been fear for men\nI mean you know look at there's been school teachers who have been there the fingers been played it then there's been you know I mean there's ...\nThere's nothing there was a draft or lurking right everyone remembered walking up to the post office or the rain and luckily for me and my life that never happened where that came to pass but for every generation prior to that\nEveryone knew that was coming and everyone had to think about that and think about what they were doing there's always been concerned has always been fears the idea put forth really is that\nMen are under assault now and young men in particular have to just be so careful about what they do because things are going to turn on them that's true\nYou do\nBut young we're not leaving ... Mac young young women villa woman in the Nineteen eighties if you believe Dr\nFord in this particular part of her story said that the one of the reasons why she didn't tell the story was that because she knew she would get in trouble for being out with boys were having beers when she was Fifteen so that was something that she had to deal with ... clearly Kevin either didn't worry about or wasn't as concerned\nAbout so who has a tougher\n'cause he did one thing again we get back the trumpet there all these things are all there but he made those comments as a father of women of younger they were young girls once upon a time I mean you can\nYou keep just talking about the one group and that group happens to be you and you're you're not even commenting on the other group and that's where it does get a been divisive right right\nThis is unfair about how you're feeling the narrative may got his own man Ryan\nIt's tough to be me right now and yeah it is tough to be you it's also talk to them right and so I mean literally I'll ask you what would you rather be right now I have two sons and I have two daughters I can just tell you as a parent and it may be my macho\nBut what I again for me this is a much bigger issue related to the idea that there that people are just crediting and the president is just crediting the idea of\nIs that there could be somebody like Brett Kavanaugh out there who did do something like this but nope it's Brett Kavanaugh and in his family is the only one suffering and young men are under attack and it's a dangerous time for young men and everything is bad for men\nAnd I just I think that's dangerous and it's wrong and the president shouldn't be doing that I keep saying that over and over and I think there's a lot of people who see it that way the president is always taking the side of\nSome some the young man and like you said earlier this morning it's really interesting the president keeps changing his deal pointed this woman\nShe's credible she's not credible\nCheese we have to hear her why we have to hear her\nWell my only reason for bringing that up before the only ones 'cause he's only changed it once it's been five days but the textures keep telling us that he's he speaks the truth is not a real politician or a traditional politician he tells it like it is I hear this all the time with Trump\nOkay he tells it like it is yeah sure and he's blonde and he's much more direct in all cases sometimes he pushes it a little too far it goes a little to direct\nBut when you tell me that he tells it like it is\nUsually you have like selective amnesia on that because she told us five days ago that she was very credible\nLast night he said she didn't remember anything any delivered that message in a way that suggested that she wasn't very credible and today you're telling me he tells it like it is well did he tell it like it is five days ago and did he tell it like it is last night because I don't know how those two can be true\nThat he's telling it like it is in both cases\nBut you're all defensive him always is that he\nTells it like it is mhm that's ... that's how this could help you keep reminding ones that say would you not get about it he doesn't like it is saying okay well then what which one but it's like everything\nIf you hate him you only pick out the ones that make your argument if you love 'em you believe only the things that he says that\nFits your argument well\nThe interesting thing about it is that he has a a base out there many of whom are listening to you know many of the listeners right now who they are willing to they're willing to to be flexible with him\nAnd he has an on base that aren't as soon as he could share hair had anymore and our needs and then the others they like that kind of coming\nHe was just by Kim is in Boston Jim good morning\nGood morning or good thank you very well I'm In the range the Bible and the marriage is OK well very shot was all going okay everybody do is missing\nThe point about truck Okay Number one is not all that shit okay the American public ... ... ... even even George Bush okay George Bush\n... and\n... ... ... why the American a book that all of non and the information\nThat Trump doesn't do that Jim hold on to hold on just yet do you think Trump doesn't do that I don't think ... is now I actually\nOrganized he orchestrated the effort to get Stormy Daniels a restraining order he\nDid not know unit okay so\nWe heard yesterday definitively did mhm well a son and his eyes that are just regular lawyer to to do that if he told them what to do\nIt out in the outlook I Believe that\nI wrote about what was the proof of what\nYou said that George Bush and and what were some of those examples\nWhere do I get a gym I mean he's a politician in your eyes what does your polling you liar\nI because I Would say it's when your profession is politics right one would say if you run for office of whatever office and you win and you hold that office you become a politician\nRussia where do you where do you continue to people continue to say he's not a politician serious or not hire he's the single politician hunting\nYou know you guys go ahead I mean there will be a word I don't mean to you\nThat would change my mind I don't think we're I don't I mean I I look for the lightest sensitive about this I'm asking you you say he's not a politician Trump used to say that even Trump doesn't say that I guess I guess I have to say I'm a politician out campaigning for for a run around and just came at rallies overnight worry all of that\nLaw away\nRenee venue on it and using the lines of David right means you're a liar others as me are you at all that is labeled a liar\nOkay good well then I then I Would argue that the president is absolutely a politician because I think we know he does not tell the truth\nAnd like oh you\nAnd your mind you Jim Jim Inhofe access to fight on the road you only tells little white lie would\nNever I Would never write up a tree anyway it's rude up but it is\nOK okay that if they're all also so Jim when Trump says I could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in my people wouldn't leave me are you one of those people\nUh you know but I think so yes and he would be because under any circumstances that's what he would tell you when you do with it\nLook you can live ... Jim I'm up in a new thing but\nThe one to two things that keep coming up with him or is that he's not a politician I don't how long does that get to be said about him the guy is the president of the United states that's generally considered a political job he runs campaign rallies all day every day and talks about he literally said last night\nI Know I'm not but just assume that I'm running in November and vote accordingly if that's not the most politician thing I've ever heard you\nYou'd have to give me one better he is a politician of course does he lie well the you can you can play games with what you believe he sat on the plane he didn't know anything about any money and you'd have to talk to them because he doesn't know anything about it then you hear this tape to go and put out where he saying make sure your parents cash\nWe have David Pecker supposedly saving documents that have specific here's how it's going to run\nIt was it that\nBothers you are not that he's lying about a personal Trista nearby pay off of a personal trust okay but let's not pretend that this guy is some truth teller always in every time\nI that stuff gets old and you like credibility when you say that Jim is all I'm telling you can say yeah you might lie about small stuff but these other guys live by big up okay go with that than you at least can try and defend yourself a little better but in a John from took spring morning John\nMorning a lot of people are forgetting she wants to be anonymous you know yeah you are you did and she was dragged out by the league and I'll never liked it yeah whoever\nLeaked interest that I mean it's pretty ... they're just using her\nAnd her letter if you read it it looks like a two year old wrote it looks like it was under stress it stinks crossed out is wrong and it was not legal pad so I think it was just get this out yet it down you can stand on a ... and\n... what is wrong with her doing it because she's a liberal wacko professor\nI hit the defense of her their argument is that this is orchestrated they new to write it like a child because she was going to go a little differently to testify and it would look good to me was weak and\n... and she had a very loud spoken boys because she could play the victim better I look I don't subscribe to that theory and it's ironic the ones that are saying that are the ones that usually accused ... [laughter] that sounds sort of have\nTo me but yeah maybe she I don't again I'd I've wrestled with this should have gotten a hearing I mean ultimately I think probably no\nBecause she had no corroborating evidence and I don't think that that should be the standard going forward is you just get to make a claim and then you get a Senate hearing\nBut I also don't think that you know all all the politics that's being played with her now we knew it was common [noise] five away tests can we just agree that Trump is not a typical politician yes yes that that was there for a while you were to eight fifty a year and W.

I I agree with Jim id that each side they just dug their heels in on this and knew nothing about it and that's a bad precedent on both sides\nYeah and I and and you know again going to follow but something that you just said well you know he is innocent took her what they'll do is to to make E E claim and I think it was Chuck show that basically said that um or one of the center it's up to Kavanaugh you know ... from what\nWe would get a in a court room and he has to prove that he's been a slum it's\nIn ... with us today and no matter whether he's innocent or guilty we just need to get a different person on there now because he can't sit on the court what has to matter now thanks to him gone too far we got to know we got as best we can we gotta\nSort of make a judge well he has a life and he has a family and and you know I mean we do it I I I guess at in the end we do have to make some kind of resolution here and they didn't light and it's\nIt's not beyond the pale for the Democratic senators who weren't going to vote for him for other reasons to say we were already not going to vote for him before this oh no they're going to\nSay that for sure yeah I and that's okay\nI mean I'm On record I didn't I didn't think he should be on the court before this came out of it and that was just your your views as great as it to me I got one of the ...\nIf this happened this way and I look there's a lot to go here but if somehow the FBI comes out today the report doesn't say much they have a vote on friday he gets in what you're going to hear over and over again and it is going to be something we're gonna have to look at is that so can you make a claim\nWith no corroborating evidence whatsoever something that would not be heard in any court of law\nWe now put that on television and part of the thing is because that's going to open it up to but to bad he lied about boos which wasn't the claim that she was making she was making the claim that he sexually assaulted and so now the guy gets hung out to dry because it's something you're not even\nI guess it's borderline related but that that's not know he was never going to not get on the court because he drank a lot of nice right now we're trying to keep them off for that this is the precedent and this is the issue where I think you're gonna have to have some sort of standard as to how it is somebody gets a hearing you just can't be that we just make a claim\nThat has to be something more than that which is why you didn't allow Ramirez to have a hearing and it's why you haven't had sweating to get a hearing\nWell the problem with the alcohol the though is that he didn't tell the truth about the alcohol but the reason he didn't tell the truth about the alcohol was he was fearful that it would make it look like he didn't remember what happened either\nAnd that would take away from his credibility I mean I understand he was back in the corner there\nBut I Would have said that I Would have said look I may not I may have drank drank a lot and I might have done some really stupid things like we're stupid caution that I did not sexually assault a woman whether I was really drunk or I was sober but he never said that he said he didn't drink a lot\nOkay but those questions weren't even asked him when he first was in front of his committee and that would be the thing with him when you're right

R. T. O. for yourself off in his heart radio station [noise]\n\nNine thirty four here on W. or kale and we\nAlways enjoy solution Susan\nWarning joining us of course brought to us by Rabinow in ... good morning good morning what a busy day huh yeah every day Susan [laughter] yeah I guess you're right it every day it's really interesting every day there's something to talk about ...\nAnd that's why we depend on you but we're going to take a little bit version now from the other news the day I was just a consumer stuff yeah this\nIs a really great topic because I'm and I I thought it was really interesting as Susan you sent us some info yesterday and then you centers an addendum so we appreciate that because obviously you were really given this a lot of thought that\nThis is related to recalls and you hear about these recalls all the time but I Know you're about to point out there are two different kinds of recalls when it comes to merchandise\n... ... that's exactly correct um there are recalls that are ordered by government agencies that oversee various products and companies and then there at the time that consumers bring\nSomething to the attention of the manufacturers and they do voluntary recall or there's a third case in which the government goes to a manufacturer and says\nHey here this is what's going on and if you don't recall it we're going to order you to\nSo those are the basic\nThree kinds of recalls and I'm In any event the bottom\nLine at the same ... you know they need they have a product that potentially could be damaging or did a detrimental or dangerous in some way and they need to know and the problem is that there are very few\nFederal laws pertaining to how we cause much be communicated dispersed eliminated you know pick a word mhm and so so what happens is that oftentimes consumers don't realize it's something that they have has been recalled\nIt you know the law or the says something like that the manufacture must do everything possible to alert consumers you know what what does that really mean everything possible\nDo some of these companies pay billions of dollars to same either but they did they pay for advertising to pay to notify about recalls no they do not and there's nothing that says they up to shall we have to be consumers heavy and we have to know what's going on\nThere is a law in Massachusetts that protects consumers in the case of any ... weather which recalls or not\nThe consumer has three choices they can get a refund full refund they can have the product repaired if that's possible or again if it's possible replaced and the consumer\nHas the right to choose which of those three things they would like but manufacturers are under no specific obligation to notify personally as I said and that's why would you buy a product it's a good idea to fill out those registration card\nBecause if the manufacturer has your information on hand they have no excuse for notifying you of course the other side of that is that what they get all that information and they use for marketing\nPurposes you know oh\nYou got to really where the pros and cons um it's especially tricky when you're buying a used car because sometimes the new owners are not\nCommunicated to the manufacturers so yeah so those are the things that are important to know about you know basic recalls um when you buy a car I just wanted to say that you always look on line and there are a lot of really good services like car facts that don't cost you anything\nSo that's always good to know 'em as well as checking with the manufacturer of a car because they have to post recalls on their website\nSure we have I I Will say this though we've had recalls you know parts or whatever for some of our vehicles and we've actually gotten something in the mail\nYeah that's great have you been they've been do you buy them new\nUsually there's a new car yeah right yeah I mean they have\nYeah so they have all your information right there and there's absolutely no excuse not to do that but if you showed that cartoon me you'd be under no obligation to let me know about that\nWe all do might get it rip it up say I don't have this car anymore and then I'd have no way of knowing because I'm not a record with the manufacturer\nMhm so that they're in lies you know part of the problem but in doing the research for this um for this segment this morning I felt some really interesting recalls that frankly I had not heard about and so I thought maybe we could take a minute just shy about\nThem I care has recalled ceiling with glass shapes and and that's really all they say about it they're not specific about uh about any kind of a brand manufacture it just says and I hear\nGlass shade feeling lamp and the reason they recalled that is because the glass is not attach properly and as the potential to be catching and falling without warning and possibly shattering\nTo folks if you have purchased anything that sounds like that are ... within the last few weeks colic here and and make sure that you do not have one of the defective products this I thought was fascinating Boy Scouts of America you know in Decorah chief scarps\nYeah always felt where and they have the slides that holds than actually have\nSome place well they discovered that some of the color the enamel on the slides contains levels of lead that exceed federal limits as we all know that can be toxic how'd they found that out I have no idea", "show_name": "The Kuhner Report", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston",
