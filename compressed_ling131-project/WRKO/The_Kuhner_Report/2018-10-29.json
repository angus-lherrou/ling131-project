already we're talking about the events of the weekend and you know\nThe the talk everywhere is that the three acts of hatred that we saw in last week\nWe saw the grocery store a shooting two black men shot outside of the Kentucky a grocery store that happened last Wednesday and of course we saw the arrest that came about after mailing of these pipe bombs that happened friday and then what we had on Saturday [noise] show it does\nFeel like there is some kind of\nI don't I there's a movement across the country that is just hitting us against one another I don't know what it is I Can't put my finger on it I mean there have always been people who have been on the fringe who have been haters\nBut why do you that that is making this kind of thing and these kinds of individuals crawl out of the woodwork that's that's my question you've just said social media which I Do believe\nI Believe social media embolden people in a way that we never imagined when it first came to be\nIt allows people to be anonymous it it allows people to find like minded individuals where you may be couldn't find them if you were out walking on the street\nThis guy for example who shot up the synagogue you know he was on some obscure chat site that was just crazy so we thought exactly the same way he thinks something you and I wouldn't even know that eating fish to it because we wouldn't be looking for this kind of\nSocial media there's no question about that\nBut what about the role of our leaders end of the media because that's that's where fingers are being pointed\nAt it you know and and I think there's a I'm a ... legitimate charge that can be thrown\nLet's say in the case of ah first of all the the media I Do think that much like identity politics has become a huge part of a of the political strategy of our leaders where you\nYou take a slice of the electorate and you're going to tell them why somebody is is giving you the short end of the stick why you're being you know while\nI'm a ...\nWhere there's some sort of an injustice that is is being thrown you away\nSo that creates an anchor that creates a divisiveness but then the media has become you know MSNBC has its slice of the pie CNN as it slice Fox has its place\nAnd they keep playing to to those kinds of biases and ultimately I think Ninety nine to nine tenths of people can understand that ah yeah this is you know debate on steroids but then you get that one or two individuals those one or two individuals who\nDecide that they're going to take the next step in and go and shoot up a church issued a synagogue or or do something at a mosque or you know something at a high school it's um I you know it's it's I unfortunately I mean we hear about a lot every time there's one of these incidents\nHow do you get to those are mentally ill people before right they do the kind of damage that they do and with civil liberties and so forth and confidentiality you know there are a lot of people love it I

then you add the extra\nFuel to it with her you know through the media or social ... holds a dog whistles people start hearing these things and think it's a call to action right right and by the way on the on the political fun front in terms of our leaders\nIt definitely has a gone from decorum was a huge part of what the electorate expected now they're looking for the extra jolt of you know

I'm great thank you sir I\nJust wanted to make a quick comment you know you're you're absolutely right about eight and has got to stop and I did this no stop lights you know you just can't say it and then it goes away it's it's a behavior that needs to be changed and\nI mean I'm I cannot believe what's happened with the synagogue I'll be honest with you I was not going to rise to a African Americans that would shut\nA at a at a market whether right or that I\nI ... I don't have anything to say about I really was not like what happened or instance this there is a mental health problem in this country that is a greater than most people even have to admit I'm and I can see anybody can see that this kid crews\nThat are quote unquote I'll eat fell through the cracks cracks both we're ... we're not cracks or I mean you know and this guy he had Bowers wasn't running affiliations me for instance the er the guy that type of bombs out\nHe had all sorts of a backup information if you will or or evidence leading to his ... his way he bought his thought process that cetera\nUm I'm not sure about this policy seems like he was just a\nA spec on the wall you know no people no but\nYou know he didn't have any uh websites up or that I'm aware of you know similar to the guy that did the bombing things I mean right basically hated everybody but you know\nWell you know Alex ... is it turns out what they found out about him is that he he didn't participate in like Facebook or Twitter because they wouldn't allow him to be the kind of hate that he did so he was on these very obscure websites\nUh with with uh you know I'm a white supremacist and that kind of thing and it was a half a million um was it\nWas it have a Twitter for people that were banned anywhere right and he was on these kinds of so you and I would know anything about these Web sites because we don't go to that kind of stuff you know that's where I was with all of stealing his hailed\nThe government called on these websites well that's just thousands Eighteen is a keystroke\nSomewhere on the keyboard that you can get like a chapter this information I mean that this was kind of where it needs to go I mean I I Am a gun owner\nAnd I support the n._r._a. I support that that my right to carry a weapon et cetera and I'm not the only any craziness zero but I'm saying is is that uh you know the first thing I saw was marquee and his\nAh you know this this needs to stop and you know this cannot happen in a place of worship and I ... I mean I Know what his agenda or as I Know what the liberal agenda is and I bought for it but as Mr ... said you know there there's a time when we can come together and speak\nAnd walk away and say yeah you know you don't I see what you're saying now but I also see your point of view of it has to come to okay the grenades already and I'm all in the in the late I just I I don't know where we're going I think we're going to be this country's going to be defeated for more than mark my words you can quote me on that I'm not famous but\nNow like say you know I agree with all your comments on the last point though keep the faith because you know I think part of it is when one of these horrific incidents occur as\nHey good morning guys I mean this really if you're going to go where we've changed I mean the and Joe knows this the conservatives the the people the federalist society heritage ... they're not\nThey haven't changed much in their overall general message but if you go back to the mid Nineteen seventies you had the neo Nazis in Skokie, Illinois and they actually would defended at the Supreme Court by the American civil liberties union these were traditional liberals who didn't agree with the message but defended the right to say\nThe problem with that is that the left has been taken over by leftist progressive and there are no truth liberal left in the movement anymore I mean you literally had Hillary Clinton who was the de facto leader until another one is chosen of the Democrats say\nThat you cannot be civil with conservatives because they're looking to destroy your ideology in the way you live that is one of the most divisive thing that I've ever heard and old almost a call to be on civil and violent but it doesn't get any press\nGuys like Alan Dershowitz are true liberals he doesn't care what you have to say he doesn't agree with it you defend your right to say it that doesn't exist on the left any more\nMoney comes from these progressive the money on the conservative side is still coming from these big donors what traditional conservatives they're not looking to radicalize the money\nThat these fringe groups have is so minuscule they don't affect policy the money\nThat aggressive have the guys like style Soros Center for American Progress that money is turning the left into what we see today that's just the way it\nIs you don't find anyone defending the neo Nazis right to speak\nOn the left well Steve my my problem with what you had to say is just narrows down to something just very very small but it's that you are willing to just simply said that this is a left problem that's part of the problems\nThat we have in the well and good you can quote on the one thing she said that was not as bad as six things that Trump said the same day I mean that's the problem you know you're you're drilling you\nWant to wait you asked where this is coming from and I explained the difference in the in\nThe underlying ideology of where you're coming from tell me who won the right that is a major donor that is a old writer\nCompared to Tom ... who was an incredibly progressive left is and has no business being on CNN he doesn't even have any power you're not a politician he never was he's not a governor and he has no political influence our power and I\nAnd I couldn't tell them you know one could tell you a single thing Tom star stands for except he doesn't like Trump\nDid you see that's the that's the point you see\nHim but that doesn't make him elected are aggressive it makes him an enemy of the president said he is he [laughter] stop it and when you when you decide to characterize every one on one side is an extreme is like and say that it could be a problem on one side of the EU and literally just had already everyone on the left early Steve you literally just had that\nJim I said your ideology has been drifting so far to the left that it's now progressive in progressive don't accept a conservative the right to express his ideas that lead to violence what what what is wrong with that\nI Would jump in and say this Steve that\nWhen I see what's going on for example on college campuses and if you're right of center if you're a conservative than you are not being allowed to express yourself other other ... and if you do you do it at your own peril and and I think that's a sad commentary what\nPiece of property more than a college campus should be a place where there's tolerance and where you can exchange ideas and if you disagree with her as a person you can walk out of that room and still be friends instead of people are being stigmatized for defending Trump or for ...\nBy taking a conservative position now the flip side of that uh is you've got Madonna who stands up and says I thought many nights about blowing up the White House you you have other people who you know a former attorney general who's talking about kicking when they're low the point I'm saying is\nIt's happening on both sides and the situation is growing worse not better\nBut a big part of that is because of what technology has brought us where everybody thinks they're a broadcaster now and everybody thinks that they have the right to instantaneously slap somebody figuratively speaking for for disagreeing with them and then it takes that\nOne crazy person who takes it way too far and ends up ah wreaking violence on a a synagogue or something else but those are the the mental illness or a individual ... mentally ill individuals who given the wrong kind of atmosphere that they're dealing and then go off the deep end\n[noise] yeah I I just think that\nThe the idea that we can point a finger solely at one side is that whole problem here there's just no open mindedness to this at all I I think part of what he has said they're a portion of that is true\nBecause there is intolerance on the left no question about that but there's intolerance on the right\nI mean I've got we've got three situations in less than a week that I Would argue are probably three individuals\nWho stand on the right side not on the left three we had a man in ... Kentucky walk past white people saying I won't shoot why people he had just come from the predominantly black church\nWhere he tried to shoot it up but couldn't get in went to the Kroger and just ... randomly chose to black people white supremacists and I don't know a lot of white supremacist who are considered progressive\nThat's one and we got a guy who's in Florida\nWho is absolutely anti laughed and he has sent pipe bombs to fourteen different individuals\nThen we got a guy who goes into a synagogue who is also I Would argue all three mentally ill by the way because nobody nobody is of their right mind who does the things these people have died\nBut winning shot that place up and he too is a white supremacist and he's at now he wasn't the Trump lover by the way\nHe made that very clear but he also made clear of the state decide on which he stands any any had that many of his post so so the so I mean you you can't argue one side or the other we've seen things here that have been filing on both sides and that's where we all have to come together it's violence it's not right or left it's violence\nAnd by the way though just to the point though that the see the opposite side of the spectrum you had the uh\nThe congressional baseball practice going on and there are any sand is supported raising shoots up a a number of congressman so so so we're now left with the situation where\nThe media can play the role our elected officials can play the role citizens as citizens can play a role\nIn just turning down the anger factor don't turn down the passion turned down the personalization the anger because you don't want that one individual who was mentally ill and on the fringe on was using it as an excuse said it was a heroin shoe\n... exactly what it is bringing out of hatred and violence violence is\nViolence knows no color it knows no political values it's it exists and if we if we blow dog whistles\nTo bring these people out they find a cause for which just stand and then they're violent they'll they'll absolutely and I you know you you you gotta if you got to look at this in that way as far as I'm concerned you cannot look at this\nFrom a right or left perspective you've got to start looking at it as an American and ...\nAnd he got to start looking this is something that everybody has to take on and we got an issue\nIn by the way given that I probably\nYou know associate with maybe for every three person a third person as liberal I may be listening to two people who are who are conservative now if each day I only go back\nTo those places where I'm going to hear more and more of what I already think is is true and right then that just kind of reinforces oh how can these people be so wrong you know and so as\nA threat to our listeners out there every once in a while it's it's it's helpful to go listen to a point of view that is different than yours and and try to put yourself in in that person's the shoes as to why they view it that way\nYeah six and seven to six six sixty eight sixty age I'm Alone is here with me this morning it is seven fifty eight on this Monday morning October twenty nine [noise]\nBoy so Boston New York

I can handle this now\nI'll handle this for at least through ... November sex and boy he's out there when and and again taking questions from long period of time in in ... anything is in play is\nThat that's the flip side of it I Will say\nBecause the president has made the decision that what do you think is what he says the media's decided that what they want to know they're going to ask right so again this is that push and pull thing that's going on that we have somehow come to accept\nAnd as we know if you're a reporter or even one of the uh the the the ... the TV stations cable stations the ratings are great\nPeople say he's helping people uh have their their stock or go up a very handsome Lee in the in the media world because\nYou either love him or hate him you know used to be the days of Monday Night football with Howard Cosell you know in the broadcast that sets people tuned in to them they tuned in because they they loved them and uh I think we have that in the present\nThat for sure that we're talking about the mid term elections a week from tomorrow and a sort of your take is this a referendum on the president what do you think's gonna happen Richard in New Hampshire this morning hey we're chicken morning\nOr good morning good morning Joe good morning Kim running really gone Joe DiMaggio uh [laughter]\nUh I was thinking when you were just talking about comparing Obama's a news conferences with Trump's news conference\nTrump lets anybody and everybody out as many questions as they want it goes on and on\nAnd Obama would ask they would ask one question and he would punt chocolate cake cooked it you know twenty minutes and then somebody would say well that's it to buy and live in the media never complained about it they should have been raised in the heck about it but they never get I I Want to just\nSay a real reason that I was calling to say that\nYou know everybody complains about Trump and his ... and his commentary on his um criticize him quote what he says it says when he says it and and yet the media and the Democrats\nWere complaining about Trump on November ... two thousand sixteen they wanted him gone and if they didn't and they claimed he stole the election and then they claimed that he um um\nClaim that no one I mean do you stole the elections are they claimed that they stole the election yesterday did you ever do that no one going with all the election em you don't know where they're shocked he wound up\nWith a debate with two Gen but I'm not debate what free now that's wrong\nI I don't even understand what that means or\nYou should do it this way of you there now and I'm not going to do a debate with ... if you don't think that\nAnybody that the media didn't claim many many many many times that Trump stole the election what do you think is what do you think this um ... investigations all about exactly that that is what it was all about\nWell Richard the only thing I Would say you know ... ... ...\nThe only thing I'll say in your defenses I think that time and time again the media pointed out that he didn't win the popular vote is so if that's what you mean by stealing the election he didn't he didn't win the popular vote that down\nTo the Russian collusion about what was the Russian ...\nWe don't know yet so we're going to find out what else can we\nDo know because you don't hear about it any more now on a way\nIt's evaporating and he has now has\nA show so ... so it's fun to to Richard Stallman here I Would say this that when you had schools like a Harvard and a bunch of other colleges calling off clashes calling off exams the next day it's like was you know this kind of elected by the people in this country\nSo maybe they're not saying that it was rigged and what they were saying he sort of an illegitimate president and and that theme has continued to carry over now\nSometimes you can be his own worst enemy but when Ninety two percent of the media coverage is deemed by independent groups to be negative then then I think the media has got an agenda here and uh and I think the president you know and his very direct way decides he's going to punch bag with tweets\nAnd everything else that he does but I can tell you having grown up in politics in this state when the globe was at its heyday\nThey would rig polls they would you know come up with bogus stories if it was a Republican that had the least bit stumping of his toll it was a one week series that was a Democrat it was over and the Democrats beacon hell would laugh about it that says it's a one day story you know it it\nThere's a double standard there's no doubt in my mind\nOr good morning I'm kind of a couple of times um I Believe this election is a referendum on the soul of America and put put the economy aside because of money the right thing that we care about and we lost our way [noise]\nUm my daughter is a rape survivor and voted for the first time and twenty sixteen and was distraught when he was elected\nOr comment to me at ... night with mom if the president I it can be a sexually ferret I had no case that first the second thing is this guy I mean strip away the media strip away you know are there I mean there's so much chaos created\nLook at what he says his own mouth I mean why are we not doing that if my son is the way he did\nI'd be appalled\nAnd the second the last thing on my face you know oppose the um the horrible shooting in Pittsburgh he's calling for the death penalty\nRepublican Party especially the evangelicals why are you in because he was a pro life president I mean there's nothing pro life about the death penalty he's he's just a mess and I I'm just I'm I keep looking for Republican women to explain to me\nHow they can vote for him other than to say the economy is better that's the only response I keep getting for everyone needs to say about this so what are we tell our children what are we tell our daughters the man has admitted to sexual assault I can grab winning I mean\nOur women can look at that and think yeah you know what the guy that I can grab them in a cart ... their daughter what that meant that I Do not get it at all\nWill Murray let me let me say first off thank you for your call um secondly if you listen to the show on a regular basis you know I didn't vote for him that that issue right there for me was just that it was a non starter for me I Can't vote for someone who\nHas that I openly no has made those kinds of comments and I did\nSo I understand where you're coming from and I understand what your daughter is saying that let me go back to this issue of the economy I think if you look through time and through history\nWe have voted based on the economy time and time again a because in the end while the\nIssues that are you're talking about the soul of the country is so important I think that we look to our families first and taking care of our families first as Americans 'cause you have to that's your ... that's ... that's what you're on this earth to do take care of the people around you first\nAnd we can't take care of the soul of America if the economy is not good because you can't take care of your family and you can't take care of what's happening at home I think this is why people vote based on the economy time and time again they have to have a job they have to have food on the table they have to be able to take care of what's happening at home first\nAs they reach out to the rest of the country so while it may sound like we're all about money I don't think it's so much about money but it's about taking care of\nWhat you have to take care of in an effort to take care of the rest of\nThat and I would add to that you had a race between a Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton now with Bill Clinton's history and with the with Hillary acting has his number one defend in with three women claiming he didn't just\nA you know a make a Anwar unwanted sexual advances toward the ...\nThat he raped them and the ... media never covered it than these women to this day\nUh continue to make that charge and he ended up being this barred everything you went through and and she to this day when she was asked just recently about the Lewinsky situation she said oh she was a ah she was not a minder you know while she was in a situation where\nHe had a superior job position over\nHer in the oval office so my point is is not a black and white that Hillary comes from this you know pure as the driven snow world than Donald Trump comes from evil so\nWe had to really in my estimation we'd too bad candidates America can do better than either one of the show and I want to see better\nSo so I Would say this decorum side with Donald Trump we had a of the poor candidate on the policy side I think we had a good candidate who came\nInto his position as a strong candidate because people were so sick of the Washington swamp and it is a swamp fifties Islam has gone show oh no oh no but they but they you know what is least he's exposing how that system works down to\nThe counties surrounding Washington D. C. and now the most wealthy counties in America and they don't ban you\nExtra anything it's all about connections is all about driving our national policy based on who's putting the most money and a lobbyist pocket and you'll notice the mainstream media nobody in the media covers that why because lobbyists are the best sources of story so they just leave that old story untapped untouched\nIt's look I I Will I Will grant you the idea that I you know some of his policies\nHave worked for the country and I'm I'm happy about that and a time and I can tell you this is as a woman for ... and just like that one and it is very very hard for me to a ever imagined that I Would vote for him and I'm very clear about that I really am I wanted another Republican candidate [laughter]\nI really yet I I Want to John Case I think I was a John Case that gal I Wish I Would be today if he would run again um I just it's it's I understand why a lot of women I Know I don't speak for all women because a lot of women calling here and say to me you don't speak for me that's that's that's one of\nMy number one reasons for both voting for Donald Trump was that\nHe was willing to take on the the media that I think his ... guarded way too much power in this country and nobody held them accountable up until Trump came along\nAnd the CNNs and the world and everybody else they could destroy your candidate that they didn't like in a minute and and be held accountable by nobody in in in my opinion now people looking at the media through a different lens in recognizing\nThat story was an affair story and\n... well that is true and I think that that that has brought the media back into or it will bring them back to some level of accountability\nAnd again even even with the ah you know the the whole subject of of these are the sexual look you know advances being made and and uh inappropriate behavior\nI've saw Barbara Walters when the woman came up with the book she had attended we in a in that said you know I was an intern and Jack Kennedy took me up to as a bedroom the first time he met me and ah it took my virginity and Barbara Walters says\nHow do you think Caroline Kennedy feels that you've written this book don't you don't use ... thinking about her feelings\nAnd nobody in the mainstream media said she had to resign for that is ridiculous I worried about Caroline you know so and I mean these things certain things get brushed under the Carr horse aid to other things ... bond with such focus that is crazy so let me go to Paul in ...\nGood morning a joke or it's again thank you for your courage as running at a state rep in Crossville it'll carnal\nOh it's a great man and not looking forward to voting for\n... a great guy but my comment is against it ever truck you have what's it yet\nKim ... thanks for one or that have a dirt are Trump ... before the ... is a swamp rabbit dropper if he had dirt are Trump\nRussia at the up before the ... that's why he's keeping it he's not ethical he's not moral for people in jail Massachusetts where you didn't commit a crime\nAnd they refused to let them out so cut the crap you're ever trauma to\nHope I am and never try or you're right I Am and I'm very clear about that I won't vote for him to get I didn't vote for him and I won't I and I'm not ashamed of that and that it makes you feel better to call me that and be nasty\nMan's okay I Would argue that would have voted out of prison after she was someone yeah but having said that I live with their own\nShow or never balance showstopper ... it was single or weight watcher caught why don't you have a shorter Kate only struck\nBecause they're not the president tapes\nThe ones that cause the whole Russia collusion crap that narrative ... ... ... who sit there and that's just not oh you know we don't\nWe don't call it in ... and that doesn't necessarily mean hall thank you for calling this a little odd for you to be calling other people out and not being open minded Paul I'm Sorry\nMy issue is just that Paul just hold off\nMy that's my answer I'm not saying that that necessarily\nWhat ... is going to come forward with he's got to be bad for the President Bush's pulled off and see where it goes we don't know yet there's time let's just see what happens here and where it goes so far he's he's put some people are behind bars that I think God needed to be put behind bars into things I didn't like\nPlus just let's give it a shot [noise]\nIt's a fifty nine here that are kept\nThe voice of Boston New York about one hundred and twenty seven till you see like eighty to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise] mama\nMorning on Nick Bovey W.\nR.

Donald Trump is the most [laughter]\nWe talk about his everyday Donald Trump is the most interesting politician I mean if I could just take\nIf I could take the good of him and put it into another person to get ... get rid of the bad that I don't like but for me I just it just gets so frustrated and angry about uh the way he goes about things why can't they just I think the fulltime joke why can't he just stayed with the good and put the bad away\nFor example I don't know whether we were talking about it on the air or off the air but Jim brought up the fact that he's tweeting about the Dodgers manager keeping the pitcher and the game too long and you know it's like\nMr President you don't need to dwell into every issue and you don't have to attack LeBron James and so forth and you know but I I honestly believe he will run for reelection and it'll go reelected and it comes back to that idea\nThat people love the fact that he policy wise not only as lead our country and some correct directions but he has fought for those policies as opposed to some presidents George W. Bush famously said\nWell I'm going to spend a little bit of my political capital to make some things happen in my second term\nTrump doesn't think of it in terms of political capital he turned thinks of it like a real estate developer which is why is it broken and what are we going to fix it so I can I make money off of it well I'm not sure about that I I I don't I think he's lost money since

tweeting if he would stop saying he was doing you know you don't look at it if they ...\nYeah you just have to live with the big picture I mean look at all the steps in his garden dark North Korea and

much\nExercise should it be and it's been fun yeah it's fun is out of last year some very passionate about very a well\nInformed callers absolutely appreciate them every day and uh so thank you guys are for calling in being a part of the show today I'll be the has the morning off he'll be back tomorrow morning me time we we've talked about politics here but we got we had a circle back we've only got a half an hour let's we got to talk about abs on on ... city today\nJust a short time ago guys a and B should check it out Red Sox raised\nThe world series banner at Fenway Park so it up its official it is official that doesn't count 'til they get that band or up right [noise] oh we have made the announcement or that it looks like the parade will be on Wednesday morning\nUh probably starting at eleven o'clock on the boats and that is Halloween and the weather is supposed to be pretty good at least the weather is supposed to be very nice which would be awesome to have a parade when the weather's you know my my most vivid parade moments are those of the patriots when needed so cold that you can't you know move\nRight right in the late February [laughter] really I guess early February right so uh but it looks like that parade is coming on Wednesday so that is something to be very excited about\nA and we're still waiting it doesn't look like the patriots are I keep saying patriots I'm Sorry 'cause I'm looking at a thing about the patriots playing tonight it doesn't look like the red Sox are on the ground yet\nStill waiting for them to land here but it is very foggy\nAnd ah you know maybe taking them a little bit longer and I don't think they mean they wanted eleven Fifteen they weren't off that field or even remotely close to that before one o'clock in the morning right to India and all kinds of celebrations going on so\nSo you know my thought on all of this though is\nThe the great\nPublicity and imagery that's been brought to Boston through all of these ah championships and it's no coincidence now that you know you see kids want to come to college you know they always did but even more now\nKids want to stay here and work in our city and in a state that it really just adds a tremendous image to the community and the one that you know uh when I'm traveling um\nI'm proud to say I'm from Boston for a lot of reasons but not the least of which is the sports teams that really brought such a great joy to everybody\nWho it is interesting that they have to have to wonder this right that they have been so successful does one feet off the other how can we have all this success\nI absolutely I think you know competitive athletes are who see the the cue the celebrations and see the the kind of a\nA approach that's taken by one team to achieve the greatness that they do let's say it's the patriots\nThan it inspires the next scene that's come along to say hey we can get that done too and pretty much use the same formula to get there and I think it's always cool when you see opening day or whatever after the patriots won the super bowl the ...\nIf you went to the pets are there you know oil at Fenway Park to to them applauded and that's it all seems to to mix well very nicely\nSo let me ask you is that a competitive athletes are competitive owners\nBoth [laughter] I Know you've got owners\nWho are well we're now wait a minute I'm going to bring just equally as much to the end you notice\nI mean all of these guys in in ladies who ah in the leadership of these teams I mean there\nSo I like the the old days where it was passed down from one family member to another I mean these these are people know how to run a business and know how to attract talent out to assess talent all of those kinds of things you know when\nThey said earlier when the Celtics bringing a guy like Danny Ainge that's a huge decision you know and have that same with the the the the personnel people in the rest of the teams you know the players you're picking a\nA going to decide whether or not you're going to have a championship parades or you're going to be cello dwellers now how you just have ending that money has oil business decisions\nI and I got to tell you I Would argue and you you said this earlier but it is so true\nUm we really I Know that the outside world you know look thin and says all those Boston people again you know they're they are when another championship that's when that's when they're being ... that's ... cleaned that up um but I Will tell you they do bring money these teams and these owners\nUm they spend a lot of money in their teams and they make a lot of money but boy they bring a lot of money to our economy into our you know you you're so right about that and you know pets even I I really do think that even plays the part when\nCompanies are looking at places to bring their their businesses you know it's just part of the appeal for that community it's about winning atmosphere\nYou know I mean you look at highlights on ESPN or from some of the of the baseball stadiums around the country and for every seat that's filled that seems to be three seats that are right you look at Fenway Park highlights it's jam\nPacked the patriots had as I I I I've seen a lot of ... yeah yeah so uh it just brings a lot of\nMoney to our community and so I think all of us should be appreciative\nWe'll just fix the weather there were a little shook him and then bam we live we live in a really fabulous place [laughter] well that is\nI Know that for the for Fox certainly you know having those two major television markets in this series had it's been terrific and I think very anxious I really haven't seen many of the ratings I Want to look that up and see how they have fair but
