and seven to six sixty eight sixty eight that is our number Paul mentioned before we went to the break um you know people who in the future who make\nAnd they turn out to be false in situations like this one not that he was saying that professor Ford has done that and he made that very clear he he's not saying that she did but they need to be penalized in the way I see that is it that\nThat's like making a false police report finally ... you absolutely it's proven that you've made some kind of accusation against someone\nIn a public forum like this where someone's reputation is on the line you've cost taxpayers lots of money and you've taken up a ton of time and it proves to be completely false\nThan you should you should face consequences but I don't think that's the case here when it comes to professor Ford and I don't think that taking a week\nTo just answer a few more questions related to what's going on this Kavanaugh situation is a bad thing so I was happy to see what happened on friday having said that I Do think when the weekend rolls around some decisions are going to have some really hard decisions are going to have to be made because you cannot allow this to keep going on and on\nIf nothing has changed over the course of the week\nThen devote should take place period now whether\nYou know whether flake and and the others decide that they're going to vote in favor of uh this nomination that's going to be up to them whether they've decided they'd gotten enough information but you have to make a you have to vote you cannot or I guess on Thomas in Brockton good morning county\nGood morning Jim how are you I'm super thank you sir\n[noise] you know to me uh this is just delayed delayed delayed delayed until uh hopefully\nAfter the election if there is the alleged blue wave that takes place\nThen I'm going to stymied president a President Trump for putting\nA conservative on the court does all this is about\nAnd I just find it very hypocritical that two U.S senators set up there as holier than those one Cory Booker who admitted to sexually harassing a woman in college to bloom and fall to sit there and quote some sort of Latin phrase\nAbout honesty I Can't I Can't fully paraphrase it but\nHe out no lied about his service in Vietnam he was never in Vietnam and he portrayed himself as a Vietnam veteran that was overseas so I just can't stand these people\nYou know five vote among the court by the way oh\nOkay well listen I get it yeah you're right you're right and these people stand in judgment of other people and you know standing in judgment of other people is a hard thing you know because [laughter] who among fest doesn't have things in our past and some of 'em are much more dramatic like the two that you just mentioned\nBut be that as it may I mean ... it the Democrats are not the ones who really and truly right now that are holding up this nomination and keeping him from being on the court it's Republicans\nI mean in the end right now is Republicans who are not voting in favor of this justice so you can blame it on the Democrats but that's not who is doing it right now let me go to a rich rich he's in lemon start good morning\nIt was like those of you he was shot me last night right\nYeah I mean the bottom line here is in my opinion that you know she had no recollection of the time place and then\nIt it it's like so accused of somebody doing something to say but I don't remember the day I mean how believable let's say I mean you can't you have this memory for thirty five years ago but you can't remember the day and somehow six guys supposed to go down because she didn't have that information\nI mean the other part of this show which she lied about not wanting to get on a plane show or a fool I mean something happened to this woman\nShe hit him it online that Bobby I got a dispute you there I mean yeah she\nShe didn't want should atmosphere of flying okay and they got caught you go in and you go there you\nGo okay well that generally you don't have a fear of it and by the way it was in her who said she was she was not coming to Washington was her attorneys who said that\nShe was asked and she was very open about that when she was under oath they asked her why don't you get here she said on an airplane she said you know I I Wish they could have come to California she went on to say I I Know\nWhy she had to be coached to get on that plane\nOkay but she said well why have you with us all why do you take issue with that she did do a\nShow that you\nLike like a big thing went up on the plane about sixty times well that's that's not a region that that was just lay in being interviewed\nBut why she couldn't get out now why why did that matter\nIn check fix this whole thing is a tactic\nI I I ... I agree with ... and early\n... all the people that have already given sworn deposition changes story on the ancient\nFirst the perjury I I I don't know you really think that\nI think the answer is that they haven't been asked everything they made statements but those statements weren't weren't uh they didn't have to expand on that was that's the difference when you're interviewed versus somebody making a statement\nWell I I mean if there's going to be a lot of nothing\nOkay and maybe it will be and maybe it will only and then they'll all day\nAnd the people and the Republicans which ... which are the backbone to vote on this damn thing about what you do for this\nAnd by the way you remember about it you do remember it is the Republicans were holding this up\nStay yeah you got it because they don't have a backbone\nSo when you talk about delay tactics it's a Republican who or keep it from being voted on ...\nBut the facilitating the filet Jeff Flake facilitate it they'll go away by or what he did okay and this guy back when we talk with them like this big money is a buddy I mean up sharply this whole thing's a joke\nWell you know you can you can say there was a delay you can you can say that she doesn't like to fly and whatever by the way again under oath she didn't lie about that I'm looking in fact I'm looking right now at the testimony about it\nAnd she did not lie about it she she never said that she didn't come to Washington she herself never said she didn't come to Washington on that Monday\nAs opposed to for Thursday because of flying it was her attorneys who said that under oath she said\nUh that she certainly unfortunate when asked how did you get here she sat on an airplane\nAnd she said that unfortunately she had to do that because she doesn't like to fly but when asked\nIf she'd gone to you know uh Hawaii whatever whatever she said yes she had and she had to fly frequently unfortunately yeah I mean she wasn't really made it very clear that she didn't want to be doing what she was doing that she\nWas not comfortable was didn't would rather not be involved in this at all\nMhm but she didn't lie under oath about that situation and again I Know I Know that everybody's frustrated and thinks this is a big a delay tactic but it's the Republicans who made this decision\nLet me go to Richard he's in brain tree good morning\nGood lawyering thank you for taking my call um first of all um I don't see what this whole at one time the game by making these accusations and and the demeanor in Norway testified Kavanaugh ... it looked like it was on him I mean\nI don't think I Want someone Supreme Court with that type of demeanor\nAnd he showed no humility whatsoever\nHe acted like he was titled they kept interrupting to shut up those um I just don't get the main problem to be on the highest court in oil and you know I'm I'm sixty six years old and I did a lot of creating a in a while I got on a fishing I never did anything like that\nAnd I didn't want to do anything like that has no place on the Supreme Court\nAnd you know they say he'd been bed at six different times a lower court ... court or you don't really get advertised you never know what's going on all over the course and don't make is not a big deal like Supreme Court\nAnd that's one of the reasons why it probably didn't come out she seen this guy right on a Supreme Court and she felt that she should tell her story and I I I Want to do I have water doing\nNow people would argue that yeah he looked unhinged by the guy fighting for his uh his life\nBut again if she act the way he did she would have been\nCalled hysterical that's that is true that is that is absolutely true Murray is in Salem good morning Murray\nMorning um I have doubts in to the radio than I something happened to me forty five fifty years ago I was about six years old I remember\nEvery single detail I can tell you that time to play the why what I had on everything I find it hard to believe that she was in high school and had\nCan't remember a lot of\nUm stun loves this thing or the events that had happened and\nI also feel that maybe ... she was at a place where she wanted to be

Tennessee exactly yeah let me go to Mike in New Hampshire this morning my good morning\nA warning um I\nI I think she's overeating or should she I think she's misinterpreting what is going on I think the reason that squeaked out was because of the\nThe blowback from this these Kavanaugh hearings I think she ... I think she thinks that women are out in droves and that meant that time of the you know the age of man is coming to an end\n... what ... saying you know how to play the old you know first woman president card again and I I\nThink obviously she's got a when there's no question she's going to win the match me I feel bad for jak seems like a good guy but mass is going to get worked over again but it there's no question she's going to win\nBut if she sees what happens in the midterms which I ... that I think you're going to happen which is I think the Republicans are going to crush a lot of these red state\nDemocrats that are running for reelection and the fact that I think if she when she sees what takes place in how the the blowback from ... from these hearings is going to destroy I think a lot of the narrative the Democrats are pushing I think she may she may reconsider which is why she didn't go full bore but shit lately she's been\nVery close to her when she went pretty close to full bore MIKE SHE really ... she's\nBeing on it to being on it and I look\nJust come out and say I have no interest in representing back I have bigger aspirations I'm bigger than that some better than that and you all know it just made on it I mean that's what she thanks so don't lie to people and people may actually respect there more than they do that's a problem with everything going on right now in Congress\nWithout\nLosing your and generally there can we leave it right there well she may be honest but you know sometimes there there's times when um [noise]\nThat kind of full blown honesty is not necessary she doesn't have to say that right now she really doesn't ... it's just raised it to her I that's how I see it it's disrespectful it really is let me go to bill bills in Providence ... [noise]\nYeah it's a good morning I'm there's a word um and uh got in it I mean for to just come out like that and basically hit me like you're getting married to a woman\nWho is you know you know Tony I'm only going to be there for you about your four years until something better comes\nAlong that line is getting a divorce then and I plan to marry him [laughter]\nAnd and the other thing is it like we have a right as as soon as soon as the state of Massachusetts to know well who will be our senator if you become president you know I mean not that I Believe she will ever will be like\nWell and I I I don't know what the strategy is because I'm obviously it was a kid with a different strategy but I Do think\nUm I ... just like in in in a business you have to find people who want to buy your product you were the product who are the people who want to buy the product so I think that's what you do as a a political campaign as you look at and find who uh subscribes to your message and who ... who you want to overeat because you\nHave to get them to go to the store that day you got to learn to get out and vote and uh you know he did that certainly in the primary so you know he but now comes the numbers and to see how are you going to compete I'm against her and where are her votes coming from and you know and I've I've you know communicated with Jeff\nShowed up at the unity breakfast or you know the Saturday after the election and said you know she can be beat so you know keep going keep keep them because she can BP\nIs six or seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight if you are on Elizabeth Warren supporter love to hear from you this morning as well because I'd like to know what you think about her making these comments\nIt best if I was Jeff deal I Would take those comments and put 'em in every TV ad that I have yeah I think I Would make literally responded everybody has heard that her intention\nIs to run now to run later\nYep and leave Massachusetts voters behind right and and I think he responded right away and said hey you know why don't you actually stepped down if you want to want to run for president step away right you step out or you're saying yeah a\nPower to ya you know look she's got every right to run for president if she wants to run for president again without being a senator sure absolutely but she wants this national platform as as you said earlier\nI'm so she's got she wants to hang on to this seat for that reason [noise] um and that does that leaves Massachusetts voters behind that somebody was texting I'm Seventy one who says well how would you feel about it if she announced this after she wins\nWell I don't think anybody thinks she's not going to announce I don't think it's been a surprise but I Would you know I Would I don't know I Would just see it as less arrogance rave she did it in February of Nineteen or for that matter May of Nineteen even if she's out there you know versus the water versus today\nBefore November the sex right because it is kind of like the ... just you know the the arrogance of it all just saying like I'm assuming I'm going to get reelected and so let me just you know the right and I think the telling thing is this is what she has had in her head\nAnd as we just discussed off yeah when the moments when the emotional moments of their when she's feeling pretty good about\nHer audience and it's kind of the raw raw and that does happen when you're ... you're up there you're talking and you get the feedback from the audience you feel good you about your message and so these things come out of her mouth\nAnd [laughter] and and it's ... it's in her head and has been her hair and but yeah and it's just but\nHow do you make your truth don't you [laughter]\nReally you comes out and and but but being mindful though\nShe should know that every word and especially in today running for office which is the difficulty of and all that everything you say neither is recorded or will come back to you and so did she not think that a comment like this was going to be a little I think she did it [laughter]\nI I mean I uh she may not have at the\nMoment but I think she has no one will always\nBe one thing we will say about her that she she certainly has made she said herself up for a national stage mhm so it's not surprising that when she made these comments and she had to have known that was going to happen\nUm maybe she didn't anticipate it would be right now but she got excited and she said it but it it's been headlines on national news and across the country since she made the comments so I think the interesting question is though to if she says\nI'm In needs to be you know White House ... and we saw what happened the last election and she's making the assumption that her personality is the personality that's going to write in\nAnd you know her supporters are from you know California and New York\nI mean it'd be interesting to see what the break down a is in her donor base and where they come from sugar and to kind of take your what you look at them as consumers and say you know what do they care about and see where they you know to really do the announces I have not done that [laughter] but it'd be interesting to see where they are\nWell she would you know her stand like Bernie Sanders I mean she\nShe would have to go out there and find those extreme blue voters I mean because I I'm from Missouri and Elizabeth Warren is not going to fly in Missouri she's just not that's not the kind of a\nCandidate even if they're looking for a woman that sounds kind of care that they would vote for it and then ... says she's not going to go these campaigns they're long\n... long nine times change and bass I I Am if I was running for office I have to be honest with you I Would be so calculated in this because\nI think that's part of that the process has gotten so long and so that we learn too much about these people ...\nBy the time election day rolls around I find I don't want anyone because I eat we we've run these people in the ground and Elizabeth Warren is someone that I Do truly believe\nThat if the nation comes to know her for too long a period even people who like hurricane I like her I I'm just being on it was that she's not she may be a very smart woman I'm not going to take that away from wherever sure\nI I just don't think she has kind of personality that wears for a long period of time well and I think we have to see 'em\nWhere she stands and some of her policies as a nation I mean we can talk about where she's the of course you know Massachusetts although I have to say in in the campaign most of them were more national then Massachusetts yeah centric policies so I'm ... and whether the country agrees\nI'm not sure she knows what's going on Massachusetts half life right she is very nationally center I mean there's no two ways about it yeah\nKnow taking that position on the national stage and um and she's comfortable in that let me get a wreck works in Boston this morning hey\nGood morning wreck they killed ... daughter Eliza let's go ahead and those are so that's okay\nI'm going to everything from this is where your own honest opinion and all that Elizabeth Warren\nIs nothing more than ... older or so ... when the Democratic party look the whole going to replace aspirin I write a certain group of people and I also ... because so open change but the two two\nGoing until they see this country into a culture that we will recognize any more than a lotta have radical characters on the Supreme Court I still stay open borders\nOrange socialism more legal immigrants coming into our country logo change even cook legally openly aboard or the constitution at least changing okay\nAll a boat showed I don't know what changed as long as it's good to ...\nWhen it comes to a point where we want to rule in our country\nMost of these progressive than not American exceptionalism\nThat's one of those I hate the whole America great again because they don't even believe America is that great of a conscience but they want to ... to their own ideology\nSuburban neighborhoods are going to ask you this is we got over one would illegal immigrants and although certainly all little label it could turn the total someone else out the door\nI still want to look almost all that you don't like what the United States was not a third world countries and those people are not going to pull my own opinions and believes I looked at lunch and thank you very much for taking my call\nThank you for your call well I don't I'm not sure why he would think that I find it hard to have that anyone anybody even if you don't agree with one political you can't seriously believe that she wants to make the country awful and tear up the Contra no constitution I mean\nI I don't think she wants to make the country awful I think her view of the country may be different than different members actually vote for who are listening\nI'm and this is the this is the beauty of our country and then we go out and make decisions as to who we want to run I mean I'm ... I Can't stand the president I don't think that he got into office the going well I just love to turn the country to cry\nAs ... as the intentions are both eyes every gesture political right different absolutely right motives different thoughts different policies seven fifty eight here at W.

I don't think this is going to go all that much further I think the people who have spoken are going to say the same thing they've already spoken because most of them have signed affidavits\nAnd we're not going to learn all that much more so if you think that he is a judge who is capable [noise]\nUm and if you don't have an issue with what you saw last week\nAnd you're looking at this strictly as you're saying the rule of law and I think you have to vote for him because I think he is a qualified judge ... yeah I think that's\nWhere it probably will shake out and when watching the the hearing\nAgain everyone was every senator on either side we just reiterating that same thing and then again you kinda take it back look at what is the over arching motive here and and put this in perspective and it's um\nIt can color your opinion mhm because you're saying okay well is is is just the Elizabeth Warren I'm going to stop at all costs ... or is this are the Democrats really caring about you know Dr fours and her experience and is there some foul play here right\nThat really [noise] well I mean regardless regardless it won't make I don't think that's going to in the end that will make all that much difference there is a Democrat and less Joe Manchin comes over and that's only because of that's only for political policy is right it's all of our tax write it if it's gonna be the only reason that he comes over for the same reason all of these\nDemocrats aren't going to vote for him because a lot of that it's just politics and the\nParty line taking the ... it's interesting I just um when a person who is supportive of me and my campaign sent me a book called the centrist manifesto and just like I'm finished reading that and I felt like I could have written that book I mean I just feel like we have to\nNever going to make progress in this country unless you can make progress with the other party\nRight and which do you think that both the interesting thing about that I don't know if you saw Jeff Flake last night on sixty minutes they did not but he was asked would you have done this if you were running again and he said absolutely not right and he said the reason is because there's no\nThere is no collateral to be gained by stepping cross the aisle and that is problematic\nWell and again advocate for term limits because\nAnd all you got to clean this up those behaviors I change when they don't feel like their re election is at risk and and in this you know centrist area it's ... you have you can come up with the best solutions from both parties\nAnd there are a lot I Would say if you're not twenty yard lines from the goalposts we have a lot in common and it's unfortunate especially when I just went through ... going through a primary and the only way I'd be able to be successful is if I did not have people in a primary which is sad because I say primaries bring out the best and kidneys but it's because\nThe primaries especially ones you know two days after Labor Day or whatever a dancer and ... you know it is the most um you know passionate activists people who come out to vote sure and those are the people who are just\nOn more extreme absolutely they're inning in those areas let me go to Jason he's in trucks for this morning hey Jason good morning\nIs demonic I wanted to say that\nI Believe Feinstein it if she isn't it's problematic I think for her age it whatever that is that she doesn't know what's going on around her if yeah if you don't want to blame the first step of the one that released this information the name of a ... year but\nI Will vote for Twenty years or her personal chauffeur and ate the camp has been like a Chinese Nationalist by\nWell I I I'm not aware of that Jason I it's a ... yeah yeah yeah\nWhich is a guy and he was I I I think he's being investigated and read this happened about two months ago\nWhere you're where did you hear that Jacey it did you read that somewhere sir\nYes ... if you want to go go yourself you can look it up\nTo ... thank you for your call Jason I you know when it comes to a defined sense situation again I'm I was just quoting what Lindsey Graham said yesterday Lindsey Graham said you know again that he's known her for a long time and you believe that she was trying to protect 'em Dr forwards\n... ... and she was trying to protect her but somebody else wasn't but you know there were a lot of people who touched that letter I'll take my ... my\nMy my thinking on this is that a Lindsey Graham was probably trying to come back around because he was pretty tough and hearing so now it's kind of like trying to you know say okay you know Feinstein you know whenever I'm sure but I have a hard time believing\nThat staff would leak something that the big Boston Nobel [noise] oh it's a pretty dramatic thing to leak of a hard you know\nThen we'd never bet adjusts on each side is perfect for both you and your partner experienced this link number back next was that we're one of their five hundred and fifty stores nationwide\nChecked him out its lead number dot com slash and Dr\nEvery morning we learn something new about Kim\nAnd we'd be when I was saying he was a large man I met his Hi [laughter] this morning show have believe I just so that out a W. R. K. O.\nThe euro in W. R. Kaomi quick reminder that coming up at nine thirty\nDean Martin coming to see is is that your bill\n[laughter] you're not actually coming in the right here on the phone okay well well well of course we won't know if he's dean Martin or not read the Martin is ah the the the reports of his are passing are greatly exaggerated right Jim\nUh it's actually drew Anthony Andrew Anthony isn't impersonator actually kind of looks like him to ride or even made sure that he looks like him\nAnd he's going to join us he's got the show coming up and Lynn on the twentieth of October and he's going to join us and we're going to be given away tickets so uh that's going to be kind of a fun thing so we'll be chatting with through Anthony coming up\nAt nine thirty in the meantime ... we're talking with Beth Lindstrom who's been in this morning filling in for VP you took the day off\nAnd helping us make our way through all of that's going on in the world\nI I that's the thing that I was asking our viewers earlier a regardless of what might happen this week\nWhen it comes to Brett Kavanaugh on this investigation\nShould a vote take place on friday evening or Saturday morning so let me let me lay out the ... so nothing happens more than what we know\n... than a vote takes like if there if it's inconclusive and they're still question marks should've vote take place if we find out that more investigation needs to occur should vote take place\nI think that's a tough thing because you know that's the motive of the Democrats to delay\nAnd so anytime you try to answer that question it's like oh\nYou know because you want to move on you want to be able to secure this as a Republican I'm you want to be able to do this and not have it go beyond the midterms and and it's all about control Aaron that's what the tough thing about politics is right it's all about control\nSo um but you know a a [noise]\nOne would say you want to have all the facts right right so um so what so with the delay\nWhich I Know is not what is certainly what are Republicans want to do but if you don't have the votes well so yeah I mean but also the preponderance of evidence I think you know at some point how much more\nRight sure and I think that's the question and I and I'm not a lawyer and would not even act like I have enough legal intelligence to say\nUm you know we need to do here there and there but I think at some point you've got to say okay\nWe can keep on spending our wheels or we can keep on digging in search insure or when you say look at\nYou know here's we know what the motive is let's set a date and everybody do what you can up until that date and then do what you can in terms of the amount of evidence and information that you need to make the vote and make your best\nVote so what at what point does the president say okay uh I got to move on but ... he doesn't have the votes\n... so it's gone on to you know it's gone on to the ... to the full Senate which they're holding it but as of last friday for the full Senate would have voted tomorrow they wouldn't have the votes so if\nOn friday of this week they're still question marks and they still have the votes is there a point where the president has to say\nWe had to move on to another nominee because\nI don't want this to keep going any further I I Want someone in place before January one Egypt decision right to say okay if we're going to do this but I think all of that push pushes you beyond\nThe mid term elections anyway so again you're getting ready to what other motives were Democrats are wanting it what are the motives to you know cut and do something different so Jim's chip said\nThis has said to me on numerous occasions 'cause I've said you know even if the president would decide at the end of the week that they don't have the votes and he's got to move on uh you can't you're not going to get somebody in the seat before you're not November six but as Jim said regardless of the makeup of the Senate\nUm it'll still be the same until January one or whatever the date is right\nSo ... gym is right about that so there could there could and would be enough time for another for another nominee to come through so is there a cut off date you think in the president's mind where he says we don't have the votes we got to go or does he ride this thing out\nI don't know and I'll you know just kind of thinking about this now the asked the question I mean is there again everything is strategy right and you think well jeeze maybe there are some nominees that would you know make Democrats shaking their\nPants more than Brett Kavanaugh right yeah and again considering that there's not enough evidence and nothing can be proven that happened to Dr ... so I'm you know maybe that's a strategy saying okay well hey if you don't want this one may want to now I don't I don't know um\nBut I think your question is at what point does the president but is it is it\nThe president that says that or is it just like oh well that's I mean I can withdraw his nomination you know I I I see and so the idea of withdrawing his nomination the president has said he's sticking with him period but at some point or maybe the or maybe the president says\nIt doesn't matter to vote any way and if you don't have the votes than the president can say I stuck with him mhm you people did not and then we're done and and what does that say to the country\nAbout this process well again it's just a yeah it's a ... and then I think that that is what has made\nMe feel so uncomfortable is that who else will say yeah I I Want to go through the confirmation process you know let me step up\nWell you know people have said that over and over but I'm a firm believer in the idea that everybody thinks that they're they they're different though\nYou know if that was the ... who would ever run for office right now major jury [laughter] I mean I think everybody sort of goes yeah well Brett Kavanaugh um had a hard time and I'm just using him as an example 'cause he ranked sample that exist but I could get through it and I wouldn't have any problems so\nI think we'll never have any problems you know they like to use that as an excuse I don't think I think I don't that feels that way cause I fully\nAdmit I Would never never oh but there's there's way too a lot of\nLike well yeah there's a lot of Neil Gorsuch is out there I mean it's ... it's gonna sail right through and you're very qualified to do so look I have said this over and over I don't know why anybody would be the president's press secretary why in the world would you do that\nBut people keep lining up people will do it I you know I mean because for me they think for me it'll be different\nWell you know and Kim is on that list circle back to something that we talked about a little bit earlier when you said about getting into the race to run for US Senate I mean as someone who\nWas not I wouldn't say calculated in the strategy to run I mean I really ... it took a while to say okay I'll do this\nBecause truly you know I lost a close friend and that you know life changing moment makes you think about your purpose in life and so truly that was a motivator for me to literally I was not something I was planning on doing you know for the past\nFour years or so sure so when you think about it how does the person who wants to get in the race because they want to do good things and offer them so of course public servant\nHow does that happen then when you have to be so you know strategic in what you're doing the same thing you know as these these confirmation hearing some you've got to thinking your whole life that you know you will\nSail through these uh you know next question and then hopefully that will be the case I just to me it just kind of left a pretty sour oh he's\nA tough part is if Brett Kavanaugh doesn't get through um they're still going to be an open seat and this is still going to have to continue and and that seat that will be filled a it is eight fifty nine year on W. R. cap [noise]\nVoice of Boston and you walk\nWorking about one hundred point seven till UCLA HD to Boston and heart radio station [noise]\nHow much involvement does the White House have over the cabinet investigation good morning I'm Nick Bobi W. R. kale new White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says the White House is not micromanaging the FBI investigation process into Brett Kavanaugh was NBC's ... reports sources familiar with the situation confirm\nThere are limitations on the investigation\nTop of mind and why isn't um you know there's some more deeper thinking and and again you might say well it's a football game you know this was happening and it's just you know is is a major\nBut I think this begs just part of what we were discussing too is that some of this has to change some of this thinking some of this um\nThat this is acceptable right now again I have three boys and sometimes when one of the boy says something and and it's like mom really I said no I don't think you need to use that language I don't like to use that language and I think as as a mother it's my job role to say here's where I think it's unacceptable and I don't like it um you know\nThe same example here where the coach ... is is this\nLanguage is acceptable is it set in the locker room is this kind of just a swell\nAnd some other right Jeff I think there's a I think there is a mentality out there you know that um it's boys who will be boys and you say these things and uh and that's okay 'cause he's a rough and tumble football coach and that's what they do and they\nSpent and they you know and I don't think it's acceptable anymore and quite frankly that is not not only is that\nExcept the ball because it's offensive to women but I think it's offensive to a lot of men as well but that's certainly\n[laughter] I I understand I have a son who plays football on the collegiate level and I don't expect\nHim to at this stage of the game learn how to be a gentleman from his football coach more any of them are coaches anymore that that horses left the barn but at the same time there is a certain amount of a reputation and respect that should come from the football coach that is that emanates down to ...\nBecause that is any CEO that's anybody's rich running their leader right and he's a leader not only for the Seventy some odd young men who play Football Under him but for his coaching staff\nFor he's a leader at that school this is a man who makes a half a million dollars a year again he is one of the higher paid people in this state the taxpayers are paying he's\nSpeaking out on behalf of that university\nAnd using the term like that is just inappropriate and the time has come to stop doing it well I think you can\nBe tough you can be aggressive in the game of football but you need to know that until it in a place exactly and rape is not a time or a place for any place I don't care what it is somewhat ... suggested that you know he could have used terms like absolutely mugged\nI okay I don't know are rude yeah that's right I would've I would've I would've been much more acceptable to me but I mean in and it's just so odd that at this time in\nOur world is going on you truly in the hash tag me to write it why why is that when\nFriday we it's Thursday and friday we saw what was happening in capital on Capitol Hill that everywhere you turn whether it was on the radio on television or if you pick up your newspaper we're talking about sexual assault and then he comes out and says that a call was bad and that somebody was\nThat we were raped and I'll tell you I'm On a whether fleas or campaign people or whatever I Would have said be mindful being all of your words right because words\nMatter yes they do well I think this could found that out very quickly yeah so the question is is a is a week and a lack of income for a week isn't good enough\nI think so I mean my my opinion the sensitivity training I mean he's now publicly humiliated um we're talking about him so I think ah hopefully he will learned that lesson but I think the bigger uh\nImpetus is to make sure as a coach your coaching your team on ... you know let's look at what just happened and what ... what the lighter more learning about six or seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight nine fourteen Indy Car bony it's Monday morning and I know it's been a tough way to get so we started out there in the road\nIt certainly has given good morning everyone would check in the right into the city of the ... goes back through sixty\nIn ... they'll have even slow from top to bottom loaded up Ninety three is low rider the metro west like you found ways against ... nine where there was an earlier jak I've tractor trailer and your slogan from one point Ruth sixteen new bones to be you see you as well over toward the seldom\nTraveling or the town of resolve at a standstill Roosevelt circle down through the lower that one's white cellphone delays from one twenty nine Wakefield ... roads\nSolve its own expressway north ... that was the only ...

so I have to tell ya I I don't know about you but I'm fascinated by people who are ... are able to take on someone else's persona and do it effectively and I think it it makes for such a fun experience and our next guest\nIs someone who has a show out right now and is doing this and dean Martin is his guy it's called dean lives\nAnd it is drew Anthony who's joining us this morning good morning\nMorning everybody how are you are you Kim great to have you along this morning my pleasure thanks for having me\nSo a burst of I have to tell you I I'm I live in ... which is right next to Lynn I see signs I see people promoting the daylights out of the show which is coming on October the twentieth so congratulations to you\nOh thank you very much I look forward I mean and seeing everybody out there near Linn at a rally in in Boston and of course\nSure that tell me about your love of dean Martin where did this come about and and how did you learn to to sort of take on his persona if you will\n[laughter] uh I guess the love of the Martin came from my parents and a lot of time other Italian singers and my grandparents and the level of singing came from all that um I Am Italian\nAmerican and that that's where that came from a bed when I moved to Las Vegas or someone said you look like the Martin and you know there's a job for you in a show called a rat Packers back which actually has been inland um so I've been doing that\nI guess uh you know for for ten years now [noise] uh playing the Martin and I and I guess the the incentive was that you had you know a a job\nYou know in in in a show that was paid you\nKnow okay here's a job for you and I'm like well that sounds like fun I Love to sing you know I I Know about the Martin I Love the Martin let me let me do the best job I can and then it turned out to be something you know that's that is a lot of fun and you're very natural to\nFor me to play dean and of course I guess looked like the um\nWhich is a which was a big advantage or are in Vegas for that and that's how it all started and then I decided that I'd like to uh you don't have a show that was just about dean is there's so much about the guy\nOr a after learning so much about him I respect him a great deal in many ways as a person and as an entertainer and the comedian as most people will know so I wanted to do a show about him and his uh his career his musical career\nSo when you go and you see the show I Know you're obviously going to sing some of his songs whatever but is there is there no there is\nNo oh no I'm not going to say no I'm kidding I'm just source and sing\nSing a lot of uh uh uh I'm going to say a lot of the things hit songs of course but there's also a um a lot of information about the Martin that separates a some of the acts of the show that kind of leads\nFrom one point of his life and career to another ... um you know with a lot of characters that the foreign were like Jerry Lewis ... um and there's Johnny Carson at a show\nI mean there's Maryland role in the show does it take the lead a show um\nThere's a few different things happening and these people actually performed with the Martin so it's a nice mix of entertainment for people\nOh that's so funny that sounds so often now listen I Know that you're a guy who um does a lot of the mayor and the guy guy do this to be a fat [laughter] and if I needed me to tell you this morning I've already done so so you heard of that for the rest of the day [laughter] or the Americans and it I Know that you're somebody who's done that just a light you obviously you've\nGot a great voice and you're a singer um but you then you've taken on the trades have dean Martin but I Do it are there are times when you sing and you're not dean Martin and you are just drew Anthony\nUm beef well before before during the rat pack or before during these type of shows yes of course um and then during you\nKnow even during the rat pack or doing there's still a you know part of drew Anthony that's in there that's kind of their you know there's I Would say twenty thirty percent I mean you it's hard to be a hundred percent of the person you know a hundred percent of the time on the stage sure\nUm and I don't even think I Want to try to to try to you know I mean I Try to be as natural as possible so there's parts luckily drew was close to ... even\n... even naturally like parts of drew people were confused with the and especially with a look so I don't really have to uh you know force myself to\nPretend all the time um\nI don't think I Would really want it to that it's it's\nA mix germs others so the answer is yeah there's there's drew there yeah that's for sure\nYou don't ... I guess my point is I've never I've never really had the opportunity as someone who um you know has a career sort of imitating if you will are taking on the traits have somebody else you know lose sight of drew\nI really don't know cool\nYeah yeah yeah a show look I don't think\nI don't think it actually would help doing a good job if I were to do that yeah you know I mean it really after it wouldn't be respectful even to of dean ... or ... to do that sort of thing but yeah I never lose sight of of drew that's for sure\nI ... are you doing this show I Know you said you were doing that the rat pack show but I have you done this show in Vegas has this show been out yet\nI've done this show in Vegas um in different spots not I'm not ... you know in smaller theaters like they are in Vegas even the rat pack years in the smaller theatre and I've done it in Youngstown, Ohio near teams\nUh home home China's Steubenville a done it in a New Haven Connecticut a veteran of the few different or\nA Venus around the country more than more than Las Vegas\nSure and and I to tell me what kind of uh what kind of audience reaction you\nGet because I Know they again um there was I seen on social media there's a number of people up on the north shore Boston here who are talking about seeing this show and how much they want to see it it looks like to me you have really enthusiastic crowd", "show_name": "The Kuhner Report", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "01"}
