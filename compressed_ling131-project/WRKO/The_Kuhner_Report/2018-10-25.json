Curt Schilling is I I Would imagine do the John Henry I'm done with him happened not in the last two weeks [laughter]\nJohn enters I'm done with him happened a long time ago and Curt Schilling is just said stuff that goes against the grain when it comes to John Henry and his wife\nJews Muslims transgender many little yeah he said so many anti Semitic things I mean I don't think are an issue for John Henry and rent issue for\nA lot of people by the way an Warner and um\nBut I keep trying to figure out in my like how would you spend this though like so we only wanted the guys from game seven of the Yankee no because Damon ... right off the bat Damon would have to be there by would very tech be there particularly do\nWell I mean showing does live in Alaska so it's a whole to get no\nWe want to fight in Iraq the most popular players from the team he's not one of them\nPictures defy that if you go back I mean he just he was\nFrom God and the guy who for\nIssue is now that's the problem [noise] [noise] let me go to hold on here Paul Paul's and rain have followed the morning\nAnd you know John Henry being small I'm Sorry you know what ... do you have nothing to do that first pitch and I mean\nAll of that Loni is John I'm Sorry Curt Schilling is the reason we don't have the curse and that I mean even I Would even take it was better than Pedro um because you know what you're getting old all the time\nIn the sixth inning current kept going nine and that's a big deal in baseball and those who actually watch sports because we'd like sports not because we're looking for a soap opera um you know I still wear that\nTwo thousand or world champion at um I don't where the other one is the other ones are just you know nice texture and I'm Sorry John Henry was was weak\nAnd that and there's no other way to play just appalled you know nobody\nCan I tell you something now here's the problem with that you can't have it both ways if you if you were going to be a great athlete and be remembered for your athletic then be a great athlete and be remember free athletics is why I say all the time but if you want to be a great athlete and then you want to go out there\nAnd voice your opinions about groups of people about politics I think sometimes you know the old\nWell the thing is is Kurt didn't get invited to this thing she paid a price now he again I think this is just a thing where the person who looks bad in this isn't Curt Schilling he's you're you're you're divorced analogies right\n... ... at this point John Henry the cycle parent doesn't invite the other parents and the kid's graduation party even though the other parents to\nBut did you know I feel like that's a pretty damn good law is to [laughter] on the other end you gave it to him all are I mean really [laughter] why wasn't even\nThere anyway you know what I mean is there any way they would have included why does he might not go to the games like you said he lives in a\nWhile you can't get on if you can't get a dog I Know he's showing I don't think he could just walk down to the dugout area to walk up with those guys I think\nThat happened to some of the others one bite it and yet it\nYou do yeah I think some of them what just happened to be there a\nFat how and where he got out there [laughter] you under sanctions seven years and ... [laughter] ... thanks uh yeah I don't know I mean I think that was organized last night I think that was\n... to my understanding of it showing I think said something along the lines of he's not vested in this stuff anymore and he's not even I don't think he's even watching these games whether that's true or not I think that's what he said said so I don't think he's\nBeen there and\nSo unless you know once he got wind that they were doing this he shows up on gr Jill and I'm going to be here and let's see what was the um try and stop me I that would have been\nWell he was vested enough that he knew that he wasn't on the field and the rest of them were on last night will somebody\nSaying they mean in his live and somebody asked him on Twitter he didn't yeah All right and I found out at four thirty yesterday like the rest of his did he could have obviously jumped on the tea and join up if you wanted to and said let's see what happens here but\nI Would never do that I'd want to get ... up on the tea [noise] but I don't actually let's not anywhere never [laughter] I mean ... Curt Schilling did the right thing\nBy today I think he's on on this has been good I think can you imagine\nYou show up there and they'd be like a now and then there's pictures of the guy turn around and walk and now\nThat would be hideous\nI I I didn't realize until just now I don't know what though I was thinking I didn't know that folk was there\nTo Mr Johnny from Burger King or ... yeah it's I've ever there was so in two thousand and wild ... two thousand and six really we couldn't stand the guy but he's ... years but the guy we could stand in for what time things change you know ...\nIf you squandered good fortune or you know that's that's on you\nIt's funny to shelling would you have to sit there and go like OK showing wanted to run against Elizabeth Warren a couple of years ago right he was rumored now is thinking about having been running okay that would be one thing you can't be out\nThere we can have you know politicians and we can't be picking sides and we can be given commercials to you kind of thing but\nThat's not the same now still not fair because I don't like you write about the ... I don't I like you and you were when I didn't even like you then but that's fine related you are right but I don't like yeah\nWell\nI don't think we'll see Curt Schilling around the ballpark anytime soon and I don't think it will seem on a duck boat and uh I think that most people there last night if you ask them to be perfectly honest with you\nI think those people in that ballpark last night ... weren't even taken note of that mostly they were just caught up in the moment they were excited\nThey had your favorite guy Kevin mill are out there putting on the show they were taking that in and then they went right on because all they cared about was what David Price was going to do last night out what Curt Schilling did too that in two thousand four\n[noise] I have a ah now I didn't start just read text read you know some of the mid ... one of them's fairly conservative and says that you know what I don't even like showing but he should've been there and then the next one is from a very liberal I have no you shouldn't have been there\nIt's this it's the same for me were at that same divide here\nI really don't care if he was there or not to be honest I mean I understand from baseball ball point of view\nYeah why would it be complete sense that he would be there I also understand that when you're dealing with a private business and you've done things that the owner\nAs my husband likes to say they on the sand box and you you either get invited to play in it or you don't but it's their sandbox and that's what we saw last night he saw owners of a sand box saying nope nope\nWell for what it's worth because the red Sox did put out this statement that said this was done not out of spite well what else would have been well it was an ... drew asked the Kelly ... question is why was he not invited a not out as ... she is currently at eighty six rules course\nI mean that that actually that makes them look that makes them look worse than the fact that he wasn't invited to come out to try to say and by the way it was it was not out of spite of course it was\nWhat what is he going to say who they're going to come out and say we don't know how to invite him how 'bout that we don't have any comment NATO despite is Red Sox for no comment\nNo it's really not now despite is you know we're good guys that do well\nWandering they go to our study we don't have any comment current lives here we use Kurt a lot we were bringing in these guys that otherwise don't get to participate and stuff and when we probably should add um but that wouldn't be ... we'll see curtain game six because we know that yeah that's what you do there yeah that wouldn't\nBe poppy that would be Pedro those guys are there all the time\nYeah no it's not much I just got to come up with something similar as works for the team basically I mean I bike riding 'em up or something so it's got to bed for this morning have got good morning\nHey good morning I got a couple of things you can't change actually\nI I had\nIt was part of the team he goes to he had to go last night he has to be invited and then if he chooses not to do you can't it's the same thing you know if you think that ... showing it said things that a little bit off color\nYou agree or disagree but you can't invite him just like Colin Kaepernick the things he said he's a hero for speaking out what he believed by saying cops are all cops are racist and let them out\nBut he gets it awarded at Harvard but\nHe's not invited any NFL games as a\nWhy would it be invited to admit I fell game he he you try out\nYour argument is that he made statements the NFL doesn't like but you should be invited anyway that's what you're saying\nThat they make the team because these things you could have been out of football for three years now\nBut the equivalent you're making the equivalent showing made statements that Red Sox doesn't like but he should be invited back anyway kept running away and they all died willing to bring the\nNight the forty niners that made it to the super bowl to some event a couple of years ago and then you want to invite calling capital that's wrong\nThat might out of that and by them or not\nNo no no no don't start around this was a team effort if they excluded crap or next from a forty niner came that within the super bowl a few years ago that's different\nDifferent if you mean it's the same and now you're it wouldn't be wrong bring them to do that yes you're right\nYou know what a snowflake is saying is that Kaepernick is not on a team because of it is\nNow what I'm saying is that you have your argument I was going to be invited to NFL games\nHere what you're supposed to know what it was okay what what is your most interesting I Want what what are we supposed to do it or not and I fell game\nWell what Scott what why would why would the chilling be invited to a baseball game then it's the same\nHe's part of the team that won the ... okay so if the niners but he was on that team okay\nYou can't change history that that happened it was part of the forty niners either Scott you're right we I agree with you want\nTo hear it in and they were invited say they won the super bowl that year which they did and then the forty niners invited them to whatever event and they said Capra that you're not invited\nA bachelor on okay when we all went and we all jury we all agree that's what we're ... that that that's why we're\nCreating chaos primarily I don't get\n... now you explained to me why it's Capra that got an NFL games what does that mean\nWe're not learn about what happened in our yard that you brought up I didn't bring among\nTheir missing you're you're making a point but then you're getting defensive about it and missing when Jim Jones\nHe's making made some comment about how can we capture next not an NFL game\nSo you know she was actually agree with you write your point was you weren't you were saying the opposite of what you thought you were saying you know all\nI'm saying is history Kaepernick\nIf they invite all the players that were team ... one of at all the players should be should be invited\nDonald it yeah now that exactly I think he meant I just\nGot ... I Believe me I'm not ...\nI agree with your assessment that shilling should it was a major part of that even as such he should have been there it's not the end of the world that he wasn't we don't even need to bring Colin Kaepernick and when that ... is that you were jumping in your own mind your analogy and it wasn't coming out the way you thought it was that was leading us down a path but hey game\nDuring the day [laughter] gave three's coming off on friday\nNight we got other things to talk about when we come back here on W.

R. K. O. U. R. tale\nSeven thirty five let's try this at all\nLet me say once I first started to go ahead [noise] I was sort of would have to buy\nSome friends yesterday I tweeted out off of so Trump ... my parents just says yeah I agree wholeheartedly\nMight read off of that was like I feel like going forward this is a pretty good blueprint let's let him handle these\nAnd then the president just says plus one yes fine with that yes everybody was ripping me for that of that in my little circle right they're like oh come on the guy who's the president the president has to set the standard on this but no he doesn't you know\nWe're we're talking about making Kelly during the break which will get to a little later on the show in my ... one of my arguments with the ... thing is that do you put her in a position to fail and she's failed right\nDon't ask Trump to do this right at using natural to him because if you go because you'll get the tweets that you're doing this more than ... people are ripping me enough people have told the president apparently so\nHe's tweeted this morning and then just you didn't hear and yet a very big part of the anger we see today in our society\nFirst of all like he's he's removed he's on a mountain looking down enough\nHe he he sees it that way I'm afraid\nVery big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely falls inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to was\nIt knows it has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast and ...\nSo whether you think there is merit to that point or not we can kick that around sure I look I don't love the media I think the media is doing a lot of bad work I think they're doing some good work\nAh but yeah media's gonna look themselves ... agreements for president I feel like when you were telling others to look themselves in the mirror you may also\nJust as I thought maybe looked in the mirror yourself and but I as your wife is telling us yesterday to be best I didn't get the sense you were thinking about the I got the sense you were doing just fine uh by yourself I oh that's that's one of the issues\nI Know that ah the media has a huge responsibility and all of this and I agree with that [noise] but it time and time again it's just hard for me to imagine that the president does not understand the impact of being the president\nHe his words are magnified five hundred times over everybody else and he just doesn't he he he doesn't understand that\nAnd so when he stands any screams and he yells things people are taking that over anything and every thing that everybody else says so he's gotta he's got a slowdown first I agree the media is wrong many times\nBut\nI for me it's just hard on a day like this when you've just found the eight package\nThat you know and this is all going on on a day like this you kinda kinda like Michael comes on and just he too just absolutely it's as if he didn't hear or see any of this law just screaming ... just ... he's feeling when I think is just all really close to hate but you don't understand\nThat you do though because if you're going to operate in a zero sum world than it has to be one or the other\nSo in this case Trump's tweet gee I Wonder how many thousand times that's going to be re tweeted today with the comment pot that cattle some version narrow right in the Trump world and in what Trump does very often sometimes to a very large success is that these are the battle\nLines and now we know where everybody's defined and now we must win and they must fail fine well\nThere does come a point at which things are way beyond those boundaries this is this is the United states here in the United states you can argue was under attack right now it's irrelevant whether it's damn at some point you must understand that it's irrelevant whether\n\nWhether this is uh what was the phrase they're using a false flag democratic operation to swing the elections or whether this is some fall on hard core Trump or who said I Can't take it anymore\nAt some point you must realize there are crazy people in the world that are willing to take action into do stupid and or really scared really crazy things like this right when they instructed to do so and whatever code words it was the triggered this person or this group or whatever it is\nOkay but I Would never wake up in the morning and say you know what I'm going to kill my father is a Trump supporter I Would never ever in in any way I Would ever think of doing like that right so they love you guys\nThanks for calling for she ate it well look the danger is what Trump\nHas decided to do since he got into this thing in the first place that we've all known it like this is this isn't a hot potato this is an absolute ball of fire that you have in your hand\nTrump's not a violent guy he really is and what he's bombastic he throws crazy stuff but his Trump ever punched anybody as Trump ever been any violent in any way towards anybody and his whole life\nTrump plays tennis Trump plays golf he doesn't know football well he's a guy who doesn't even want to actually not a ...\nA talker he's a big talker so in Trump knows that about Trump so for Trump it is a game because Trump knows the he's never going to do that well you know the him so far\nAs anybody knows what they are going into the future Trump does that he's never going to do any of this sort of stuff what\nHe would do the danger of excuses that you can't possibly know that guy sitting at home in Los Angeles riots seventies is watching TV going the guy keeps telling me the globe socks while you know maybe I'll just make a phone call right and then again terms not the only one is why holder had the\nSort of make the statement about him when they go high we kick them he had to come out of the next day and sort of explain that it needs to lighten up but then did explain it like ... 'cause you gotta be careful\nWell this is this is why I keep saying over and over the president as he never he didn't understand when he was a candidate and he doesn't get it now his words mean something to people\nAnd if you if you say things they may not mean anything to him Jim it may look like it's a big game but it's not a game to these people who are sitting in somebody's basement listening\nI mean those are the boss who have spent a wife and I I I mean this the right way but those of us who have spent our life\nSort of in you know in a public position understand there are people out there who interprets things differently than what you meant and differently than most Americans they hear things that the rest don't\nAnd this is the problem with the president but with everybody who is is whistling that dog whistle\nConservative friend of mine has texted me off of my call from earlier and said look the reality is only one political side as directing their tribe to physically bully the other that is the fact and as you see my response to my my friend which is best\nBowl and I don't know how long you walk into that my friend but did you not see the closest video over the weekend of course you didn't because you did doesn't fit your story but did the president\nTweeted out on Sunday or Monday hey what happened to ... easy that was a little aggressive and we're\nGetting into some dangerous territory or\nYou can keep telling yourself that only one side is doing this then when this happens\nSo you've got several theories that you just go in one is it this is the media this has nothing to do with conservatives too is that this is false flag liberal operatives to control the election sure\nOrange some wing not whenever it happens on this side then it's always we not that's got nothing to do with ... right you are\nBut when it's the other side is always a coordinated effort that's fully invaded knew full well when\nShe said or he said that this is what they're supposed to do and they got their marching orders yes Maxine Waters did say that absolutely that was wildly inappropriate we said at the time\nStay today I'll say it forever more that was ridiculously stupid what she said when you continue to act like your side is so much purer than the other\nWell that is what she said and we condemn did when she said it and it is wrong and she is wrong with the president stood up there last week folks inside my guy is the one who can body slam and he pointed out to the media and coming after you and then he showed us how to body slam\nWe can win I I don't use hearing relive gardening this back and forth but because he's a lane for me this isn't about\nTrump in in in a way this is about our country this is about who we are just about every one of us if your initial reaction to this story is to go fake news plants liberal plants or you're going to turn this on Trump your to your to wean it to see what's going on\nRight you just this is Red Sox Yankees now all you see is that you don't realize is twenty eight other team out or there's this collective that has made in your ... in rating argue\nAnd you're adding to it you may think that you're not you may think you're not part of it you may think you're just at home with your political ideas but the more that you do do you yell diminish you see this this is this is all about\nThem you're adding to it as a prop ... and get like a ... on on the other side all we just keep picking is ... I Wish the Democratic party was a tenth as organized as as people on the right thing to think they are that they could come up\nWith all these grand conspiracies and having on no plane maybe if they were that organized a what do you mean something happened and why do they win something again you forget your in charge of everything right now so if the Democrats are so smart about the way that they do these things maybe they would have won something at some point in theory the only really\nOne grand conspiracy we know the Democrats did do if you want to use that phrase ... is Kavanaugh they lost\nAnd that's not okay that's not even a conspiracy and if\nYou want to play by that I agree if you want to buy that rule David you look let's let's try and find out how to it and they lost\nOver it they lost weight away to play that one of them for us yeah [laughter] yeah grand conspiracy to steal the election from Trump except except who's president right Kevin is in New Hampshire good morning Kevin\nBack more than guys good morning or so what about hold 'em I'll have to admit my my message from my point at all quite a bit um\nI was gonna say something about the false flag idea and all that nonsense but\nTo be honest we hate and love problem here in America um were were were sucked into this tornado of anger and hate and yeah I I Would say a lot of it has to do with that media I won't say right or left I think both\nBoth push anger and hate hey we hate you we hate you we hit you so we have to be this way um I just I guess my message is a challenge every liberal and every conservative so look at their counterparts with love and their heart and try to understand them\nFrom a loving perspective and you guys have a really huge platform here and um\nOh and make me a little bit emotional so I just I'm going to leave without a love each other and\nWell Ken you're right [laughter] that's my thing too I don't care where these things are being delivered I just know what's wrong I don't care who's deliver him I just know it's wrong and I just I Can't understand the world where we if you don't agree with me then just sent me some terrible package\n[laughter] I don't get it\nOne one way again I'm going to sound like I'm ripping I made it one thing that has happened is Trump is forced to happen he's made it happened and we've been willing participants and it\nIs it the whole world is from everything for our world is Trump's CNN that's all they do it's all they do good morning America we were watching it this morning to their credit\nAfter thirty minutes of the Bombay did do a piece on Megan Kelly and then they did have Dr phil on talking about that twin that killed her twin right yeah\nIf you are going to be all in all the time and this is ... you were going to have eight and you're going to for example in other words could you could you have watched last night's game will is Warren sitting next year\nI could and I don't even like her but I I don't care about that but there's a lot of people are doing this is the thing like\nDo we ... we now have an inability to just say to me to shelve this part of our lives from these we can't show it because you're on our society don't you understand you want socialism and once you do that you'd never getting out of that tiny little bubble that they put you in\nSeventy one says Kim I support Donald Trump but I don't like it when he's being bombastic and I know that a lot of that is BS and and two Seventy one I say you you certainly can support the president and good for you and supportive and really positive ways\nThe problem is that you're sensible and you recognize that he's being bombastic but unfortunately there are people out there who don't hear it that way they hear it as gospel and they believe that is a call for them to to show their support for him in some way and vice versa by the way I'm just I'm just\nGoing off of your your tax that's the problem people don't get that there are people out there who can't separate the two [noise] and that's where we are seven fifty nine and ...\n[noise] the\nVoice of Boston New York ... and one hundred and twenty seven to ... like eighty to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise] patterns\nIsn't that weird that are royal family up there you gotta thank you very much and by the way she still pregnant a Twenty one [laughter]\nSixteen Twenty one what happened on that day governor Bradford of the Plymouth that's P.

T T E mhm yeah I'm sure I bet you money that's his mother's name right [noise]\nUm yeah so we've got nine packages now that have been identified I'm a ... I haven't heard much this morning but I'm under the assumption because I just\nGot this will sound like a micro aggression I don't know how am I allowed to say blonde moment off the table no go ahead for both for all of us as the package does tell you it's just sort of robbing a bind junior ... wouldn't be his mother's name because it's junior\nSo certainly would be it could be his father's mother's name\nOh yeah I ... I don't mean that long to figure out what you were saying that right that it\nSo that was his father's name now so it has to be ... if there was that or whatever it was his father took on\nHis wife's middle name and called himself junior or senior I Know yeah you're right you're right um okay so anyway we what we haven't learned\nThis morning yesterday we saw the pictures of the of the device um that was found in the mail room at CNN um we have not ... learn much more about these devices this morning\nRight they've just been taken off and we I was asking the the um during the break you know they said that that may have done away with these devices and whatever ... did they actually explode once they got them you know to this location and got the forensic off forensics offered them they needed\nAnd the answer really is if we don't know there are a lot of things that they're not saying because as they do in all of these investigations they want to know and they want the perpetrator now and that's it\nSo there are a number of things that we still don't know about these devices about the cameras\nAbout anything related to some of them were it looks like they were mailed from the ... they weren't but they were found at the post office and again all kinds of issues let me go to Tommy he's in Brockton good morning\nOr good morning Kim how're you doing I'm good thank you\nUm if if it turns out these were hoax bombs\nWell defined what you mean by that what do you mean by a hole\nIn other words bombs that when you open them up they would not detonate now at other words someone just makes a pipe bomb but there's no detonation device\nLike what the kid and Beverly did it was very bomb but it literally was confetti you wasn't there was no power or anything and yes right\nBut ... ... from what we know what we know as of now these bombs had powder in them some sort of\nA glass of wine glass but yeah mhm\nYeah so anyway if it goes from that the the sixty four dollar question is what is the particular what is the motivation behind these ... and if it turns out a it's an angry white nationalist um who supports Trump\nIs going to own it yeah if it if it if it turns out that it's like the guy who shot Steve skull lease a Bernie borough\nIs the media going to point to the left as is my question we just don't know at this point in time but to me it it seems like it was more it it has to be more than one individual doing this\nWhile they're young yeah I don't think ...\nKim Kim the Unabomber didn't send out a multiple bombs at one time he did it over a stretch over years and the other other point is what the Unabomber all of\nIt it it took them years to figure out in technology after nine eleven there's cameras everywhere you go into a post office you're on camera I don't care if you're in Buckeye West Virginia there's a camera there yeah\nAnd on that case I think the honors yeah as of yesterday like she's never going to have you back on ... that's the that's the by you're getting\nRight uh she okay so we're just backing up just to make sure everyone knows what we're talking about making Kelly who has a morning talk show\nThree days ago I'm In a panel discussion about PC costumes on college campuses for Halloween made some comments about black face saying that um ... you know she thought as long as when she was growing up that as long as\nYou were just playing a character that blackface wasn't an issue she sent out an apology a written apology to NBC she then in turn yesterday came out on the show and had a cheerful apology on the air which was followed by standing ovation by her crowd that that was there at our show\nPrior to her going on the air however the today show group had their own panel discussion about Megan Kelly\nAnd it didn't it didn't bode well for her I don't believe\nA an al Rucker was diplomatic but very direct in the idea that he believed that she owes more than the NBC crowd I'm an apology and then he was offended by her comments we learn that now today she is not going to be on the show\nUm that the cast of house of cards was scheduled to be on the show and they said they would go on her show and they cancelled their parents and now NBC is saying that there had been discussion prior to her comments earlier this week\nAbout ending her show and ending her appearances on NBC and this has just solidified it and has meant that they will take her off the air or quickly like now\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] but it also has a year and a half left on your contract sixty eight sixty nine million dollar deal\nBut one that's most telling me is that apparently she's been her people have been talking to other outlets\nSo they say and\nNBC it would appear as aware of that and in her claws there is a you will not\nTalk to other outlets there like that it's okay you you can you conduct let us know to find anything really to foster this for you\nNot only is your dog you know they're eligible to pivot NBC is also going\nHey anybody interested in where where where they're going to get us as well I'm off world will pay most of it yeah that's\nThe interesting thing is that she had she had an agency that represented her started representing her back in two thousand and Fifteen which he made the switch over to NBC um see a that's a that's a talent agency ca and Kelly and Megan Kelly have parted ways in the last week\nI'm part of which I Would not be one bit surprised I'm just speculating is that she has told them go out there and find me another job and they've said I'm not sure we can find you know their job and so she has said well we're going to part ways we don't we don't see this the same way\nTo get another gig somewhere\nShe says she wants to go back to the news she doesn't like to talk show thing she says that she misses news I Am trying to figure out who is going to hire her at this stage of the game\nI mean she burned to bridge the only place I Would hire at this point she's not going back to fall snow CNN doesn't wanna know MSNBC certainly doesn't Mara nope\nI don't know where she's going to go you're going to go to Yahoo and joined Katie corrupt will pay you a billion dollars to not do anything club I don't know that they would want to pick her up\nKatie Couric never did anything to offend anyone\nI I mean I I I assume like a news max that kind of outlet\nRight sort of an online forum thing if she wants to do what I don't know after sixty seven million or whatever it takes the nine\nMillion three year deal is she still got a year and a half on it she's only half way through this deal\nYou gotta figure NBC sort of like that guy whose ex wife says she wants to date again and you're like alright hunting did you want me to set you up oh one I mean [laughter]\nWell I'm sure that if I mean I'm not I'm not sure I don't know what\nWith her contract would have read but you know sixty nine million and she's a halfway through they still owe her a big chunk of money now I don't know if what happened to the other day would justify them not having to pay that full amount I don't know how do you usually\nSee around on I mean they put her on and she could apologize and ... and then jump broadcaster show like I ... they would they would have trouble winning a case they're based on the fact that that are on that would have to rise to a level of all my God\nI agree so I I don't think that it's necessarily um that they are finding ways to not pay her [laughter]\nBut at the same time if she find another gig maybe they don't have to pay as much or you know they can negotiate a deal to get her out to go to the other deal and they weren't but they still owe her a lot to do\n\nIf I'm Megan Kelly I got to tell you the truth I Would say this is what I Would say to NBC [noise] you're gonna pay me I'm going to go sit on the beach and I got a year and a half to let this whole thing die down\nThen maybe at that stage of the game someone may seem in a different light and may may determine that I\nI went with the wrong the wrong a venue in the wrong\nType of broadcast and I need to go back to news hard straight news\nYeah again my thing is that does she go back to our news who's very I think Fox might under certain circumstances might have taken aback but she's increasingly been aggressive and burning that British and I there's no way\nI think she can go back to some form of news I wouldn't say there's no way I mean right I think over time but I don't think that she's going to find a gig tomorrow I think Fox is way more open to having Bill O'Reilly\nBack then her I agree yeah but things change in two years' time and who knows I mean I ...\nAt tiny walk away or she says something and she's gone and now you're like well we need a woman like Megan can come in and get it from the I'm On the\nDollar here we know that our audience will take her back because they loved her so she had a huge numbers\nAnd a year and a half from now the storyline is different everything is very different you know we're getting very close to another election uh you know they could they could bring her in just for election coverage kind of thing\nYou know they're there but it but if I'm In banking Kelly I don't know why I mean she has made\nA lot of money money is not our issue for me I just don't understand why you wouldn't say I'll tell you what NBC here's my negotiation pay me out\nAnd I'm going home let die down there are\nI've written this call him a few times between our K O dot com and my local paper but the the old careful what you wish for thing and like a always usual Joe single was my example where his famous three when the patriots sign him when he was a free agent was I knew I was going to land somewhere I didn't know I was going to land and have him now\nAnd ... turned out having wasn't for you you didn't know you could you just couldn't cut it this is the same where she had to get away from that held that his Fox but you don't know what you got until it's gone and sometimes when it's gone it's never coming\nBack and I just one of the problems is you you said she's not likeable ripe all don't view her that way and that's hard to go back to doing\nWell NBC you know NBC thought that this is the thing that a lot of times happens with a lot of these people one ... one set of skills don't always transfer into another set of skills it takes a certain kind of person to be a morning person\nWho's on one of these very successful morning shows who by the way Katy Kirk didn't do all that great when she went to the evening hard core hard line right those skills don't always transfer\nNow I'm sure Megan Kelly behind closed doors her argument is NBC you did me dirt because you told me I was coming over here to beat the host of the of the today show and I never became the host of the today show and I was going to do the hard line portion of that show and you never let me do it\nI'm sure that's her argument it you know I never thought that I could sit around and have a panel discussion on\nCostumes but you know what happens sometimes\nHas run out of the left and you think you're more than you are and then you find out good that'd be in the NFL every year they have these players that just think well Greg always wanted to be a starting quarterback instead of being the bills backup quarterback finally he was given the opportunity and guess what Frank regulators are you're supposed to be a backup quarterback Scott ... like I ... and\nI got this they tell people what the networks they put their [noise] they way too much faith in in the idea that again that these skills can transfer ... they they don't always do that sounds six one Seventy six six sixty eight sixty eight here's a question for you\nWould you watch Megan Kelly if she leaves NBC and she ends up someplace else as news anchor again would you watch her when I hear from you say fifty nine here and I'll be ... [noise]\nThe voice of Boston New York about one hundred point seven to UCLA HD to Boston and I are radio station\nBut that is the world we're living in now right and the idea that he has to be likeable I Would argue there's a lot of people on either you right now that it was accessible that are not likeable\nBut not just our I'm Don Lemon is very polarizing mhm whether you think he's except when he's on so here's a scenario for ...\nTwo years three years let's say Trump loses in twenty twenty let's say the stock market continues to tumble Trump loses and twenty twenty whoever's the president but let's say it's let's say fine fine\nBy the president let's say the ship Smith whatever ship just just done with the business or ship gets an illness or ... gets a new deal at some other network and ... is it possible that that wing of Fox and we know that there are two Fox's says\nWhy don't we put her on at three in the afternoon here and let her do whatever it is she wants to do\nIs that I I to me that his boss I don't I have friends that are telling me and my phone that she will never ever work at Fox again\nMaybe I'd I disagree I think that she could I think she could pop up anywhere I think given some space she could pop up anywhere nothing that she has done or said has been so agree just the reality\nOf agree just though there is a combination there is it\nLooks as if it was me in someone brought this to me it's a menu really got to sell me on this because I'm not buying that this was going to be a good idea but if it's wicked cheap and there's no risk okay which is why I'd be thinking like a middle one did Fox's\nAre women take out numbered out but let's put her on for an hour see what happens and then if she's good will will expand that to where I was maybe\nThere's a number of things that have to happen for that to happen\nBut I've just seen too many things in this world happened where I'm like wow I never thought that that could happen and I give David prices happening right in front of your eyes were were not loving that guy [laughter] we couldn't have hated him more a month\nAgo and I mean I Love 'em or NBC just announced Megan's off for the rest of the week [laughter] [noise] I mean it's a it's a slow grind shedding I'm back my ... I don't why would they put her on live to\n... you know what she's going to do they already said she's not going to return live regardless she could not have\nKnown when she left the building you know her husband was there but she didn't walk out with a box like she couldn't have known that that was her last day\nMm I don't know I'm pretty sure Kathie Lee Giffords'\nTopping off or a wine a little extra this morning\nI Believe that but I don't think Megan had any idea even again when she did that apology and then she just did or show she has a very good job look what are we gonna come up I Know I was a car just pulling some stuff so let's let's be ready\nWell no I don't know I think after the show is over yesterday and they started getting the calls and they ... they tell us the cards what in common and you know Mm she's she's\nShe knew she was in trouble when it was made when I was brought to her attention that what she had said was he had to kind of reaction that it had because she already knew she was trying to negotiate a way out [noise]\nIt's sad nine Thirteen in Indy Car bony how is hour commute this morning so heavy in Spokane good morning every one check the right into the city so virgin bound back up the rich sixty ... airport tunnels\nBusy aside metro west he founded ...\nAll the way to Cambridge results invite westbound some delays passing through the solar\nLooking north of Austin that as we stopped at a standstill Roosevelt circled the lower ... ride the breaks for ... like it at the ramps and one's twenty eight south of Boston expressway to our best up and go slip past Columbia road map that was the only owe federal ...\nFrom as Anthony for North separate from Harrison Florida have are heading up to one twenties the traffic updates was sponsored by the take back their your unused description drugs and the Miss USA stole it safely take them back at the national prescription drugs ... this Saturday\nOctober ... here you had the fact that I'm from the W ...

allowed to have a personal loan or not [noise]\nSo we'd have a rather heated discussion or is it it's just a debate this happens\nEvery time with you where I point out a heated discussion and then you didn't know that it's either but you were yelling at me and you were very heated [laughter] but that's okay I enjoy it you\nNever had a heated discussion because at my house you discussion is much more than just over\nThe last minute you just kept talking so that I wouldn't talk you know that you were doing that's called a heated discussion held back to you you you say okay I I'm I Love listening to you on this because\nWe started this conversation about the president's phone in a light hearted not so serious way and I think we both realized how much more serious as is and how much more complicated this is you don't think it's complicated but I'm amused by your thought process on this if\nYou think the Trump can have a personal phone and the government phone but the the ... there have to be limits on what that personal phone is I'm telling you there can be no limits\nNo I think he should never have a personal phone while he's in office he cannot\nPay so then I said to you all phones must we're going to redo our break non needed heated argument now on the air\nIf he can't have any personal phone than he can't be on a personal phone in other words if Baron says dad my buddies thirtieth birthday so can you wish them happy birthday and he reaches over with a phone to him the president cannot take that phone and say happy birthday John you can't he can only be on government phones\nMhm under your rules I think\nI'm not sure Baron can have a personal phone everything is monitored so the entire family under the mansion either\nWhen he goes I Know he does for example in the broadcast as he has done before and says hey it's my wife's birthday you know caffeine can you just ... you cannot take that Paul well no\nYou're you're that's not the president's phone [laughter] that's someone else's phone the issue is that the president himself\nCannot have a personal phone that he uses on a regular basis that can be monitored by someone else outside the reason is not because of the president\nIt's because the president can it can be manipulated by outside influence says that's the issue it's protecting the president against the outside world\nAs opposed to the president ... you know having issues because he's talking to the outside world that's not it it's that while in office if he is a personal phone that's not seeing it it's not secured\nSo that the Chinese can monitor it anything he says even if it's innocent\nCan be manipulated that's why I don't want the president to have an a a personal phone that's not protected by the government\nI don't care what he says on the phone he can call Steve when on his on his government phone he can have personal moments in his life as this government official it's just that he needs to be protected from the outside world that's my point\nIt's not that he can't have a personal life and I I equate it to the secret service I mean she has to be protected he could have a personal life but they have to protect him this part of being depressant\nSo that's my issue ... you know I just don't want him\nTo be vulnerable to the outside world which is what Hillary Clinton did to herself she made herself vulnerable to the outside world to be manipulated\nYeah yes she did and potentially\nHe has we don't know whether this is true or not again he's denied what they reported so we don't know\nBut\nMy thing is as your crafting the office of the presidency\nAh what are the limits you're going to put on it\nAre you going to say to him look whoever the president is not just this president but are you going to say he cannot have a personal phone under any circumstances where did you put that kind of limit on him for me I wouldn't\nI think if you're going again elections have consequences you are we are putting our trust in this person to have our nation's best interests at heart and one of the things I'm going to trust them with is a personal phone now that is a hard argument for me to make within a Trump world that's for sure because Trump\nMan it's hard to trust them with anything but that's what I that's how I Would ... the president makes\nIt do you understand that that's not what I'm arguing\nThat it's not about the trust of him\nThe problem is if he has a personal phone he's vulnerable to the outside world it's not him so that's why you can't have a personal phone that's why that's the argument right here you're being monitored by the Chinese because you're on a phone that is not protected by our government it's not about having trust in the president\nIt's having trusting and in this day and and your age I remember bronco bomb was like I don't want to add a Android he did not want to give that thing up it had all his personal contacts and it it's not about trusting you Mr President it's that you are vulnerable to the rest of the world that's my point\nSo ... what are the limits the limits or that you can't be on you cannot have communication on anything that the that we can't ... it would protect you and your conversation", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Kuhner Report", "city": "Boston", "day": "25"}
