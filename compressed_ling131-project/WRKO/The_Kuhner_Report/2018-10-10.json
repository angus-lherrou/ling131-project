R. Gail\nHey good morning I'm this is a theory maybe a B B and think about it to it I think she she wants out of the possibility of it's really dirty politics and maybe that's why it was kind of time with Elena thank\nYou do you remember when she ran for governor\nUm they produce is the ... guy that claim that he had had an affair with her and and the newspapers down they're covered it extensively and it and it got some play in the in the air and the British tabloid it didn't get much national coverage but do you guys to remember that\nDo you remember that Michael Wolff said that Nikki Haley was sleeping with with it right with the president that was just earlier this year or late last year\nYeah I guess might filtered must have filtered that out but uh but that that's like a third party rumor but this was the first part of a guy that was the grants that he had slept with her and he he was produced in\nKind of detail about her life and her kids and stuff like that and I was really creepy and scary yeah um so anyway but you you know I uh you can Google it I'm sure it's still there and some place\nGeorge thanks for the call there this was on the dirty politics theory in general like one theory is that how could you say this publicly but she's just\nAnyone that in the Trump Administration must know that you have a hot potato in your hands and and it Jew and at any point it can change on you in a second and when it does your down\nSo it was an old line uh I was telling\nOf our sister station goes Bradley Jay this this morning as you remember jak chase field TV news guy that worked to channel seven long before you to channel eleven channels of them are getting killed how he tells the story all the time she also used to be getting killed in the ratings always they're always the silly little station is no one took them seriously I don't know where they became number one\nFinally number one after all those years and what a jak chased do we done judges resignation how are you ...\nWhy the hell we we finally your number one why would you leave you got to do it to them before they do it to you was his line\nIs this Nikki Haley doing that here which is that I Know I'm going to get mine the longer I stay here somehow I've been able to pull this off for almost two years now maybe I get out while they're getting good is is that is it as simple as that\nUm I actually don't think that is the reason I I think she's been a star there I think she's done very well I think she's ... a lot of uh respect at the union un [noise]\nUm I don't I don't think that's what it is a maybe she I mean there there was a lot of talk yesterday about the fact that you know when ... was the secretary of a state she he had a little more power\nAnd ... and John Bolton hold the reins a little bit tighter maybe she doesn't like that she sees where this is going that she has less safe there and she has to constantly be you know asking for permission\nAnd she doesn't like that which you know I think any of us can understand if you go in with power and then suddenly they start to really your power and that's a little bit harder to to deal with that would certainly fall in line more with the idea that I recognize that now is my time to go because you need somebody with more energy and\nYou know more stamina or more stomach for the job because the job has changed\n[noise] I mean I don't know I don't I just don't\nI don't think it's because of the job she was doing it I think it's either because of the jobs she wants to do\nIt's um it's some issues that she sees coming down the pike how about the fact that yesterday there was all kinds of talk about [noise] you know there's been some investigating about her maybe some impropriety\nShe'd been in limos on airplanes that she wasn't supposed to be I mean could could it be something like that\nThe president's giving her an opportunity to bow out gracefully right now as opposed to letting that'll come out and get ourselves possible\nYeah what how much is that place\nThat she was living in now and what was the numbers on that staggering ... them something a hundred thousand a month or some crazy number not that\nShe picks it that's that's just one but there is a lifestyle that these people get accustomed to win that's possible I haven't we haven't heard that yet but it's possible sure ... don't you feel like Trump could have played that off pretty easily though if she was worried about\nThat yeah I mean I don't think she's worried about it I'm ... I mean I did what did you like I got a ... they're going to come out with this stuff he's like yeah I don't care about that I don't worry Pruitt live through what ten ... or they finally got one of them\nDid you think that was possible for somebody to leave this administration and have that said by him\nActually likes tweeted out there and wait for the big enough like you would\nWho is this guy went back to alter Trump\nThis the other guy it's the body double doing this 'cause I I didn't think you could leave and get that kind of glowing commentary\nFrom ... well that's why we know there's something else going on [laughter] it's not just alive served my time and I've done such a great job and now my expiration\nDate has come up it's not that that's not what it is there something else going on and they've worked at this through\nAnd somehow it's going to benefit the president I don't know what it is it's on conspiracies ...\nI'm Out it's not even a consideration that what she told you multiple times just even a positive ... well I one of the other thing\nThat I think is is odd is let's say that it's just that she thinks that it's time to go well wouldn't you think if she told the president six months ago and\nUh you know this has been works and whatever that she would say it's time for me to go and you know I'm looking forward to the next chapter in my life while I continue to fight for the president and this administration and the country that I Love so much\nI'm thrilled about the next chapter when I go back to South Carolina to serve as a partner in now the law firm you know Smith Wesson I don't know whatever right\nBecause she didn't say that in fact she said I don't have any plans yet and she told him six months ago\nI just I I kind of find that hard to believe I just don't think that you just go well today the expiration date and I've known it for six months and I'm walking out and I got no other job I just don't believe that [laughter] now I don't\nBelieve that Nikki Haley is a is a political beef and she knows\nExactly what she's doing so\nI mean if you want to go with Nikki Haley as a political beliefs that'd be ... flip side I mean maybe she's not replacing a Lindsey Graham maybe she's primary them\nShe said she doesn't she says you're not running for anything\nFor no she said she's not running against the president you\nKnow she's not running for anything that doesn't mean she couldn't be appointed to something attractive she wasn't running for anything but I didn't I didn't understand that I went on to me\nThat meant if you think that I'm running for\nPresident or anything but think about that though how easily 'cause she picked him off it she's more popular than him and trying to be stumping for her not him\nI I look I'm with you you don't there's no way she doesn't know what she's doing this is like I just burned and I need to catch my breath on that it wasn't like I doubt that what did she say it's been six years or eight years have been a long while ... again you seem to do it better than most was\nCriticizing her for that by the way I think you know I think that's great she's been great she's been in these high powered positions in that but I just don't believe that high powered people just all of a sudden one day at however old she is\nYou know she's not she's not a you know Charles Grassley who is going to go okay now it's time for me to step out because I'm eighty five Nick he's got lots to go\nNone of the theories make sense to me because the Senate that's the best of lateral move but I Would argue it's almost stepped down from where she is right now\nIn it that it's flat early in the sense of no heavy lifting still but you're you're more like you\nYou have boss has the chapter ... to more than just him in the Senate I I wouldn't do well I mean their eyes I mean optics\n... it's a really good thing for the Republican Party if they can say look the first time in history to minorities are senators from the same state are both Republicans from a southern state\nWell and I would be that is true but I'm not a good argument woman's leaving the administration yeah but I Would also\nArgue this you guys Nikki Haley's ultimate goal is it in two thousand a twenty four she's going to run for president\nThere's no two ways about it she\nClearly don't go around about it I don't know that for a fact\nOh I I think one that I think one hundred percent I Do and then we\nI have there she needs to reconnect in a world where with wins and twenty twenty and Pence runs on twenty twenty four there's no way oh I disagree I disagree\nVision but I Can't worry about twenty twenty four that's what I think that's part of that I made ... head right now but we don't know I mean then that is why she wants to go to the Senate\n... ah I don't I'm not buying the Senate thing at all I don't I don't I don't know what she's doing so I'm open no any and all suggestions\nI if I had my

the big tour I I Do\nFind is just a hysterical it's like I as I said it's like Beyonce and Jay Z there like going out of the twelve city to\nOr it's not they're going to play it together it's like share and you're like you've been telling us you've been retiring for ten years just stopped [laughter]\nI Love that the reaction from Jim this morning when I said oh Hillary Clinton out there saying that as a bully\nJust stop but before the tour and get started she's got a few things to say so she's she's kinda getting you know getting everybody wrapped up for the tour when you say when you say that's true\nMaybe maybe that was the theory on this I don't know but I you know those are pretty cool yeah well sometimes sometimes the appetizer can ruin the meal and sometimes I didn't want to order an entree and I feel like some people this might be that\nYeah let's let's let's see what a Mrs Clinton had to say\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seem to\nRecognize and respect strength\nAnd you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nBut I thought and it and the next line is and insulted and attacked Christine Blasey Ford\nI'm gonna I'm gonna try and be generous with her here which this is to me just classic killer where she's she's getting some of what's going on here\nBut she just completely gets in her own way without one line that's when we can be civil again when we get our way then we'll be civil\nI mean she just she just is she has had so much more influence and a lot of it has not been good there's been a lot that's you know hurt so negative so that I think that's why so many people at this stage of the game or like you've you've you've gotta go yes stopped talking\nYou you've hurt us now\nYou're not helping Republicans on the other hand like yeah\nCan we add three more cities to that tour before the before the election [noise] ...\nGood morning how are you guys today from\nUm just fired commented on the Hillary's speech yes and I personally I agree with it just requires\nA instead a Democrat or Republican and that's actually what happened speak I Believe it I just try to be bipartisan and every episode of argument is that\nHey hey get whatever they want when they were you try to be bipartisan and they never acquiesce to what we think it's a good thing for their country\nAnd um yeah if you think Trump's got any go God you're she's she's she makes Trump work like that you know as far as he goes\nBut then again it was true are you know it gets people running for president ... ...\nWhat what what what makes me say what I said on Fox News day at the Democratic comic carrying the guy was going on the Tea Party after they play that many or what they were going through\nA Tea Party what you're going ever carried a police on and then click passers by like those part when people dead so difference between the conservative mob\nAnd you know ... and now she's player to that because that's got to talk to still listen store\nThat's why it's our tone deaf I'm In that video is banned everywhere over the last four or five days and everybody's showing it for a while people thought that was Portland Maine actually there was a little bit of confusion because of the way that\nWe did and hurt her comments when people here but the first time it's like ...\nIt just ... right on to that video if you're Republicans like Fox hasn't been able to show that video enough for the last three days right now they've got another reason to show it because she\nPutting yourself out there is the voice of quote unquote reasons as we we can't be civil right now that I\nDisagree I don't think those people like her at all I think they may not have heard those are Bernie people but it doesn't matter if you're Trump or if you're a Republican there at\nThe same it's like Jay Gonzalez trying to pin Charlie is from ... ... any Republican would do that there was Hillary and they are the same and they go hand in hand she says we can't be civil right now and look at I'm In Oregon there block on the streets and chase them all the guys down with the times\nAnd it's not a good look and I it's just amazing to me that she said that and that she said it in the way it's one thing to say look\nThere can be no doubt that the country has lost some stability here and there's plenty of blame to go around look I'd been subject to this since Nineteen eighty two I think you should probably Ninety nine Ninety to return back because she went and she can list all heard\nYeah I've been a Greste upon this way that way or the other way and then can be and we leave everything else out fine you can't say\nThat's when civility can return when we get back in church that's the part where you just completely that's it\n[laughter] let me go to Steven Boston Good morning the\nMorning Kim good morning maybe live from what's gonna happen here I think as as soon as this coast so Chuck Schumer is going to come out and said Donald Trump ... the Clintons to go around and do this to us because what's the when winter you know what I mean what is she going to go\nProtect her husband from all the you know all the stuff that he did it with the women and and you know ... they're going to say oh cabin on this that and the other thing and you know I I'll show you how to beat the women down and keep them awake I mean what is the upside for going out because\nI was ...

my friend\nEd is that and yeah it's it's summertime again which is bizarre but ah that's okay [laughter] right [laughter] oh man I Want to talk about a negotiating credit card fees\nI Do because there's been so much um news recently last few days last week it information about the fed up the interest rates and you know people um I think are concerned about their personal debt which they should be\nAnd interest rates and personal knowledge and we are we we do have some\nPower as consumers you know and so I don't talk a little bit about this this morning credit card companies you know a ... question but we do have a right and we can negotiate certain things like our fees like our interest rates and so I wanted to give people a little confidence today\nIn knowing how to go about that and the great thing to shop around shop around for the best deal the credit card companies are all\nVery competitive what's the best way to find the best deal go online Google who has the best credit card\nYou know rates affinity clubs like AAA sometimes offered the best deals or you know case in point Jet Blue people flying Jet Blue that card can be a very advantageous she'll get the best re\nBike can carry just like you would for anything else that you would buy and at the same time do it if the credit card has issued by a bank that is chartered\nIn the state of Massachusetts generally they had the best deals because our state laws Massachusetts or some of the most aggressive in the country you know I say that all the time\nUm look for a look for a deal where you get zero percent interest for a period of time to catch on that as it you gotta check\nThe length of time that the offer you know is good because if it's only good for Thirty years sixty days then what's the point really right you know it is the key is always to pay off your credit card\nSo you want to make sure that it's at least for nine months here check to find out what the interest rate will jump to once the offer ads and if there's any sort of a payoff penalty because they can make is great office and then they can say that if you pay this much then five percent\nOf the kicks in and make sure that that doesn't happen [laughter] I'll start with your oldest card\nAnd then just call the company and ask for a lower rate why start with your skirt well because you know companies want us to be loyal and especially if your payment history is good they want to keep you as a satisfied customer joke you call it used to you know what\nI Want to pay thirty percent interest anymore\nI'm and I'm going to close my accounts if you don't lower my race\nThey will fight to keep you the key to negotiating always is you know you have to be polite you have to be patient but you also have to be persistent and if you were talking to somebody who does not have the authority to help you and you need to say can I talk to you supervisor and they\nCan put somebody else on the phone who can help you and like I said threatened to close your account ... sorry if you can't help me I have three other companies that weren't my business and I'm happy to go to them of course you can't make that\nYou know blindly you have to hash or allege\nRight right leader appeared to walk right\nYeah and then the other thing is you know eliminate your at your feet and be smart about that many cards\nOffer different programs it may just be Jet Blue MasterCard but under that card they have four or five different programs it got to know what they are I had\nA personal experience is like where I got a letter saying I'm your annual the is going up to forty dollars and blah blah blah blah blah and I know I don't I don't have an annual and his card and I don't want one so I called the company and I said what does the button and it will say oh well we're going to start giving you four times the value\nOf your dollar we're going to give you points that are four times\nFor your ... your travel toward travel and I will go toward miles no but anytime you stay in a hotel and blah blah blah blah well guess what I don't use the boys to stay in a hotel and I never will\nSo that's not valuable to me right I'll tell you it was valuable to me the forty dollars in my own pocket sure so they did they eliminated the end it will say and instead I Will or three times to the point that more valuable to me so people have to be smart about that and they have to think about that Kim to those are just some of the top things that I'd like\nPeople to really keep in mind as they use credit cards and we're doing it or or some cars without even thinking about it\nWell the thing that you've said I think that just stands out the most is just for a lot of people anyway it's just the idea that you can negotiate this I think people just think that's my card that's their rules there are um stock and that's not the case\nExactly right and a lot of people ... well what's a um what is it good or interest rate well and that's also hard to say because every case is personal\nAnd every deal is personal you will pay a higher interest rate if you're getting more points or more reward and the key to making that a good deal is just", "show_name": "The Kuhner Report", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "10"}
