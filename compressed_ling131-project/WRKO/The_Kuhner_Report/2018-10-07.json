moving forward you also leave with a copy of one of ... books you can call or you can tax whichever you prefer if you tax just be sure to include your first and last name eight hundred seven zero five twelve thirty two is that number\nAgain ... eight hundred seven zero five one two three two you're listening to Joel Johnson money wisdom Joel is a certified financial planner and the c._e._o. of Johnson brunette is the official wealth management partner of the Yukon huskies Joel anytime we're talking about retirement planning we're going to encounter some decisions\nThat just can't be done you know a lot of things about your retirement plan you constantly tweaking move around as you go but some things once you make the decision it's irreversible there's no going back and and doing it so let's talk about\nSome of those things that you absolutely need to get right the first time around one of those things when you start your Social Security\nWell you're right if you start to your benefit at age sixty two and now you get to sixty six or even Seventy and realize hey I'm going to live a lot longer than I thought I should have\nWaited to collect my benefit later it's too late sorry you made an irreversible decision now one or two of you out there thinking wait a minute I've heard that I could at age sixty six I can pay all those benefits back\nThat I got from sixty to to sixty six and then get a restart yeah you can that's a bad idea so let's just forget about that for a minute and if you didn't know that just never mind\nIt's not that important it's a really bad idea to give a whole chunk of money back to the Social Security administration and any time [noise]\nSo basically starting Social Security is an irreversible decision\nAnd here's the thing I was just talking to somebody about this\nLast week we were having a meeting up in Boston in a big actually this radio station up there the folks that work for this radio station I was talking to one of the executives up there and we were talking about the fact that people make the Social Security decision the wrong way they look at it as if it was the only asset they have and it's not it's one part\nOf many other financial assets that you have\nYour retirement plan for one case or for three days your brokerage accounts your bank money whether you have debt are not going into retirement\nNow whether or not you have to homes and you're going to sell one to help your income in retirement so the big mistake people make when it comes to Social Security yes\nYou're making an era vocal decision when you choose went to take it but also don't look at that as a single we call it in a silo don't look at that decision in a silo it's got to be done\nIn the context of the rest of your finances not everybody should take it early not everybody should take it late it depends on your individual situation that's why we want to help you with that retirement income planet factors in the Social Security ...\nAnother on doable irreversible decision is something that not everybody will have to face because not everybody has a pension but\nIf you do have a pension and you have a spouse you need to be thinking about whether or not you want to take that spousal benefits on your pension or you know maybe a fifty percent spousal continuation or none at all that's something that once you pull the trigger there's no going back and changing\nRight and the pension decision is one of the biggest decisions people making one of the things that that's interesting about the pension decision let's say again are retiring I'm sixty five I Want to decide whether I'm going to take a hundred percent of my benefit and then if I die before Wendy she gets zero or what do I want to take it reduced benefits\nAnd then if I die first she gets a big chunk of that payment for the rest of her life the problem is if I take a reduced benefits she dies first I've left a bunch of money on the table we don't know who's going to die first in most cases we can kind of gas sometimes but we we can't know for sure\nAnd so there are so many different ways to approach the pension including I could take a hundred percent benefit my highest possible benefits\nLeave her with no survivor benefit but by a life insurance to really take care of her which is just like taking the replacement pension benefits so so many different options here it's important to get help in making that pension decision\nMost of the time if you ask your friends are what are you doing Bob you know what should I say how should I take my pension you're going to get the wrong answer everybody's unique and the situation\nAnother decision that doesn't seem irreversible and technically it isn't always is whether or not to get life insurance you say well I I can make that decision later I can always get life insurance down the road if I determine that I'm going to need it but it may be a little trickier than that\nThat might be trickier you might be too old you might be too sick people think well you know I'm not really that sick oh but wait a minute there might have been a hard situation that came up three or four years ago were to you it was just a scarier doctor says you're going to be fine but from a life insurance company standpoint it represents a higher risk now you can't get insurance\nAny kidney issues a slight spikes in certain tests of kidney liver anything like that and blood sugar\nCould prevent you from getting life insurance so the time to decide if you need life insurance is now and then if you do want I shouldn't say need but want for most of our clients is do you want life insurance to do some special planning things maybe leave money the grandkids and so on then let's lock that and now\nThe other side of this is should you dropped your life insurance that can be an irreversible decision and we're always very careful of telling people to drop their life insurance because in my mind as a financial planner worst thing that can happen is I recommend somebody dropped life insurance in three months later they pass away in hoops there's a big problem for me and for that family\nYeah certainly something you want to weigh all of your options before you make a decision there the last one job is not something that on his face seems like an irreversible decision but choosing a retirement date\nCan kind of emotionally be irreversible once you kind of hone in on a date it's hard to change plans have you thought oh I Need to work another year or two or even worse you retire and then have to go\nBack [noise] yeah it's one of those things where I think you know we set something in our mind in the future that's maybe two years five years out and we're so emotionally locked into that that to change it yeah we can change that retirement date we can always say we're going to work a year later with that is going to have a little bit of a psychological toll because\nFor three four five years I was counting on retiring in a certain date so on a certain date so if you don't have a well conceived plan in place\nYou end up walking away from your paycheck earlier than you should have\nOr you change a mid stream you know you can always go back to work in some other capacity but realistically it's going to be very difficult to re enter the workforce\nUm some firms may not hire you yes that's age discrimination but you know good luck fighting that fight or they may not hire you and you may get a lot less of a salary that when you were working at the other job at your main job so choosing a retirement date is critical\nOne of the things when we take you through that money map retirement plan if you are not retired yet it'll show you when you can retire and be okay for the rest of your life and a lot of people come to us and they'll say Joel\nTell me you know I Want to retire at age sixty four can you tell me if I can do that or not and will run all the numbers will run the analysis for you\nWill assume a certain interest rate that we talk through with you will ask you what kind of income you want to retirement we'll look at what you've already saved what you're guaranteed sources of income or going to be whether that's pension or Social Security will put all that together and we'll be able to tell you given a certain set of assumptions which for us are pretty darn conservative\nIf you can retire at that age sixty four if you have to work a little bit longer and you know what some people come in and they find out hey I can retire early then I thought I could so now the question is do you want to retire that early or do you want to keep working so I set a little while ago but I Want you to call us and get your money map retirement review\nA call ... I'll tell you exactly how the money map retirement review works you come in sit down with us have a cup of coffee and there's no obligation no risk\nBut we want to put together a snapshot for you that's why we call it a map it's going to show you on one page exactly where you're at\nAnd based on what you told us if you are on the right track if you're not on the right track you'll be happy came in and you'll find out right now\nWhat you can adjust we'll give you those recommendations you don't have to implement them with us we're here to help in any way we can a good friend of mine says will help everybody if you will become clients if you want and that's okay with me and that's how I feel also on the same as my friend so\nCall us get that money map retirement review again consist of three main things and income announces for you telling you when you can retire what rate of return you need on your money a second is that stress test on all your investments make sure you're not putting yourself at risk and this time when the market could go down any day\nAnd then last but not least that one page financial plan so if you have two hundred and fifty thousand dollar save for retirement\nCall now one eight hundred seven zero five one two three to come on in get your money map retirement plan one eight hundred seven zero five one two three two you can also taxed and leave your first and last name\nWe've made it as easy as possible for you to reach out for the call or text would ever used for you again eight hundred seven zero five one two three two that's eight hundred seven zero five twelve thirty two that's all we have time for on today's show thanks so much for joining in\nBlood with you next week same time same place right here on Joel Johnson money [noise]\nInvestment advisory services offered through J.

there's another one uh there's another story in North Dakota\nHeidi Heitkamp is is running for reelection she's a Democrat\nAnd she is she is now down\n... points to her Republican challenger who's a congressman and you know North Dakota is one of those states\nThat only ... they have so few people that they only have one congressman so the congressman also like the senator represents the entire state and he's running ahead of her she's she's pretty much on the she's pretty much gonna have to vote against Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd are they the percentage of people in North Dakota want Kavanaugh confirmed is even a greater than in West Virginia\nMeanwhile Mitch McConnell's was badgered at the at the Reagan National airport yesterday by anti Kavanaugh activists that just happened to be a TV crew working with them um they they said that he was pro rate and the uh\nThe people who were heckling him were identified as Tracy court or the center for popular democracies quote unquote racial justice campaign director\nAnd name that kind of positive women networks USA's positive women's network usa whatever that is executive director\nEight for four or five hundred forty to forty two last night as you know the uh the the prosecutor from Arizona who ask the questions in the morning of a of a Christine\nBlasey Ford the female prosecutor from Arizona she issued a report to the Senate Republicans pointing out all the holes in the the testimony of ah Christine Blasey Ford\nBroadcast news networks last night or continue to hammer away at the sexual assault allegations using the seventh FBI inquiry into Kavanaugh's pass this latest news hook however\nThey devoted only a miniscule portion of the Kavanaugh coverage to the memo that was released a by sex crimes prosecutor Rachel metro\nAnd of course again that was a it was a pretty a thorough uh\nUh the bounty of or many of her a claims\nWe've actually got a new allegation and how he what's that there was a party at a frat after Kavanaugh had graduated that included sex acts with a stripper yes and there's no evidence that Kavanaugh was there or that he was a participant by senator Coons has decided to forward the allegations to Grassley anyways\nOkay so Grassley basically just sent him back a letter that said you believe that they may\nYeah so this is this is like the one in uh in Rhode Island where he he and a judge or were charged with raping a woman on a boat in Newport Harbor and or at Sheldon Whitehouse went running with that too was to to Lindsey Graham\nValley was a grassy writes we reached a new level of absurdity with this allegation there's no evidence that judge Kavanaugh was anywhere near the part of your had anything to do with it at all in fact the only person we can be sure attended the party was the accuser himself\n[laughter] if there's another one to hear I I Can't even I I Can't even find them all now but\nA ... now there's another story here this is by I think by NBC text messages suggest capital I wanted to refute accusers claimed before it became public this is a Ramirez claim you know where she says there gaps in her uh her her\nMemory because she was drinking so heavily and she she had to spend six days talking to her lawyers and a ... and ... at before she could decide the cabinet may have exposed himself to her\nAnd she also was texting friends asking that I ever tell you about this and uh so so now now that now it somehow bad that Kavanaugh I wanted to refute the accusers claims before they became public\nSo this is I mean this is what the this is what they're up against this what the he's up against here and but I I don't think it's I don't think it's working I don't think anything is fixing cars that there is nothing there is no they're there to quote Peter Struck on the uh on the Russia investigation into what the twenty six team Trump campaign\nSo today the New York times puts out a new story to what kind of a to keep the heat on Donald Trump as he heads to Mississippi for a campaign appearance tonight on behalf of the Republican Senate candidate down there and um\nIt's a Trump engaged in suspect tax games as he reaped riches from his father he reaped riches from his father he inherited money\nAnd then here's a quote I mean a lot of this a lot of this story by the way as a as a critique of of the New York journalist who covered Donald Trump including the New York times\nI built what I built myself Mr Trump has said a narrative that was long amplified by off incredulous coverage for news organizations including the New York times\n\n[noise] of course the story of how Donald Trump got rich cannot be reduced to handouts from his father but that's what we've done in the headline we've reduced it the handouts from his father 'cause that's all anyone's gonna read know who's got who's got time to read all this they say that\nA Trump by the time he was three years old was making two hundred thousand dollars a year\nAs part of ... effort to hand is money down well pretty good for a three year old [noise] [noise]\nWell I you know there are guys\nThat have they have they're the guys in the launch woman's union in Boston who as soon as their son is born they signed him up for the launch orbits union so we can you know even if the kid as an infant isn't getting paid he's at least on the seniority\nList I I mean isn't isn't that something that's traditionally done you try to help out your offspring Mitt is is that actually especially to avoid the death tax yeah\nAcross the decades aided and abated by less than aggressive journalism we're back to this again I'm just you know I haven't got time to read the whole thing it at a better by less than aggressive journalism\nMr Trump has made sure his financial history would be sensationalized far more than ...\nSo there there it is it for four or five hundred forty to forty two I uh I Hope but Trump makes a trip to North Dakota just like you did to West Virginia I think he's already made a trip to North Dakota has any I Am pretty sure he has\nIf he's got ... if ... if if he's ten points up I mean he may make one more trip just to make sure it's in the back but I mean ten points is that's that's pretty good margin over a a over a ... an incumbent senator at this break\nEight four for five hundred the forty to forty two is time for a call with I think I Will take a will take a call Tom your next ... go ahead Tom\n... thanks how are we have two questions one sexual assault the terrible thing but all people have to do now is made the accusation

he made up that story about being in Vietnam but book or a yeah Booker has admitted that he wrote a column for the uh Stanford newspaper when he was out there in Palo Alto as an undergraduate saying that he had rubbed a woman at the age of Fifteen yeah\nI Know ... so that always said should ... someone in the intro was saying if you harassed a woman in high school your life should be ruined I mean what about what about Cory Booker he admits it\nKevin Kevin ... denies it Corey below admitted it\nRight or is he a judge Jim and also though then make a sexual out is Asian but also it is the one that went ahead and fabricated his a Vietnam so you know go ahead and call him wrong so\nRight going no I agree I agree what about ...\nHarris has passed I mean she started out as she was the
