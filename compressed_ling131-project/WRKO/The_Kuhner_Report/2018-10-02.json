I don't want to but\nHe's writing in it that's the worst dark and rainy and it's just like impairs your visibility I hate that it makes me so nervous\nI had a stretch this morning I didn't even get to tell you guys is just very quickly I Know that did this just a warning for everybody out there I saw like all of a sudden I realized looking down to the there were just red lights you know galore people on their brakes\nAnd I for a brief second you know you're kind of freaked out you get off your accelerator and as I'm getting there I realized there is like a pothole that has formed as a result of this rain and for all intents and purposes there's a portion of the road that is gone\nAnd people are coming up on this and it's water and there's one car kind of hanging in it\nAnd everybody else trying to get around it\nIt's just that moment you go if I had an exit I might just go home but fortunately I mean at this person's not such great fortune but for me\nIt was somebody who is already there are so everybody else realize that's what was happening you're going around but yeah bad morning on the roadway so be careful folks\nSo back to China for them to do one thing I Do\n... does union in this whole thing and so there's two things I'm positive we're going to hear about today and my reaction to each of them is to say the other which is so for for Democrats are liberals that say how could you do this in a week and this thing's been rushed and you've got to take time\n[laughter]\nAll you asked for last week wasn't investigators yeah now that you've got one you're moving the needle for Republicans and conservatives and this is why I'm mentioning you know because a buddy of mine is doing this right now which is that how can you judge him based on what he did when he testified when he's got a Thirteen year record on the bench\nOkay but you told me last week that it was awesome what he did and now you're trying to tell me don't judging based on that\nLike do you guys see what you're both during very right he was terrible and you wanted an investigation you got it so both of you be quiet on those that's my view on that yeah if there's things over by friday it it'd better be over by friday for me\nI'm there has to be a limit on this you cannot be what is his wife doing right now\nWell I gotta tell ya I say this with all due respect\nHis wife is not who I Am concerned about I'm Sorry that his life has turned upside down I Know it stinks it is a lifetime appointment\nSo I my sympathy for all of that part of it is starting to run out my issue is this look\nAt some point they're just going to have to make a decision we can continue to dig and dig and dig and dig into this guy's passed\nAnd eventually it's going to be enough it's lined up you know I always say that when a candidate runs for too long eventually you just get soured on them because that's just people in jail right so you got to draw the line in the sand\nYou know yeah there is this exterior part of this that his family's in hell and the nation is being held up and it's just enough enough and everybody said\nBut beyond all of that and we're getting closer to the on all of that there comes a point where\nYou have to draw lines and so it's a line has been drawn on friday okay and unless we find out that that guy did something so egregious that now we have to go further into this beyond what we already know about him then you got to draw the lines hand and you gotta you gotta ...\nSo your worst nightmare scenario is\nThat Thursday now at nine o'clock there is a new woman who has a credible allegation at your worst nightmare it is because they're not doing it and not this is over this is it you've gotten as much you do you honestly think Trump's going to say hey enough let's let investigate this new one model if that were to happen\nMy question yesterday at this time of day after I watch the president all day yesterday my question yesterday was if if something like that happens is the president kind of say you know what Mr Kavanaugh thanks so much for coming kind of guy and he just he just pulled it he just has a lock\nThat was my prediction on Saturday I even read it which is I thought he would be pulled by Wednesday but part of that prediction was that there is no way with the amount of time and resources that are being put in right now to get ...\nIf you told me by today already that they wouldn't have found anything new I would've said you're crazy because they're gonna they're gonna and they haven't yet so nothing surprises me anymore\nI just feel like everybody has got to have you ... you can ...\nPeople you know the old adage you know yeah it did get an engine you take a mile and I mean this could just keep going for ever Jeff we really want to weed out\nSo there does have to be a line in the sand so I mean you got three more days four more days and if something doesn't come up beyond what's there than we take the proof that he's there or at least the the allegations and the testimony that's been brought forward and you've got to make a decision that ... that\nI don't want to hear that the FBI is doing a shot to invest it now I don't want to hear all wearing after you die and rights issue and you've got one we can't we can't keep doing this stuff right\nAnd it whether he gets on the bench or not you you've got what you got make a call so I'm Matthew is and hope for the morning Matthew\n... year more than ... come on reading and math are great flick like they say you you you're told going right and and that the truth comes questionable so you mean yo\nYo's ages you on that would be you know you know the argument here which is I look I Believe I'm with you I think Kavanaugh was lying under oath for me that's a deal I wouldn't vote for however ... either but do you think foreigners don't want to drew\n... ... ... yes I Do\nSo about flying for example about the double doors about\nIf there is that she ... she not getting on the Supreme Court no matter what so we're not voting on her were voting on ...\nExactly if I acted up ... if I act the way he acted furlough senators and his courtroom don't you think he would have helped me to go to court\nIt show how he was and I'm not a big fan of Lindsey Graham but Lindsey Graham him right out and said you know people should be ashamed of those I mean to shrink become ...\nIncluding book we've got to go into a shaded passed\nAnd um and those ... it was thought it was embarrassing they want to fight that she never looked up she never talked from the cup she's reading up attacks I mean she was almost robotic ... and you know ... you know we we we don't spend any time just saying okay well I mean if they were all\nI mean how did they behave but was it was here and I just thought it was completely unfair and I thought cabinet I've got a good\nTime you know I I I see this and I know this will make you mad and a whole lot of other listeners being washed gets rough and tumble city and come on this idea that people keep talking about how the process has been so tough and it's just\n... I I think you know at this stage of the game the judge can stand up for himself he's a big boy and he knows what the game is here and if the allegations are true\nAnd there's something that's necessary is in his past we need to look at that I'm I'm sort of getting tired of everybody talking about how all the judges treated so unfairly the judges and being treated unfairly it any more than anybody else's goes for these positions and sometimes has some issues in their past\nI I don't disagree with you there but I think it seems to be a question that you know you were very aggressive the way he fought back I mean wouldn't we expect to fight back then to be weak and just to sit there and take it I mean so yeah I mean it's a rough and tumble play Washington\nYou know he's going for you know there's this incredible position but I mean in this fight back so I mean I think you've got to give them a couple of points for fighting back\nI think fighting back is not the issue I think\nWhat it is or what one thing one of the way to get out of okay you ... it was like that football coach mentality where like in less I'm screaming and I don't care about my team really cause here's an idea Jon wouldn't set on a bench and never said anything during the games and the one that died on\n... you know why is it that if a guy just screams regardless of what he's saying we're like well the guys fighting wreck okay but I mean my big thing with Kavanaugh always has been from the moment this thing happened is that\nI always I always heard the the line I think it's thrower Imus in one of those who goes to the lottery spoke of his honor the faster I count on my spoons meaning in other words the the\nThe more that goes on about honesty is the more you ... I'm not so sure about this guy why doesn't that apply in this case\nOne to anybody that did what Kavanaugh did in Kavanaugh's cord that would be used against them because you'd be like no he was in ... the my ultimate reason why I wouldn't want to have it on the court is whether you think this should have happened or not and whether you think these senators are appropriate or not and whether you think Ford should have got nearing or not\nUltimately gets down to this for me I'm I have to assess whether or not I think that Brett Kavanaugh is the best most qualified or belongs on the Supreme Court and the reason why I don't is\nThat there's an advantage in alive told him this multiple times in her husband's a lawyer he knows it well if you have all on your side ... the facts and your side pound the facts if you have neither pound the table that can never\nNever be unacceptable defense for a Supreme Court nominee which is pound the table because you have to pound the facts and you have to find the law and he didn't do that in that hearing\nFor me that's why the shouting and screaming is not impressive because that to me that was weakness you you've you that his strength I view it as weakness\nWhen you have to be shouting because you can't win your argument otherwise that's no good for me and he'd that's when he chose to do I think he was or to do with by the president and I don't think the Trump to help them there well\nSo that I thought that his performance there was a good one because I thought it was disrespectful and I thought that was problematic I don't like that I don't want that to me immediately came off as being arrogant but I and I also think he's not a good a table pounder I don't think that's in his nature\nOr he would have been better off to just continue to stand by his story\n[laughter] my problem is I don't think history is one that he's telling the truth\nThat can be fun on TALK radio there can be fun and um yeah and the ... or not you were when you're having a discussion was afraid that we can do that but but ultimately you do have to ask you but let's step back is this the guy that we need on the Supreme Court at this time prior to that of urine\nI was totally fine with it do I think that Ford should've gotten married and I think there's a lot of debate on that I'm not sure I'd history will judge a man I Know that would be a woman didn't get a hearing and I know that is why they didn't get your you know they don't have as much ... board did but Ford got a hearing weather's so that was when he was court\nBecause then once she got the hearing he decided to go that route which is something that he would never stopped right\nLinda she's in Cambridge It's MORNING hey good morning Linda\nA good morning I'm Kim here for Mr Right here in LA\nOkay they had a poll out where they've called a women voters and asked them if McCaskill opposition the cabin are affected their voting decision and forty nine percent of women said it made them less likely to vote for the Democrat\nOkay now do you think that he doesn't have\nCalled on where are you going with that Linda's Jim supposed to do that are what what are your which aren't\nMaking a statement that saw what is this fair but what if what is it a little unclear on it\nI Can't tell you what the polls said okay because the cats though\nThat no vote that forty nine percent of women say they're less likely to vote for her now for a Democrat or ... and they're less likely to vote for her but do you think his temperament leaves him out of the running for the Supreme Court\nI think he's lying does I think that yes ma'am I think if if it is what can you lie about camp\nI think that he was very adamant that his yearbook all that ridiculous innocent that your book which is ridiculous and if he should have just been honest about it\nBut he made up things about it instead of the fact that he constantly was indignant about anyone insinuating that he drank on a regular basis and he drank too much those those may not have anything to do with him being a good justice but the problem is he just didn't tell the truth now why wasn't he telling the truth about that just tell it\nWe all did you see things in I'm\nSorry I differ from you and I did that for every baby I thought that his when he was stopped there speaking in his defense that ... it was absolutely profound and a lot of winning cried when he did it okay so you two guys a totally different opinion\nBut that's why we're discussing away\nYou know what really bothers me about all of this

was set up by the way they found out that was set up it just so happened to be the CNN cameras were there and everything so that was set up like that okay but\nNobody has a problem with all these

members\nSaying here um and we're talking about ... football coach who has been suspended\nThis week without pay after a sane during a press conference that there was a bad call him a team had been raped\nAnd I'm looking at people who won writing in and I'm looking for right now and I can't sing find that that are saying you have to look that word up in the dictionary because it means and we got a please go to um Webster dot com [noise]\nThere are multiple definitions for the word rape one being an outrageous violation\nI understand that there are all kinds of you know explanations and there's all kinds of um\nDefinitions of the word but the fact of the matter is in in our society today words you've taken on certain meanings regardless of what Webster says you do that the definition might be\nAnd for everyone I think we all understand what that word means in society today\nYou know it it's so for for the football coach to use it in a press conference you know the the you point out not even in like the heat at the moment which I don't know why you'd use it then either on on the sidelines but okay let's just say he did and he's yelling at\nThe raf he said it later in a press conference where he's had a chance to think that through and that's just not the words they use\nFor on so can I say I got screwed because that's a reference for for sex I\nIs that forced sex one two or wherever you are you going to do that always where when someone raises an issue on one thing you immediately said what about this what about that what about well what about it\nI don't know we can evaluate that I guess if you want but if you're thinking I think that word is the same as the other one and yeah and why do you always feel like\nSomething deeply personal is being stripped from you if you can't use the R word going forward have I said it in reference to a village being pillage sure am I going to try to be better about that go on for dear as\nWell I slip up probably ... but don't act like this is the end of your life for the world you she side is going on in a basket or to even say that any more\nWhat does that has to be being used it let's say if you use it in reference to a village being pillaged\nAnd set on fire and people being killed that is a true extreme violation a bad call on the football field is not you might feel like you guys\nRipped off you might feel like he got robbed that you were raped\nThat's different and if you want to look it up and Webster you're right and you want to say that the definition is an extreme violation and extreme violation is not during a game when you had a bad call\nThat's just that's that's the whole point right there you've just actually made the whole point people dying homes being set on fire people being killed ... you know this these kinds of ... that's different\nSo for all of you who want to call and please do eh call and tell me why it is that it should be used on a football field and more importantly in a press conference after because you had a bad call\nFootball to get a wake up as you look I'm Sorry but he's a world is changed and they this idea of we we talked about this was August one proven but this idea of you know shame and somebody 'cause they're not wearing the uniform or whatever and that's why that's one of the issues there\nReally were going to have the guy running around in his boxers to make the point like\nThis idea of you've got a you've got to get up at four thirty damage to show me that you want it and you got to run until you're ... because that's what we do because well you can then we'll keep find all those macho stuff and all this you're gonna have to\nRethink this a little bit going forward because you're gonna consistently if you're going to fight on this one then you're going to get burned again if you don't understand that this is for a lot of people in the country this is unacceptable you're going to get burned again I'm just telling you\nOr did you hear the ah the kid down in Georgia that died or over the weekend on that head to head damage and he died did you hear the coach a statement on up not in the coaches response was he loves this came he came here and he played every day no matter how sick he was he always came to practice and that's that's not the right respond or there this is what you mean the Maryland story is one like the\n\nWe can keep putting up billboards and to you to tell you got to change your ways it's it's it's all it's irrelevant whether you want it to be that way or not it's just how it is mark ... says this again mark ripples gone ... might be gone at the end of the year anyway based on his record but you can't\nBe doing this anymore that guy in Texas and is not going to do that again I don't know why he's not suspended that was out rages\nBut\nYou've got to start to knock it off and you got to start to get with the program and you've got to start we all are on eggshells you've got to watch what you say and this stuff is the one I kept buried yesterday was because you said we got murdered\nWe need to hang on to macho no we don't but fine than be smarter macho\nWe were physical we were better than them and we got some calls at ... terrible\nOn but de do use that phrase oh that's really the only one I ... if he said we got it and he used the F word while he would be bad for him he wouldn't be suspended no that's true you wouldn't\nAnd that's what he meant really but I it's just it's\nYou got to be just got our Martin I there is no go just going to say this now so nope it's unfortunately Vermont liberal you're the one that got nailed Ford\nAnd you're the you're the ... and that's what I'm saying and that's exactly it\nAnd they're going to be people who are going to be the teachable moment and he's he's one of 'em right now\nAnd don't let it be you go on for everybody's got the word now there's a big national story so this stuff's over with\nA uh she this asteroid out of St Louis speaking of just kind of sports stories and kind of crazy stories a mom who filed a federal a federal lawsuit citing\nAge and gender discrimination because her son who was going into his junior year trying out from varsity soccer and he didn't make the team but he couldn't play Jane V. anymore because they have an age limit\nSo\nShe went and tried to sue now her lawsuit in the end got thrown out\nI just said no can't do but uh\nShe she said that it was not fair that this kid didn't make the varsity team but couldn't continue to play JV the school's statement about it is that we try to develop players younger and so we don't hold spots for those older guys but her argument was that\nAcross the school where the girls are playing the girls can stay on JV if they don't make the varsity squad\n\n[noise] ah I Love the judges explanation I was really worried he said no one to uh the court finds that involving itself in does case would be contrary to the public interest and involving a federal court in a soccer programs coaching decisions\nAs to an individual student athlete will rarely advance either interest\nAbove all right it's not unique to get us involved here there's no good coming from a verse than out of it I ...\nI hadn't heard of this policy before my mum when I was in school you're going to be energy we as a junior they'd be on there is a senior you're more likely wouldn't because it's bad optics but\nWell this is the same when my son went to high school this is just as policy I don't have a bright JV as a freshman and sophomore you don't play after that you if you don't make the varsity squad you're finished playing that support\n'em and they and and the reason there's no girls so it's not like you can say in the ... about the girls get to a their reasoning is the exact same thing they're developing talent and you know you move on who would want that it's\nBad enough that you're a junior on the JV team because you couldn't make the varsity team now you're only there but his mommy and daddy sue to get you on the chain yeah\nI'd like off how was that a good look for anyone on the thing about this too that I don't understand because again being a parent who's one of my kids went through high school that had this policy you know this going in\nIf if if that's a policy you don't like it may be and you are adamant that your kid is going to play that sport and they're going to play it until they walk out of high school or whatever then maybe you chose the wrong place to go to school\nI I think there is a public school but I don't know but I can tell you this about Lou do that's where it happened in la do they do is a very ... it's a very very um high profile and very prominent a community in St Louis\n... Horton Watkins high school I mean that has to be\nPublished it sounds like a public school ... do schools but yeah I I you're so right though Jim who is the kid who wants to be on the team after you've been cut because your mom and dad took it to court\nMhm [noise] it was a weird raw he did say to\nYeah I just that you it's too late in the season well it is soccer though it's like there are there plays the learn really like you know how to play soccer one way or whatever so that was a bit of a stretch for me but I\nI'm a little bit surprised by the ruling and just because of the world we live in these days it seemed like they\nAlways end up siding with the sewer and so she was going to win this kid was going to have to play and we're going to do that thing so I I'm I'm happy\nWith the you know we had the caller earlier talking about activist judges and whatever well here's one that isn't this great because like I'm going to stay right out of this\nI got to tell you this what is at such a precedent to say would have taken this and they would have started down this road\nThat would have been you know I I'm Glad they didn't\nI mean these are these are decisions that schools make I don't\nI don't see this as discrimination because they have a reason behind it they're not discriminating against his kids age\n... it's just that they had a lot of kids who come out for soccer you can only develop so many and after that you've essentially sort of get your ... that's the way they see it and if you can't make the varsity squad then you just sort of your peak with the sport and that's the way it works\nI I mean so there first argument was that age discrimination and that they didn't fly and then there next argument with a sex discrimination because the girls can do it in the ... and that didn't fly\nAnd then the step father just goes out there just shoots himself in the foot just goes what if they said cut all the blacks that wouldn't be okay yeah I mean like if we really that's really what you're right that's the comparison brand new to me\nI mean if you're if you're rational and you sit back and you look at this you understand the reason and the reason the girls can keep playing is because they don't have as many\nGirls in the program like let's ignore the fact that you used the term the blacks to begin\nWith place right now they don't have as many as many girls playing in the program they have enough space for those girls to play in fact that they the athletic that's that was part of the statement from the athletic director here\nYou know we want to have that rule for the girls we just don't have enough that interest in their team we don't have enough people to field a team\nAnd maybe maybe not it could be each individual program just a different\nWhatever it is he saying look let's stay out of it not normally courts don't stay out of these things and they force people to blame people that they don't want to force people next thing you know we got the kid playing field hockey in the boy and he's put ... course or two members because it's absurd usually the courtside\nOn my own wrote the law lawyer and I got a blood and\nI'm oh what whatever it is in this case I'm happy with what he ruled so that's how I look I just I don't get like how ...\nHow do your parents as parents how would you decided this is what's best for our ... like I mean to be forced to the coach to get on the ... like get a public statement out saying I only said the kid was good because I didn't want to hurt a self esteem after he was already known he wasn't in the G by him anyway\nThat was the other issue I mean when you I Hope these parents understand when you go out there and you do this kind of thing now there's it's one thing to\nTo fight if [noise] you know if you know that they've factor on your side and there's been some kind of but if your kids on the bubble and that's what this guy said\nYou must have kid is just one step from being Pan Am ... I Would never go out and fight that for fear that my child would get their feelings hurt even worse it would just be more detrimental for them\n... ... I\nMean this is not a unique pairing here right and it's not a lot of these parents in the country and people are more and more of\nGetting the concept of suing [laughter] in this circumstance is just insane anyway it is is what happens more\nThan it is [noise] alright six one Seventy six six six the eight sixty eight\nIt is now eight fifty eight and this is Debbie ...

financial news we going to cover would fall Parsons he's the president\nAnd founder of planned strong investment management we always talk to them about money on Tuesday a nine thirty and Paul ... and let's go All right you got it NAFTA while not NAFTA\nNow now it's us macaw or whatever us MCA ah he got the deal done with Canada he said he would he did he's got his NAFTA replacement of what does it mean\nJust don't call me knack guy whatever you do right\nOr the big deal was that the U.S and Canada reach the big deal over the weekend after a lot of people said it was unlikely it would have happened they combine it with the U.S Mexico deal it's no longer called NAFTA is now called us MCA not YMCA us MCA\nA and here are some of the biggest changes from the NAFTA deal itself first better trade terms for us dairy products I don't know if you noticed or not but\nIt was a Canada limited\nHow much we were able to ship into Canada actually quotas they increase those quotas at the same time they lowered the tariffs\nOn those dairy products so we're going to be able to send a lot more stock to Canada in the form of dairy products good news for farmers second thing driving a more manufacturing of cars and their components to the u._s.\nBecause what they did was they reduce the amount that can be made outside of a Canada the U.S and Mexico for forty percent down to twenty five percent or otherwise Seventy five percent of the cars that will not be a ... will uh any car that is a subject to a ...\nA Seventy five percent of it has to be made with in the three countries and also they increase quotas for the ... portion that has to be made with higher minimum wage workers in other words they pointed it at the U.S as well\nAnd then the third thing all about drugs are Americans now pay an immense amount of the development expenses with drugs by pay full price for drugs\nWhile Canada and Mexico you're not going to be able to get quite the same good deal you used to be able to buy getting your your drugs they're because they're going to have to respect truck pat and especially for biologic trucks and they're gonna do it for ten years probably means more expensive meds and Canada and Mexico but it probably means us customers are not going to be the only one is actually paying\nFor research and development at this point so there's a reason that the stock market or the u._s. stock markets haven't gotten back to where they were in January twenty Eighteen until very recently and that's because\nJanuary twenty eight aim was right when Trump started his protectionist a theme and you know we've kind of worked our way through a lot of those there's a lot less uncertainty and markets and in fact it looks like some of these deals are actually better than the old deals that were in place\nAnd now of course the last big challenge is probably going to be China and see how that plays out\nLast week we talked about gee and you said look this is the CEO is the question here and Kenny turning around as a bit of a hot seat there turned out it was even harder than we realize because now he's gone what's this mean\nThey are so John flat planner you got to feel bad for the guy by all accounts he's pretty popular man he was a lifer as a G. E. employee and for the first time I think in history she actually hired a non uh GE life or to become the c._e._o.\nOr instead it it's a man named Larry Cole who came from Dana her and and he was asked to be on the board recently in the last year or so and then they asked him after a planner a missed some targets\nA to a concert becoming the new CEO and I think ultimately you know they've decided that gee he has to get moving on their plans quicker than they were doing so at this point you know jeeze trying to spin off their healthcare businesses that has huge liabilities with it [noise]\nUh and and what they're really trying to do is end up with just their power generation business and their aviation businesses you know they make a lot of aircraft engines for example\nSo you know gee Amy though is in top shape you know I wouldn't want to be Larry cope right now you know they're they've already said they're not going to make their twenty Eighteen revenue a profit targets\nAnd recently we heard about a twenty three billion that's would it be twenty three billion dollar right down associated with a French power business that they acquired and twenty fifth game\nSo that they hired this guy that this data her acts specifically because of his track record of spinning off businesses quickly and getting deal is done and overall it was welcomed by shareholders that gee stock yesterday was up eight percent about twelve dollars a share of Eby\nSpeaking uh CEOs it's when we talk about an awful lot but boy it's kind of big news rights and see see you on a mosque either huge news depending on how you look at it or maybe not as big a news is you might think if you're looking at another way where do you come down on the whole you must deal\nYou know so one of the many ah cases of litigation or potential litigation was settled this past week and that was a the FCC had", "show_name": "The Kuhner Report", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "02"}
