helps when things are going you're way this just ... you have a lot more personality when you know what this is a little too\nYou're right I mean let's just be honest about it like ... and the story that's been linked to it is that\nThey did this earlier in the year to wear a wire hard told ... gave a homeless guy a piece of pizza and I had a Homer so then ... gave a guy a piece of pizza and he armored that nice too\nWell so is that what we're doing all those guys are re yeah they're like ... like the puppies on a you know I'm Jimmy Fallon who predict the super bowl and then how does it work where we are giving them meals after the game now but there are good luck charm for that game\nWhy I don't think that when I read that part of it I don't think that's true I think ... just I just think that that\nYou know I think he probably does something like this and then we'll did he do it on a game on to it like how do they come to be that out of nowhere at the Boston Public library come to be that Lou we happen to be the one who I get her to ask you let's remember he's got some connections to the red socks that it was like well the whole thing\nReeks of yeah it too clever by half so

is the first time you've ever heard of this\nYeah I I'm not ... but I'm On anything because I'm not so sure honestly I I think that if they were around to defend themselves or be asked I think deep

I don't know how Vermont survives is a state at some point you're gonna have to have ...\n... what what people have been saying for the last few years of a major league baseball which I think it's sort of I hate to use this phrase under the current sort of ... but as a false flags story that baseball is dying off because they're just getting out of the day\nI don't know where all staying up to one in the morning watching these games now so I don't know if that's true or not but I think there is an issue that New England is facing as a collective Boston where we are right now no obviously\nBut the northern half of New England definitively I Rhode Island I guess kind of gets on Boston's go till the little bit but that at some point you've gotta you've got to bring in the next wave and who the hell wants to live and we're going to get snow this weekend the new law I Love it if we're up here and make good on main\nBut it's like that half the states in the country\nI matches why I mean and I don't know how any All right like Wyoming has less people than I like the block I grew up in Brooklyn but that's how we weren't going to college is one oh I Am I not that they're going to fold I mean they're still going to Vermont is for ever going to be that that share and why is always going to be that\nAbsolutely well those states they do have one in Maine is they they keep saying this over and over one of this that draws of course it's tourism I mean their tourism is what they they can depend on thirty six million people visit main in a year\nSo that's you know thirty six million people generate some do\nI mean in a perfect world we'd combined a bunch of states back together but that's never going to happen now\nBy Roman Empire ... New Hampshire and Vermont should be one state\n... New Hampshire and Vermont yeah fine I'm I'm with you look bad Puerto Rico urine and that's how we're doing in Rhode Island and Connecticut is one they're not\nTo separate states yeah mine but the entire mountain regions one state\nI just feel like there are certain places I don't know why Wyoming hasn't been doing this forever egg I'm enjoying the wild west and probably have maybe but how would we know yeah spirit because [laughter]\nPeople are forgetting the Maine is a huge state thirty six million people that's really not so sure girls or\nWhether there was a numbers are accurate or not Google it right for you text just doubled chicken\nI Googled during a break main tourism numbers that first thing that roughly thirty six point seven million tourists visited Maine and two thousand and Seventeen two and a half percent increase over twenty sixteen [laughter] that I Know we have more than happy\nTo get after Jim and we'll call her out in Missouri a math not use drugs [laughter] but it's that's the number of the main provide rights thirty six point seven million people that voted read that visited as tourists clearly they're smart because they have a ton of college graduates moving up\nThere right now [laughter] the other thing nine seven eight says well what about Montreal well I remember [laughter] we're not saying that people don't want to go to cold places we get that the issue from Maine and Vermont is it they don't have\nThey don't have a um a workforce so they're trying to develop that you\nKnow Montreal is a city where there is industry\nAnd there are other places that people go that are cold as well we get that it's not the cold as much as it really is the workforce issue I mean it ... is probably one of the coldest places on earth and they have a huge work for it is the cold in that people moved to\nMississippi because it's warm [noise]\nYou know there's nothing going on in Mississippi but it's at least warm there so some people just move there because it's more that is true but you know what ... Mississippi to it doesn't have a huge workforce either right or you know I mean again it comes down\nTo the industry that exists and the workforce that you can build and then people start going and what is my quality of life right um I like I said if you've ever been to the twin cities you know there's snow on the ground\nThree fourths of the year but there there is in Chicago for goodness sakes and Cleveland did either big cities because they have a workforce a so they do have a quality of life that exists\nSo that's not ... that that's what they're trying to draw you two in Maine and what like you said be they've tried to do in Vermont\nBut it's the chicken in the egg can you get you know Jeff Bezos to move or if you can get him to move Amazon someplace to Maine I'll bet you they can find a way to get a workforce they're\nHarder for the state to do with them for a company to do this sort of in your Ben and Jerry's says hey come to move the mouse will pay your student loans and we'll put you up and housing or whatever people my young kids might do that I Would have been suckered into that probably a ... this one\nI don't know what the amount of money that it would for it and what are you a gym and I have to say I don't that literally you have to give me a check as I drive across state lines and then when you do that I might consider it and I don't know what the number would be then yeah\nWith college kids usually it's a case of beer and they'll do something but I ... yeah\nI I feel like you would that would have to be a very high number\nAnd it's not that when you're looking at those kinds of loans and you just graduated from college or not looking to just be oh here\nYou know you're in that state of the game you can't do that you've you've you've got to get after you got loans and you're going to get after now if they wanted to say they pay your student loans by way of your ah you know paying part of your federal tax then maybe [laughter]\nMaybe be getting into a different area I hadn't really thought about until our texture pointed that out how large your\nIncome would have to be in the state of Maine to make a real dent in your college a lot\nAnd if I'm making that kind of scratch I don't need a Texan\nAnd to move to ... live abroad at that part of it too [noise] speaking of moving do we get to the German\nWe've talked about care of and for a day and a half two days\nA pretty simple question Kelly front as we're watching it was just gone up at BB the wise is the president ultimately going to issue an executive order to close the southern border mhm yes or no\n[noise] ah early returns in polar yes he's going to ... reports from sources for whatever this is worth sources but who turn Francisco Chronicle which is ... times as this is probably going to get scrapped are not going to do what\nI think they floated that to see what reaction would be to it or they are sending troops which I don't really have no problem with that issue I don't have a problem with that and they're sending him down there now in the Caribbean is still a thousand miles out\nBut they're sending 'em down there now so that they can help not so much patrol that to you know help for preparedness\nFine that's fine I have no problem with that [noise] um\nI I'm not sure that I think it's a great idea to to to the executive order a closing the border\n\nSix months I've been to six six sixty eight sixty eight what about you you like that idea executive order close the border of that means you just don't come in period you don't you don't sign paperwork you don't file you don't do anything it's done you come we hold a a big hand out and say now\nBack off\nI I don't know the legality of the thing the thought process would be that ultimately is going on at the Supreme Court in one regard Bret Baer now so presumably but I I\nI'm not positive about the guarantee like other people uh regardless I you would have to the executive order on that would would have to show some sort of threat right and I think\nIt's fine to say on TALK radio that these people are threatening the very fabric of the country but it's a different thing when you're doing it in front of the Supreme Court and you're making a claim that ... for the you're going to now we're going to have to get an accurate count on this group but as it fourteen thousand or is it ten thousand or is it seven thousand or whatever but also that\nYou can't in the Supreme Court\nIt's not going to stand that there were a legitimate threat because we just are going to surmise that there might be middle Easterners in there as if somehow being Middle Eastern\nImmediately makes all forever right so you do that would be one of the challenges with that\nWell immediately you heard what people were saying when this started to leak out the first thing people said first of all this is a ban on\nSpanish speaking people\nWhich it would be it would be along the lines of the

going to have to apply for injury and\nI mean the executive order is making the assumption that borders currently open to these people\nIt's not ...\nI mean that's that's the reality of it the

president should sign an executive order to close the border um ... if this caravan makes its way of this direction if they're still a thousand miles out\nHe has sent troops down to back up border patrol or in an effort to prep for this bill is in Boston Good morning bill\nGood morning Hawaii super thank you sir\nShow up I Want to start off by saying look people really should stop at the whole it's being undone by anybody this is stuff that happens or three times a year I called the other day and I've been in Honduras for many many years been is\nThis is just something that is known people know that they they want to do this\nFood the water and everything else they fish it's kinda like donated by different religious affiliations all up and down and there's very little money to do that is why\nThere's so many people turning around and going home it's also one of the most dangerous tricked ever I personally gone down to go get young women out of work were being used as sex slaves and brought back to Honduras it's just the scariest and most dangerous thing\nOf course like and all things in life there are many different elements that are coming up and that and that's just that's just the way it is\nBut I think that it's the most desperate situation and it's just really sad but I think that the biggest thing is is that people need to stop with this now it is um it's not as big a deal\nWhich we think it is it just being played by all people for a political purpose so that we can get people elected to a certain positions and the government and I just wish that people would take a step back and look at what's really going on and that\nWell there's this bill is this will look we love conspiracy theories and we love to point and say oh my God and then\nSo there are certain phrases intellectual like Wall Street Wall Street so be evil for the Democrats time it's just this thing the throughout their deep state is a Republican one where it's this is the deep state whenever we needed as the deep state it was it he said oh you you we don't know because they don't want to leave but they're they're big and Steve\nThis is another one where it's this being funded you know to what\nDoes that mean writing funded\nWell again you you do know this has happened before was it not funded then so when you tell me this is not some organic mob which I don't know what even if it means to say it's organic sure people were texting people may have been people with bowl orange they may have been signed up a this things happen and\nSo if that's what you mean by organized and funded fine if you think that some Steve wind type or George Soros type I'll say his name\nSaid hey look you three guys had down their here's some bundles of cash spread it around here's what we want to do\nTell me how that done and how it's played out and then how the images that you were seen of this thing fit with what you want me to believe that's all I don't have an surely wants to get really mad at me 'cause I'm not open to that concept\nSolely on it right I mean we weren't so who got the money and so some local guy who knows how to Oregon\nSome local community organizer down in on doors got the money okay well it's been a color we pocketed it yeah it's been a couple of weeks you've been marching you're drinking one baggy of water a day on this march why are you still doing it if you're not getting more than that out of this and yet you know that there's money to be had\n... and they're not a lot of them are turning back and let me just tell you this nine seven eight is testing and saying hey guys in case you're wondering Fox News just reported his churches along the way that are supplying some of the food and some of the water ...\nBill just All right what if\nIf you see that as organizing and ... and what it would be though right or just do do humanitarian things regardless of why every church the one up in the town that you were just talking about for example has the\nWe welcome everyone and they say do these things like that is why the fall when we did the refugee crisis a few years ago had church leaders on beacon hill urging people to be welcoming to this idea of we're going to take in however many thousand it was at the time I was three thousand but whenever was\nThis is what churches do you don't that's not what you're talking about you Dave in surely you're not talking about churches you're talking about\nSome mastermind guys sitting on a pile of gold coins somewhere in I don't know anywhere usa\nIs is doing the Montgomery Burns with his fingers as he goes years what we'll do our own ... and I mean like when we were travelling we talk all the time about how people accused Trump both of being an evil mastermind ended up being a moron and he's got to be one of the two you can't have it both ways\nAnd it's sort of the flip and that's where you are saying the Democrats or the evil masterminds of this plan and their motivating thousands of people marched on the border to screw with the president and they're also completely incompetent and messaging it and they're not able to actually get any kind of message about it and that's why they're losing look\nAnd I mean they're gonna they're gonna or is this thing gonna just fizzle out by the time to get your first time predicting that by the how ... how many get actually make it to the border I Am\nPredicting when it's all said and done we have a smattering of people who show up you know a group of maybe I don't know a couple of hundred I look if they ... thousand miles is a long way I tell you this every single\nTime we have a conspiracy theory whether it'd be astrology whether it be deep state whether it be now this caravans funded by rich liberals\nI'm open to everything convinced me on it one of the things you were telling me or on the week is well who's funding all those trucks that are moving this thing they're not even marching well yes that's true and you guys are telling me this at ... am on Tuesday and Monday of this week right\nTrucks are moving this thing if trucks are moving in how come it's not moving\nHow come they're gathering like ten miles a day right I I don't get that number one number two how come every time they go to Fox\nThere's no tracks\nWhere are they going there's only one road there and if these trucks are how are they hiding the trucks in the Bush is\nI don't get it and by the way\nIf their trucks that one truck that we have seen that giant flat bread that looks like yeah collapse at any of that right now that's not what I Would call the definition of ... you know uh so I just want everybody to know to keep his Chicago from here in less than a thousand miles you\nKnow so I'm not walking I Know\nSomebody was saying yesterday the showing could have just you know the the Red Sox didn't want to fly showing 'em because you only live sixty miles away obviously to reach only go walk that I'm like I'm like sixty miles out of your mind\nUh Vivian is sin a Boston Good morning\nCombining the morning so\nThe question on the table is whether or not President Trump to close the border yeah I Believe they should\nYeah you should close the border and\nRegardless of this caravan Caribbean before successor nonsense that the people that make it to the border the catch and release the criminal not all of them\nThey're truly people that are looking for a better life and want to be part of the American culture but we have an overwhelming problem that the immigration illegal immigration here in the country already we need to concentrate on that\nBefore we start taking in more and more closed the border\nGet it get it shut down now and work on the problem that here control the population that we take into the country\nI don't see it working any other way we've tried Obama tried it Clinton tried Bush tried everybody's trying\nIt's always a topic for every single election it's always about that but it never gets resolved so let me ask you this over the and what about asylum seekers [noise]\nAnybody can claim asylum seekers anybody can they all want asylum they all want to come here because for whatever reason then how do you know they're not like\nWe better what attracts you got about him but they're not betting on\nThere that's out on the president because he brought president said that we would have the best betting ever when he was president so we've got about\nI read that impact it if they can't get to live through that how is that supposed to happen\nOh what a lot we need what do we need to vet these people\nBut what is your ... going to attack but the right one of them was if you say you're betting okay yeah I Need to get them to everyone in Honduras can claim they're in they're in danger any everyone in Venezuela consider endangered now how do you prove whether they are they are in danger like if there was simply like look I mean you're not\nDanger or not danger or whether or not they're starving or wind or better economic light\nWell that's not I don't know yeah you're right I get together and things like that yet Ron yourself on the hit very thorough and very few people actually are granted I I agree so how much you can actually show up for the court date that's because what that that's not any more though that used to be\nWe don't we don't catch and release this now and it's made that very clear no we don't know we don't have I Will time on the border where there's a reason why this yeah exactly one of the things that\nLike Elizabeth Warren brought this up and Jeff deal didn't hit her on a particularly but she always talks about the cages I went down there and I saw the cages and I've said this forever\nRight okay so how are you going to handle it ... what what are you where are you going to start\nIf not in cages which cages is a gymnasium when bars that go up the sides of it ... where where are you going to hold these people if seven thousand people get here where where do you plan on all the normal is if not in quote unquote\nCage it's like this is this is murky stuff it's dirty stuff it's not simple I'm with you vivienne you you've touched on a number of issues I told you right from the start when Trump issued a travel ban what I thought he should have done\nIf you're going to be a hard has to be a hard as you know what we're just closing all borders for a year until we figured this thing out not one of the dangers of that is that\nThe concept of figuring it out don't think that that could ever be done but close them all do just talk about closing the Mexican border close our borders look\nEither we have enough people are we don't if we don't than we need immigration and we need people in the air and so this will be orderly way we're going to do with going forward and then this is the system with dealing with illegal\nBut shut it all down right now\nHe's not going to do that in the country is not going to do that because there would be huge economic ramifications and one of the things that\nMakes it so murky is that we all know deep down we need illegal immigrants to keep the economy ... especially in the summer months in New England in Florida it cetera and it's one of those things where we all go this is outrageous but thank you thank you for doing what you've been doing and you're really helping us and it's just that the\nDishes the problems of society is not everything is always clean and meet it it does get dirty it does get murky\nAnd while we act like this is the end of the world of the seven thousand two thousand or fourteen thousand whatever it is people get here\nAgain I way we can rice ended in laws on this stuff because we do need people I don't know why drum gives they look we're going to double the amount of legal immigrants that are common we're shutting the borders otherwise this is how it goes and by the way we're putting our refugee program on hold for ...\nI did do check because you ... you brought it up really if you walked a thousand miles from here do you know you end up where farming in Alabama\nYeah I'm here to tell you right now I think there will be a few a few hundred who show up on the border maybe and you know so I I think the idea of closing the border and going through all that and going to any ordeal I think will be worth and on this go round\nI think this is I think the president will have one because he will talk to a very very tough and people will be afraid and they won't get this far and they will get to start anyway it's a long way

I don't get the thing the running for opening period I'm also shocked at how quickly this has happened I shouldn't be but I Am\nI don't believe it has anything to do with all the way in thing I'm like that they needed an excuse she gave him one she's gone to Megan Kelly had Fox like making jelly ratings she wouldn't be gone for that we all know we buses and complicated right\nShe says she has said things that were equally as bad if not worse she just doesn't care she yeah she doesn't say\nSo she's got to help it and this is what they're going to use the do it\nCorrect that's right and they ... and if we are to believe the claims they were already are in the process of trying to get it done\nSo um I don't know but the interesting because you were saying you were listening to how we yesterday and kill me was on there no asked about whether they would want to see her come back to Fox yeah\nAnd it's certain kill me and said he loves Megan she's one of the smartest woman he's ever met\nLoved working with her would love working with her and is she's just awesome I don't want to say anything more than that is what he said he didn't say ...\nI don't know it's hard to see how that would happen right now or I ever down in ... he said I don't I just don't want to comment any more than that and whenever you do that and then we heard later in the day that there was this whole allegedly there's been preliminary talks already between Fox in her\nSo one question here is is making Kelly gonna end up back on Fox\n\nWe said yesterday that would be the only landing place but it seemed like she burned that bridge I don't think she's burned it forever I Do think there has to be some period of time where we're like not bad now Megan but let's talk again in ... after twenty twenty would have been my thing but maybe they're like no you need or specifically\nFor twenty two I'm just will be awesome yeah when I hear\nSo she's got um\nAllegedly a year and a half left on this contract right mhm so that would put her at the end of a what made twenty twenty\n\nProductive running on why don't you want to have you know the early twenty twenty well yes I\nI I Will be I Would be shocked if if they pay her a part of this negotiation is going to be ...

R. K. O. morning with Kevin maybe on Boston morning show you are ... you\n\n\nKnow I mean they're really good I was really surprised that it was great I Would just be for me because you lost your era you love her right\nActually didn't recognize her because her voice doesn't sound dying catty and then right yeah\nThat I sometimes she actually things well how that didn't win an Oscar for best song is beyond me I'm not getting it that year that movie's underrated one on\nThis I don't even know what movie it's from a very odd utopia oh just for a moment and I think it was under rated do very good yeah I mean you and I didn't see it\nWouldn't you be a little disturbed if I had seen as utopia I Would not any more than five year old man sitting and watching cravings by himself yeah with no children right now I wouldn't see it either\nWay I asked a during the break and I just treated our somehow Rushmore of TV epic\nYeah so Jim you brought up a good one off the air uh which was a the Conan Conan O'Brien Jay Leno box all\nYou know moving announcing five years out that Leno's retiring and then when the fighters came and Leno didn't want to leave for pushing about putting Conan and they're giving them no support putting Jay Leno on at ten destroying your whole prime time line up and then firing Conan putting Jay back and eleven and then having retire again and giving it to Jimmy Fallon out of\nThe blue cat was so bad that hold back and forth that was that was a debacle only read\nBut there's worse like so to me on Mount Rushmore and I don't have the fourth because I'm trying to think of it but this is on it this is horrifically bad at the dollars that it is Megan Kelly is on them\nI was that one was a huge down worse than that though we get an ad dollars I mean and changing the whole line up but that magic hour is the epitome of ... TV ... magic John when it comes to unite TV Conan and lentil ultimately did still work and late night TV has survived Magic Johnson killed\n... foray into late night TV because it was so ... and ... at one point a Chevy Chase to you got to gather isn't there's a few of them I mean there have been a few of those late nights if you stop and think about ... ... ... ... we're going to be fun but did our most\nOn funding guy ever you couldn't do it he he just he couldn't do it yeah it's like when they gave emerald show not to steal but both what belongs in\nThe oven amoral did okay for a while he they had gone to I'm Talking about all his sitcom I just think of his his his cooking show village let's give emerald sitcom and we don't know if you can act and it turned out not only could he not he was horrific\nI mean they they kind of acting after four episodes they brought in Robert ... salary\nDemanding Johnson thing was bad and it was bad for magic is bad for Fox has bad traumatic but I still would stand by what Jim said I think that was one of the biggest blunders because they had to change their line up\nBehind timeline up I mean they kill on and they ... o'clock hour for that and right now and we were ... they were they were the sheep job place for five years after they did that\nAnd you remember you guys remember when they went through the whole David Letterman Jay Leno issue so they had gone to that do you remember that under cars Jay Leno I mean everybody Letterman thought for sure he was going to get that slot right and he said I'm leaving and\nThen I Would also followed Fox for the American idol the what is the the British one that they tried to do the X factor where they pretty much killed all of their programming that wasn't music related for\nAnd they still haven't recovered from that they still have basically no programming now that is true I mean what's the biggest show on Fox right now\nToday what is the one that but it's not the boys what is the one I Am now Meghan Trainor is one of the judges\nYeah is that ... or ... or is that right now doesn't it's on a Christmas\n\nIt competes against the ... show that I Know a lot I mean these are this is what I'm Talking about what ... epic fail like things that man everybody was on board\nWe're what we're about to do here in this is a ... a bad idea and we're not seeing it Megan Kelly going there given we all thought you're Christian or a talk show\n\nYeah that didn't but that was it that wasn't that didn't cost anybody I mean there's a lot of people who get talk shows you know Bethany what's her face got a talk show for a couple of minutes and\nA prank call and you know I mean they all get these to get an object that right failure that had been huge and then you do something so stupid like this right here I mean I I go back to the Denver normal thing because remember they took Jane ... who was so popular in so love because they thought she got too old essentially\nAnd they put they put ... on at the time it was thirty one beautiful young and people were just like\nYou know how dare you replace Jane poli with this chick\nAnd people hated Deborah normal as a result and I mean she was on there for one year and they yanked her and she she would tell you she thought her career was done at thirty one because they just missed place her then that's when they put Katie hurricane and Katy Kirk you know\nSo there was a buffer but they did it because they thought that Jean Paul he was too old and war that was nasty and people stop watching the today show Jennifer's in Boston Good morning\nGood morning you know you have to remember that ... that was in the end it meant\nLike attorney paternity cases or whatever and it's like everybody was watching it at a time and the judge was just a complete the job and I think he has his own show and it was just like it I guess I've been watching that guy thinking oh my God I cringe eat like one guy didn't they gave him his own show\nTrying to remember that the only thing I can remember about the ... are you talking about the one with ... she was married to the elderly man\nI'm ... ... ... ... and ...\nAnd Howard Stern and that Larry Bird at work and you know like for you know that's a test for the kid but it was they had you know like children and they gave me his own show and I watched one episode and I'm like oh that's terrible\nI had forgot I'd totally forgotten about that whole we went through that whole Anna Nicole Smith thing I mean it was like well that would I told that an epic fail why don't we cover all pets so much how would you be because if you worked together at the\nTime so Larry ... is the name of the guy who was\nBald yeah yeah yeah around\nI remember him she's a year and Jennifer was right I remember that judge\nYou remember on the second you see yes I Am now you just described him I remember that but did he get his own show her she just remembering it from from the holding being such a disaster he resigned there were rumors that he was gonna cut a deal or what have\nWe covered that we covered wall to wall like her whole funeral and everything I obsess\nWith so I'm looking at a list of the ten worst decisions and TV has okay just as fast as it uh NBC canceled Star Trek after three seasons as they thought no one would ever be interested in something like that\nHuh OK\nSeventy one says by the way empires the only Fox show that anybody knows right probably true ... canceling Family Guy\nNo but the difference there is that they could undo they're mistaking her I mean cop rock has to be on a caveman they give you show that was a good one but again I don't know how much that costs them that was a ... epic\nBad TV someone at ABC turn down the CSI franchise before they went to CBS\nAll stupid was William Peterson to train up for CBS to not branched out that you just for your show man effect sit down [laughter] we're not doing as an average out on their love it you're going to eat it [laughter]\nOr a fifty eight here and W. R calf [noise]\nSo boy so Boston New\nYork about one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise] talking in the\nMorning on Nick vote VW are\nKeanu Reeves hundreds of us troops will reportedly be deployed to the U.S Mexican border soon NBC's Peter Alexander has more from the White House\nDepartment of homeland security is requesting those troops me in place by early next week their assignment an official tells us would be behind the scenes support and customs and border protection officers were already there\nThere'll be preparing for a slow moving migrant caravan that's traveling north through Mexico defense secretary Jim Mattis is expected to Sunday order shortly there already about two thousand National Guard troops at the border offering support to the border patrol\nThe ... the season hits the east coast today NBC meteorologist built parents since the storm should be relatively mild\nYou didn't do resource wildlife wind warnings and sometimes we'll have snow advisories and this one is warm enough for all rain the winds aren't that high and we just have a little bit of issues with coastal flooding\nLackadaisical here and I am looking up at the monitors and I see that scene in clearly there's officers everywhere and everything's blocked off and then one does go off\nWhat am I missing someone on the poll that have you heard of theory as I've told you I'm open to all sure I'll entertained the concept that does with the Russians just meddling in the elections I everything's on the table when you do investigations like this and I've heard that and I feel like it's actually\nIncreasing that people are suspicious of this you know I've heard liberals liberals are doing this specifically to make themselves out to be a victim and the Trump is so evil and so gross and\nWe need you to vote for us because we're the only ... we've are these conspiracies so okay sure that's really it's a possibility it's a guy in a magazine that loves Trump and there's literally thinking\nI'm In the Trump army and I'm going to let these guys know that something bad could happen to them if they keep going after my guy that's certainly\nPossible mhm so but those are the three\nPrincipal ones that I've heard and then just it just so I'm not\nFrank's in Dorchester Hey Frank morning\nOr good morning goes you know I think the the two things if it's if it's the Russians are it doesn't\nMatter they are going to get away with it anyway [laughter] if it's if it's\nSomething not they got 'em anyway I mean you can't do anything today without being watched\nA cook you could commit a crime down the street and the cop we'll see where you you go on it what vehicle you go out into where you drove I mean the guys as good as caught any way but just a crazy guy [noise]\nUm as far as Elizabeth Warren is concerned I think this just goes to show our irrelevant she is I mean the woman is\nA threat to Trump as far as the presidential candidate is the third is I'm sure she doesn't have it was that\nI mean I guess my question will be as Cory Booker like if these people are being elected because Trump is railed against them which is the argument I'm deniro is not a threat to Trump bright but the narrow got\nWell he did deniro was a threat is and the fact that he's got a media outlet and uh you know people listen to him and it kind of take them seriously I mean I Do but you know you you could argue that he does have a platform\nWhere the war and will not be successful politically outside of Massachusetts\nYou know I mean if she's the vice let's say Cory Booker runs for president or gets the nomination and he says Elizabeth Warren do you want to be my vice presidential candidate like\nAt that wouldn't be a big mistake for him to maybe go way anyone outside of the state will take a whiz with war seriously she's another judge Jed any\nI Know that but I I I don't know right lady rancher agree to you Frank hard in Nineteen eighty and got a lot of sport like it does happen yeah let me go to Sean Sean's and conquer good morning Sean\nWarning all high that's taking my call 'em\nLook what's happening I think this is another deep state we have the cat in the novel is a total that\nWe have the ... a caravan which is coming right at election day the Republicans are going to clean up this is just the final inside job attempt\nTo destroy Trump and the Republicans to make them look bad because they already know that the packages were meant to be clown they didn't have enough postage spelling they were all bulky they were meant to be found in the screening process\nSo you you have to look at it that way this is the final attempt to make them look bad\nAnd you don't think Sean if they were sent by liberals and this is to that final attempt that they're going to find out who sent it\nYeah you know what that's another thing um if they drag this out right one day after the election you know it's an inside job and you know the FBI doesn't even want to find out who did it because it's one of their own\nLooked oh I'm just listening series I'm a judge and you you want to do with that you run with that I've heard this three pronged attempts to embarrass thing the administration is strong just laid it out for him ... okay so there's a vote for that\nIt's time for teen let's check in with any car bony\nThank you
