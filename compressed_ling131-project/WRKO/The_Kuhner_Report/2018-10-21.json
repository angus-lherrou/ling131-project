I could take that money and converted into a Ross\nPay some taxes today but I pay them on a smaller amount now is that money grows in the future it grows tax free I can take it out tax free in the future it might do another double or quadrupled\nFrom today when I converted it and when my kids inherited it absolutely tax free as a matter of fact I like to talk about control and flexibility a lot when it comes to retirement planning and I have a lot of control and flexibility much more than I Do in my traditional retirement plans more control and flexibility\nIn the Roth account so you know there's so many bad tax mistakes we've seen John it as you can imagine what what are you seeing your financial planning well\nI've seen a lot of people who make some assumptions and sometimes it's like well you just said we've been told our whole lives that our taxes are going to be lower in retirement and so everybody has feast it on that idea and essentially taking the immediate gratification of lowering taxes now with the idea of well we'll pay them later\nBut it seemed like what people often aren't taking into account is the fact that you know you put fifty thousand dollars into an account and it grows the five hundred thousand and now that five hundred is all taxable you know even if you were in a lower tax rate in the future\nDrawing down that five hundred thousand over time that's that's still a big tax bill\nRight and people say wow fifty thousand to five hundred thousand hey\nWith compound interest at eight nine or ten percent reasonable rate of return that does not take a long time so\nPeople don't get this you know they've saved money in the ... in the past by getting a tax break to put money into these plans and they've just been partners with the IRS for twenty thirty forty years then that doesn't mean everybody should pull money out of those qualified retirement plans\nBut what it does mean as you need to have a strategy to sit down with somebody who was an expert in retirement planning in investing in retirement\nAnd do an analysis of how much taxes you're going to pay in the future I remember a client I have that retired from United Technologies had plenty of money between his pension is other retirement funds his wife are living very comfortably until he hit the age of Seventeen and a half\nNow all of a sudden a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year was being forced out of his retirement plans throwing him way up into a much higher tax bracket causing higher taxes on his Medicare premiums\nLosing some of the ... that he had previously because of a phased out of the Dutch and just all kinds of problems that happen\nBecause he didn't plan we met him when it was too late he was only about three months away from the date where he had to take money out of those retirement plans if we would have met him\nAnd planned earlier he would have been in much better shape because we would have frozen the growth of those retirement plans begin extracting some money out so he didn't have this tax time bomb that hit him\nWhen he was Seventy and a half so we've talked about tax is a little bit here at the end but for some of you this is going to be the biggest issue the biggest impediment\nFor you being a successful investor some of you spent so much time making sure you have the right investments\nAnd you're missing the boat on the tax side you try to get an extra one or two percent rate of return on your money in retirement through choosing carefully to write investments\nAnd you lose twenty or thirty percent of your gains because you're not planning for the taxes we want to help you with the taxes with understanding bonds with making sure that if you're in the financial red zone you don't make
