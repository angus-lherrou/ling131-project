I don't know just a first hand I've heard from people for example at mar a Lago I've never\nBeen I Know people that have been before he was President Trump would occasionally agreed people there and from what I've told about that is the guy walks in\nYou know he lights up the room everybody's while he goes over you glad hands and he'd\nJust hey how are you having a good time but he knows how to do that in in doing that he always says something over the top abusive tells you exactly what it is that you want to hear it gives you feeling good about yourself [noise] I feel like Trump post was on display yesterday when\nWe've got a gathering of our hardcore is here everybody in this room thinks what I'm about to say is true and all I'm thinking about is this room than outside of that I ... I just make awesome dust up to knowledge\nAll those no problem because I can twist anything I Want to work the way I wanted and I'm sure this will be no different and I think he wants us to talk and cabin are as much as possible sure so that's right yeah it's just it was all good for him as far as he's concerned\nYeah and I think that's true and I think the president you know I mean again I I think the president even though he's been president of two years he still does not understand the power of his words I don't think he gets it\nAlready does I think he completely get no I don't think he cares\nWell maybe that's true I'm ... I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt that he doesn't understand it by making those kinds of comments\nIn ... in a room or at a rally where everyone is in his corner you know it's like he's in a bubble and he doesn't realize that there is the rest of the world\nWe are not realizing is that there's a calculation on the right that\nCabinet ... and our winter owing left has the the thought processes and I it may be right I don't know and it also may be wrong and they may be over play on their hand much like the Dems did during the cabin iron\nBut the calculation is that the Dems have screwed themselves here and they're going to do it again and\nYou saw all the usual suspects the Lawrence tribes the ... all these guys\nTook debate immediately on Twitter and started screaming and him they think they\nAre learning as from Kavanaugh that if they're screaming like that they are going to burn themselves and so I you know I don't know to what degree they thought this through but they just want to keep the name Brett Kavanaugh going as close to the election can because they think that the the winter for them which is\nCrazy to think of from two weeks ago by that's where we are now\nOr the visit Marshfield good morning Steve\nWarning everyone I'll uh I'll agree with you I don't think she can get a kick out of his name out there because they could be calling this the cat but not cool I think they are really read a rattle the cages a pitch overdose who I think probably would have stayed all\nI'm a little bit more and probably less likely to stay home now I Can't might get one you take issue with something that you should use it you didn't see anything that found him in a set\nA the basis of our whole system is the presumption of innocence and I don't think anyone could show anything that that proved anything that he was guilty\nBecause I mean what was there when\nTrump surely were proved it was proven innocent right\nIf they if that's what your commenting on I agree\nThat that was my issue I mean I think a lot of people believe he's innocent and I'm I still to this day I'm going to tell you and I still don't know what happened there I really don't um\nYou know I think something happened to I I just don't know what it was I think ... and ... and\nI'm almost I'm almost in I'm Susan Collins camp in that I Do think something happened to Dr Ford I don't know if it was ... I just don't know that you know my problem with Brett Kavanaugh really doesn't have anything to do with any of that I didn't like that he I think he didn't tell the truth I think he lied under oath\nFantastic well give us a sense of just exactly what's in this guy didn't why you do believe that it to be true sir\nWell the uh the guide as you mentioned there in your opening I mean is it set out because of the unique challenges that veterans are faces they're transitioning out of military service uh we had done a survey a partnering with monster military dot com where fifty seven percent or so\nOf veterans had indicated that they feared or some type of discrimination because of their disability so uh the reality is that companies do want to hire them uh\nAnd we really wanted to do something and get in the game with a nice a set of tools and resources for employers are where they could reach too that would help them overcome the challenges and get these men and women into the workforce so what what they're going to find\nIs a lot of useful tools and resources to help them overcome that\nTell me a little bit about out from the employer perspective um how you approach this and what an employer should know\nEmployers are definitely know a ... and as time goes on they the education of it all kind of grows with it\nAs we found out really rapidly in the last four years through our career fairs and things like that that companies are they do recognize the the set of skills unique set of skills that many veterans bring\nA not just to the workforce but to their particular company um\nAnd with that things that are often missing\nInstead of looking particularly get an education level which is still important but they're they're looking to things more on the sauce skill and things like discipline are arriving to work on time a lot of things that are very elementary and that we probably all taken for granted that it's the norm but\nWhat the company is really a when it gets down to it they're looking for those highly motivated highly skilled individuals that are very resilient and\nKept looking at the uh the economy and the workforce I mean there there's a lot of opportunity out there or unemployment numbers are very low how is this translating for the bats that you're talking about\nThe you know it is great uh when you look at the unemployment rate and jobless claims I mean that's great that's great for America by and large and especially when you're looking at you know veterans themselves and that's it ah I don't know I think the last number I looked at it was like three point seven percent that's that's great um\nWe still good you know I mean we sponsor a hundred and fifty career fairs uh each year and with that that's a lot of people that we're seeing in fact you know we have over the last four years since we started our employment program more than a hundred and sixty five thousand or ride around that number\nHave attended our career fairs with about a hundred and eight thousand\nAre receiving offers of employment which is really really great when you look at the overall but the majority of the vast majority of those coming into contact with us either through the career fair or\nYou know calling us ... working with us directly the vast majority of those individuals are now unemployed they're under employed they're looking for that better opportunity\nJeff I you know as I'm listening to talk and talk about the the struggles and the problems and the thing but it it's sort of surprises me especially like in the middle part of the country where\nI I guess I always assumed that a veterans have a leg up and be disabled veterans would be specifically where companies would be wanting to say yes come on come on board we can do this we can work together what's what's the hang up what's the holdup why is it that we're in this spot for him\nYeah I think it's I think it really gets down to ah there's just uh\nLot of missing information perhaps would be the best way to put it a lot of missing information when companies look yeah they do they want to and they'll they'll stand and tell us\nYou know a one on one we really want to hire disabled veterans we know there's tax incentives we know it's the right thing to do it goes beyond the patriotic sense they understand that these men and women that have had to overcome such a strong adversity with\nSay disability in the recovery process but they're out there ready to go to work they they understand all of that the challenge it really is there is a lot of stigma still I think that exists out there about what is a disability and that's really where the Wii stepped up the game because we're we're experts in\nHelping veterans and their families get their needed benefits especially disability benefits and so standing and talking to an employer who says yeah you know\nA disabled veteran we need workplace accommodations we've got all this stuff when in fact our you know our research are guide has provided a nice collection of things that tell them how easy it is to overcome things like workplace accommodation with little expense involved that could be as simple as a chair\nBut what again what what you're really looking at I think is just us really getting in the game with them and under helping helping them understand that a ringing in the ears for instance if you were involved or near an explosion or or acoustic trauma of some sort\nIs not going to prevent you from doing most jobs out there yet it is classified as a disability so\nYes you'll have somebody that's dramatically injured that has a long road to recovery or a lot of things happening there and then somebody with a not so severe disability so I think it's just really the education\nSo working folks get hold of this guide I'm ... and learn more about recruiting skills in recruiting tools and how to get recruited so on and so forth\nThere's there's two basic

open it up here tonight\nIs the big gubernatorial debate the first one there's going to be three before November the sex is Charlie Baker facing off his Democratic challenger for those of you who are not familiar it's Jake ...\nAnd our question for you this morning is what is the question that you would ask each of them let me go to Jerry in Framingham good morning Jerry\nCome on guys how's everyone super thank you [noise]\nSo I Would like my question to Mr Baker my question would be that's Mr Becker understanding you are in full knowledge of the fact that the commonwealth of Massachusetts spends approximately\nSeven hundred thousand dollars per mile road maintenance and our neighboring states like New Hampshire spends a hundred and twenty five Connecticut spend about a hundred and thirty something why have you done nothing about the costs of road maintenance and the commonwealth of Massachusetts in the time that you've been in office\nQuestion or ... I we took the goals down we've got fly over tolls where\nWe live in a changing climate that makes road maintenance dog you're going to hear all this stuff and then you're going to go yet but main news to submit I didn't need you don't get it all and that that's going to be the answer but we've been proved T we're looking to expand it we've got a lot of bike programs that'll keep cars off the road ... the generic\nRap yeah infrastructure is always a you know safe wanted to go to write because everybody's got differing opinions about infrastructure\nBy the way it is actually something I Would ask about because I I still believe that the tea is just\nSuck it up money and we constantly are having issues related to it as we get ready to go into another winter you know what has been done to improve so that we know that when there's a foot of snow on the ground the tea so then we were running through softball for him though what\nWhat I mean ... new equipment and play and you'll notice last winter we did ...\nRight I mean that that's I Want to do but the ... on that again where I hosting God God Bless John Keller good luck with is like putting all the time and effort and pretend that this is real bright he's watching like when a tree falls in the forest deal\nBut if I if I had to sit down and write some questions one would be how could their governor how if the tea continues the average money how can you be expanding it you know it was my pet peeve on all of this stuff say ... it's like is there a limit to what\nYou send good money after bad what what is that how would you decide not to expand the branch and sees any ... you know we need north south rail but at some point there has to be no more money for this right at some point\nIn ... one of the questions I Would ask them is what do you think the gas to actually be mhm I'd be shocked if he's not asked that tonight but that that's an answer that can only hurt them too but his would have to be twice what it is some version narrow\nSeven seven forester they'd ask governor Baker why do you call yourself for Republicans\nI that's just the legitimate if he was sitting here I Would ask them that absolutely because what what are your it's I Would ask it this way what do you consider to be your Republican credentials\nBecause my guess is is the answer for I think when I worked for Bill well okay I'm not talking about who your friends are what what are your ... what is your biggest Republican principles that you that you hold on to hit that is a tough one for him to answer I mean he's been there three and a half years and what\nWhat we consider ... job you know it can Eric remodel it and just write principled things what is it that he did\nThat that help to those ... gone up mhm raises have been given out mhm size of the government's expanded no government programs to my knowledge of been shut down or stop their limited or any of that sort of stuff you've expanded social programs you supported social programs that some conservatives don't agree with it at all\nIt didn't support the president's judicial peck your blanket the president and the election what what are your crowds I he endorsed deal okay\nThat'd be one what else but I that's a fair for that's not only fair I'd the obvious question but yes a good one\nNot long ago that it was a little bit in the legislature told all roads in and out of Massachusetts and that's a question I'd like to hear the governor or aunt to see what he a position to heal holds on that\nI I agree that there's no\nI don't think there's any doubt some version of calling and our gas taxing is coming up and they'll they'll go on both of these for a while so you'll you'll get your answer to night if you're watching\nYeah I ... the whole issue is a big one for me as well I mean these are the ... you have to kind of think about the things that affect you and\nI mean I I go to lots of tools that do as do all of our listeners you know we all do and uh I I like to know I mean is there any serious plan to tolls on I Ninety three\nHow about why why do we still have tolls and some of the places that we do because we we were told those would go away\nIf they move this thing just to seven and would you watch you know games to probably start some tornadoes having over a little later tonight\nAgain\nHas anybody told the truth I I feel like ... and a forest under any circumstances it just falls even quieter when the red Sox Yankees are playing a game for but\nUh I if they moved it to the hour before the game would more people watch the thing or no\n\nI mean obviously for me the earlier the better and yeah but I I don't know I'm not looking forward to it anyway I actually\nKind of get they get the sense that they're not particularly concerned about that because that wouldn't be such a hard thing to do you're given move they wouldn't\nFan but I didn't know you could easily Asian but you would think they'd be easy would want to move it to you I mean you literally no no one's watching it no one so but maybe whatever I guess we're just going to [laughter] somebody a democratic friend of mine said ah\nThat insider quote unquote told him recently that\nBaker will win this as a Republican landslide which will be about five percent\n\nA mad white may may well be I've always looked at this quote unquote races the so this is the definitive in twenty eight teams this is how much a sure thing as a Republican could possibly be in Massachusetts and that's the only interest Avon the races what\nDoes that number right because whatever Charlie wins by that's as much as anyone could possibly win by period and ended up just end of discussion I cry now again I'm assuming he ran ... and I've got that as a foregone conclusion which is usually something you don't do when the numbers five or six\nBut that's where I'm at in this thing and it was Sherlock as it could possibly be for a Republican in quote unquote insiders who do and you it's going to be in Los in mid single digits\nCrazy it here it is it is I I I I don't know if I kinda think Charlie to be honest\nBecause ... going back to this changing the times or you know watching it or what I actually think Charlie probably would not be in favor of changing times and he would rather this beyond during this because this is one of the biggest problems Jay Gonzales has as far as the state is concern is that nobody knows who he is\nLess exposure he has the better off right so why would surely want this to be\nOn at seven o'clock anybody watch it\nOh I Love I obviously I get that but in theory Charlie supposed to be for you know what the people in the commonwealth five to make a decision and we need them to be informed and doing so I Want them to hear what I have to say as much as anybody else you know what am I have the income that a theory right\nYeah but he's income and so he's got the you know he's got a bit of that incumbency ... advantage going his way he people know where he stands what they think when he doesn't want is anybody to know who Jake Dallas is or what he stands for\nThose Charles you'd asked about his son when I\nUm I don't think he will I don't know maybe we'll I'm actually very surprising\nSaid none of our listeners asked about it said that that's what they'd ask I mean I assume me to come up right in what way when I ... how do you bring that up where\nYou stand on me and probably in relation to cabinet but you know governor you you didn't and you said you wouldn't have voted for Brett Kavanaugh because you think these things are\nThat way or the women's what I Want to stand on me too I mean is there anybody who's going to say I really think women should be discriminated against\nWhile Republicans in large part to stand on me too that this was an assault on men and men are now Trump\nSaid this that it's a very dangerous time for men to be young men to be in this country Charlie do you think that's true well are you going to ask\nMe anything on anything Trump as soon as a jumping off point but I Would think that that would be some version some some version of vets coming up than I Would think right to\nYeah I mean the only ... has is to tie Charlie two Republicans that he doesn't act like\nSomehow man doesn't vote for you didn't like ... and he said he wouldn't vote for him I didn't vote for Trump allegedly a so that's the funny thing and that's the weird challenge he's got his how do you make a guy that is absolutely not drum and doesn't like him and won't take his picture with them\nOr you make him be drum\nThat's why I said just go for I just go crazy left and I just started to run out the most crazy socialistic stuff ever\nBecause you got to get you need Fox to be revenue tomorrow morning\nAnd so the only way you do that is to just make the most outlandish ridiculous left his promises ever and maybe just maybe they did you see what this guy that's running against them but go Republican and managers and said and then you've got something\nDo only way I don't even know what that would be but\n... you know people that make over a million I Want to attack some three times more than people are saying I'm currently they want to I I don't know you got to do something\nSuddenly comes up with some crazy a gun control issue that is so far out there that\n... has already is like what does that general guns period like\n... no gun used on Tuesday\nI assume school safety is coming up to\nUm I Would think so I I was just actually looking at what he brought up and take on on the tax yes exactly and I was just looking at Jake and Dallas is um [noise] the issues that he's highlighting on his website\nWhat would you ask on Amazon now a according to the texture you criticized Trump's tax policies as they can do to the rich but you want Amazon here and you're willing to give the massive tax breaks tax breaks to get the true question\nYeah a company that is offering Fifteen\nDollars an hour for that question you're going to ... the rest of that yeah I assume you're in favor of Fifteen dollars an hour you saw what happened with Amazon recently so how you're going to rectify this\nSo you know the health care is going to come up in some way shape or form\nProbably off or is going to probably I Would think health care would have to be one on one it was an hour and I mean it's all day long it was only only\nWell I'm not going to feel like for our right now I understand what you're saying but I mean it's it's an hour I mean they're going to bring up they're going to ... there's going\nAll the issues that are exist out there that people think exists out there that are being brought up not all of these\nWere spell check I Want him in this time I didn't want him when he was running but now I Want a third or or ... ... anybody just get somebody in jazz this thing up a little bit\nIt's you and they're held jazz it up so I man this is going to be brutal I Would ask Charlie about um of\nCourse it doesn't really have anything to do this is a national thing that\nI Would ask them about the eighth systems are just where and when asking about health care and what he thinks you know\nThat's we'll allows for him I think you know gym that\nI made my bones and healthcare and we made great strides\nReally because we just keep getting reports over and over again about how veterans not being treated well [noise]\nBut he of course that's a fact she's going to go that's man you've been hearing about New Hampshire here in West rocks very we do
