I Would think you'd so you do that again\nAlso the ... in this thing he says look I was there for was there was a son I was there is a now ...\nAbout ... men and there was only five people I was thinking about that is my wife my two parents and my two kids my question for him would still be um\nAs you know I didn't love that appearance I didn't love the things that he is now acknowledging maybe weren't awesome are the things that I didn't love I Love the tone I didn't love the combative thing I didn't love the\nYou got a drinking problem to hide to a globe occur\nBut so you know\nAs a father and\nYou can't love what you see looking back on I'm like that's not an example for your kid right as a son\nI don't think yes you want to defend yourself but you can't that can't be the tone and tenor and the the one that I never liked that he said is that you've torn my family are part\nWhat I Would have always preferred that he said his tries you might believe me you have in fact this group in any way because this group is rock solid and they love me and they stand behind me and I'm such a lucky man some version of\nAnd well again I think the red cabinet wrote this realizes that died and I I\nThink that when he was there ...\nHe was so overly emotional that he ... he wasn't even he just wasn't even clear in his thinking that was just\nIt wasn't even the when he was saying you toward my family apart he means meeting your tort tearing their heart out you know we're we're cringing here where we're so emotionally distraught [noise]\nI I think that where he rarely really went off the rails though was when he kept when he kept turning it around on I'm On the centers that and especially as we said locker that said that was an ugly moment for him and I'm sure one that if he could take back he would take that back in ... [noise]\nI think he got back to the corner right there and he just didn't know what to do and he was angry and what they can be said that\nWas a funny thing is why foreign with people today I'm sure but the people that have told me all they do several things I've been wrong about this we're not the least of which there was about to be a vote today which I didn't think was going to happen so I'm right off the bat I'm telling ya I'd been missed reading a lot of this thing\nA lot of you that are going to tell me how I've been wrong about this are also going you were the ones that told me how awesome it was an outright it was and how it was right\nTo be that way well the guy that did it is now telling your maybe it wasn't that awesome right right right right the ... in other words what I'm doing if everything's teachable\nMoment and everything's or we can learn from this or whatever well let's learn from this the guy who did what it was that people said was great is now telling you that wasn't that great and he's telling\nA has heard he's heard the people that have said that that that the temperament issue is clearly yeah he understands where people are coming from and said uh you know\nThat well they might ... I Will tell you I don't know that you can put the genie back in the bottom right I mean we've all seen it we've all been there and we you did it when Bush came to shove so it's hard for you to tell somebody that's in front of you when push comes to shove for them to have gone down settle down as an actor\nYou got to find that guy that had that Brett Kavanaugh costume and those two huge here thing hands in front of his ... one of the bachelor I've ever seen\nThat comes with the attached hair piece right so it looks like it's the way it gets underneath that yeah that one of my favorite ones for sure\nI I I'm not into the road just loved to have you been doing down there but that guy we did that I don't like there are a young guy was one of\nThe people I hate he was very creative\nI mean he had the Budweiser can but it didn't say much wiser to Brett wiser legend of detail that is awesome that is that how about some creativity I like it\nHey Michael let's talk a little bit about what y'all are saying about this morning's out bad I mean that is an eye opener you followed by you know are preceded by the fact that we had a Supreme Court justice our former ah making comments about the nomination of a Supreme Court just wild things just happening left and right\n[noise] yeah it it's the drama that's unfairly here I mean the FBI report gets released and then all of a sudden you have a drama the the level of who shot Jay arguing or or frankly for the millennials when Courtney car dashing refuse to being Kim's video game it was almost like that\nUm but here we're looking at the result of what I think is numerous people that had concerns about Brett Kavanaugh not only did you have the Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens was a shocker because\nNot only its Stevens previously said wonderful things about cabinet included a bunch of cabinet decisions in books that he had written so he had nothing but the highest esteem and then to say that it was a performance during the hearing it caused him to think that Kavanaugh was not qualified to sit on the court was kind of a shocker and I think maybe that\nCoupled with the Yale Law school a BA questions that have been coming up over the past couple of weeks or cause cabinet as they listened despite what you saw from me on television I'm not that guy I'm a guy who is is level headed I'm a guy who who can be an impartial judge with blinders to partisanship now\nCan you won ring a bell I don't know and that's what the senators are going to have to decide when they reconvene and nine thirty this morning and then go with a procedural vote at ten thirty this morning\nWhat do you make of the hatch deal yesterday so Orrin Hatch there a couple of survivors and or protesters whatever how are you on a group these people they go to absorb them for you to harass him are educating them whatever where do you want to use and he says grow up kind of laughed and walks away he's been getting ripped for that and this is one of those things like\nHow how do you handle this one this come your way\nIf I'm if I'm Orrin Hatch is PR today I'm going to say on the other combat with a well he was in a hurry to get someplace but the reality is is that he wants to hear every accusers story he wants to hear the people who are victims he wants to sit and listen to what they have to say\nIn the right place at the right time not when you're on an elevator or about to walk into an elevator\nAnd people are screaming at you he would rather hear stories in detail on one on one meetings because I think that's the element you have to approaches from a humanistic level you want to hear the stories I think that's what has sold\nPeople on sort of this possible turn of Jeff Flake is he sat there they held the door open in the elevator when that woman was telling him her story you saw somebody who was looking at this from a human approach not just the political approach\nAnd that's kind of what shifted that element of what Orrin Hatch did yesterday and I can't blame him for that I mean they were screaming at him but what I saw him do is kind of it again from a PR standpoint\nI Would say do what you can just show the human side of this thing that you're concerned about their wellbeing but at the same time let's have a proper place for that kind of discussion\nSo Michael this morning where do we stand on this ... what what's your reaction\n[laughter] that's a really good question here Ken because you've got we knew that there were five swing votes right we knew that we had a couple of a a red state Democrats and we had the three Republicans and Collins flaking Murkowski so if you're keeping score one of the red state Democrats Heidi Heitkamp as saying she's giving a big solid no it very hard no a voting and\nJudge Kevin she said it was very emotional for her at the end of the day she wanted to be able to look yourself in the mirror so she's saying though so that leaves us with for Susan Collins Jeff Flake basically saying exact same thing which was ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight whatever\nYou know she's and I got to tell you she was ... ... did you worry that were you able to get some of that let's listen to it for a second she's pretty emotional about it\nHigh everyone wanted you to hear directly for me about why I'm voting against confirmation of judge Kavanaugh\nConsidering voting for a nominee to serve on the U.S Supreme Court is really one of the most important jobs of any US Senator and I take that responsibility very seriously\nToo many people in Washington that parties and leading to tape record or their opposition\nOn that isn't the way I ... I met with judge Kavanaugh closely watched his hearings reviewed and his available records\nAnd I've heard from North ... date as your senator I'm always put politics aside and voted for when I Believe is best for our state and our country I voted for justice Neil Gorsuch because I sell his legal liability and temperament qualified him for\nA lifetime appointment to the U.S Supreme Court in addition to the concerns about his past\nConduct last Thursday's hearing call into question for me to judge Kavanaugh's current temperament\nIs honesty and his impartiality these are\nCritical traits of any nominees Mr mom highest court in our country\nAnd then she was interviewed look and it was actually you know ...\nWhere do you don't and you either I don't know her well enough to know\nIn the past why she's done what she'd either she was one of the rain on Gorsuch who she is here she is what she said she was there in any case I just know that every political operative told her the thing to do is hold out right Wade in should they do is what mansions doing\nThat well though again I mentioned I don't even think ... I think there are no circumstances in which he votes no I don't I Can't see it I Can't but you still playing the game whenever\nShe she didn't do the thing that we all expected her to do and she's getting ready for that I said it's a weird\nPhenomena well it is strange and it's unfortunate I think I I don't think it's right she did vote for ... for Gorsuch\nYeah [laughter] I mean\nShe could have just just as easily\nTurned her you know held their nose in raise your hand the easiest thing for her to do is for her to say I'm waiting and whatever Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski who I'm On board with absolutely and I'm gonna do that I mean really right I Would be the ...\nSix or seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight\nSo where how do you read that I Want to hear what I Want to hear what people are listeners think I mean do you see her as an operative\nI either way and I don't know how you went right how do you win [noise]\nSix and seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight [laughter]\nWell the only weird thing in against or is that you waited for the FBI report which had nothing in it and then said it was the temperament from last Thursday like how was the ... gonna just route I mean\nWe don't know the go for it has nothing in it that's just what Chuck Grassley says\n... Coons groups that there's nothing in the report that you don't know\nWell maybe what maybe I mean we don't we can\nSit here and just say maybe maybe maybe and I'm sure if you asked her that she would explain it but maybe she was hoping that you know [noise]\nI don't know I don't know [laughter] a million weird phenomena around this is one of them are at seven thirty we'll take your calls in just a moment seven Thirteen here on W ... we have to check them in the in the ...\nSecond very much Kim checking the right into the city that's over ... back up the revered beach parkway lover downright heavy and slow top to bottom loads of Ninety three but sluggish over the metro west like east bound Islam or thirty ... one twenty over sixteen\nFor North of the city one twenty eight from a cell phone so I just delete from one point on Wakefield down and watch the ... were were three Burlington over ... road and resell phone tied up from one point them up I'll ever was will circle\nDown to the lower to sell the city one's white cell phone as an accident on the art grabbed suitable arranged ... thirty seven stress\nRight off from the splits up to Columbia road age would be like traffic heavy some and then in ... the former for British stuff causing heavy delays armored ...\n... was sponsored by Russia ... mortgages simple infinity sales betrayed given the right ... we understand fully mortgage confidently that rock mortgage dot com day was that often these days they go home and whether and MLS number thirty thirty I'll be ...

are attacking senator and elevators I mean really even your commentary I'm Wondering if you're trying to protect\nWomen attacked by people\nWho are you going to end and supporters\nHave no evidence yet and you know this is not talk about people at the end of the sexual you know one is saying we shouldn't feel that they shouldn't have your district but there is no evidence here and why ... ... anybody look at the white\nRec having our that anyone noticed her and\nHer contorted painful they turned him that was real and as far as these comments about having only\nWeighs what\nTypically on a typical day but there's not a typical day defending family who is white\nHis children just wouldn't care in his article that ... is it just a minute or increase you know they're out there we're talking about your targeted country we're talking about the will and a lot in this country that we rely on that list civilized country\nBut artists or world country and we don't just a few people for things\nWhen we're real evident I agree is I'm not I'm not sure I get your point in that I don't know what you've heard the IRS told her around is by\nEmail like me who can\nI not to speak for him I said I'm Susan I didn't fight for you I said why\nDon't you know there are a lot of people have said you know what I mean there are a lot of your\nIncome out and support cabinet what's been happening with that book and anybody else who they were that Facebook jak record hearing because Kavanaugh with his friends\nBut I doubt that would have personal friendship\nSusan was legal and some and it's on the show ... do do that to him\nLet someone else talk slow down\nWell she's is I I Know it wasn't just by listening at all to the show\nI mean I think you'll forget that this was my chance\nThat saw Susan everybody you know just get bombed yeah people defending them at all and they would have it on ...\nEvery single person on this station outside of the show completely ... percent support spark cat right yeah and there's been none of what you say what happened to him [laughter]\nOkay no so I Am I going to get picketed but if I thought you said\nYou know what is it so\nNow I'm going to interrupt you because you're wrong or some hand you have an overt you're you're\nYou're coming at me I have said over and over ... okay first off on the day that I have said over and over that I thought that this man was certainly qualified to be a Supreme Court justice I said that a hundred million times on the air I'm\nGlad I'm not voting for him I said that I did not like his demeanor the other day I thought it was I I thought it was wrong I thought he went about it in a wrong way now that doesn't mean that I Can't speak on behalf of women who are upset about the president and what he said Susan\nNot Brett Kavanaugh necessarily\nBut you've been listening for days so you know exactly where everybody stands here\nThat ... and that that is exactly what I've said what the president said the other day in my estimation and a lot of women that I Know\nAnd a lot of women across the country it was wrong that the president belittle that woman and he made he mocked her that was wrong and that's what I just said a few minutes ago as well\nNot Brett Kavanaugh\nIn my case you didn't say what it is that I said you don't like I Will tell you this I told you I didn't like the way Gemini carried himself\nHave it on himself said that in his op ed today just so you're aware of that Susan my guess is you'll be dismissive of that because whatever it takes for Kavanaugh find whatever but I've told you on your bread Kevin along the Supreme Court or Brett Kavanaugh was not on the Supreme Court it\nOr when he got up there in the state but there's all these\nPeople read that as it was just wondering cells and other people read it as he was on him so why couldn't the Democrats say that's the way they were they or read the report\nSays some are saying that\nShowed me\nSome are saying that Blumenthal his editors ... stuffing their Booker said that what he heard sounded like a there was some sort of some cooperation so some have said some rumors that that too yeah yeah\n[noise] but ... but my\nPoint you understand why they say that they should do what they wanted their report that I've ever heard nothing about\nThat they said I Believe what I was they go through it\nThey said it but it doesn't seem to be real is the problem that they have a and enough again one of one of the big winners for most of the week anyway was Chris Coons Coons did not back that up\nSo what Schumer said which was basically what you're asking for Schumer is that I heard I heard this I don't agree at all with Grassley I think there's some stuff in here that needs further looking into and there's a lot of his troubling Coons came out later and said there's nothing in here that we didn't know already so that that's why\nThat's not much of a conversation and if that was going to be their play it's it's falling apart\n[noise] uh let me go to Joe from their good morning Joe\nCome on guys you know something maybe I'll tell you you're not going to your partner if you could tell him black and white ... a year or two are going to tell you something or you know I got to weigh\nWhy wouldn't argue with you told me black is why I I mean\nYeah OK but with\nLike a choice they could have solved this anybody ... listen to rush they know it's\nOkay if I went to what the Democrats did to me two weeks prior to this hearing I Would have been just like that judge or maybe worse I mean they made him out to be a rape is no\nWithout even knowing anything without even hearing and number two let me tell you that\nIf they go into this girl and want to hear a psychologist who she sat talk show and she never mentioned about Kavanaugh she told her I think about the rate but never mentioned Kevin I mean the only time she mentioned the name was born she got involved with the Democrats\nOkay that's the only time she mentioned it and you know she was about a phoney and it goes oh he did was mentioned what she said\nSay what you want to Trump he said that like he's like a straight\nGuy tell you the only way to this country and you know not true but I hold onto and why isn't it to tell me why I donate them know only one of the things I Know you do but she does\nShe know them my name is Kim ... OK here it said um well I Know you do let me tell you something I don't like his demeanor you're right I don't like I Am at the main or I understand\nIt and I agree with you on that street guy\nOkay that but that doesn't that doesn't make any money ... it just doesn't that doesn't mean I ... I've said this over and over as well I mean you know I Want to come at me today and that's fine I don't I don't\nLast long to choke two calls ago that last lady she was right I mean I got\nI I mean anybody that's got\nA I gotta I gotta do what I read about what about you know what I got one of your daughters ... and his Seventeen year old daughter sir I so I'm not coming from this like you know I don't know what I'm Talking about all of those yeah the way you can't\nDo it I got two daughters to if my daughter came and said to me that somebody put on me or somebody raped me I wouldn't want facts I Want to stay awake Chu I Want to know who did it and when they did it all out there still don't know anything she didn't say anything to show corporate\nStory I think oh I felt like a\nWhile I don't on that and you say the Trump tells it like it is But Trump's first reaction to this was when she was very credible\nSo I I agree I agree with that she's credible\nThat she was credible at first I thought she was until the facts came out about her lie detector test how come they never brought up a lie detector test\nWhat is your job what is it one holdout what facts on the ...\nThe fact that she had a private person to the fact\nThat that was all ... all denied that was all done I don't know what she was as we don't know what even if\nJeff calling it fit that she was asked question okay Kevin she was never ask questions about Kevin okay we don't get that should've been the first thing they were\nOkay but if the if the claim was that she passed a polygraph test it appears that she did pass a polygraph test whether you like the questions that were after we\nKnow what kind of did they introduced shit\nWe don't want to go Democrat announcing that the FBI investigation was incomplete and phony\nMade me angry I agree it would be one thing just took away with me on one thing I always try to two weeks prior to this hearing they this judge so bad they should have been in\nI've told you my number one thing on this show is whether or not Ford should have been given a hearing and as I look back on it and as we continue to go over this\nIn the climate that we're in in in the way that this was done I don't think they had a choice but to give her hearing however going forward what is the standard if a woman makes a claim\nAnd there there is absolutely zero corroboration are we going to give her a hearing like this in the future and my answer would be no on that\nSo I I'm yes this is a troubling circle\nAnd my aunt and all that we would have been before you gave her hearing what they should have\nDone and they should have done from the get go was an FBI investigation immediately\nOkay so if you got so that was ... I Would have done what with well then once that was decided then the answer if there was no cooperation and the answer was no\nOkay so that simple whenever the standard Kennedy we've got to learn from this and we've got to try to change and we do it because this wasn't the way to do it and it didn't go well I mean you put people through from some things here that I don't think people should have to go through no doubt\nThat's ... ... if there's any lesson learned in all of this I Would think that would be one of the biggest lessons learned plunge always wanting to\nKnow if I were you I Would be saying and mornings I don't like about Ford it all is this concept of now we'll give you the\nThe therapists notes now we'll give them but this late stage you've had you've had plenty of time and Grassley specifically asked you for this stuff before and you didn't do you do look like you're playing games or your lawyers do and I I'm done with all of that stuff now\nA John is in ...

I thought you know pretty good comeback that's a better come back then grow up\nYou know he just that's just that's the way he is in the day before he told people when they started to Boo Boo to you\nAnd me [laughter] their mail every one of them doesn't matter which side of the aisle you stand on every one of\nThem is becoming so incredibly likable because the poor people are exposed\nUnder pressure the way all these people are the more it gets to be you know for me they just become or more likeable so that's why the votes gotta happen on a boat let's go and that is one thing he said to yesterday less about I'm with you I'm with you on that one day\nSo I I don't ride it anymore I wrote it for a long time in my life and I try to avoid it at all costs now but to me ... ... ...\nThe best argument for the tea is the tea is like a preparatory class for life and here's why I say that because that that tunnel now\nIs like the tea and you you have\nAll of the options that are there on the tea each and every day and what I ultimately chose yeah I'm going to put the headphones on pull the head down and I'm not going to make eye contact with anybody and I'm not talking to him but there are those people that ride the David feel the need to talk to people and feel the need to have conversations in discussions and try to help and ... and all that sort of stop\nI feel like these senators need to get themselves some ed phones and get some ... some sunglasses and I don't care what the circumstances are you just keep walking you're just came over and they don't want to acknowledge\nYou know it just watch what you wish for because I mean look these guys they just want to be on TV so bad that most of the time they are seeking out the cameras\nPraying there's somebody in the tunnel walking slower than normal oh I see Lindsay's in front of me I'll Wait housing back because they don't want him first I mean we've seen is over and over so they love this stuff\nThey just don't you know they're just irritated by the fact that when they don't want to do it right now and they're trying to get out that they stagger the time they walk in and saw an ad interrupt each other's TV Time after ... you saw that last week\nWhen they were leaving the day hearing and you know where there's break time or whatever and they were I mean I literally saw some of them hanging back because they knew that the cameras were\nYou know surrounding somebody well funny is I feel like the one that doesn't do it is the one everyone wants to get an opinion from the Mets Collins well they they ... they have an ice her down I get a comment true\nAnd I did see her like yesterday I think it was yesterday when she was going to the the FBI hearing or the you know the FBI reading room I don't know what the heck you call that and I'm someone very quietly goes good morning senator and she turned she was good morning yeah and then she just kept\nTalking I mean it's like but it just kind of stood there is a study in complete comparison because I could you could Google a hundred and fifty clips of Lisa Murkowski walking in a hallway and make a comment but like Susan Collins they literally the chaser yeah but isn't that tunnel or hallway or corn\nOr whatever you want to call like isn't that like a microcosm of life now where yeah generally the word would be for people or the advice you give to people trying to avoid those situations when at all possible so what do you do when you can avoid him and that's one of the tea the tea like do you are now in an enclosed environment and if somebody wants to get up and your grill they're\nUp in your grill so ... so how are you going to handle it these guys better have a game plan on going forward I can assure these dams that there is coming a time when they're going to do this and I for me I Would hope that area of I don't want people down there anymore but until that happens\nIt's like it's like the NFL like I'm sure the pets all they've got today off but Saturday there will be back in his study the game from what's yeah let's watch or an ...\nWhich yeah let's watch Lindsey Graham and let's watch blooming for let's go over all of these guys how do they handle this how do they deal with it let's watch flake obviously what what I have done and those sort of you you might want to prepare yourself for this because your career can end right there\nYes they've hatched was younger and was up for reelection he'd be in charge there they're well why don't I don't know I mean it would be about it on a lot more than a artist because his old wacky you weren't actually puts on glasses don't aren't as and and all that sort of spy and he's leaving\nIt it's it's not that big a deal but you'd better be ready for this kitten\nIt's irrelevant whether they're paid and whether they're agitated and whether they're just chaos what they're they're right and now the focus is on\nYoung you right well I I Do think that if I were in the Senate I've been in that that ... ... ... I'm sure we've all been in that time you know what what we're talking about here if I were in the Senate I Would say that when we're in session that that things should be blocked off\nThey should just have it blocked off for security purposes but when we're in fashion we can walk through there was a little bit of peace but they don't want to\nDo that all they do have a yeah now though there is I didn't make it was a guy I don't know what are they right do they have not wanted that right well like six months ago I forget who was one of the senators said maybe we got to start thinking about for security purposes we don't have cameras down there yeah in every other senators to sit down right\nNow we absolutely want on cameras there are you crazy danger cameras down\nThere that's why I said you know I'd been there only because that can be really dangerous I mean it's closed in and it kind of creepy\nYou give me I there's every reason to feel concerned that someone's going to throw in a make or if not something more serious\nAt somebody and then and what's guy someone eventually it's going to get punished and that person will win re election with eighty percent of their ... and then there will block it off or they will do so well I say that definitively but if somebody got shot in no nothing happened as a result of that so who that was long enough and they stopped having those softball practices yeah although the funding that arises they didn't have them there but if I remember\nSexual assault is a serious thing and we had Facebook realized that we've made some mistakes and the handling of this sort of stuff\nAnd a lot of law his comment originally was a apologized for being\nThere but then be said I Do believe in spending by your friends especially when the going gets tough\nLike I feel I Do those two I don't know that you can apologize and say that in this circumstance I think you just say the back half of it and don't you what do you get to a point in a company where you do no longer can do that you can't stand by your friend because of what it could do to your company well\nI think you can I guess you can stand by your friend in private but you can't actually physically stand by your friend hands what we've seen happen near as Sandberg turns around this is what she wrote in a post I've talked to Joel about why I think it was a mistake for him to attend given his role in this company\nWe support people's right to do what they want in their personal time but this was by no means a straightforward case\nDie because it is tricky I mean look you\nDerive a top people here where the biggest company you that everybody's keeping an eye on and we've had issues with bias some things of this nature I mean the question is who would he would have to just ... them does he want to\nWrite that morning part about it he I'm Wondering if his attitude about this originally was I'll do it and apologize later or if you just didn't see the complexity\n... by somebody and they were like hey you know you gotta do what you got to do that your personal time and then all of a sudden the fallout meant while you shouldn't have done that and we made a mistake I I don't know you know and we don't know and none of them ever really says that\nBut it ... the question really is you know Mimi ... at what point do you become a part of a company that you can't have any kind of personal face it doesn't belong to them\nWas and it was it Donna Karan that came out and supported Harvey Harvey Weinstein at first and then she took a giant hit her company and had to come back and backtrack a yeah\nThat's what I'm saying these things are a little bit tricky in his case by the headline on CNN hundreds of Facebook employees a voice outrage choose not to him for coming right\nI mean\nIf let's say he sends out a group wide email or about Facebook post whatever but ... says look I get to you guys are upset about it but this is my friend my ... I Need to be there for my friend and that's how it is it if you don't like it sorry I I ... what are these what are they do they want him gone because he was in there\nWell I Would think that that statement would be okay as long as he had checked in with the two people who are above him he's number three I think in line to if one were cool with it then the rest of the gang hey\nSorry you didn't like that he is my friend like you said but I it almost appears to me that he decided I'm going to do this and I'll apologize later if there's an issue or just didn't recognize that there would be\nYeah I mean there's a naive and tell you there if he doesn't think that right if he thinks a no one was going to notice be that this wouldn't be an issue right which is why the all the way it's been handled after the fact that it's sort of like a lot of things with Facebook Like\nReally you didn't know this was going to be a problem and now you're done other than hunky dory even though it clearly you you're not\nComfortable with any of this and you're not sure what this the resolution is I mean this is typical of them right uh-huh yeah [laughter]\nSo my ... my concern with him is that what you can't be that naive to not know that this would be a thing I Am fully find that offensive if my friend and I'm going to stand by my friend although there has to be limits to that and this is right there right\n[noise] I'm actually really surprised um and maybe this will change at that company but I'm sort of surprised that there is not something in his contract that would keep him from being able to\nWhat would be written like that's the thing yeah I mean it it unless that's unique circumstance\nYou're so right I mean [noise] I guess there could be something written your your contract that you can't donate to political campaigns or you can't attend political rallies\nUm but this isn't either of those you know it's what's strange about it and you are in a very gray area here if you're Brett Kavanaugh's good friend and you just want to go there and sit behind in\nOne of those like overhead maps are news arrows to everybody because I think he's in the second row I think the ... wasn't right behind him her lawyers because they were sitting\nAt the ins and they he his face is is is the face that's directly between the man and a woman who are her to lawyers and only thing about this I Will say bb is that there is a certain level of calculation here because I don't know how good a friends these guys are but there that's a very small room and you\nIt only invites so many people to come in there right and some of those people are invited by ... the senators everybody you know maybe you got inside your family you got one or two other seat and he chose the number three men\nAt Facebook I mean I\nMaybe maybe they're the best the best the best of friends\nI assume they are\nBut maybe they also\nWhat's real and it wasn't for him and he wouldn't have faced that but I assume a lot of people didn't know that they were good friends in the company and now they do know and now they're gonna be worked\nUp about it yeah because they are one got wrapped what's right that's what's causing the problem they really wasn't even people from the outside who were upset about it was a Facebook Facebook people\nPeople didn't know it was him but I feel like you're upset the cabin I Would have invited him but I don't know\nI'm just I'm saying I'm I just I I Know I Know I'm more addressing him I don't think it's as naive as oh gosh she's just my good friend I mean I think he knows there is only going to be a handful of people\nIn this room representing him and I can come here with the power of who I Am in addition\nTo what I mean again what should've happened to your my guess is when all this went down each month extra an email and said look at anything I can do for your body you know that and then at some point the guy reaches ... says hey would you like to be there I mean all day All right\nAnd get your Gulf crow Jesus I when I just\nWrote the generic thing and now he wants to be there what am I going to do\nOr did you say to them what you know I'd want to be there you're going to kill my company you're fired from South that boy talk about a tough thing right\nNow so maybe you do this which is you go if they catch you you eat it and write you a pile and how best otherwise you've lost your friend your friend is asking you look the chips are down in Egypt\nMhm what do you do he went\nI knew if I get I don't know I'm just a ... hour when inhabit if he doesn't always in your friendship forever tarnished\nWell I mean in the end he waited I guess and he made the decision that he's made a lot to do and [laughter]\nIf it gets booted so be it I don't know ... to get booted over this\nAre you you're obviously could win but would you would you get booted for this but I don't think he's going to it doesn't appear enemy today though or they may be I have a lot to do with the fact that he beat everybody the punch by he went Thursday and friday he issued his apology immediately juries are risky this was\nFor him if Kavanaugh if Ford was proven definitively aimed or more to the point if sweat Mick was proven yes\nThen when she really does have a problem I realize that's what they're saying to them behind closed the naivete of this thing like that is one thing to back to your friend but if your friend turns out to be a rapist right which an avid what the hell are you doing [laughter] well his response\nTo that was I knew he wasn't I knew he wasn't right oh I didn't worry about the difference between Sarah Silverman end on a camera\n... got away with what she said because she was being honest look this man's my friend I don't like some of the things he did but Lucy can't didn't rape anyone but you know ... and had to walk her statements back because Harvey Weinstein raped people capital went there and knowing\nDailies has not had a tough one ... one two she can't ... I don't care what you can tell me you didn't know ... you're positive he wasn't but you can't know that you can't you didn't go to you know with them or you didn't go to Georgetown Prep with him and you can't possibly know you were at that party so how do you know what he did that well that's just response\nTo them I can ... you know when they say what in the world would you have done if that the FBI investigation turned up blah blah blah and I said why did I didn't wasn't worried about it\nIt used to be where\nHe does he he directly behind his mom\nWhen you used to be you'd point that a guy in the chair and so you don't want to be the guy in that seat now you don't want to be in any of\nAcceptable is a model she wanted to be probably in the river so\n[laughter] oh eight fifty nine I W our head [noise]\nBoy so Boston you walk working in one hundred and twenty seven till UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\nAll lives on four senators good morning I'm Nick ...

Scott but\nThe flu shots at our pediatricians were destroyed in the ah the fire down the the the power went out up there and so I don't know these things need to ... or something and\nThey were destroyed and so now they're waiting for the new shipment but there's so many people waiting on the new shipment gets theirs and just do the CBS thing et cetera et cetera\nBut didn't didn't realize that yeah it's too late for me though\nYeah sorry about that that stinks and he um I Know ... we just mentioned ... valley you were up there I chatted with some restaurant owners and stuff right\nYeah we did that last Sunday on the radio show and and a couple of one place out of all the places that we interviewed have reopened and other than that there's still no dates or you can actually hear the frustration on some of the the the voice especially John and goes from Palmer's restaurant Andover\nHe says the communication the first week or so was phenomenal he says they were always contacting them and let them do the status what was going to happen and then that was it\nAnd you know he's here is basically saying I have to my all my employees which are being paid for supposedly out of the fun as of last Sunday show not one of his employees has received a check\nAnd then it goes in for me you know I still got the mortgage I still got to pay all the insurance is you've got to pay the electric electric bill got to pay everything and I have no revenue coming in at all so you could just hear the frustration\nYou know on his voice and and he was told about a week and a half ago that it could be some time in November that he'll be back\nTo cash while you are getting you live up that way Scott so we're Palmer's isn't Andover\nYet Palmer's end over his closed a roads up\nThere you've seen them that you're writing downtown in over it's a nightmare to try and get around right now yeah it is wrapped up there's construction crews on every single road it's a nightmare grass fields which is a little further\nDown if you're going north ... uh I Believe that kitchen had a small fire from the gas leak and they were able to switch over to propane so they have reopened but talking about the expense and then finding people that can go out there and do it uh it it just really tough I there was one restaurant trauma restaurant in North Andover\nAnd they're in the CBS flies and you're picking CBS flies right you can't be more central located in North and or and then that he said they were cooking what it all happened\nAnd all of a sudden the gas just went out so he thought maybe somebody accidentally pulled the button to stop the gas and then he starts you know like like okay it's not working with turnover ... no gas coming he calls the gas company they didn't have any answers where I'm at that moment\nBecause it was all happening and he turns around and you start seeing people getting phone calls and they realize what's going on and then he looks at his gas fire place that has been off all summer it turned up and turned on had about a twelve inch flame\nFor for the whole time so it it talk about scary but again still they're they're hoping I noticed there Facebook just the other day I said the crews are on the street working so they hope to be open soon but it takes a long time long rows of torn up\nIf you come in this area and the staging areas are unbelievable yeah yeah yeah there's a place right behind the China blossom I Believe they feed a lot of the workers\nSo that could be hundreds of folks and they were at at night\nAre from all over the country you know just basically the commissary line or getting through but it's still still something and you drive by everybody looks normal and realize that there's been selected areas of town that have no gas in the ... and you really know date when they're going to be opening up its tough\nIt is tough it is and I just feel we we talked about this yesterday I just feel so sorry for those folks ... and I'm not trying to stay away from the ...\nThe restaurant issues but I feel so sorry for them yesterday they had the smell of gas in high school I think it varies or elementary ... to get those kids out I mean it's just sort of a nightmare for these folks because every time they smelled gas I mean you can ... you know you can only imagine how panicked at people and certainly kids feel right now\nEven for me I Am with like that that Monday or all of a sudden I start you're knocking on my fireplace was so my first thought is that an animal crawl down if I was\nA ... and then I'm like well you know the vents for the gas to the boy was underneath it also comes up there and then you're thinking could this have anything to do with gas\nYou know it had nothing to do with anything other than being cold but you start hearing knocking upping ah and you're like wow you know it just it just so scary or the thinking about what these folks have gone through and Palmer's I mean the story that he tells he had evacuated on that Thursday\nAnd emit service\nYou know food is basically they pulled food off the stove they were just sitting there uh dishes in place and wind was poured it just frozen time yeah and he said that he walked in four or five days later the smell the stench from all the food's going bad was just incredible", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Kuhner Report",
