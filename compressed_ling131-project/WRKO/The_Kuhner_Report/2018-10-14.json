let's find out if you have to work let's find out if you can make it work if you've got enough\nMoney saved so you know it's been a great discussion so far about this forced retirement either being offered an early retirement are being forced to retire early it's why I Want you to get the book forced to retire like I said earlier it's an easy forty five minute read\nIt covers the seven things you need to decide before you take an early retirement offer or if you've been forced to retire early or if you think you're going to be\nGet the book one eight hundred seven zero five one two three two again one eight hundred\nSeven zero five one two three two when you call that number you're going to hear a very brief recorded message from me leave your name will get back to you and we'll get you out a copy of the book not any book a real book you can hold in your hand and you can read at your leisure so give us a buzz get a copy the book\nEight hundred seven zero five one two three two\nIs the number that eight hundred seven zero five\nTwelve thirty two if you like your own copy of forced to retire eight hundred seven zero five twelve thirty two they're listening to build Johnson's money wisdom Joel is a certified financial planner and the c._e._o. of Johnson ... the official wealth management partner of the Yukon huskies\nDoes talk a little bit about emotions and the role that they can play in retirement planning sometimes good sometimes bad but more often than not emotions are not our friend\nWhen it comes to financial planning I Know one of the emotions that can really take a toll on your portfolio is greed how do you see greed manifesting itself when it comes to investing\nWell nobody wants to say they're greedy but a lot of people will say hey I'm afraid I'm missing out and that's really where greed comes into play here I'm afraid I'm going to miss out I better get in the markets hitting all time highs and I didn't have all my money invested in stocks um oh my goodness look at\nYou know Apple's stock it's it's gone up and I could have owned it a year ago and I didn't own it\nLike this this self talk we have of everybody's making money and I'm missing out or I'm not making enough money inevitably it can get clients into trouble because what they're typically doing is they're buying at the high than the market turns on them their funds or whatever they own start to go down\nOr they go down enough and they sell trying to preserve what they have left then the market turns and starts going back up again\nAnd they buy again fearing that are going to miss out then the market turns and it starts to go down and they sell they keep buying high and selling or buying Heinz ... if they keep repeating that long enough there'll be broke and even though you're hearing me say this and you're going well that's not me that's not me\nThis is the typical investor and I bet if you really examine some of the investment decisions you've made if you're like most people maybe you're not but if you're like most people\nThere are times in your life when you've made investment decisions\nBased on the fear of missing out we call the greed but it's based on the fear of missing out had a client just a few weeks back or not a client somebody is coming from this radio show they they wanted to become a client and we're in the process of doing that for them and they had done exactly that\nUh they had looked at the funds and their four one K. statement there was a one fund that had done incredibly well the previous year\nThey put their money into that fund just in time for that fun to start doing poorly because almost all investments styles work in cycles it's almost impossible\nTo pick the type of investing whether it's asset allocation foreign stocks are us stocks large companies small companies commodities it's almost impossible to pick what's going to do best over the next twelve months but if you do\nThat based on what did the best over the last twelve months I can almost guarantee you at some point in time you're gonna get shut lacked\nA which is a nice word if you're going to lose a ton of money and so this fear of missing out you've really gotta watch out for it check your emotions again as we've said so many times on this program before your emotions and the way you behave based on those emotions is the biggest impediment to you being a successful investor\nYou say that greed is more often than not the fear of missing out when it comes to investing but that's different from just regular old fee you're not the fear of missing out but just fear in general often is an emotion that can make you make the wrong decisions when it comes to your money\nRight and this is getting scared of the total loss of capital of feeling like you have enough to have a certain monthly income for the rest of your life in retirement\nWatching the account value go down and beans so scared that it's going to go down to zero or it's going to keep going down that you just sell and get out and say I'm not going back on the mark and I'm just going to protect what I have\nI should have been happy where I was before I should have gone out earlier now I'm just going to protect myself from losing any more money it's demoralizing\nIt's terrible when you feel that way most people cannot resist the temptation of making that decision of when everything looks bad everybody on the news saying it's different this time\nOn the world is going to hell in a hand basket I better get out and protect my money\nThis is what takes over and people sell at the wrong time that's why it's so important to have a good financial plan to\nMake sure if you can't do it on your own which most people can't you have a good financial advisor that's protecting a good chunk of your money so that you can't lose all your money in a down markets and the amount that goes down\nHas already been ... the the amount of risk that you're taking has already been carefully analyzed so that we or whoever you're working with no exactly what you can take\nFrom an emotional standpoint so you're not tempted to sell out of fear and if you're working with the right financial advisor they are going to help you stick to the plan regardless that's what they really get paid for\nI was talking to somebody the other day Joe ... who was\nRetiring next month and he was talking about how excited they used to be wrapping up a working career and I said well do you have everything figured out in terms of retirement income and all those T's crossed and I's dotted and he said yeah yeah I Hope so I've been been working on it for a while so I Hope I've got everything taken care of well guess what hope\nIs not a plan and hope is another emotion that doesn't work in our favor when it comes to financial planning\nHope is not a strategy I like to say you know somebody who doesn't have a plan it was just hoping they'd have enough to retire what if a nursing home comes along what if the market goes down what if something happens personally in their lives whether it's with a spouse with kids with grandkids that they didn't count on\nYou've got to have a financial planning you've got to have a plan\nThat not only lists out what rate of return you need on your money to meet all your goals\nIt sets aside reserve accounts for the nursing home situation or for\nChildren or grandchildren emergencies it has the right insurance you got to have the right insurance in place whether again that's nursing home insurance homeowners auto um some type of insurance that might be life insurance to protect against you losing income at the first death between you and your spouse\nYou've got to have a full financial plant greed fear and hope that three things that we've talked about that our emotions that will affect your retirement planning and nobody likes to admit they're greedy nobody likes to admit they're fearful\nNobody likes to say they're just relying on hold but the reality is all of us I think if we're honest certainly myself to one degree or another\nFrom time to time we make decisions based on these emotions those emotions might might not be overwhelming but they're an influence on what we're doing\nGreat showed us far I Want to offer you the chance to get your own map your money map we put your entire life on

sheriff's deputies are being accused of stopping Latino Z it's called racial profiling right\nThere because there's a pattern of behavior the deputies are saying so what is the difference between a pattern of behavior for ah for Brett\nKavanaugh but you'd think which it turns out it's not even true and a pattern of behavior for stopping drivers are stopping anybody because you suspect that uh
