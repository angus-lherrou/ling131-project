W ark how\nCan you ... I just wanted a\nRoad things shouldn't between Obama and Trump as far as nationalist label it'll for those of us were from the world war two being raised by parents that nationalism is really something that was very important and after World War two clearly we needed to\nShow up to ... better I mean the\nTwenty percent of the world using eighty percent of the resources I mean as a kid you still see pictures of people bathing in\nNew Delhi in China and all that and it's clearly we needed to distribute some of the world so that we could raise the level of the world\nEconomy we did that we do such a great job that the last twenty or Thirty years we've done it at the expense of America let's all Trump is doing in rebalancing in a row Barlow clearly was an American you looked like a buddy love is America which was a global view that you know we should all share and the wealth in the ...\nYou know a lot less well than our parents in order that the rest of the world would look better and maybe we'll go too far on this and but yeah the pendulum has swung and that's all Trump is talking about there's nothing wrong with being nationalistic it says let's say\nWe've come first and quite honestly when we do it we're able to do better for the rest of the world because we spread the wealth and the way we would go in there we were going to be there for the rest of the world when they needed it in disasters and recovery so uh that's that's the way we're going to get back and that's all I have to say on that\nI call that ... that I think that it's so well said I don't think is right though I don't wear nuts for an oil so that\nThe difference with with what Paul said sure that's great that's not what Trump's talking about Trump the do the China's a perfect example hey look I Want you to do well you do well for you we're not going to do well for you then stop ripping us off\nHe doesn't he doesn't care in theory you know been so far as he thinks anything about it he he doesn't care if you're does well or not he wants Merkel to buy our oil which they're now doing and he won that one he should have played that harder last night\nEspecially in Texas but he doesn't care well do well great if you don't too bad where are you going to do well but I mean that's all he cares about I think ...\nYou know there is a possibility pendulum could swing too far again Oh absolutely you know but I expect that to happen actually\nMaybe but in in a in the short run there may be needs to be some pulling back I'm In for a lot of Americans apparently that is that's the direction they want to see him go let me go to my keys in New Hampshire Hey Mike\n[noise] you know the interesting thing I've ever listen to a few people try to explain what what nationalism what this comment means to them and I haven't heard anything about the color of anybody scan I haven't heard anything about immigrants are illegal immigrants and\nI think that's an important distinction to make that the media is going to make this out to be a white versus brown versus yellow versus black type issue that Trump is standing up there saying that I I only care about white America and it's just a shame because all he's really saying which everybody is already agreed to\nIs that this country needs the book itself in the mirror and realize that we ... number one will be the world's police we can't be the world's shopkeeper we can't be holding everybody's hand all the time expense of our own and for the first time\nSomebody unabashedly stands on stage and tell us the people that he wants to vote for him that he wants to serve say\nYou are the first and foremost people that are on my mind when I'm when I'm overseas when I'm making trade deals when I'm thinking about the economy went up thinking about national security is not worried about whether or not the people in Honduras or ... or Nicaragua or China or any other place or Europe\nAnywhere across the world not worried about what they are doing what they are responsible for he's worried about\nThe people at home Americans and this is a breath of fresh air we haven't heard I've never heard it in my lifetime and\nTo be honest with you good for the media let the media\nPick this up part however they want to pick it apart all it's going to do is your poll is already shown its I mean he has no credibility they're not going to be able to build on anything other than the fact that Donald Trump is dealing with lowest\nThe middle of the night where they are still yeah there were two three hours behind those died to get him\nWell my my angle on this today for what it's worth ... I assume you saw this yesterday but what the AP did I'm not trying to be as smart as here but I'm just a little bit puzzled by it like\nI get that we have to be very careful with what we say and I get the words of meanings and may have multiple layers now and you want to be very careful we just did this for an hour and a half or more nationalist than what it means but\nSo the a P went to great pains yesterday to put out but they they tweeted this out we've moved in a pie tweet from October twenty first couple of days ago that\nCity migrant caravan and Mexico was quote like a rag tag army of the poor and quote that wording was poorly chosen and has been removed from our coverage of the caravan\nMhm [noise] so I again I'm going to sound like a smart as I Know I I retreated this guarded Lee but is it what exactly is the poorly worded phrase there\nIs it rag tag is it on me is a poor because to me when I look at the caravan yes they are or ragtime rag tag army of the poor are hot how else would you that seems to crystallize them exactly\nSo what's the problem\nI've been told by some friends in the left that the problem is the word army\nAnd that implies invasion force of some kind of right man are we doing this or that wouldn't that actually wouldn't have\nBeen the word that jumped out at me first right I would've um\nBut there can be no doubt that they're poor there can be no doubt that there's a sort of a ragtag band they just picked up two thousand people out of nowhere on one right like\nI just think that they that that the ... he was trying to be politically correct in there and this would have been my first guest in the idea that they're [noise]\nRag tag immediately just gives you a really negative to me it's kind of a negative connotation but I think your friends maybe right army maybe the word that they are looking at and they don't want to use that term because um the the\nA lot of people have been saying this is an invasion\nAnd\nI think probably does I'm On the left don't want this to be portrayed as an invasion\nI feel like we're trying really hard here to be just so\nThat if you really need to pull that tweet again that Michael really not ... there's tweets everyday that I'm like wow how's that one still standing that no one was ever going to make sure that weren't they even like I'd\nAlready toity cocktail parties only oh you're a very you know the ones that put out that right Dr rag tag I'm Lance silly [noise]\nMeanwhile has this story moved at all for you\nWell no not really it hasn't I mean unless in fact there is something that happens today and the Mexican government gets a little rougher with them and that's what was being reported last night and I saw that more than one place that their intention is to stop\nThem that\nThey are on behalf of the United states they are attempting to stop\nThem that could turn ugly will say\n\nOh let's see if that were to happen\nObviously we'll be talking oh yeah the I assume that's a huge what I mean Trump is bullying them to great lengths correct well because I Want you to ... so that we don't have to crack down yes or we can ... I was going to do what do you want us\nTo go out in the last thing the president wants three days four days before the election is people's heads being cracked on the border he doesn't want that he'd like for that to stop before he has to make a decision as to what he wants to do and he certainly doesn't want it at this time of\n\nThis time on the calendar the only thing that that the only thing that happened yesterday that I mean again that I thought was interesting is that um [laughter] the president made the comments that their middle Easterners in the middle of it and if you go to the middle of the crowd you'll find that\nAnd I don't know where he's getting that information or where he's basing that you know I mean again this is this is I Do have to I Do have to agree that that's a bit of fear mongering\nBecause he's trying to make them seem dangerous yeah all the video you see them they just look kind of sad\nYeah I don't I don't know I don't know what they are they are sad there's no two ways about that and they are some of them look very desperate there's not seven thousand people marching toward the United states and there's not some people in there who are\nUm whose intentions are not good I mean that's just the and you can't go to the fair and there is not out of all the people there there's not somebody there who you know has some kind of ill will toward someone\nSo the idea but the idea to paint it as if it's just a gang\nOf of uh\nFelons moving this direction I think is a little far\nCharming appalled at right now do you believe that there are middle Easterners hiding out in the\n... I mean even even when you watch Fox in the morning they they've been trying their best to show how dangerous this mob is coming toward the end they just look like\nSad to people of Iraq hired on Fox News reported yesterday that they went and started they had their people moving out they couldn't find anybody who was Middle Eastern or I mean they had oxygen report it\nThey they had ... was his name I was watching well before you guys got here and they had him like go up to people as they were being arrested on the border and put a camera in their face and a microphone and ask them why they came here and the guy just kept saying there were so many criminals trying to kill me I I just couldn't go be there anymore and she didn't know how to respond to that\n...\nSo your your question is\nI mean you you would you believe there are no middle Easterners and a curve as Trump has suggested I mean does it does anybody believe that well anybody answer the answer is\nI don't know maybe there are one or two I don't know but it's being portrayed as if well how center of this whole thing is just this whole big movement of terrorists trying to get air when did they sneak\nIn [laughter] so where they embedded in Mexico and they've just been waiting for a mass movement to finally take place of thank God finally or whether they're sitting in Yemen and hey you see what's going on down there let's get you on a plane let's go when it gets you over there and then you're going to sneak in what is it ten of them\nJust slowly\nWe've all done this for or what is the group and we don't have the ticket in and let's just slide right in in January of ... is is that happening really\nWell I don't know I mean you know would we would be being naive to think that that couldn't happen yeah I think we would be naive to think that couldn't happen but\nI don't think that that the president's ... again portraying it like there is seven thousand people who are just felons in terrorists with ill will in their heart just marching toward the border and I don't believe that's true\nThat doesn't mean I think we should open the border and just say hey\nAll seven thousand give us your tired your poor we can't do that either but to painted like it's just absolutely it's a wave coming at us and get ready because I think ...\nYou know what was it was on your birth but maybe it was Paul name one thing that Trump has been done it's right or whatever we're there are people on the fence about the caravan that said well I don't know about\nThese Middle Eastern there were hiding out in their you know what I say that jokingly but I assume there are some people in the country that that do that did happen\nNot close attention they caught big window of what their middle Easterners trying to come up through the southern border yeah provider most of those people were against the care of and before that I Would think they were in in that sense I just don't feel that there was anything ... indoor healthy\nBought him throwing out and I think they're middle Easterners like okay\n[laughter]\nIt's seven fifty eight on this Tuesday Morning here in Boston Morning Joe Kennedy the with\nVoice of Boston\nNew York or Boston one hundred point seven till UCLA HD to Boston and heart radio station\n[noise]\nMorning I'm Nick ...

I was I was speaking to a group of people who were talking about it that way they're just more concerned about the restrictions associated with it\nWell before we continue on with that uh-huh let me give away some tickets real fast oh sure absolutely just ... I mean we even had the music and I just totally forgot to do or and we're all very into\nThat I'm Sorry yeah I was so amazed by what somebody was writing which I get what they're saying but having said that I I think going to the extremes probably is right\nOr it's the doors for music theater Tuesday folks I'll be just haven't color right now it's six or seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight six or seven to six six sixty eight sixty what a pair of tickets the hairspray it's north shore music theater on Tuesday October thirtieth the shows at seven thirty were to give away\nAgain in in our hope you win now hope you win later if you don't you certainly still see the show go to an S. M. T. dot org good luck\nSo one of my advice is to people that are for question one and also for NBC ten of you're listening and you are\nA ... so what is the override procedure on us you keep telling me in case of emergency it's fine but who\nGets to make that call my impression was the actual nurses can I say they're allowed to say I can take more than I've never I've never seen that\nHappen in any union circumstance question I was absolutely given was that it is written into it that a nurse is allowed to say we have an emergency I'm going over to the maximum is supposed to go to you just can't be forced to go over to but\nI wasn't born in ... Iraq was a more last night I get I've\nWorked in the shops where if that maybe you've seen this where\nWithin reason you can do something but then the union member complains that you did it because that wouldn't be reasonable for them and then you're called in because you're not going to keep doing that because that said that example\nYou know like really 'cause I was just carrying the thing to the car right you're told them to cut the crap what it's like I don't know that\nIt's not working for me I'm not buying that I Would argue\nThat the issue is less about when it's all said and done that you were these restrictions probably are less about the major crisis and they are more about day in and day out but day in and day out of the times when sometimes these nurses need to make those kinds of decisions hey\nYou know we need one more person and that person needs just did a little extra care and I'm going to um to step in and be the one who does it no no you're not\nThat I think that's where the restrictions are going to be an even bigger problem\nThan when you have a crisis situation where everybody says look we'll deal with that later you know\nApologize later as they say don't ask for permission you just move but I think it is the day in and day out um restrictions that are going to be problematic for some nurses or they see it as that let me go to Mary and she's in the feeling good morning Marion\nHello good morning I'm I'm a nurse and I am in a hospital in Boston and I have to tell you that when that are needed knowing minute station ... and ... and then say oh well and it give you plenty of nurses that you need it\nSome of the nation I have worked nights for twenty seven years and I have had\nShifts where I've been in charge\nIt and I've had to say please we need more body and now like sorry we just don't have them you know I'm I think that the hospital needs to be held accountable\nUm and it is written in the law that in a state of an emergency there is um [noise]\nIt can be listed there isn't a quote is that\nUm [noise] I\nJust wholeheartedly believe that we need that\nAre you getting a sense that you're in the minority or in the majority\nWell unfortunately the vote no campaign in the hospital administrator and have a spent millions fighting that and if they had just put that money and to say that I think\nThat we wouldn't need this um but they have this campaign they've had a massive campaign um and spent a lot of money trying to ... confused voters and make them think that they don't need that that this is going to beat that um that hospitals are going to close that they're going to close\nThey might involve listening California none of it happened\nUm I just really truly it's common sense don't you want to nurse taking care of you know like she has the number of patients my daughter works in New Hampshire is a nurse she takes eight patients at night that's a lotta med search patient that's New Hampshire again this won't affect her but\nMaybe it will spread along down the road I just think that we need um\nWhat's that enters into bed Mary and if you can I knew what twenty three years or so doing this now is there are the one you know it's like\nWell I work you know me I work in high risk will be but I'll be just a thicker than ever um you know what we don't get a healthy moms and babies like people think I'm you know so\nBe it a little different but I still think that I've had night where I just haven't stopped I had the ... now that I haven't and I I just think that we need a limit to um\nThe net dot the immediate um medications the things that the protocol for that particular need and then you go to get an education um for the next medication they may need that\nTo say you're only going to be taken care of five people about five people they thought could be five people donate immediate care\nThat is going to get your message at her house at that time\nI used to um I used to work all the land and they were times that we didn't have not patient filled the nurses were needed elsewhere anywhere\nThey didn't like it but you write to us for that surge without having going back to having treatment that search well you don't really lose their skill but they're not going to want to say no I'm working this you know what you eat me or not at all do very well\nThanks very much she's somebody who is changed her mind I think that's interesting on let me go in on the south shore hand to morning\nGood morning I'm taking this from a different perspective a I'm a nurse I retired um but I've done quite a bit of research when I was working and I think this is a matter of\nWill this law if it passes improve patient outcomes and everything they've written about California since they enacted a similar law shows that\nPatient income outcomes are not changed so what we're going to do if we pass this is make the mass legislature interests managers they're going to tell the hospitals how they have to be staffed they tell the nurses what they're\nGoing to do and nurses are going to be floating around more and they've been nurses have been floating for decades but you don't want to take an OB nurse and put them on an orthopedic for tickets they don't know anything about it because nursing is very specialized today just like\nFor example law is very specialized so I think this is bad but people are looking oh my God these all these women and men they're they're overworked but they're not looking at the real\nThe real thing that we need to look at and that is this going to improve patient outcomes I don't believe it is and I do believe it's going to cause a ton of turmoil\nUm and I don't think that's good for anyone and I do think if you can't bring another person up to a bit because\nThey can't take more than X number of patients\nThat patient will spend more time in the emergency room or an and observation unit and those are going to be stretched and if you've been in an emergency room with a family member recently you know then it eight ten twelve hour wait to be seen and gurney stretching the hallways\nIs not an unusual sight anymore so no I think this is bad I think the unions really want this obviously the unions in Massachusetts only represent twenty three percent of the nurses so if you talk to my daughter was a nurse and M. G. H.\nThat's non union they're against that you talked to a union because you and if people are always in lock step anyway they're all for it but I think I've looked at it pretty closely because they spend it with three years and the profession and I don't think I Would want it for myself so no vote no on one\nAnd thank you very much there you go maybe she gave you just give you a plus\nYou have him on both sides on it in a way which is that you know and the one hand you haven't explained to me how this was better for patients which I Do think is a huge problem on the other hand she did say there's eight to ten hour waiting periods sometimes and while I Would assume this would help with that I'm a member of the\n... her responses to her problem is that do that she says if you're so limited up on the floors you're going to you that backlog down down down down down to the emergency room which is going to get worse and worse you know whereas if you can keep circulating keep patients move\nBut if you're hiring more staff and presumably the duty count argument would be if you're hiring more step and you have strict limits than there isn't going to be some sort of back warmed up top you know what you have\nI but I think she's assuming also that you're hiring more staff that is going to be specialized and only one place\nMaybe you know look I write to me it always is there's this room I get what's in it\nFor nurses I get with Senate first steps I get what's in it but you're not giving it for me what's in it for me like I told ... when I've been to the hospital I've never felt like man was a nurse when you made when I feel like there it's more like it's okay you don't need to check on me\nI'm I'm okay and so I've never felt what it is they're telling me is going on in hospitals maybe it's just 'cause I'm lucky I haven't spent a lot of terminology but Savage told me on that and to to make the leap to what this would do in the precedent that this was\nExcept for me away I'm Mary is from Logan morning Larry merry\nMorning I'm a first time caller longtime listener and I'm a registered nurse I work north of Boston and has no excuse me where I work at Nineteen eighty\nAnd I'm I'm voting yes on a ballot question number one and I understand both sides of the issue however I'd been waiting for this bill for almost forty years and um [noise] I Do have my reasons why I'm\nI I feel that um there is a massive campaign that is being put out by hospitals to vote no and that the that the staff nurses um I don't have much of a voice in the matter on my hospital as a non union hospital and so um\nI just feel as though our voice needs to be heard they need to be a distinction made between the administrative nurses who would vote no on one and the staff nurses who are in the trenches to me and a lot of my colleagues we talk about this all the time we are voting yet\nAll right Mary thanks very much he's interesting there's there's a split [laughter] let me go to a lady in she's in Boston Hayley in\nIowa good I'm\nA veteran\nThen ... and I am a strong advocate for vote no on ... on the ballot poorly written\nTo implement it would be an astronaut taxpayers not in general are and now they're both agree just staffing ratio issues are in nursing home\nAnd nowhere ... mentioned it's not because the majority of nurses taking care of patients out yeah\nAnd they are not represented by the way it did not I\nMean that's an issue Mass General approach that out of my colleagues and I wrote right that fail for time over in its entirety it's written and it is not on their goal but that tax Oregon for use of resources [noise] All right\n... thanks very much what we're seeing the thing I have heard from many that's what I was hearing from the nurses that I was talking to it's not the right bill it's a bad bill a and let me get to Ellen Ellen is in east Bridgewater good morning\nOh good morning thank you for taking my call I I'm also I have over forty years I mean I just did not proud of it and I am totally opposed to this and bill and the number one and voting no and I'll tell you why in\nTheory I agree with that nurses do need more help we they have an awful lot of patients that they're caring part but the problem is they're not looking at some of the logistics so let's just say as an example you work on the medical surgical floor\nAnd the government determined set for nurses excuse me for patients per nurses that limit that they want to have been if I'm going and everyone on the floor has for patients\nI go to lunch now who have is my for patients and because\nYou can't take that patient can add that need to have five and someone else will have five CEOs over the limit so now what I don't get to go to lunch and they forget and another thing nurses we know how to trash I came from a very good hospital in Boston and that's now newly retired and\nWe have guidelines in place so certain areas of the hospital like an OB for Annette surge in ICU an intermediate icy use they had nurse patient ratios\nWho how many nurses can be assigned feel per patient or I mean you see any patients printing there is a little nervous I've never done this and\nI think that that is what is so sad that they're not looking at least ... it's gonna cost hospitals style more money than we are now getting reimbursed from governments and insurances kick out of the cost of patient care\nEllen thank you very much you know again going back to the idea of the deal itself is just not a really great one Seventy one says my father recently was hospitalized did make his own bed they forgot to bring his breakfast is roommate fell out of bed my dad had to get up and getting back into the\nBad part of that ad out Harris as well and part of that's not nurses let's keep in mind your business is probably not making your bed and you're nurses probably not bringing your breakfast for them that that may be a hospital that has
