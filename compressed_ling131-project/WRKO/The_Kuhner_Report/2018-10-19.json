I Know yeah but I mean somebody I mean he's not telling you to actually be violent and\nThe very next line of his speech by the way which nobody ever show was was I mean don't do anything crazy and don't do anything illegal\nSo he immediately corrected that statement but no one shows that\nYou know yeah they you know what [laughter] you're a leader\nYou gotta know haven't have you not seen CNN and Fox yeah you're a leader you got to know you put that kind of stuff out there you're going to be edited\nAbsolutely and boats site edited that it's not you know Fox not showing the second half of that no one showed it\nRight and it's you know you're putting yourself out there making those kinds of statements period at this stage of the game you're going to be portrayed in a certain way\nLook this is where we're at in in we get back to Trump and whether he's wicked clever and planted dean different levels of chess but there's Trump\nDid Trump gold warning begins a DNA test and now she's ... eastern on retarded if that's how any of that all plays out that's one theory that's out there I don't think he's that clever I think he just likes to bump people\nThis theory would be that he's actually pushing the you've heard this story that he's pushing the left to lose their minds and they're they're gravitating to the ... of the world who are\nAbsolutely being as aggressive as they possibly can be without crossing the line and that's only to their detriment I don't think Trump's anywhere near that clever\nI think he just knows if he's in a fight chances are good he's going to come out okay on it and so he picks fights and doesn't think much further than\nI Am I mean look I think that's that's ...\nYou can it's easy to say right now what was he doing in Fifteen and sixteen I mean he wasn't trying to push the left so far that they could you know by lord I agree in the world but that's where some people are saying yeah I mean that's come on I mean the president I I Do think there's times when he's the master marketer\n[laughter] I think that he is the greatest wag the dog president that could ever ever exist and maybe some presidents in the future will take note of that\nBut I don't think that he's that far clever that now he's doing that I think this is just too\nAnd he loves the loves the applause\nPay ...

S. borders and just to get out of Honduras Guatemala and get into Mexico or whatever\nBut anyway be that as it made the president said if the Mexican government does not do something about it and stop these four thousand people\nFrom approaching the U.S border then he's going to go down and close our southern border period with the U.S military\nWell what could it be I mean to me there's only really like two things one is that bold and saying definitively we need the military\nDown there to kick some ass Kelly really arguing over that [noise] so the other is that\nIsn't getting the job done right that they weren't Kelly's coming and going listen your little pets\nSand right but then that might be best be careful with that\nBecause Trump loves him right now and he's the favorite son right now\nAnd there was we're told Trump was sort of like I'm going to give the the ... and then this one bacteria going again on well\nI think that both of them said that it's from what I'm reading that she's not getting the job done and that she should be doing more and that crossings are increasing\nKelly says bowl there not increasing you know it I Know we all know it stats show it and you're putting this on her and that's not right and that's where things went\nCrazy and you know I think they're trying to use that\nThey argue was fixated on a surge in border crossings Kelly saying it's untrue how Bolton criticized Christian\nI mean it seems like an argument between the more ... pragmatic this is what we want to do let's be realistic about what's going on behind closed doors as opposed to what we're potentially saying versus the one percent I've drank the Kool Aid and I'm all in Wayne sort of\nYou're never going to be on the wrong side of Trump if you're just yelling about somebody not getting the job done met isn't you know and that's what ... we're glad you got to be\nOn their rights I this is the conundrum of being Kelly right yeah I think there is it would be fun to be that other guy but you at some point have to keep order and you've got to set policy and you've got to make this thing move and then when you are that guy that's a different\nThing when I feel like John Kelly is one of these guys who um he doesn't live in the abstract he I mean that's just did a military guy and then he he doesn't exaggerate he personally doesn't exaggerate what he believes is fact\nAnd so I got a feeling that you know when they start saying oh they're they're they're increasing and this is our story so that when we go down there with the military to close down the border we've got a story to tell and it looks like John Kelly saying let in what's happening there\nI mean the existential questionnaire and so far as there is such a thing and the Trump White house\nIs Ken Bolton and Kelly coexist over time\nI don't I don't see how they do not John Kelly is still there I got to be honest I I don't know how can the\nPresident our existing for as\nAnd brought up the Christian belles Snow White thing much just by won't name any names but every woman in my life [laughter] had very little time for Kristen Bell in her pompous moms fan [laughter]\nSo [laughter]\nTwice I brought it up through validating rise of al phantom body and in the conversation quickly when I realized this isn't going well and actually did you feel that like over the course of the day I had that conversation because I had it here first\nAnd then I'd do it somebody else here now know about it and it came on the one time were you talking about and I told them as we're walking out and then when I got home I brought up with a couple of different people and\nAs the day went on that was increasingly like screw her yeah I don't want to hear from how it was and I increasingly got softer and my hard stance on her because there was no reception from my audience nobody was helping yeah\nNobody was you know the Sox tonight is going to find interest on that should be I think he's going to throw Jim ... call me crazy [laughter]\nUm can I just can we just take a minute because I'm always blown away by these can we take a minute to talk about the ... story and if I I Love the story is crazy this is really crazy actually\nI'm going I I Am and I'm only going off the fact that there was to attack in twelve hours in the same neighborhood so I'm going to say I think it's the same Fox I mean I'm I'm shocked if all of a sudden you know Fox have are just rebelling it's the resistance in ... for\n... phone either they're talking about an actual physical like an ox we're not talking about Fox friday or rabbits ...\nWe're talking about a far right so the first woman\nOrders ... pond road and the mold ... bucket road map to the to the data there's roads down there anyway so that that gives you if you're familiar with ... gives you kind of a sense of where this all happened okay both attacks happened in that same area\nBut tell me what happened then\nThe one woman I the old open bucking ... road woman's when we're talking right near nor nor well that's like since written all round revealed own embargo thing\nShe opens the back door I think and does it to let her dog out and she sees this Fox in the back yard and cheese and a little concerned for Murphy or I don't let him say the dog's name but so she goes out to try and shoot the fog gay run along you go to school\nBut when she gives them the school to Fox looked stern says you know maybe I'll just take a PC you before I Do when he jumps sir\nYes she goes she opened her garage door to let the dog out and that's when she sees it and she is or coffee at it and everything else and then what should\nThey usually it'll take like three or four steps back then the guys you up and then they'll go they don't want any party you generally ... but he didn't have any interest and leaving quietly and so he jumps or they toss all apparently in some fashion and she finally realize as you know I don't want any part of this she goes into the house but\nWe all know these doors right they have that round cylinder fingernail and as you shot at the things kind of ... and it doesn't shut yet and then it takes a few minutes or a few seconds before it's\nIn those few seconds to Fox says you know what I'm not done with you I'm coming in now and we're going to continue this the Fox goes into her house and takes her down\nYeah this is frightening this is really scary I mean you gotta know something's wrong is fine I mean they got to find this thing and she obviously has to be undergoing are both these women um\nRabies shots immediately and they are not aggressive in that way we have we live next door wetlands have told you this before we all have Fox\nWhile you're well into the Atlantic ocean\nYeah but we have a wet head it's really wet but we are to the side of my house we have a wetlands there and so it's kind of a you know there's a lot of wildlife that living there and we will frequently have Fox and they'll come out they usually come out right at sunset and there'll be in the backyard and sometimes they have their little\nCubs and it's real cute but you don't go out there you know you don't want anything to do with that you feel threatened by that I was just going to say if you open the door though they usually look at you like you said stand there for a second kind of figure out if you're going to hurt them and then they take off never has won aggressively\nNever come at me or you know at one of the kids or anything like that a here's my question\nFor six and seven to six six sixty eight sixty\nI just would love to hear or have you ever been attacked by a why is one thing can be bitten by a dog right but if you ever been aggressively attacked by anything other than a dog I never have thank God I've been\nFace to face with some of these I was close with a ... and\nWe have ... bomb you a couple of times that are close although I was\nParticularly baiting that it'd be that'd be used to let it be known that you are not to be in this area and then I went in there with a TV camera to see if he would attack me and he did multiple times\nOne could say you got attacked by that vote at the the cow but that wasn't an attack that was a hey that's all you know I'll drop you if you give me a reason to that's all that was my favorite moment have you ever had a I like this is scary this is really\nAnd then a couple of hours later another woman down the couple of streets over gets attacked by a Fox and we as soon as the same want to have something was going to be done about it but\nOne time um I ... this is another example of this kind of story but\nThere was a rabid raccoon running around swamp Scott and this raccoon ended up outside one of the grade schools and it was time for the mothers are all lined up to pick the kids up here comes this raccoon so they had to end up you know literally sheltering the kids in place because they couldn't come outside\nAnd one of the mothers they'll get in their cars they call in to tell the the principal and was a teacher comes outside and that raccoon like a TV movie flies up and an attack this teacher\n... and all the mothers are in the car out of the street watching this and this thing attacked this woman and it was rather\nThan so y'all make fun of me all the time because I get parking tickets for living in the city I've never encountered in angry beaver a rabbit raccoon on my way to my ... know that as an end to south and go wherever I\nJust saw your teachers during the promise you couldn't give the cops are good description either because the thing that I'm asking it certainly did that was I Love that one line then 'cause I wanted to say was it was sort of a two part thing one is you know have you ever been attacked by something other than a dog five but also have you ever had an animal in your house that\nDidn't belong there ... okay yeah I've had bats in my house so I think we've all had bats in our house right now but I'm not I'm not down with that statement either we've all at bat and a half and I think that you call at five hundred Joe I wouldn't give you live in the woods you've had bats in your house I don't think yeah I haven't had that I've never ...\nWould have been to New Jersey and it's not even a question where you live\n... said I I I get my our rodents are on the ground in the city thank you yeah well you get that [laughter] so what I'm saying is is that level of I had a pigeon drop down my radically some sort of bird die on bad yes but that's the limit\nHave you ever had anything outside of that and you know like a Fox in your house no lack owning a rather unusual I should say we have awesome and I was\nOnce but it was in the basement not been box for ... like wow that that's a possum and that's not fun to deal with at all the way I Do with it is eight\nThis is why we have older brothers you deal with it yeah and they they did ultimately get them out of there but but that that would be my follow up is if you've ever had an animal other than one that yeah I get that you've had that in your house how what did you do like in our town that I'm a woman
