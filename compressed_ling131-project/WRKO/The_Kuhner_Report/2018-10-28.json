review\nEight hundred seven zero five one two three two you're listening to build Johnson's money wisdom Joel is a certified financial planner and the c._e._o. of Johnson brunette eat the official wealth management partner of the Yukon huskies\nDo let's talk about some major life events that you almost always need to have some financial counseling when you're facing one of the significant events in life or you can explain why first of all a job change why my Batman assessed the tape from financial advice\nThere there's a major change right a job change and this could be\nA vet you retire and you no longer have the job that you that for many years or you just switch from one company to another that is a major change in a lot of people don't look at it as a major change or they sort of sweep it under the rug but that can be a big traumatic event in your life is a fundamental change\nSo you should be assessing when that happens when the job change happens step back and assess am I on track it's a great time to get a new financial plan new analysis run it's a good time to do and do projection\nThe money that you've already saved is that going to be enough to last for the rest of your life or do you need to keep contributing to your ... your savings program\nThat four one K. that you leave a firm that previous job or for all three be if you work for a not for profit or the CSP if you work for the federal government should you roll out over should you roll it over to your new job should you roll it over to an IRA all this needs to be assessed so the things that you should be thinking about is number one\nRedo your financial plan if you have a job change get it up to date number two should you leave the money behind or should you roll it over into a self directed account or even to your new employer that's an individual decision there's not one thing that's right in every single instance\nWhat about health care what are you going to do about health care if there's a gap in coverage or what are you going to do if you have retired again and you're sixty five but your spouse isn't what are they going to do for health care are they covered by president jobs a lot of things to consider here how do you handle a severance if you're getting a severance or a separation package\nIt's really time to sit down and redo your entire financial plan when you have a job change\nRight what about after a divorce what are some of the things you might want to be thinking about from a financial perspective in that situation well this is really a situation\nWhere you need to start over again obviously you're probably going to have some assets you probably might have a piece of property maybe co ownership and a house that used to be to the house for the marriage maybe you end up with one home and the\nThe spouse that you divorced ends up with another home what's gonna happen with the pension we like to get involved before the divorce happened so many times we'll get a referral from an attorney or we'll get a call from somebody saying hey I'm going through a divorce\nWhat are the things that I should be thinking about that is much better than the call afterwards but regardless how has the pension going to be split up\nOr what are we going to do a lot Social Security what are we going to do about any four one K. some people make the mistake of asking for one account leaving the other spouse with the other account and they would have been better off splitting them both down in the middle so\nRegardless if you're going through a divorce we can help you if you just been divorced most of the time you want to leave the financial advisor again most of the time not always but most people leave the financial advisor that the other spouse has and create a new relationship but\nAnother major life of it where you need to be thinking about the financial implications would be receiving an inheritance yes obviously that's a windfall but there are some things you want to be thinking about if you find yourself in that boat\nRight I mean things like do I pay off if I have any debt or if I have a mortgage should I pay that off now that I've got this inheritance\nUm do I want to set money aside for kids and grandkids now maybe I Want to set up a trust for children or grandchildren are people that I Love and put the money into that trust or life insurance into that trust and slowly put some of the inheritance and that trust to pay the premiums\nUm do I want to set up a trust so my spouse skits income for as long as they live but that that money is now sheltered from the claims of creditors so for instance if if I inherit money and I want to make sure Wendy my wife has taken care of she's three years younger than I Am so statistically she'll probably live an extra ten years\nMaybe I Want to put that money for her in a trust\nSo that if she re Mary's or if there's some kind of a lawsuit or credit or judgment or something like that that could come down the pike that inheritance can never be lost her spent due due to a lawsuit are creditors or something like that so an inheritance again like we said with a lot of these things that needs to be a fresh start\nYou start fresh you pretend like you're always had the money and now this is day one let's put together a financial plan with that inheritance and place obviously there's tax issues there is a state tax issues of health care issues and so on it needs to be dealt with bottom\nLine is that if you don't have any good financial coaching already anytime you encounter one of the major life events it's worth getting a review and there are other events that we don't even have time to get to on today's show like the death of a spouse obviously the major event that necessitates\nSome good financial coaching or maybe this doesn't seem major to a lot of people but\nBecoming an empty nester you know you have some opportunities now probably less money being spent on kids at this stage of your life that could be saved and invested behind and you need to close the gap in your retirement savings So Joel if somebody needs to come in after one of these major events\nAnd get an analysis tell us again with that process look like well\nGetting call the number get your customized money map that map will show you where you are today you've told us where
