C. sometime and do you think six sixty eight sixty eight and then you can have an easier for seven zero and I\nAnd my response to to what you were saying before about CNN and this this whole idea that this was something calculated I think it was calculated I Do but I think it was calculated for different reasons not to\nYou know send to the left reeling and he was calculated because I think that the president\nRecognizes that there is a a following to be had\nOr an openness to um\nIdeas that it this would generate or it would certainly give the appearance of\nThe I don't think that the president opened that up thinking that what had happened was going to happen because I don't think he would have opened it up with the cameras like that I just don't I don't think that the president in the end\nThought that was really really great\nBut what happens with Trump over and over again as I I agree I don't well I don't know whether he thought it was really really great and I don't think he knew that that was going to happen but I also think the Trump\nThere's two kinds of people in this world when you give someone something volatile there's those people that say everybody back away won't take it easy let's figure out where you got to your or those people but let's pop the lid on his baby and see what happens and I think obviously Trump is that ladder and he was that yesterday was bought the lid on his baby and see what happens and I think he loves\nThat New York post front page I'm positive Trump wood frame that and put that in his office like I I think he loves our went now part of it is because of the reaction to what the people are acting like\nOh my God they couldn't have happened in the oval office you disgraced it man like that he loves that and I think that will play well for him\n[noise] well see that you describe the oval office I mean I think there are people who don't deserve\nUm a meeting face to face with the president I mean I don't I don't think that everybody in the world has to get that I've said that a million times I thought that when when he was president elect and he was seeing all those people at Trump Tower is like ... he doesn't have to let everybody in the world coming\nAnd feel like they they they need to be there and be represented I mean the president\nThat's always been true though right like that's throughout his like Elvis doesn't need to make\nRight I mean I I don't that's how it goes yeah\nI mean I I remember when Don King and you know I mean there was all these people that were marching through the front door and I'm like the president really doesn't have to do that [noise]\nUm and there are some people Louis Farrakhan there was you know we need a bunch of that ... they don't belong there ... I don't really think that our president has to meet with some people who I think have been have been no wrong for our nation for other people but having said that\nTiny west isn't one of those people that's not what I'm saying I just don't know\nI don't know why the president thought it was gonna I don't know what kind of a west has said or done in the past it led the president to believe that it was going to go really smoothly and articulate Lee and it was going to\nBe something for the ages it was something for the ages but I'm not for the reasons that I I Would have thought\nTrump just wants to show he just wants ratings and he got them yes but I that's that's it when huge love it do it again\nAnd he again you'd think if the market doesn't have a few more days like this guy news not back next week like\nBecause they're not talking about the market down Thirteen hundred points in through the ... talking about gun you they're not talking about written questions to Robert Mueller not that we would anyway because people are tired of it but\nWhatever it is that we're not talking about he's fine with that because we're talking about this like this he's happy I'm positive that he's thrilled with out this way for the economy is the one I don't know like\nHow how does this work for him yeah you put on his big show and looked at me and you gave your speech and you had your good lines but what does it do for him overall I don't know\n\nLooking back behind me because on Fox here there are they are is that what they're talking about right now\nYeah west students by Trump's support despite backlash and they had those two ladies are on the Internet stars Simon and ...\n[noise] I don't know I I I'm sure you're right about that I'm sure the president did\nLove it and because he just he does all of a spectacle and he loves that Kanye West\nLoves him so maybe it'll play well I don't know I guess we'll see huh [laughter] it just it was very uncomfortable for me very very uncomfortable I'm uncomfortable with anybody who\nWho's thought pattern is jumping around the way his allies and needed to stop and he wouldn't stop and\nBut I mean I'm uncomfortable with anybody who over speaks quite frankly like that I mean I remember I was uncomfortable\nWhen the president had that day meeting with a\nParent's or after the shooting in Florida and the one of the fathers got up and he just kept going and going and going and I was like you made your ... your there you've got it done that's could sit down don't please stop please stop because I think the more people talk usually they\nMake a mistake along the way so it was just uncomfortable for me let me go to Charlie he's a ... good morning\nMorning go on and uh my take on it was\nWe had Jim Brown was the end and Tanya was the anger that a representation there and\nI feel that in June browsing authentic crusader for black right so he put some credence into that and I feel ...\nAre going to break the back to the Democratic party because there are\nPeople that a lot of the black people look up to\nAnd they're opening their eyes and just saying you know what what they're saying is right reality is connecting tool\nAnd in that reality is jobs are coming back which is what they want for the country Trump in no question about it in his fanfare and a con you out of control at times he was raised without\nA father and he had a tough life has not had died young so he's kind of a wild guy but his intentions and Trump's intentions I think a genuine and wanting this country to get back\nIn ... solid financially and to help American citizens have a functional lights that they can be proud of and not have to go out and Rob to survive I really think that's so true and I think that's a shame woman is going to break the back to the Democratic party who ... likes keeping them dependent that's my opinion\nI I'll give Charlie some credit here in that he said he didn't\nLove all the ... said because I was surprised by that I thought Charlie would be and that's to your credit Charlie I thought that you would be just all and it was awesome it was great\nI one of the things that people as always happens with Trump is there's risks to everything he does for both ... both right ... right the far left yesterday will get the Don lemon I'm a second but the ... to me was just crazily over the top but the far rights like Tucker Carlson talking about a point you know it was and how\nWould we know full well that the people that are saying that we're the ones that are screamed about every rapper that Obama brought that uh well\nWe've got somebody right now ... says so Kim should be ... met with Obama I first off I didn't say that that he shouldn't meet there and I didn't my point was I don't know why we had to put it on live on television when the guy is a loose cannon that's the part that was uncomfortable for me\nAnd invisible [noise]\nI Love the first ... the second one I was all over the boys\nHumans or even the president like the fine wine when we went out as a yeah new like on our on our balance could make your own\nTwo three three nine says I'm Trump is having a young black Americans conference at the White House in two weeks three hundred will be attending is trying to do something\nI think that's great okay that I think that's terrific\nUh he should be having that I think that's terrific I it's not the calving Kanye West people are trying to say well do you what did you think would Jaycee having Kanye West to the White House is not the issue\nThe issue is is just that it they\nThey open it up and let him just go on and on and on and I don't know how well that vote for either side and I think it will hurt the president a lot less than it may hurt Kanye West and I think there are fewer I'm African Americans out there who think that was a really positive thing for African Americans\nI think that probably this event in two weeks will be much more positive thing than having Kanye West they're ranting and raving in the in the oval office on camera\nA boat lark I I've always tried to hold the McCain philosophy of don't get caught up in the noise here get caught up in what actually is dawn yesterday was one hundred percent noise absolutely and we are just running wild women we meaning the country like we\nWere all fallen prey to this because this is what we want we want yesterday to a tea and we got it and we we love that had happened and we hate ourselves for loving it\nThat's how it is he is in Boston morning stave\nGood morning Kim good morning they listen to a U.S mentioned that he would vote you know something about the rest of the black caucus they want me with him in the white\nIf he and Dr budget out and then they wouldn't have made him\nIn the wild they don't make I make all of our wages so when you like the black man who is crazy I guess that you know being a multi billionaire and make a decision like you just with the Adidas thing is is crazy\nYou know Jim says you invite crazy people to the White House should get crazy well\nIf he's if that guy is crazy listen give me crazy all day long I'd like to live with him I I ... I mean I'm I I talk like he talks a lot of times I get crazy I don't know it was because I lost my dad when I was a teenager and I had to go by myself I maybe that it sounds to me being crazy but\nYou know it it is it the black part came up the crazy but you didn't live in the White House I don't understand\nIt either that or it's got nothing to do with him being black that's for sure people\nIt's the people's house in in Trump is invited people that never been inside the White House than any other president I think you know ... it's not so to me for tropic autism is impressive for him to be in the White House 'cause he's been in\nAnd probably nicer places or his whole life because he's he's a rich guy and he's he's got a nice safe maybe cognac growing up didn't have\nI Know we didn't have brought up but now you know for him to be in the White House in Jim Brown there it might have been more impressive that they were there because it's it's the people's house and I I I just don't understand how you know one side says he's crazy they shouldn't have had 'em there because of the way ... I I I talk that way\nAnd most of the time I get in a conversation that I could eat it I thought that way I I I don't know if I'm Crazy maybe some people would say I am but\nI I don't get how one side of the political ... to ... a few years ago he should run for the president because he was so smart you know he was awful black people and he's going to help the black community and because he's in the White House with Donald Trump it is I think he's an idiot\nI I don't think anybody ever thought Kanye West you know an for only person that ever want to NATO run was called ... right now on on the left as ever looking for him to run for president we've known he's crazy for a long time\nWell again his point\nLike CNN just got a whole segment\nOn how crazy ... and of course there are just more good into but one time you did yesterday with Trump does a lot there go Trump is also crazy I don't think that plays well for them and what he's crazy\nIt was crazy amount of ... I've never seen anything like that before but but Steve's point is that it's crazy but the guy laughing all the way to the bank so ... where are we in twenty twenty or twenty eight team\nI don't think he's laughing not farther back because I think his last album is selling exactly nothing because of this whole dog and pony show and\nThat I don't that's why I keep telling you what the question you'd ask on ... crazy or is this crazy like a Fox he clearly has made a calculation that I'm going to own this I'm going to be all in on this and this is how I'm going to do it I'm positive when that thing was over yesterday he thought\nMan that couldn't have gone better I don't know I don't know how to I'm not in that world I don't I don't know how this works I don't know if this is good for him or not\nWell I think that ... and I'm not going I Can't\nSpeak for the African American community and if you are out there and you want to call please do\nLove to hear from you I'm but I think there are other people who could speak more eloquently and probably will in two weeks about the issues facing the African American community and people would rather have seen them there\nWith that opportunity to sit straight across the desk from the president in the oval office and speak their minds I I just believe that's true\nI think that the fact that he was throwing F bombs and and you know acting crazy is not really a represent representation that\nThe African American community or\nA anybody under the age of thirty or forty or what that that's not the representation that they necessarily wanted there at the White House that that would be my issue it's not that the president invited him they're gonna do with the president at all quite frankly I I felt bad when it all\nStarted to unwind because I don't think that's exactly what the president was hoping for\nI think they wanted to be able to go any any is but I mean I think he wanted to go see their look at this guy he's helping me understand the president's response was wow that was something\nThe president wanted the photo op what she got yes the cherry on top for him or the bonus is that he kind of want to you talking about it yesterday or today about what happened\nYesterday but we're talking about it a thousand fold and that's why he's like I think that what even better than I could imagine because it went somewhere I didn't always come in and that's all fine and the ... what gets me I don't want to sound to preach you on this but the people that have a\nVisceral like oh my God all is lost or that's such a disgrace to what to the oval office or any of that conversation\nIt's just\nA twenty Eighteen world we're living in you can't you can't do that you your yours bonds can't be that nutty because this was nothing nothing\nThere's nothing to this at all zero nothing substantive at all it's all a show yeah I think I think most people just want or just like oh yeah yeah\nBut actually they they shouldn't because isn't that unfortunate that\nDoes no yeah it is why because this is all about how about we get something done\nBy birth really are we going to do that yeah I Am so they're not sending people\nDown to Florida and it's okay no no I'm Talking about with\nBut things are getting up is what we're saying they're getting up\nSo I Can't do both have to walk and chew gum at the same time as Obama showing me after so much time\nIt was ten minutes\nWas ten minutes\nIt wasn't ten minutes by the way he was with him for lunch\n... you're only talking about wait a minute point\nIs if you want to move forward with with a minority relations why not give that ten minutes to somebody who could maybe moving forward that's the whole\nPoint of having it instead of just saying wow this is so cool because we got him to talk about is how we talk about something but you can do both I don't think they did yesterday well what happened about ...

and then they talked about five minutes but then to but we're not gonna ... we're not going to diagnose this or talk about it or break it down because it's just so\nGreat so would they put them on

think they should\nI'm surprised he's not on Fox It's MORNING but I assume that's by his choice for whatever reason I don't know I don't know\nI maybe some of them think that uh as\nYou heard from Don

you good thank you sir I'm\nOne what I'm not a fan of Kanye West and he said some pretty horrible things in public in the past but what I saw yesterday with a guy who was speaking from the heart with

can get the ear of the president to push through prison reform because this country we have\nWay too many men in prison some of them obviously deserve to be there some of 'em just end up there for for

hours was Michelle Obama when she called out Eric Holder on his comments about when Republicans go low we kick him I'm really fed up with this political climate in this country right now\n... you know but the the interesting thing on that is that Eric Holder's response to Utah directly was to get over yourself and died I'm fascinated by this because\nWe didn't get what did he say exactly\nGet over

I didn't play it yesterday because\nI think what I think we know a hundred percent of us are going to have Tom's reaction to that clip and there's there's almost no discussion to be had there because we all agree\nSeventy one says uh chemicals it bodes very well for him among his cell worldwide fans\nI I I think we have to see that I don't know I I I'm not sure where you're at the information comes from I don't know if that's true nine seven eight says I'm ... I just want what's best for the country five one aide says mental health and sexuality should be off limits\nKnow but then why are they on the show was using that [noise]\nWell I think number one that show is directed at a very different audience than other day part\n[noise] um and I think they're looking to I mean I think Don Lemon is on that show to relate to a different audience\nI mean why I Want to eat on areas when ... says fill the brawn James shut up and dribble shoes were told that dog whistle racism\nAnd I think there there's the issue there and that's to be discussed and we did discuss it when these guys do Kanye that he's this is what happens when African Americans I'll say not the word that they don't read\nMhm but the difference is again a she was a white woman who said that and I'm here to tell you that if Wolf Blitzer said what Don Lemon sat on his show that same day with a panel I don't care how\nYou know diverse the panel would have been Wolf Blitzer would be in a ... heap of trouble\nI eat that trouble I Know I just feel like at some point we've got to somehow\nClearly define or get clear defined on this stuff than we are now and it's not up to Don Lemon that's aside I wouldn't\nThink I think it would be the network that has to say here's where we are going to push stuffing years we're we're not I mean if Conyers on and he goes there fine but we're not going to drive that discussion ourselves I Would think but they maybe they have enough faith and trust and Don Lemon that they they done you go where you go\nWell and I think he hasn't a following ... ... again following of the audience that they're specifically looking for their um I I you know and I think it's it's safe\nAs to the merits of the argument and as a comment of you know this is what happens when you don't read\nI I just will tell these people that use lines like that all the time and it's back to the Hillary deplorable thing if you don't get that there's a large people large amount of people in the country that are rejecting that kind of leaders them and being\nHave that pushed in your face you're missing what's been going on for three years and they keep doing it you got to get away from that that's why I think older\nA lot smarter than you think that he isn't doing that\nHe's like but I didn't work and we got to try something different because it isn't working and that's why every right person on Twitter imaginable ... dead tweeted that clip the second that have happened\nBecause this plays well to the right if you're going to get back to what Mitch McConnell said they figured out how to do what we hadn't figured out which is to galvanize our base it's things like that that do it\n... you got to be careful with this stuff I think and I just kind of thing\nCould be another one of those where if you're going to scream that loud and go mental health because he doesn't agree with us\nYou got to be careful\nAgain I don't think anyone screaming mental health because he doesn't agree with I we're screening metal held him if he's had mental health issues for years and his wife has said he's office medication I think that that's the right putting that on the left your screaming about that because you don't want anything he's crazy because he likes Trump's yeah it's two separate I just turn on line and collect strong\nRight they're not to separate necessarily Don Lemon just said I ... I had to turn off the TV because of what I saw these crazy he didn't say he's historically been crazy that may be true\nI think I think I didn't I done lemons for me what Don lemons point there is is that he's being exploited\nNot because of how he necessarily his viewpoint but that he isn't ... did you eat the exploitation would be the fact that he was allowed to just be in front of a Mike and just go and the guys cussing I mean that doesn't look good that makes you look like you're out of control\nI mean that would be where if I was gonna say what yesterday was exploitation that would be the part of it for me\nI I stand by what I said before I don't think he's crazy because he likes the president\nI don't think that at all I I think that's his prerogative I think he's been clear about that too for a long time by the way that didn't just happen you know in the last\nTwo weeks he ... he he's love this guy from the get go and that's fine that's that's where he said I just think\nHe did\nOpen letting him in front of an open Mike me prove that one's life\n... life got to the very end and they they were all outraged by it because that was not in the script that was not planned at the credits are rolling and he just grabs that Mike and he just starts going and they were just like what are you doing we don't let anybody do that\nDo more and Michael Sable they handled poorly didn't wasn't that his new thing earlier this week and whether he did or didn't is open for discussion but\nWhether that makes him crazy I I like I don't know the guy I cannot value or whether it was crazy and just because his love some of his loved ones favor these crazy maybe is maybe isn't I don't know I I didn't love the thing I yeah I don't think it was nearly as tight as it should have been for starters I don't think it was it scripted and needed to be and\nI think at times he thought he could just free flow in bringing altogether and he wasn't able to do that\nBut I Do think he was performing yesterday and then performance I rarely go crazy I just hope that failed performance or good performance I just thought this was a performance\nI'm not going to deny the fact that I think the Kanye West is a smart guy I think he is is I think he's much more cerebral person\nThan one might get the impression right off the bat\nI don't I don't know I I stand by what I said earlier in the week I don't know how well informed tea is about certain issues that he wants to get involved in I think he needs to be pretty careful there and that also sort of\nYou know paint him as crazy because he started saying things that I'm not sure he's that form I think he's informed about what he believes the president has done for the country\nAnd I think that's that's perfectly fair but I think\nHe would have done himself ... a world of good if each that reigned in that's what made him look like he was crazy [laughter]\nBut that's what you said about Trump for two years right and that and I even heard of them and I don't know at ... again what does it was there was a dragging energy or something like oh yeah they have dragging energy he was like\nA year we go full throttle trumps the only one I Know that that's worked for and others are tried it and has failed Marco Rubio for example and although actually know Graham it worked for Lindsey Graham last week so maybe maybe it is catching on but ... legitimately was like I'm going to do my best Trump yesterday and does that work for him enough\nWell the thing about like comparing it to Lindsey Graham and again that's not the same thing for me I mean people do have moments of\nOutrage and they burst out and they go but again Lindsey Graham you know I'm not defending necessarily what he did but he knew what his mission was he went from point a to point B and he got there I felt like you know yesterday\nI couldn't decide of ... I just thought\nI only got so much time and I got to get every subject I've ever thought it came off like a like a a crazy fan who's like oh my God this is the only time I've ever going to see this person so we've got to get every single but that I've ever thought about them out in his couple of seconds and it just went off the rails\nWhy why I ultimately I'm fine with Don Lemon using that phrase about the show and saying it is because I think there is a historical context to the point that he was making whether you liked that point or not is debatable but that makes the point what's weird about\nI think Lindsey Graham and Kanye West or did the same\nThey were both performing they were performing for an audience of one and as Don Lemon would put it they were performing in front of an audience of white men\nLindsey Graham was doing the exact same thing but he doesn't use that phrase would Lindsey Graham for obvious reasons and there isn't a phrase for what Lindsey Graham was doing but they did the exact same thing the trouble with Tanya is your audience of one was across from you in that room but your audience one should have been at home\nAnd she's not real happy with you and so that's where I think he might have missed the mark Lindsey Graham doesn't have that issue he's only answer and the Trump and that's why he\nDid he have a grim didn't talk about sports team different subjects in that short and talked about\nZero he just yelled Wow Did and he yelled so the Trump would see that\nHe thought he was yelling about the fact that he thought that the other side was treating this man unfairly I mean I\nThat's just a ... that's that is this a little way that you know just yesterday that was just rent don't even know if the ranks of France it'd be negative whether it's a ... he was in Iran he ... he was he was like he was a rabid\nFan who only had so many minutes to get in what he wanted to there is the reason the phrase that's ... has been around for years it it said was you know like I said yes bingo\nUh seven fifty nine O W our cat [noise]\nVoice of Boston New York about one hundred and twenty seven to UCLA HD to Boston and I are radio station [noise] Michael reach our area good morning\nI'm Nick phobia W.

R. I. ABC has this big millennia Trump\nInterview coming up tonight [noise] and\nI'm actually really looking forward to this she didn't put any parameters on this and it looks like she was asked a lot of really tough questions and so far as they sort of leaked out some of the answers I'm just I'm a huge millennia Trump than any way and I'm just like in her more and more\nYeah I feel like this is going to be proved to be a good decision\nBy her ... ... a\nCovers a lot of issues they they've promoted as well I thought they made a big mistake by sitting on this thing for a week a publisher to run this on Monday or Sunday bought they've promoted and well and I think they've done better than I thought they were going to do because I still am interested in total late so I'll record it not watch it when it happens\nThey've teased enough about the jacket may know enough to not have to answer or just smart yeah but the ... been pretty good I've been pretty interested in for starters they make a point of saying we asked her about her husband's alleged infidelity and what does that do for you\n\n[laughter] and they need to be said we need to support them and you know also men not just the men\nDo you think man in in the news that I've been accused of a sexual assault sexual harassment had been treated unfairly\nYou need to have a really hide as he does that you know if you all kinds of something so that evidence selling albums\nSo that's the original one out of ... right through sort of came with and that's the one that sort of all of them that's the one that's the most like me [noise]\n[noise] yeah well I mean she\n... they asked her if she's with the kids to share the back of the women and to me too movement and her response was and I think a response originally was well I Do but women have to come forward with evidence you can't just accuse people um you know which I\nMean I understand exactly where she's coming from there I mean I don't like this idea of the just there's just accusations and there's no evidence at all that does it make someone guilty just because it's used them [noise] but um I\nI we were more specifically this morning the ABC released the question about um her the alleged affairs and that the president has had and her response to it I thought was excellent and I don't know maybe marina doesn't have that one because it did just happen I don't have a okay so she says quote\nI'm a mother and a first lady and I have much more important things to think about and to do it's not a concern and focus on\nLet me tell you why I like that that answer [noise] um because I don't\nI appreciate the fact that she didn't say all those women are lying and it's not true because I think she knows it it is true and I appreciate the fact that you didn't take us really into her marriage because really that's not our business as Americans it's\nNot really our ... our business not really he's the head of the sanctity of marriage party it is absolutely our business that he cheats on his wife no it's not our business what their relationship is now that's my point\nMy point is it's not our business to be in the middle of ... and Donald Trump's marriage\nIf she wants to stay and be the first lady that's her right she doesn't have to explain to us how she feels about him or how she feels about their marriage I really don't think she does and some day I think she will but she doesn't have to him cheating that's a whole different thing that's different for me\nBut she doesn't we don't oh she doesn't owe us that show her answer was not I'm not focusing on that focuses on job at hand which is being a mother\nAnd being the first lady [noise]\nMy thing with it is that there's always been this thing with Milan and which is that the issue involved at all or not at all it does she get it did she know how to do this stuff like we've got to protect them all on and so she doesn't make a fool of herself that was sort of a vibe you cut out of the convention\nWhere she gave that speech you know very well done great and I know this isn't your cup of tea but you did great and then the next day was oh you're plagiarize of\nThing and so we got to protect her the\nVibe I'm getting from this interview is that she is much more savvy than\nYou might think and that answer is pretty savvy yeah because\nShe gives a straightforward answer without offering too much of an opinion or the or getting into the weeds which is where they could easily go on and maybe there's a follow up here and we haven't heard it yet or whatever\nBut look\nI have much more important things to do that's always a cop out answer to anything because I Know your marriage should be one of the most important things in your life and you've got to work at it and all that but it's it's when you see the clip it's the way that\nShe\nYou can tell she's searching for an answer to answer the question without getting into it and she comes up with that and for me it's fine because I Am a Laker\nSo well I don't I don't want I hate and we have seen it [laughter] we've seen it in the past I hate these first ladies I hate these situations where these first ladies

drove by this morning in North Andover drove by charmer grill\nThere still close they were hoping when we spoke to him ... two weeks ago\nThat they were hoping to be open within the week\nAnd that was two weeks ago is still closed and a meat cheese and LOU LOU ... to pizza places\nRight around that same area still closed and they really have no word even driving for me driving into they a lot of the the side roads offer one twenty five all being torn up right now all closed so it it's just a terrible time in in this area and even in Andover\nI uh I spoke with ... and I told these folks would keep them in our you know our thoughts and our prayers to get back open because it's it's tough yeah they're still paying their rent there still paying you know their insurance is they're still paying the electric bill\nBut no revenue was coming in and you know they're they're afraid they're gonna lose employees and of course longtime business at this point but farmers in Andover closed elm square in ... right there in right around twenty eight still closed a sauces which is kind of like wings at a burger place in Andover\nThey're open but they're cooking with the electric instead of gas so they don't have their full menu but they got most of it open grass field down the street on route twenty eight and Andover\nThey switched over they switched over to like propane\nAnd they've been able to reopen a Boston charter company in North Andover open but kind of like getting by with what they have limited menu\nOr end in a large part those pizza I Know was closed it just goes on and on and I'm just not seeing not hearing any good words that all out there you know\nAnd here we are twenty nine days into it yeah you know it's really really difficult for these folks but it it I I Wish there was some words I Wish there was a better communication going on between Columbia gas and these restaurants in these businesses up here are because they are suffering and that these are just businesses\nNever mind the residents that have no gas to heat their house Mm\n[noise] well I guess what we have to hope is that these places can get open again so people can go and frequent them and

when people go in\nRight away you know if you listen to be on the south shore as soon as these restaurants open you hear me announce it go in and they need your business right away to get back on their feet and and all their employees need the help too 'cause a lot of them all lost a lot of revenue up I'm not working I Know Columbia gas is set up some stations we'd go in collect damages\nBut
