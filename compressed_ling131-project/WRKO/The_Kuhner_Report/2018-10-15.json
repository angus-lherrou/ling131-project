point is people get over it\nIn that he got elected ... people just moved it they they kept moving on and I think that she could have said look I'm not talking about this any more I'm done and\nPeople would have moved on it's a damned if you do damned if you don't if she never does this than it's forever Trump did it I'll give you a million bucks you if you take one by the way that you're going to cash that and now I Would if\nI were I was actually ... million bucks she took it\nBut that's one if she didn't do it is for ever going to be well why would you take a test then when she takes the test and it's is murky as the story was it doesn't really boat that well for in my opinion she's trying to play ... look to her credit she's trying\nTo play it like it's a win in the global certainly playing along CNN is not playing and they're like wow what does this all about why\nToday John ... to ten time to why now why Mm clearly she's running for president has what their inferring and she clearly\nThings whether it's her or someone else that told her that she had to do this if she's going to run you didn't have to that's the mistake that she made I think she did not have to my point being\nThere's things that these candidates have now decided their president has been saying oh I I'm not going to do it\nOne of my conservative buddies just said look this was a big mistake by her because it will never and now I I agree I never was going to end anyway is what I Would tell him and like she did\nHer hope was that it was just in Italy one thirty second right\nShe was always going to say my ... writes a edited it all they you know I'm telling you what I find on usually if you're gonna do this on the cutie\nIf the results come back murky maybe you don't maybe you keep 'em yeah she released it today because they poll came out over the weekend that has Joe Biden at thirty percent and her at eight and now she's the lead story on\nBoth news networks this morning that is true but I did it in the end that as I still don't think this is going to bode well for her I don't think there's going to be a positive thing\nWhy not release it after you reelected if indeed you are reelected do why why wait why not wait until ...\nBecause this is the first question first debate because again if one thing Donald Trump has shown you it doesn't matter whether they're talking good or bad ... talking about you you win that made us maybe trim may be true that will say Pennsylvania guys thanks when did the calm\nOr if I'm going to get eight I'm going to be going big bravado and

I Know here we go again right All right a couple of points to touch on is Ninety bases Kim I'm going to try to get three OK okay\nWe're taking our eye off the ball here with all the foreign do you think I really care that American citizen whether or not she has Indian blood and there I don't care the reality is okay\nShe's crazy leftist socialist in the constitutional list though gets smoked by Trump in twenty twenty okay there's point on\nNumber two Elizabeth I don't care if she's Indian or not I don't care Elizabeth Warren is a fraud\nOkay by it in the Democratic party gym you know I Love your brother but the Democratic party right now is a disaster they have no shot and twenty twenty was closing on this Kim she's a great example\nOf what the forefathers warn us about when they said domestic enemies of the constitution okay she's a disaster and she won't be elected\nI think it was with worn and Scott both agree that no one should care whether or not she isn't [laughter]\nYeah right right right film score sort\nOf thought he had them I Try to get it it's okay though at least ... out of ... and I'm proud of him that he said three points to get his three points out and I do appreciate the second point we're sort of part of the first yeah I mean I don't\nKnow if I'd give 'em a double I'm not one but they you know what I don't why you wouldn't care though not again with the usual always has been has she benefited from fake information well and again so that\nFor me it's less about whether she's a Native American or not it's more about an and I agree with you on that and it's more about how she told the truth or not did she did she make something up to to a benefit herself\nI don't care if it was it that she Native American I don't care if she you know said that one I is blue and the other is purple whatever it was has she been deception\nAnd now you if if if you've gotten these results back and you know that six generations to generations back there ... there was a Native American in her blood line now you have to decide so wishy deceptive or not\nIn my estimation the answer is yes because to put anything if in fact she did put anything on any kind of application and say she's a minority means that she is a minority which means uh a much bigger percentage\nOf what you're saying she did she says she didn't do that I mean I Believe in her website right now she says I've got my personnel file here I have interviews with every person that recruited and hired me all of them said they did not know anything about my heritage\nThat is what she's saying\nI don't but we always get back to the same Harvard thing where they put after they hired her they put her out as a minority and she is quoted as saying I Can't wait to have breakfast with my people like more what\nWhere did that come from right where would that have been why would you why would you have said that to them but not I have told them when you were trying to get the job that makes no sense\nWell and you would have had that that came up looking at an application\nAnd whenever you're because you didn't look at her and go while the U.S charities you know she doesn't say\nGeez I you know I have some Native American idol want Harvard to know about this I Want to get the get go okay now that you've hired me based solely on my credentials now I Want you to know that you think that makes no sense when our who do\nWay between now and and debating Donald Trump cheese is gonna be a lot of candidates and a whole lot of people who stand there way that's why she doesn't like the idea that right now she's at eight\nWell I'm Still at the use of all run because there are Deval andme lose Warren going around both maybe\nThat's kinda weird how would that play too I mean you're splitting that then are true and I neither of them when I ...\nI thought at some point they were going to have dinner together and it was going to be decided by others\n... bomber for example this is where we'd like to run and it was going to be double which apparently definitely running it would certainly appear\nRight I Would argue that she can devolve have a few things that are very different\nSome of them are pretty ... an impressive [laughter] that would be one um I think she's I mean I think she comes from a part of the party that's really far left match that I think he's quite so far left me and he's progressive but not like she is is there\nAny way I mean like one percent and I think one one hundred and fifty cents or whatever is there any way that she does this but it isn't running for president\nWell I think she can still be testing the waters and maybe what it is what is her biggest test let's see how people react\nTo is there any way she would have done this if she wasn't running for or at least testing the waters thinking very seriously about it as she's already told us but if she was just running for reelection for Senate in she's not running for president average you know deep down she doesn't want to be president ... ever take the DNA tell\nNo she doesn't know if she doesn't need to write she's gonna she's going to get reelected in this day and she knows that she is\nYeah that's why I'm I'm fascinated with it because if I'm sitting whether\nIf the answer is no I never take this if I'm not running then why are you taking it now why\nDid you is don't absolutely have don't have to answer this show already set a week ago she's considering running no I Know yeah but\n... about them to want to get into his why why why in the ... it's all all the same question but why how and why an hour the three questions that are asked year but why is always like well why do you feel the need to give them what they wanted here\n... ... well again I just think this is a this is her ultimate test and I think what she's trying to see if I put this out there\nWill this issue go away because this issue of not being truthful or could be one that stands in my way especially when you've got Joe Biden with thirty one percent\nThirty one percent of the polls not thirty one percent Indian blood right we don't know what his\nThirty one percent support well let's also remember it's two thousand and Eighteen I mean how much do these polls really mean right now\nWhat is Trump gonna tweet on this uh gone is fine but what is it going to say she is a fake like I said she was yes\nI Am and then I hold her next week that she puts out is I took the test I and you owe me a million bucks\nYeah he's going to be careful 'cause it's possible she's playing a mirror she's setting them up or something but my guess is his initial tweet is that she's a fake like us\nDid she was and I hope to God she runs I assume that's what he says\n... let me go to Barbara represent Bradford good morning Barbara\nHey there you know I have something in common with Elizabeth wind because of my family we have high cheekbones show and we have long said that we have an ... but I never once thought to check off that little box on the employment application or submit a recipe to my company minority a recipe book\nTo pretend that I'm In India and like ... lean on that Indian heritage that what will make you have and um you know I think you said a few minutes ago that it didn't matter that people might view it as her still stealing what is\nIntended to be a box on the application that's intended to capture minority information because there are disadvantaged and they need to be a made whole as part of the employment process and yet she stole that from a minority when she check that box and I know are they\nThey're never going to admit to what she put on that application than our clients you but you know the fact that\nNot only did she possibly ... we're all night and if we all start checking off every little thing that we might have not passed that those applications become useless and um and the fact that she\nWent and turned into a recipe to the minority the Indian recipe book club I hardly that shows you that she was leaning on it because I looked up whether or not hardly ever\nPut that application out and um you know be on this story the other thing that really bothers me is she is very very left wing socialist candidate and when I think of her four hundred thousand dollar salary\nAnd\nThe fact that she wants us to waive when she was a teacher and she wants us to have the tuition paid for the tuition about the students doesn't that tell you something like that I mean she\nShe that's the way too far left and she is failing from minority whip advantages are intended to be\nBarbara you've made up their mind long ago on her in on this issue and there's nothing here than just changed anything for you and that's how I was gonna only thing she said um\nI only know a recipe in the pouch our dream on average did a Harvard put out a thing I I only need a really ugly they not only knew about Palau chow what she did they do what they are a lot of I don't I don't think that had anything to do with her and I didn't think it did anyway I think what she\nDoes I think you know Harvard is where she just said that she was looking forward to having breakfast with\nPeople like her and they were having a minority breakfast in\nTown all look out for our show and see what its origins worry for different was Harvard really and I my memory wasn't it wasn't but maybe it was ... you wrote them and let me go to Steve in Boston Good morning Steve\nFrom wanting to come on and gravy listen that lady was a very intelligent woman listen\nShe started out in Oklahoma buying real estate with a brother to foreclosures this is how she started as far as I also don't I mean don't take everything with a grain of salt and have Jim started screaming at me that that I'm wrong but she started out\nBy and property what their brother foreclosure property now she's fought for housing and wants to give taxpayer money to board a lousy did she ever once every once in all those houses that you bought with their brother out of foreclosure goes to people couldn't afford it\nDid she ever give any of them people their house back out and try to get the outback\nNo then she goes into law now she can't practice Lauren any state because she doesn't have a law license ... chicken chicken teach law but she doesn't have a ... practice law which is another thing altogether then she ... she started a the only thing that you could ask a liberal about what did she ever do for a people\nThe big claim to fame as she started the credit protection agency the credit\nBureau protection agency which a rock Obama wouldn't let her one because she would've never pass the Senate confirmation hearings because\nMaybe because of our past and she said it wasn't going to become another big government bureaucracy yet the first year they were in business they spent thirty five million dollars\n... renovating a building that was only worth twenty five million dollars and it wasn't even this is even on it so this woman is brilliant I mean she's she's brilliant everybody should run out and vote for her because she's brave and can you just said there's nobody gonna beat her\nI think Jeff they'll get a good shot a beating her because people are sick and die or nonsense you can you know she's the female Donald Trump as far as I'm concerned ... she gets out there and screams about not that she talks about people just as bad as he does\nThat no different than two peas in a pod and I I wouldn't vote for it but I voted for Donald Trump because I was tired of listening to people tell me\nWise and and and they were going to do stuff when they got an office and they didn't do it in my taxes kept going up health insurance kept going up so I voted for Donald Trump just see if if things would change and they have changed\nSo I mean look I think they are very similar and I\nAre doing this is again there's a reason why she mentioned him directly in the video\nHey he apparently doesn't get under his skin and be she's going right at him and so they're just of course therapies in a pod yes the question is does she get she pull off what he often does with this type of stuff or does this become sort of an Obama birth certificate thing for her where\nTrump did that but it doesn't really look great on him for a lot of people and ask this play that way will see seven fifty nine O W weren't camp [noise]\nThe voice of Boston you walk working over one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station\nInterview the morning\nI'm Nick ... W. R. K. O. news President Trump is leaving some Americans with more questions than answers after his sixty minutes interview aired last night my powder reports\nDuring his sixty minutes appearance last night President Trump defied climate scientists intelligence specialists and even his own defense secretary\nWhile denying climate change Trump claimed that they dispute the science despite clarity from intelligence agencies the president claims that China is not only interfering in the twenty Eighteen election but now claims they interfered and twenty sixteen as well and when asked the defense secretary James Mattis told him that NATO's purpose was to prevent another world war\nThat sort of seems like a oh All right a bowling alley\nShort one question for you all is that you know it's there

R. K. L.\nOne morning I'm done for now with our Elizabeth Warren yeah I've been to I I thought this we use this phrase early but I'll give it to you from someone you might like more but Jonathan Martin who is a political writer for the New York times political correspondent\nShe didn't just she Elizabeth Warren didn't just do a DNA test she went home to Oklahoma to put her conservative leaning family on camera and have them push back at the ... attack this isn't I'm running it's I'm running and I won't\nBe swift boating yeah no I ... I think that's\nOne hundred percent what this is my question always with this this morning his bend is is that going to work\n\nIf if the CNN Fox and friends is any indication yes it is going to work I see an end planet all day in boxes and touching it Fox is acting like this is a big win for war and it is really weird to\nMe well so uh for one Texan and says\nAt six generations back it would be one point five six percent Native American attend generations back I don't know if their math is right but just the idea here it would be pointing zero nine seven percent is that enough to check the box\nWell that's the question that is a question period\nLike what you're saying she didn't check the boss she is\nSaying that you have you have the right side of your suspicions I write I this is a big strong moved to say you're not going to have me on the defensive any more about this but for me I to me this\nThing confirms everything that I've thought which is that you've got the most sketchy of stories and there's no reason anyone by the time they become an adult would still be clinging to that what you did do and you did actively participate in a couple of times\nRegardless so for me I Would if I was boxing friends I Would have walked into the into bullets run with this or at least once on our they're not touching it ... strange\nIt is strange I I'm I'm very surprised [noise] a little bit more to live with this war and well we'll see I ... is the video of the ... of the family\nI think it's in that the lightning played the clip it's a five minute videos and yeah it's in large with her calling the guy but then it goes to different people there yeah if you look through the site there's videos of her family there's videos of the people she worked with the people that hired her to the people that recruited her all saying the same\nThing mhm you're wondering ... she's got in our favor an hour's worth of what else do you want me to do\nI've shown you everyone that I can think of to comment on this and I took the test that you all screamed about that I did it so I took it I mean this is what it says you can do with what you want mhm\nI agree I mean she she has done everything she could do that the question is just how the other side's gonna react to it and I'm surprised that [laughter] I'm surprised that the president is and screaming I told you so but\nI mean one of these are the birther stuff is that when he produces a birth certificate yeah that's pretty much ... I mean you can do the ... and do German Joel ... faked whatever ha ha okay but we're moving on when we're done with that\nThis to me doesn't change anything really except that if she's going to aggressively push for you that it's over now does she get that does she pull that off obviously in Massachusetts yes but does she nationally\nI my feeling about this TB is that people are so polarized at this stage of the game that ... short of coming up and you know [laughter] being convicted of some kind of gruesome crime people can do what they want to do\nAnd say what they want to say but people are dug in in their respective places I don't think this is going to change the minds of anybody if you like ... the more you're going to say great [laughter] I told you so look she proved it she didn't hide if you don't like are you going to say really and you check the box or you\nAllegedly checked a box and she's going to respond no actually I didn't check a box\nBut then she's going to have an unlikely hero yeah she never she herself I never got her I never I use is to get\nAhead kind of thing but that so it's essentially saying that wasn't my intention\nSo somehow Harvard knew about this well this came out\nSo if you're John Keller who is the moderator of the ... the first debate between warning deal on friday how much do you push on this I assume you start with it right off the bat senator earlier this week you came out with the results of a DNA test first question why did you do this\nThen she's going to tell you and then second why do you do you\nDo the follow up but did you say to Harvard I Want to have breakfast with people that are like me do you go back again on that or do you just she does the test she says what she wants and then you say okay let's move on Jeff anything bad no but I Do think she's running for president now is why and I'm not I'm running presented you leave it at that or do you push harder on it\nI don't know I this is why if I was her people I Would say we're having a press conference today because I Would I Would make her get out in front of people and answer those questions because if it was in a press conference people would ask for that no matter what I Would put her out there and make her answer those publicly because I got to tell you\nWhat she doesn't want is for the first thing out of the box to be about that and she be ask questions that she didn't want to be asked and then she gets angry and then you know that sets the tone for the debate she should go out and face those questions now get it out there\nIn a debate that no one's going to watch before on friday and I am so she basically gets practices so that when it when she runs for president and it comes up again she's already done at once she knows how to do it\nSo that ain't no press conference just go for the debate but what what I Would argue again that is\nWhat you're saying I ... at ... whatever she does this week is to fine tune how to handle this going for yeah\nIs Joel Johnson from the program money wisdom right here on W.

Cale the voice of\nBoston morning show with Kevin Green bay [noise] generally are kale [noise]\n\nStart eight fifty a president is getting ready to go to Georgia and Florida\nWas the first lady's going down a survey [noise] some of the hurricane damage which is just such an everyday that continues to unfold and being\nMore and more horrific what a terrible story and put a desperate situation they have down there so many people so the president is going on but we've been talking about him tweeting this morning and he's talked about going down there and he's talked about some of his rallies and\nNo word on all as before but now just moments ago um he tweeted about the king of Saudi Arabia he says that he just spoke to him\nAnd he denies any knowledge of whatever may have happened missing quotes to our Saudi Arabian citizen\nHe said that they are working closely with turkey to find answers I Am the media at least sending our secretary of state to meet with the king\n\nOperate oh God [laughter] this\nIs not I don't have enough on my plate [noise] now I got to do this but what how's that working through ... going to me with the king is now running the investigation into whether the Saudis ... this is that what's happening how's that working them\n[laughter] [noise] yeah what what is the conversation that you have with the king here with if you're my palm pale\nSo look\nYou can't be sending death squads out to kill people who are talking about you and saying things you don't want to hear and we're willing to give you keep those contracts but\nLook I don't know how you handle this I don't know how this goes ... above everybody is ... ...\nWhat are we going to do where you go to just cut Saudi Arabia off let's assume that killed that guy so when we're done with you or your dad or you're not on the list no I'm not going to do well the president so what do I really are I mean well he's they've said we're going to really be really pissed and we're going to get tough about this that turns out to be the case\nBut not too tough because we can't afford it I mean he he told us that last night you know ...\nWho's ... who you'll notice that the he has the king pointing out in ... this was a big deal for this was probably the most telling thing that he said last night other than I Am the president and you're not when you drop that for some unknown reason but the\nOne talking about the Russia situation and do you believe they're assassins luxuries wasn't on American soil like that's the thing and that's a distinction if it's\nAmerica First it's also America only there where\nHe goes on ... on what do you want me to do about it in for him that's a big difference in this case he's not American\nSo it's a well I'm not happy about it in theory it's but I'm only going to get so worked\nUp about it every what what you signals you're getting from him on this stuff that is what it is\nRight I agree well and what is he going to do he I mean again I don't want to be I don't want to be callous but he's not an American citizen now it is bothers him that he worked and he did the criticism that I guess if you if in fact the Saudis did this the criticism was leveled at him through an American publication\nSo that is that's disturbing and the president said it's disturbing that it's a reporter and that's you know it appears why\nHe was killed if in fact they killed him okay so I understand there's a problem there but what what what is the president to do\nAnd\nCan put sanctions on Saudi Arabia but we have we have a huge business deal with Saudi Arabia and that there is so it's just so much more complicated than just they\nIt's created a guy who was saying bad things about a minute American paper the way they did there so much more here\nLook I Do I Love Marco Rubio no does Marco Rubio sort of\nKnow how to play these yeah he does because he's not the one making these decisions what he's not open\nTrump here when Rubio said yes that I look there's only two possible scenarios you that guy's alive and they're all of them somewhere where that guy is dead and they killed them I don't like either one of those scenarios so something's gonna happen yeah that's true that is about where it lays breaks down right and I don't like show and do things that guy's alive and they're all in um\nYeah so that guy is dead and they killed them how else would have gone like we saw the video him going in he doesn't come back out\nI have they have a record of what that is being referred to as a death squad leaving Saudi Arabia and going there to turkey\nBut then what are you gonna do about it what what I mean well don't you do what you did was ... which is why we do know definitively that you killed that guy in England but we're pretty pissed a Jew in some sanctions that aren't going to mean a whole lot to you when we were really upset you doesn't that what's going to ask the\nQuestion is is so okay we're sending we're going over to talk to the to the king\nBut we should mention should he be participating in this big economic summit I mean all of these us leaders have pulled out and you know that was part of what Rubio was saying we we should not participate in these kinds of things we should not be sending representation or to go there and to support\nAnything that they're doing in that regard I mean and is that okay so that's a gesture you know send him in the end is that going to deter that the Saudi prince and the Saudi king if they decide that their tickets somebody else\n\nWhere you've had a very conflicted relationship with Saudi Arabia for however long but let's say for the last Twenty years and they've participated in things that were not overly pleased about in some cases really pissed about\nBut I\n... outside of maybe China but I don't even know maybe they're more complicated than China they're the most complex relationship that we have in the world because of where they are and because of what they controlled right or they've got us in a ... yes they do and we can't just walk away and we can't just got 'em loose and we can't just say no we're done with you and\nThese things get really tricky them and nobody thought that they would do this I'm unclear why they did do it and why they thought that this would be okay if if they did it uh I think certainly kicked up a hornet's nest but what's it going to do well the weird thing\nToo is that they [laughter] the Saudis have sort of ... I think tried to ... the American people in which there prince\nWho I think is probably as evil as anybody going but they've tried to set the American people in with him out there being young\nBeing progressive in his thinking you know he wants women to drive and we've got to stop ... we've got to get out of the our take ages and you know that's sixty minutes interview that he did going on and on about how he's going to move the monarchy and the country and its citizens\nAnd how you know we are we are America's friend and we want to be allies and\nAnd people watch that and have watched him over a period of time and I think that in fact in and then you see things like this and you realize\nThey're not they're they're they're not as progressive as we think they're not our friend in the way that you think of I I the way I think of that bred to be in our friend or the Canadians being our friend and it's a it's a very complicated\nSituation it's the same as sort of what China where they are doing all these things that are sort of modernizing the way they do them but there's still a communist country as you just write your you've you forget that site times because they look and smell like everybody else now but they're still march into their own that's our rules over there you got it\nSo much pomp barrels marching orders who did he go to a lot of this or is it like you know the Mr wolf character from pulp fiction which is let's let's go over there and let's come up with a workable story let's maybe we're going to play this\nSign closed doors look we know you did it I mean he's not an investigator or not I like I don't know what so\nHe's got to meet with the Saudi king\nThat does seem like an odd place does it does I don't I don't know what I Do walk to the Saudi king why does he got a ...
