H. P. financial and you'll see the retirement road map podcast if you want to subscribe to it and listen to past shows or listen to shows as they come out each week feel free to do so if you don't want to do that and you just want a quick recap\nOf today's show what the most important parts of it were as it pertains to you and your retirement we're going to leave you with our top three ... takeaway is right now ... what was your big takeaway early in the show\nWe talked about following the retirement rules in\nThe first one was you know as you start to into retirement you need to think about adjusting\nAdjusting your mindset adjusting to the fact that you're not going to be saving money any more but you're going to start to be spending and also it's a nice adjustment in regards to your mindset because now you you don't have to work right you can enjoy\nYour life so it is a big step forward when you do retire in regards to the adjustments that you go through assuming assuming you're spending will go down you know when we build plans for folks that's where we assume and chances are whoa you know with the cost of living and things like that going up as much as it is\nIt's important to plan is if you you know your what you need now is what you're going to need then and go up\nPrepare for alternative sources of income remember people back in the you know my parents and things like that they have pensions to rely on they've Social Security to rely on so many retirees are coming in now a days saying I have Social Security and I've done a great job saving how\n... how to how do we how do we make this all work so you got to really think about using your assets to supplement in and provide income for you and in retirement no your nest egg no the amount of money you have in the type of money you have from attack standpoint and when you should draw on each bucket and why\nAnd then the last thing is to build a plan for your retirement don't go into retirement and what we called wing it you know you plan for vacations hours weeks at a time you should spend more time planting the retirement than you do your next vacation this stuff teeth\nAnd just to kind of take it back on that I mean I sometimes you know tell people a story about how you know if you ever sat down for a job interview right and then the person that you know your new boss said you know Derrick Keith don't worry about it you know digits work here and are just call me if you need to paycheck\nAnd it's like no you you would be you know like I like to know exactly when I'm paid for this job and take the bus like no no no no don't worry about it you know to just call me if you need a paycheck and it's like people\nEntering retirement in similar fashion\nWhereas you know now that their their monthly income to build or do they need money and if they have a plan some time to just simple as I call me if you need money\nAnd they don't have a plan they don't know where that paycheck is correct so it's like look if you wouldn't take a job without certainty as to when the next paycheck is coming in where it's coming from\nWhy would you ever retire with that same amount of uncertainty so you know keep for rules are five rules is kind of what that builds up to and just want to remind people that you wouldn't take a job like that so you wouldn't be\nEntering retirement either in the in the best time to build an implement the plan is when you don't need it it's before you need it so that you can get ahead of it so [noise]\nSo whatever you're doing right now I guess I Want to ask you you know what is money mean to you and what's important in your life right now in what really matters to you at this point in time as you are getting ready to potentially retire in the upcoming future\nUm you know we have we ... we share their story earlier mark and Karen in in their in a position where they had a an advisor they had a portfolio but they had NO PLAN in place there's a big difference between having a portfolio of stocks bonds mutual funds\nCompared to an actual plan so when they came in they had NO PLAN they had way too much risk in their portfolio and they were paying high fees when they left what they had was a plan that the ... the risk was reduced substantially because they're retiring and three or four years\nThey had an they had a a place they had a plan of where their income was their paycheck was going to come from like ... said they weren't winging it they knew where their income was going to come from\nThey were able to reduce their fees there are paying and they were able to build a full retirement roadmap plan that looked at income planning investment planning taxes health care and legacy\nSo think about where you are right now I think about where mark and Karen were before they came in\nCompared to how they feel now and how they have a plan in place going forward to retire confidently if you don't if you're like Mark and Karen where they were a few months ago where they had NO PLAN in place didn't have any basis for how they were going to retire if they can retire how much can they draw from and you want someone to help build that out for

I used to write a lot of articles\nIn South Eastern Europe Croatia when it's at the Washington Times blah blah blah blah and she ended up doing a um my my DNA ... I mean I'm a dental ancestry\nAnd so she traced on my mother's side of the family listen to this that apparently although I never saw the money but let that do that we are actually descended from Hungarian prints like centuries ago\nThat doesn't qualify me as being ethnically Hungarian I probably have I don't know one percent Hungarian blood who cares [laughter] I'm not from Gary in St so\nFor her to even put this DNA test out there I think frankly mixture look pathetic\nBecause even by her own standards so you are one\nOne thousand twenty fourth Native American maybe\nAnd you think that clinch is your case that when you claim to be a Native American or she did at the University of Pennsylvania or she did at the University of Harvard\nDo you know what a what a joke and what a national laughing stock you're going to become\nWorse than that we now find out listen to this she couldn't even use a proper DNA test because on the database that was used by the Stanford University professor\nThey don't have huge Native American samples you know why because the Indians themselves say we're constantly being exploited we don't want to get involved in these DNA genetic tests you think\nEverybody wants to own a share of a casino\nEverybody wants to claim Native American ancestry like Elizabeth Warren to get ahead to advance\nTo get promoted to be considered a minority that's what a lizard this Warren did so obviously the Native Americans don't want to participate so wanted to Stanford University professor do I swear to you\nHe their blood test and then he compared it to Colombians\nGuatemalans Hondurans\nOther ethnic groups that also have a huge infusions of Native American blood because apparently all Native Americans cross the bearing straight twelve thousand years of goal\nSo they think there's something common among anybody was Native American blood because it all goes back to twelve thousand years ago when they all came to North America\nThis is your test this this is your past\nAnd then ... Elizabeth Warren says whatever the results were whether it was positive or negative we're we're going to release him to the public so apparently she wants to believe that even though the test could have been negative\nEven though it would be a blow up in her face even those should be a laughing stock even though everybody would laugh at her no no no no this was truly an authentic genuine test and to prove it listen to this Elizabeth Warren releases the video\nWhereby in the video she calls up professor bustamante never met them before and says well Trump says my mother is a liar is she\nAnd at bustamante office are Warren staffers videotaping him but this was all they didn't know what he was going to say that this was all a roll of the dice apparently according to Elizabeth Warren roll the video Brittany\nOil very gently takes fat cat and we will also be hurt or just say I want to give me a million dollars for like to have you take the test and it shows you're in there [noise]\nOh hi Elizabeth Warren is Dr this tomato can please\nI'm Carlos Bustamante advise companies in the direct to consumer space including industry dot com twenty three hundred genome we didn't find five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the error rate is less than what I found\nNow the president like to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the ...
