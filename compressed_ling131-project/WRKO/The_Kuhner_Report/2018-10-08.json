Susan Collins has lost those people for good\nAnd you mentioned Charlie bigger I Want to get him into a second but mark a New Hampshire's got a question about another person which I Want to ask you guys about so let's have him doing mark your next ... W are too\n[noise] so my question is forget call it what happened in ... Virginia would handle reelection [noise]\nI think he wins I think he does I don't know why he voted yeah I think the Democrats know that he uses closer they're ever going to get so they're going to back you know no matter what [noise] I mean Trump harder to hold their nose and and back him yeah and that's\nSuch suggesting I suppose I you know a a Republican or here would somehow get all the Republicans to vote against listen I mean there's a lot of people who hate Baker a lot of far right Republicans who are past you know but I mean what happens is they're not going to go for Democrats he's the\nThe example of the reason that ... that Democrats will vote for Joe mansion in West Virginia is the same reason Republicans would hope for Charlie Baker in Massachusetts you the best are going to get\nYeah I agree I Do think it was not a profile in courage moment when after Collins gives her speech that he jumps in front of the cameras and says you know by the way I have a strong statement to make do oh no oh you know I was just so ... I Would like\nThe phrase use because let's go around the room right now who gets the profile in courage award for the entire cabin offing\nRam politician yeah you know you have to agree him\nI mean it's not like he you know went against his own people but he certainly just stood up in a very specific moment when he needed to\nGo Murkowski 'cause she knew that the vote didn't account she's still stuck to Oregon ... shows I think the three ladies are the most interesting study like ... so Murkowski hide camp in Collins\nWhere where do we go with those like Murkowski everyone thought was going to wait and see what college did she didn't she did it before by definition that would be sort of courageous right but now people are claiming that she got bullied by Native Americans in Alaska and she got a week\nWhen they showed up at her office the day before I don't know but so I don't know what we do with our high camp\nI I think she is doomed either way and so there's this this double theory is to she only did this because\nShe's got to worry about her post Senate career because she's about to get tossed to ... I think she's more interesting in that I I'm with her I was if if you believe her she said last night that I was\nFor him and going to vote for him until that appearance in front of us are we at all by what he did and I just can't in good conscience vote for that guy I feel like that's sort of courage no but she no one's saying that she was courageous\nLast week why because I think it's disingenuous to think that she believed him beforehand and then when he comes in and makes the case\nFor her in leaves as a solo on the table in front of her and in most like that then suddenly lost credibility or she suggested that she hurt you hurt feelings when he was Snoopy with everybody I think that's that's a I think that's a week I don't I think is anti intellectual I don't and I think that's\nThat's not him having a temper tantrum in itself I mean you it's weak I you know he basically is when you are not true to yourself and I when I was and also I mean when it comes down to ... senators or\nI wouldn't say that their feelings or hurt at all when he was nippy they looked at him and he looked like a ... kid when he was saying I don't know you know what do you drink oh you really want to talk to your book while he looked like\nThe guy she was describing yeah she did he did he made\nThem so yeah he also you know like a ... well my argument on a jet I disagree I anti intellectual as I Love when she addict before anyone spoke of his already deemed your argument to be an eye and electoral but [laughter]\nGuys are judging days is in accord honey orders people to have a certain level of decorum and they're not act outrageous and float are armed and yell and scream when the chips are down by the end when his chips are down he\nDoesn't know he's got twelve years on the bench and hasn't done that in twelve years but he did it this time was well this was a hearing this time and this was after taking a humbling you know one of the people in Twitter said you know they would hit him with a fire hose for a week and then they couldn't believe how he was you know patting himself off of the towel during their questioning\nYeah of course he had to his career was over I mean this was done there was a lot of us thought that there will be a problem with him when his current position\nYou know who agrees with me and not you him that's what he wrote in the wall Street Journal I I'd I'd said and did some things as well he's on his Mad Men\nSo [laughter] [laughter] I sure do that I sure did the crazy\nThing about I about winning is that there were people who said that his performance obviously not pushing back on the senators but his in his passion of tears his anger or all those things actually sway towards a hoarding half\nAnd the weather that behavior gets rewarded going forward is a question I Want to talk not about him but one of his new colleagues because she had something to say Friday Saturday that I think is fascinating we'll let you hear and when we come back and then we'll talk about uh six fifty nine right here in ... city W workout\nVoice of Boston New York or Boston one hundred point seven till UCLA HD to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\n\nGood morning I'm Nick ... W. R. K.

that in that generic ballot has narrowed it was double digit ...\nRun a Romney McDaniel tells Fox News Sunday Kavanaugh's confirmation will help Republican candidates in Senate races but her house candidates in swing districts she says the Republican base has completely energized right now in the cabinet hearing just highlighted how important this election is for that\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong il has delighted about his latest meeting with secretary of state Mike Pompeo mark Mayfield fills us in\nNorth Korean state media quoted him is calling the talk productive and wonderful Pompeo had a similar reaction to the meeting in Pyongyang calling it good and productive among the topics of conversation was the possibility of a second summit between the north Korean leader and President Trump the two met for the first time in Singapore back in June\nA car but you know everybody's not perfect and and and and\nAnd as I said you want a robust debate with ideas and you have to give people the benefit of the doubt that that's exactly what they want to\nAnd um and I I I Do think it helps to go through life with a little bit of a\nSense all over the worn down and um and and with an attitude that you're going to give people the benefit of the doubt and everybody's trying to do what would you have presumably trying to do which is um the debate ideas and you know a serious way\nYeah and it's unfortunately but that it's good minded it's fair minded or liberals who are getting torched more and more because of this this culture of intersection our city and\nA ... kind of post modernist mob that says no we have our values and victimhood and we're going to be monitoring the landscape and if we see a reason that you victimized us because of your identity then we're coming after you\nDust Mark Kelly tweets about Churchill and he's a great guy or whatever it has to apologize now Mark Kelly good to get into that we're going into that for this kind of thing happens all the time\nAnd so it's just compromising conversation and Hillary\nI yeah this is only in a Kagan saying is like we expect this sort of thing from I don't know what I'm say Trump or Lindsey Graham the right now is feeling his oats and his feeling really good about himself\n... out of nowhere yeah Elena Kagan dropped to hey toughen up\nGetting it out and not act like you're worlds over and it's okay to push back and not everything's in my garage and what was the exact quote and it helps in life to be a little less thick and thin skin like I feel like this should be mandatory early played in every school in the country now like you should have to hear this speech\nI mean I feel like not only are are folks very easily sensitive sometimes if you ate it seems as though\nActually the argument has gotten to finding something that you had said to find the micro aggression\nSo that you are no longer a year knocked off whatever you're talking point was right I mean it's almost like a debate counter or something basically as opposed to actually arguing about what you're arguing about you're going to go through whatever it is they sat and try and find something that is why is that that makes you feel bad\nAnd turn it to that and that happens on I mean whether it's a dangerous place for this but\nUh that happens all the time I see your and blah blah blah and eat it takes what should be back and forth and basically suddenly turns it into somebody has to be a racist somebody has to be sex as he has to be whatever\nUh and uh takes the conversation far away you're not and I think that they can begin a what happened with cake and I think certainly what happened with Trump is people aren't allowed\nTo say or something and I think those people who feel as though they're not allowed to discuss things are sick of it\nAnd just spoke with their vote and yet you know what I'm sick of being yelled at by everybody every time I Try and express something that I feel that parent isn't with the current thought process and I'm just going to go in and vote you know use my voice mail voting\nYeah and you look at that first Fox debate with Megan Kelly in Donald Trump in making Kelly went after him saying you called Rosie O'Donnell of fat or whatever you sum up some of the things the incendiary things that Trump has said the biggest things\nAnd uh and then from may to joke about it was it not only said you don't want people to ... political break those people just sick of it it's nonsense and it was short in Kirk but there are people around the country saying wow\nI didn't know people were allowed to say that still but he's saying exactly what I feel so I'm going to be quiet about it when I'm watching that guy let's see how much more issues that\nUp because it just strangled people are sick of it\nWhat do you make of what a land a Kagan said and what do you make of the fact that it was Alina Kagan who said it\nDoes show that just that's such an out of left\nField or for me I just it's it's almost perfect it's unbelievable we'll talk more about what it is that she had to say we come back first it's important to you know what I Am ...

Twain is\nDon't get into this stuff just be an entertainer it's better for business ... we've heard this over and over again asked James Woods how is how it's been going on camera man etcetera there's only landmines waiting for you here\nWhy would Taylor Swift go against the grain and say oh no I'm delving in both hands in front of me feedback I'm diving and why would she do it\nWell it's her district right these are these are her personal representatives I don't think there's anything wrong with it in a I'm not\nPassing judgment on arms right she's about business this is not a good business decision why he also thinks she's Oprah yeah she\nShe tale I think Taylor Swift has gotten to the point where she thinks she's on the Oprah level of I Need to do for the might people and I need to proclaim how I feel so everyone can feel that way\nWell maybe it's a a Nike Colin Kaepernick thing\nI think there may be more than that I think you're onto something here trying to figure out\nNicely I knew had done the work ... how this was going to play can she do that like they do\nI mean you already have a reference I suppose right how yeah oh messaging is turned into a you know I'm taking a stand sells more I'm taking it on a stand for XYZ self far more than than a lot of other things basically\nAnd it comes out the day after her arch enemy was lambasted on Saturday Night live for supporting Trump Katy Perry county ... oh\nSorry a ...\nAnd ... they only to have her entire album was about how much she hates can ...\nReally yes I have so many outlets Katy Perry they\nMade they made over their mutual hatred of can crash in\nReally what's her ... I mean I I Know I can see what they're\nDoing and I can tell you I can tell you the Kim ...\nIs a very involved a long running story yeah yeah well you know the other thing I could just quickly push back in terms of politics Phoebe is that I don't know the Katy Perry uh with all that hurt and she played for Hillary at the convention\nShould a ... so I don't know it's part of ...\nI missed her rehearsal because you guys were badgering me and I had to use their averages everyday I\nOwn a fake name is what I did I remember sweet or so yeah yeah but uh\nSo was it was keep areas well kind of goes into her the brain of Katy Perry's that she cast off for a good Catholic school girl thing right what what she was a very religious singer at first it's and so she kind of became\nMore in the sexy ... exactly and she did really well and then she got political and hasn't sold ... really shield them I mean she's on American Idol button her last year ... complete bombs wow so what ...\nI don't know how often you guys work with me but I've seen them with a joint bowl and adjoining moon I'm Leah visual yeah I mean it was\nIt was was there anything you didn't like about millennia this week\nI thought she was great I like I like the cheese I think she's trailing somebody with the fashion choices but\nShe is is that are selling with every everything he says is the role it well I mean putting that much\nInto your looks and then saying don't focus on my luck is right there\nAnd he got that one that we got to hear this when right off the top and let me\nTake the image for you okay because she ... she's in Egypt and she's standing in front of the strength and she actually looks back to make sure she sort of sad [laughter] she's wearing like she just stepped out of Casablanca over yeah for those that get the David reference but she's got this sort of thing on that you'd expect\nA man's where a and it's just very um lemony very British man in safari yeah you\nDon't treat her Lori to be on her arm reminds me of the ... catalog from Seinfeld those little or\nYeah yeah she's got the had the ... I mean the last ... yeah I ... and\nI ended up of course getting perfectly blown by the way over her shoulder\nIn ... she has the goal to say that yes yeah\nToday so they just needed an amazing team rentals on average to allowing them to pan yeah here we I Need to I Want to talk about like the\nAll ...\nAll of that but I Do what we do we tell us a call but I Do my nieces and I wish people would focus on what I Do\nNot all that down her way of saying the fake media back there in the back\nRow right won't cover that die you're down by to ever do that like to me the equivalent of Trump looking up at the uh yeah you might look it up at all I Love that got him when he's still [laughter]\nThat's her doing that she wore the jacket that says I don't care to you\nBut I don't talk about what I where it's heading up the entire Internet bullying initiative for the White House yes that's all it was just trying to achieve [laughter] hey fabulous\nYou pointed out her her commitment to the very spot that she was standing in where the space was right there somebody was talking about it being\nA there were ... you were shops on either side there was every other shot would have been somehow ruined by commercialism this one was the perfect one uh she loves it and\nIs there a better backdrop for a human being than millennia in front of the ... because they're both riddles right like\nWhat does she think of her husband what does she think about being first lady what does she care about like we we love her and all that and what most of us but we don't we don't know what makes it does she sleep with them we don't even know does she who did you spend\nMore time with her mother or her husband or something we don't know anything\nAbout her role in years it on and by the way I haven't seen you know there were two years he didn't go on is right right now I mean wasn't the whole reason she stayed in New York for six months to was because she couldn't be away from ya on that and now\nShe's the only time we saw him was was a couple of weeks ago and he's way taller than it ever we had seen him so little that we all may notice of oh my God he shot up like because we never see him yeah she's a rental she is\nShe is and she maintains a level of popularity because it'd be left as holding out\nFor her to ... him or divorced him or say something which ruled in humiliating left is basically like oh we lost Susan Collins we still have ... yeah my mom malaria or maybe as long ago\nNever know well she's such a rental that nobody on either side knows what's coming so in there for all of the people who were cheering her for ... to me or doing whatever in terms of of supporting her husband's supporting Kavanaugh there's people who are waiting for another outlook of uh\nAnger and discussed with the hand slap you ... you know eight either side can get can claim victory when it comes to Milan ya at any point\nBut she's got some Taylor Swift dinner right which is that she doesn't get political is a general rule but just what she did over there she asked about Brett Kavanaugh right in she weighs in except watch how she does what her husband\nDoes what does it way better than he does which is she controls the narrative as she wanted and she only says what she feels like say give me the Kavanaugh one lightning\nAnd your husband has time for a man on children and girl what\nDo you agree with them\nWhatever said that [noise]\nI think it's highly\nSigned\nUp for it\nI don't\nHave the\nIt gets to be a certain ...\nWell that's good I mean that's what first of all of those are good questions by the reporter the way she couched in very smartly done yep I agree and uh obviously the communications shop at the White House is on point because ... went to a safe space is going to do\nIt again this is the riddle of the things here which is that does millennia run this stuff by them or does she not is she on her own she not we don't we never know his his herd doing this or does she have writers that are just more savvy and she's using\nSpecies using them 'cause she volunteered that the questions were about Kevin ... before I mean they were obviously by Kevin ... you know brought the ball into that zone you know without any more prodding she could have done it but I don't know that\nShe knew the follow up was come in and she handled that pretty I'm going to hold on that I'm gonna I'm\nGonna move on and when I you know I can tell you exactly what went on with the reporters and it's a weird space when you're interviewing somebody who is\nImportant but not\n... billion dollars right so ... you hear you look at each other in the ... and then you go I I don't what does she mean I'm In a move on that\nI don't know I you know what it doesn't matter will just after another question didn't move on because there's people who you decide to go ahead and ... you're gonna you're gonna put your all as a scrum into following up and saying that didn't answer the question can you please again I go go on and and explain yourself\nAnd then there's people where it just ... it's not really worth it to ... you are depressed that hard and that that must have been a situation that happened there\nAnd maybe the other reporters looked around and looked the other reporters and said well I Am I'm going to move on and apparently means something\nTo them because they're not I am [laughter] I guess that was an okay answer\nBut based on how this when I think she thinks it went pretty well when she got to pretty much control every aspect of this did she wanted\nAre we getting a okay I'm going to be the traditional first lady now and I'm going to be much more aggressive as first lady or is this one off [noise]\nI don't think we're getting a traditional personally I think she's going to be more strong headed more high profile as we go into she's getting more comfortable in it I think that she's been a agitated enough by the press I haven't had any artist\nBut is she going to be more aggressive first lady versus a I'm going to go by myself ... museum because I Can't stand my husband right now and I don't want anybody asking me anything he she now gonna we we all heard the first year like she doesn't want this job she doesn't want to part of his life or whatever she like\nFine I'm In well he'll have in the pits are off lately no Newport stars have come out now you forge\nSpeech but she was in Africa or maybe she didn't hear it I don't know and maybe she didn't like it I don't know\nI think she's going to craft the job to where she gets the most the biggest thrill out of it you know and it seems to be more the princess di route another right or exactly and she likes that kind of thing she used to play around the world I think she's probably getting a thrill out of the power that the that the job provides an eagle boost\nThe anybody probably would now she can like with like Michelle Obama she can get twenty of her closest friends and packed onto an airplane in just a zigzag around the country she won't if you add right\nNow a Tuesday Morning nine AM dueling press conferences Donald Trump millennia Trump which one of your watch\nDonald will not be upstaged oh I was ... in a heartbeat\nI think I Would do I'm Donald what I'm getting hurt him much more mysterious it really is true you don't know which I got to know what she's wearing than that\nI Do want to hear where is she willing to go she went further with Kavanaugh there than I Would have expected but I'm like OK gym's right I Know what Trump's

Columbus as it is out\nIn why is this I mean a holiday that could potentially have such good food too are we\nWasting this because I don't forget it is it is an Italian American there though like that St Patrick's Day did become again ironically I think it was odd that did it but\nThey dictated the terms when they finally decided to take it on in the Nineteen eighties but no one's taking this on someone has to do it and then they have to tell you this is how we're going to do it again I Would ever read Italian food drink Italian wine too\nLate now right now I'm ...\nNow let's see if I should say was dead in the seventies there was nothing\nReally on the holidays are surrounded by like feast and stuff like the the three said it's very like religious it's more and that's when they get bring out the food and all that\nThey had a western dead just they do that they have a Columbus Day parade\nBut San ... so they had a yesterday and you know what you gotta look at the pictures on this thing oh boy\nThere's this giant well organized well run parade it's got marching bands it's got bloated and politicians there's only one thing it doesn't have\nA spectators so hops are at the front and they're bringing this parade during there's no one there yeah people are waving at buildings because there's nobody enemies\nWho goes what is the Columbus Day parade even what what are we doing there now saying and did the debate in West or his whether one of someone said we need to have the Irish takeover\nThe parade so we can do this right because they know how to do this because of St Patrick's Day parade thousands of people go to but\nThe Italians are there the Italian community in Worcester is dwindled wanting to is they're not getting people interested in the thing and that's why you can do the indigenous people's day because nobody's going to push back because there are no one cares\nYeah but what can you do then I mean what ... accustom of indigenous people are we going to use on that\nOr you can do nothing I we're not allowed in people's day is the same problem which is you can't dress up because now that is a microexpression there's no food what are we gonna eat maize and whatever\nRight kill a animal and roasted for food like but the fall is screaming\nFor ... between October ... something ... and July Fourth we need one\nYeah and Columbus Day continent is what I'm telling large Labor Day more jak needs to be gas that we need to Jack up but somehow they I don't know I feel like there's an opportunity here and I'm fine with reworking Columbus Day and keeping it but so many on it [noise] ...\nYeah I feel like Labor Day is is is celebrating an end tomorrow you know and then there's a big and then there's just this big wait until things get\nSo maybe they didn't want to have a it's a destructive distraction during the uh crop season how 'bout that\nThis season we're not going back and we're not doing Nineteen twelve again we're like this is okay I understand it so why is it I mean we're absolutely this is what I'm saying we put an end and the moon and we can read do we're ... we're\nYou know to do any but here they were written by the theory and then we'll take calls I you\nKnow you guys are do lead to a gym would get his nose in the tent and he's going to take down all\nThat is what I say all the time I knew that I Am always for the Arlington\nLeaf blower thing for example where\nLet let the people that can't not get involved didn't take on a cause let 'em have leaf blowers in Arlington in the summer because that keeps them busy with something that we don't care about them so let them have Columbus Day because I don't care about Columbus Day it means nothing to me\nSo go for it or you want to call it indigenous people they have added that means you're done did dynamic you go after Halloween now you and I got a tough one [laughter]\nYeah pick your battles\nAnd I'm happy to let them do this and get focused on this because that means they're not touching the when I Do care about it I've got to have had an epiphany\n\nIt would paired nicely with the tank prayed about that\n[laughter] I mean Donald Trump yes mining and

the last years everybody's trying to let's get rid of this oh let's get rid of that\nPeople have anything better to do um I I teach at a higher level now so we don't talk about Columbus Day as much but I really really fail for children I'm roaming up in our school systems\nUm they need something real old historic\nTo learn about navigation and exploration he said fine example I think um I think if you get rid of everything and we'll just get rid of ... Maine to after a while because it will be insulting the other person some name may be Italian and somebody else that might be Irish won't want to know that\nUm and also if you do see around sitting out of criticism this is also Italian heritage month\nThat many of us right it is October um and if you go into many associations like ... in Cambridge you hear a lot about the um older people I'm from centuries ago who contributed a lot to the country so I Know we can have\nLike forty five presidents days they might they be forty five days off\nSo I think historically ... that we will probably would not be having this conversation right now if it weren't for ...

begin to tops field Essex County and all this stuff and I know I have to judge them on five criteria and poise mhm oh God\nYeah intelligence uh we're sitting\nOn poisoning I deserve this was hard right so we're sitting at a table much smaller than this and with this four of us judges and then these women are coming in one by one\nAnd they're sitting as close as you are to me right now Hillary ...\nAnd I have to ask them a question and I have to look at them\nAnd I have to go that's a Twenty one the girl with a well known sixteen oh here it was it was up until the first two women come in and I turned to the woman to my right and I I Can't do this I picked this unbelievably impress him and they want this thing really bad and I can't I'm like over my head\nLuckily the other two judges who had been former miss it I don't say he's\nLike okay\nHere's what I thought about a B C D any and they sort of took over how they voted I said right like yes plus one on what you said because I was yeah it was I was great to meet these women and it was fun to be a part of and\nIt was ridiculous how locked in people were on this would have thought we were picking who's going to be the one person to go to the moon and represent mankind it was it's that big of a thing because you have you got to do it do it right man did they do it and I was like I'm not\nGoing to be Simon Cowell here I'm not I'm going to be even Tyler and I love every body and your grade and give me a ... and\nOh man it was ... to ... you cannot do that with moms that is such a set up us how you handle or the friendship by the way with\nThis other guy meant because I think as you can see I got some kids behind me that had a\n... absolutely ripped it up at the top sealed fair but you know what's funny about it for what it's worth so we tend to have our own question\nNo I don't I'm not going to I don't\nOh by my seven year old daughter it's her first time at the fair so if you were going to be missed Mrs Essex County what's the one thing my daughter needs to do before we leave the fair today Mm that's good seven different women coming in one of the time they don't they're in sealed containers\nOr they're not sharing that seven everyone in\nSeven different answers which I thought spoke very highly of the ... year old are your what is it I don't mean to be doing it from hurting the attractions as well which is nice ones that you've got to touch the she's got to see the twenty foot boa constrictor and other you've got to hold the check in your hands because you can do that\nAnd other there's this super slide the ... you would break but your kids would absolutely love and\n... it's all of those things for my ... year old she was all in ... so do the one last thing I'll say in my life was miss healthy and\nTo be good about this ... year or so what are you going to do so kids kept Sandy ... dancing finally and my wife goes up then of course I get the picture of her buying the deep fried twenty that'll be immortal six bucks for the deep ...\nThe right to not healthy break it into three 'cause we've got the three kids and the first kid goes and as he's biting it drops oh\nOh no well that's a kiss it up a God moment as a not well there was a good it was a good teachable moment because at home five second rule obvious right at top sealed fair no no no no no a lot of animals a lot of the the a lot of you know\nI don't I mean is it if you add to that area and there is on and you're getting half of your sister's third so you're not getting the tiniest\nMorris or whatever but they couldn't really even judge the thing because they've got such a ... a portion of it but we're like you're not eating the whole the pride during the ... with everything else you know I Would never let my kids do that either [laughter]\nI Know [laughter]\nYeah I Do think you know should bowl like if I send you to the top filtered today what would you eat the\nCandy oh my God I Love uh I like the jets and sorry or whatever that French fries with vinegar are amazing lots of German fries at the tops ... yeah ... yeah\nUm so that's good I Love fried down but I had her sugar really gotta sugar is

I'm telling you I'm looking at like ladies or whatever\nOr category judging along the way that they still have toys\nThere was a there was a stage portion of the things are how they carry them tells them stay within ... there was a part of it where they made an appetizer that they tried to them so how they would have asked for more than they would be about themselves that are is a different thing how much they knowledgeable\nAbout the the broaden his versus us there one thing it cetera but\nOne thing that I didn't get the driest chips on a stick of you seen this thing joins along like you know teriyaki skewer type thing and it's a it's odd potato this just one continual spiral Mm and it's been I\nYeah I don't know it's like they ... they're all the chips they just haven't been caught and you're just wrapping 'em off one at a time and it looks like there's like thirty ships on the fact that sounds delicious or is there a tipping\nA aspect to this year though if you're ... you're going there for a potato I Would yes no walking around out there right now you're not you know how you gonna have a goal when do you mean you could probably get a melted cheese something or other from you know I have toys [laughter] I Know that the crown an\nAd and there's a reason why I I don't want a big hunk of potato my goodness we go to is", "show_name": "The Kuhner Report", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "08"}
