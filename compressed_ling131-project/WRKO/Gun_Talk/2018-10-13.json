{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Or a Home Depot to get your uh ten percent discount for being a veteran so that's the world according to John ... next week\nThat's down from ... Mike Sweeney we're giving you some are more veteran not related\nTopics on the past two weeks um [noise] the United States Department of veteran affairs came out or they released their two thousand and a performance ratings for all of its hospitals\nI'm sort of like a hundred and Seventy hospitals throughout the country um you know we came down on or what's in Massachusetts a set of central western mass out north Hampton a day they received a five out of five a star a Bedford a obviously in Bedford mass a ... day also received a five out of five\nOr and then uh the Boston VA healthcare system which incorporates a west rocks very\nAh Brockton in Jamaica Plain or they got a four out of five\nOr so it's very interesting um you know to to see how the out of that you know how to the whole as a hundred and forty six hospitals that were that were rated a all the all the ones in Massachusetts are are are seen as improving um obviously you're a pretty good after five out of five or but Mike I Want to get your are your thoughts on on on this data being released\nI think it's good news I think the question we have to keep saying this how do we keep people coming to these hospitals I think a lot of the problem is you run into people\nThe biggest problem people run into is getting into the VA once during the VA you know they they kind of the ... because they feel like it's harder for the Wii I think is a very good job of making the application process a lot simpler so you're running and so I think people should look a sign up for the VA get into the VA and even if you\nCheck it out for yourself but I Do believe one thing that's come up that's a myth that I think we try to stop people from hearing is that\nIf they go into via there's somehow taking away services at someone else could use\nYou joining the you getting into the VA healthcare system actually makes it so that they have more the way the government works it isn't like anything else oh the ... type of thing yeah\nDo you have more patient signed up a VA healthcare you're going to have more services here in New England\nRight yeah I mean you know that just like any hospital you know they're looking at a you know the the nurse\nI'm to patient ratio of course we're here now would question one oh yeah um you know the doctor to a patient ratio so the the more people that come in the more patients that come in requires more doctors so one person applying could mean at the at the VA has another doctor another nurse which can help help their fellow veteran\nA in ... we want to make maybe ah\nSpeak to the application process I mean is it ten ten easy it's a very ... called easy for a reason it used to people used to think if you signed up you wouldn't hear from it for like three or four months it's the turnaround pretty ... pretty good now that it's supposed to get back to you had a couple of weeks and that amazing I mean really you find on a couple of we should we get in and and\nThat's the hard part you know there's so many different laws that that determine eligibility and that's what makes a confusing for people or you know so you have the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans of if they have been a\nYou know deployed or or or separate from the military within the last five years that they are eligible Gulf War veterans are eligible uh Campbell June veterans are are eligible um you know for a certain time period from fifty three to eighty seven or because the water was mom polluted\nVietnam veterans are are are eligible or you know and not hasn't always been the case right so you so you have people that were denied Thirty years ago that tell other people out there they wouldn't be eligible um you know people that are service connected disability barrels will so that there aren't any of those criteria groups on by law they're eligible no matter what their income as\nSo a lot of people think the oh I make too much money on not eligible and that that's not necessarily the case you know so\nYou know as many things laws make it very very complicated itself\nRight to where we and if there is something that is a take from this is I think we have is is Congress doesn't really give we blamed the VA in the VA you know when they make mistakes they should be blamed for it but the problem we really have is it the we've decided not to care for every veteran in the country [laughter]\nNo no not only for that so I'm a political decision unfortunately\nAnd so if we've done that we we we there's some people who aren't eligible but it still is worse I mean how much of it when an application may take you about Fifteen minutes tops the is that you and that in you can ... you can call it up on line go Google tend to an easy call your VA hospital being\nCares about us ... for for via cares into it that way too\nAnd I think as you get older too it does provide options for your family whether it's cheaper prescriptions different experts in on certain there's certain things and I can speak to about guys we talk about people with a um with breathing problems coming out of Afghanistan or Iraq if you go to your regular doctor\nThey may not be able to connect those symptoms into something that\nA VA doctor would see because they've seen that veteran come through who's been near burn pits who's had these breathing problems\nThat I think you made a I think in ... that's why it's not just about who I'm another person to provide the care I think there is a a qualitative difference and especially in certain specialties where you're talking whether it's P. TST\nRespiratory problems for Vietnam veterans when you're talking about dieticians and an Agent Orange and how that impacts different diseases and disorders that are related to Agent Orange\nI I think it's um it's a good move for veteran and if you if those are who are listening and if you're if you're a veteran or a family of a veteran you know you should look into it because it doesn't it it may not pay it may not be a panacea and cover every problem financially you have in terms of health care but boy it's a good option\nRight and well in the VA has nursing homes that they have hospice care I'm\nOf a family member a who's caring for veterans can be paid for that for that a ... of course there's a whole nother eligibility requirement you know structure for that as well you know all set up by law um but you know ... ... talking about free nursing care you know are very very discounted nursing care\nUm you know there there are veterans with service connected issues that if they need their house modified because of a Walker or you know or wheelchair a VA can pay for those modifications um again it's an eligibility a issue um but then you know there's a there's a lot out there and\nDo I think we've seen it recently at least with the the president and Congress just passed the largest VA budget of all time you're not going over to a hundred billion dollars for just the fiscal year I mean it's it's wild and of all the things that they can't get along on um you know and they don't always get will on on on veterans issues but they they did this time on you know so that's good news\nYeah and we're going to have a conversation about what veterans need having more veterans go down and apply for the VA healthcare or to get into the healthcare system shows that I Need and it gives people more ammunition to ask for more I'm One of the things I think that comes up now uh I Know my family worked down the G and lent\nTheir retirees two or three years ago used to have very good health care and we're told two or three years ago when to give you a thousand dollars a year ago I got\nSo a lot of ... veterans who may not have chosen to go to the VA healthcare system over the years are now trying to find their way back into doing Vietnam vet all those different categories if you already know veteran a disabled and get in there and it's really been a lifesaver for a lot of them financially because\nThe uh in in let's face it that could happen to any retiree tomorrow their company could come in and say ... or the health care premiums could go up so I think sometimes there's a way to get in there ahead of time so you're not a ... a ...\nYou know I might voted ... you can go in if you're already has another private insurance if you're\nA ... she wants to be that 'cause that's what I think people don't they think they had they ... they have to have no health care to go into the games as\nSupplemental via can charge a a a private insurance company if the if if they need to um yeah you could you could be on Medicare or Medicaid or try care I'm the most of the hospitals except try care um so so there are a lot of options that way to\nWe talked about the VA mission act to that and that is given people more access to a private doctors as well or so there are a lot of different options are ... with that and like I said if you're just a Vietnam veteran then it doesn't matter you\nCould you could be a millionaire you could you can maybe by [laughter] any Bill Gates you could you could have\nYou got to Medicare's you could try care you could have your own private insurance VA will still accept you because you're automatically eligible\nSo that's in country Vietnam veterans\nRight boots on the ground um you know and then the inland waterways right well we've talked about on this show that the there is a a a a bill out there for for blue water navy veterans\nUm stalled in Congress but we'll see we'll see how that goes so that's the other things are always change we talk about the Vietnam veteran that may have applied Thirty years ago and then you know one wasn't you know received or whatever um you know things are different now\nKnowing a lot of Vietnam veterans are are just living in a life like everyone else maybe they got ten percent for their knee [laughter] Thirty years ago but don't ... and now they've they've done it made you automatically eligible absolutely and if they have diabetes and it's it's service connected disability boots and there's nothing to do so is it a lot of stuff in it I think those\nConnections ... and we always talk about it in terms of ... even if the veteran himself he or she is okay you know maybe look at it in terms of taking care of your family too\nYou know well not that that's another piece too you know people think that's only for people that were wounded or for people that I'm deployed and I thought the case you\nKnow there there are people that were in eighty second Airborne Division that the fifty jumps well there are an inch shorter now you know they're ... ... yeah you know they didn't have to have gone to war um\nTheir own get injured you can get injured here in the service and you get injured ... I mean pretty much any combat arms of Europe's Hillary and you're hearing on I mean there's a fear it aren't doing it for God's sake [noise]\nThat's something to think about um what was your knees or off off the show believe it or not in a good show absolutely so John thanks for all that you're doing things for all that you do jak behind the glass\nAre campaigning for Barletta and Lou Barletta who's ... who's a great guy congressman and he's running against Casey one of these guys who were claimed sees a a a conservative Democrat\nHe he only supports fourth trimester abortion not fifth trimester abortion so that makes him a conservative Democrat\nThese days and so and let me just go over a few things here uh uh the the latest or the latest developments here in the in the\nKavanaugh aftermath Susan Collins Kavanaugh vote sparks calls to boycott main products and tourism\nWell I'm Glad to know that that\nMeans I saw I saw a bag of a main potatoes market basket on a on a Saturday or the mail room managers likes to buy a handful of a potatoes were buying bags now main the main potatoes if this boycott is going on or\nDo you ever hear of an actor and comedian named John ... sang\nDoesn't have an accent radio show he's just one of these caustic condescending lips\nBy call I'm an actor and a comedian that that explains why I've never heard of them yeah exactly he's if he unless he has a show on the seventies on seven oh I think I think he has like an hour long accent radio program which nobody lifts and he just says and argue liberal things on social really uh you know what the number\nOne show on XM Radio is by the way it's Fox News channel it's not it's not John snarky boggles saying anyway here's what he said to ... to to what Susan Collins dear Susan Collins I really struggled with this but my tourist dollars just voted against ever visiting main while you remain in office\nAnd so now he uh now he's now he's deleted that tweet went over so big\nYeah I'm guessing a vis boycott of Maine products is brought to you by all the people who moved out of the United states after Trump was elected right\nJohn tests are who owns six restaurants in Texas in his opening a seafood restaurant in California told the newspaper he'll look elsewhere for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of seafood that he buys annually for may good luck getting all those good New Mexico lobsters\nYou know\nJohn tests are going to have a fundraiser for a beta or war before he gets his ass kicked than four\nWeeks by Ted Cruz by the way so this is a this this is what the this is the fourth of boycott may that's what I think of a boycott of may\nSo Jane Mayer Ronan Farrow ran with Kavanaugh hit piece in the New Yorker to show pattern of behavior\nA pattern of behavior so so in other words they knew that they couldn't find anybody to back up this woman ... story which he couldn't remember 'cause she was so loaded and she she had to talk for a lawyer before she could even come out with some kind of a memory gaps\nAbout what a cabinet had allegedly done but they wanted to show the pattern\nOf behavior I\nThought you know a few ... if you try to stay there was just another story and one of the papers today in LA there are ... there are a sheriff's deputies are being accused of stopping Latino ...\nIt's called racial profiling right\nThere because there's a pattern of behavior the Japanese are saying so what is the difference between a pattern of behavior for ah for Brett\nKavanaugh odd but you think which it turns out it's not even true and a pattern of behavior for us stopping drivers are stopping anybody because you suspect that uh they're they're uh they're engaged in the various activities\nSo that Ronan Farrow he's shot we're going to need a new poll question or a Steve someone just to yeah\nThey are one of our other questions was will be ah well the teacher in Minnesota or be fired or resign and I said no this is the uh this is the teacher\nOr she's in ... which is I guess near Minneapolis rose mount educator this is the headline in the uh the Minneapolis Red Star Tribune as they call it out there a rose mount educator on leave after tweeting kill Kavanaugh\n\nArose out special education teacher has been pet placed on paid administrative leave after posting a tweet Saturday that appeared to call for the killing of new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh it appeared here's what it said so who knows that's by the way I spelled W H O s e\nWho's where\nDid she go to college by the way they wouldn't have any information that you go to college with Christine Blasey Ford at my alma mater so who's going to take one for the team and kill Kavanaugh so that it appears that she was calling for someone to kill Kavanaugh because she used the words killed Kavanaugh in there\nBut so are we I was I was expecting but she was just going to claim that uh you know she was suffering some kind of breakdown and would have to undergo two hours of counseling before she could return to the classroom but apparently she resigns so we're gonna have to come up with a new question\nAnd a John Heinz Iraq or is on the show sometimes from power line blog or he says I'm so old I can remember when teachers knew how to spell [laughter]\nYeah you are showing your age their job and when you talk about that who's going to\nHere's a a poll question uh this is a CNN of all Paul's by twenty eight points independence approve of a Democrat Kavanaugh tactics independent voters are expressing overwhelming disapproval of the way the Democrats handle the Kavanaugh confirmation fight\nThe uh the G O P didn't fare much better oh how how can that be fifty five thirty five this a probe that's that's I I don't okay it is a CNN poll aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two did you hear about the Facebook executive is getting his name is ...\nAnd uh he's apparently a long time he's in he's based in DC I guess he's basically a lobbyist for a Facebook and he's a longtime friend of a Brett Kavanaugh go probably going back to the Bush White House\nDays and uh so he ... he decided to come as a as as a as a supporter of Kavanaugh\nAnd so all the all the snowflakes that Facebook saw him in the audience and they went crazy and I ... I had to apologize cap one had to apologize say he's my friend but I'm Sorry if I offended the company and all this\nI mean how ridiculous is this the case his friend and he didn't do anything\nBut there's more if you don't ... it was more social media BS here ... executive slams GOP over Kavanaugh's nomination bleep you all to have\nA design lead whatever design lead as a Google has slammed the Republicans in an angry ... over the nomination of now justice Brett Kavanaugh your finished GOP you\nPolish the fight polished the final nail wasn't aware that they polish hails for coffins but you know I guess I'm I don't live in Silicon valley you polish the final nail for your coffins then it gets into the F bombs Dave whole gives his name I Hope\nThat last images burned into your slimy treasonous retinas\nTreason people not only can they not\nWell they don't know the meaning of word treasonous rat miners are millions of women laughing and clapping and celebrate it gives your soul descend into the flames\nHe added okay\nThis is Google which doesn't posted a Christmas pictures on Christmas Day because they want to be above the fray [noise] a four four or five hundred forty to forty two about what car\nDo talks about Conan moving back after this\nThis half hour to how we talk show was powered by the cargo purchasing a pre own car can be tricky but not if you go through ... she is the absolute\nBest in the ...

I'm kind of the rule of thumb right\nBut the fact of the matter is is if you have Ninety percent of your money in stocks bonds and mutual funds maybe we should rethink you know and rebalance a little bit right right maybe work with somebody that's more familiar with working with retirees\nSee a lot of a lot of financial professionals out there are more apt to working with people in the building in accumulating phase\nAnd not so much the retirement phase of life the distribution phase they they might tell you they are and they might just put you into a conservative account you know and say oh this is rebalancing your going to put you in a conservative account but\nYou know what though it's important to do two things protect your principal but also have the opportunity for really good growth yet okay and there are ways to do that\nWithout just you know going into a conservative portfolio because if you go into a conservative portfolio a which I've seen a lot of these portfolios and it's not everybody but I've seen some of these\nYou know a lot of the times you're not going to make you know any any more than five percent you know you're you're in a very conservative portfolio or I Will we want you to actually have the opportunity to still have market like returns equity like returns\nBut limiting your risk on your principal and you can do that and you can do that with us if you come in and see us\nSo this is something that interests you you know feel free to give us a call at any time you can reach us at eight five five three one eight eight three eight seven if you're interested in trying to protect that principle\nAnd uh you know try to you know also had the opportunity for market like returns and you just don't feel that you're really seeing that option where you're at\nYou know are you on a second opinion you know give us a call ... or ... or send us attacks that eight five five three one eight eight three eight seven\nYou know there's other steps that you need to look at it as well\nWith your current portfolio you know what are the fees that you're paying with your current portfolio\nRight mhm what are the fees that you're taking on because\nIf you have a seven percent return but your current portfolio is ... is charging you a two percent the annually what really what's the none of that ... percent right right so you know you might as the fees off of the seven percent if you have to present the you're really netting five percent return\nSo you have to look at what type of fees your pain and it's sometimes when you get your statements it doesn't disclose all the fees that your pain so what we like to do and families come in and the U.S it's called the Morningstar report David ... the morning star report is like a car facts we caught we we try to compare it\nYou know so that people can kind of see what we're looking at here it's like riding in a car facts on your car you're not going to buy a car without running a car facts on uh right right it's been an accident or you know to see how that vehicle is right\nWell it's the same thing with a Morningstar report that Iran on your portfolio it's going to tell you what the the mean return is your what you should be averaging in return how much risk you're taking on with your current portfolio\nThe the structure to your portfolio the hidden fees that you can see by just looking at your statement the correlation between investments you know because\nWhat that means is or if the investments are alike\nRight to one another maybe one has a higher fee than the other well maybe you should drop that investment\nThe biggest value that I see what the morning star report though is standard deviation how much your money can fluctuate\nIn gains and losses in a thirty day period of time a six month period of time a year and I'm a ... right now the thirty day opportunity for laws and the opportunity for gain is is that they should focus on I think almost the most\nBecause if you see the opportunity of loss of up to thirty to forty percent in a thirty day period with your portfolio and you're in retirement\nYou should probably rethink the portfolio that you have right right I mean there's an opportunity of loss of thirty to forty percent was or fellow that you having a thirty day period in ... and you've worked thirty forty fifty years to make this money and you lost forty percent of it in thirty days yeah that's\nA huge drain hole you know I I mean that would be very devastating right obviously be a devastating situation so you just really want to be careful especially with where the market is today you know we're we're sitting here at all time highs interest rates are all time lows um\nYou know there's deficit is at all time high is um you know we're we're sitting I'm kind of a little bit of a teeter totter at the moment you know and I'm not I'm not sitting here predicting the market because nobody can right\nI mean I've told you before I had this crystal ball in my office for Fifteen Years never worked in a ever worked right so I don't try to predict the market but what I Do is I I I proceed with caution\nRight right well you have to be proactive though right you have to be proactive and and part of that pro active\nStrategy is you know you kind of touched on it the the pillars of retirement planning to include the protection and trying to get

call or text at eight five five three one eight eighty three eighty seven\nSo Jake you know in this area that we're in\nThe high cost of nursing homes is re Dick us but we don't want to go broke so what's the first thing that we can think about it or help us out here\nYeah so the high cost of nursing home or in New England is a very scary thing to think about you know we're talking three to five hundred dollars a day you know when I moved here from Wisconsin Fifteen Years ago\nI was astonished at just the cost of living in general but that supply and demand you know I I Love living in in Massachusetts I really do um and\nAnd so I take you take some of those are the cost of living in a can federation when you you find a destination where you like to live you know\nBut when you talk about the supply and demand for nursing home I feel that families really are being taken advantage of I really do I mean you're talking three to five hundred dollars a day for a nursing home when you get to the level of needing the skilled nursing you know right\nAnd so there are some planning strategies that are available for families that are really unknown\nAnd we are going to educate you on these today um I actually started my career off in the Medicaid field in financial services I\nHad a great mentor\nHe was able to train me and educate me on how to help families protect themselves from the high cost of the nursing home expenses\nAnd so we're going to talk about some examples today and how you can protect you and your family from those high cost first of all obviously you can always if you're a baby boomer you can you can invest in long term care insurance we talked about that in the last segment I think it's extremely important for the middle class\nListen if you're extremely wealthy you really do need to worry about it right if you're worth five million dollars you're not going to be concerned about the high cost of nursing home I'm Talking about the families that had a million dollars or less okay\nIn right now in retirement you might you might feel like you're living the dream OK mhm but I can tell you right now as time goes on and if you ever get to that point of needing that nursing home care\nIf you buy long term care insurance now you're going to be so thankful when that time comes but even if you buy long term care insurance and you get to the point of needing a nursing home it's still most likely not going to cover the full cost most people go into assisted living first\nThey use or long term care insurance and then they go to the nursing home around what I'd like to talk to you today about though is how to protect a let's see we have a husband or wife right and one of those falls ill ah depending upon the age it really is not not relevant as long as you have a husband and wife\nThey could be in their six fifties sixties seventies eighties nineties whatever it is\nBut if you are if you have a family member or you're in this situation where you have a healthy spouse you know about how the spouse and their their spouse is in need of skilled nursing listen up please\nBecause this is a strategy that you can take advantage of to protect the healthy style so let's talk about this we have\nWe're going to use the husband as the spouse that needs care I can never put the wife in that situation or being a male okay so we have a husband or wife the wife is healthy at home okay and her husband is in need of a nursing home All right\nWhere they're in a position they're in a crisis situation where they're paying a anywhere from three to five hundred dollars a day\nAnd she's feeling right\nShe's feeling the money going out every month and it's it's scary it's scarier ... there's no doubt it's scarier okay so what the state of the commonwealth of Massachusetts the state of New Hampshire state of Rhode Island they're all pretty pretty much the same\nThey allow we're going to call it the healthy spouse in unhealthy spouse okay so they allow the healthy spouse which is the wife to protect her home\nPlus roughly a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in assets so let's say that this family has a paid for her home and a half a million dollars of liquid assets alright pay for home and a half a million dollars well she's able to protect her home in a hundred and twenty thousand so what does that mean that means that\nThree hundred and eighty thousand ...\nEighty thousand dollars is subject to his nursing home costs as far as the states or the commonwealth sees it\nWell we don't like that no especially if she's if she's really young yeah because of the fact of the matter is she might have a lot of time on her side and you know she might have another Twenty years of retirement in front of her who knows\nShe might have another ten years of her retirement it doesn't matter the the point is is a hundred and twenty thousand dollars is not a lot of money", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Gun Talk",
