there's another story in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp is is running for reelection she's a Democrat\nAnd uh she is she is now down\nTen points to her Republican challenger who's a congressman and you know North Dakota is one of those states\nThat only ... they have so few people that they only have one Congress but so the congressman also like the senator represents the entire state and he's running ahead of her she's she's pretty much on the she's pretty much gonna have to vote against Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd are they the percentage of people in North Dakota want Kavanaugh confirmed is even a greater than in West Virginia\nMeanwhile Mitch McConnell was badgered at the at the Reagan National airport yesterday by anti Kavanaugh activists that just happened to be a TV crew working with them\nUm they they said that he was pro rate and the are the people who were heckling him more than a fight is Tracy quarter\nThe center for popular democracies quote unquote racial

Republicans pointing out all the holes in the the testimony of a Christine Blasey Ford\nBroadcast news networks last night a continued to hammer away at the sexual assault allegations using the seventh FBI inquiry into Kavanaugh's passed this latest news fuck however\nThey devoted only a miniscule portion of the cabinet coverage to the memo that was released a by sex crimes prosecutor Rachel metro\nAnd of course again that was a it was a pretty thorough\nOr the bounty of\nMany of her rock claims we've actually got a new allegation and ... what's that there was a party at a frat\nAfter Kavanaugh had graduated that included sex acts with a stripper yes and there's no evidence that Kavanaugh was there or that he was a participant but senator Coons has decided before the allegations to Grassley anyways\nOkay so graphically basically just sent him back a letter that said you believe that they may yeah so\nThis is this is like the one in uh in Rhode Island where he he and a judge or were charged with rape being a woman on a boat in Newport Harbor and or at Sheldon Whitehouse went running with that to uh to to Lindsey Graham\nValley it was a grassy rights we've reached a new level of absurdity with this allegation there's no evidence that judge Kavanaugh was anywhere near the party or had anything to do with it at all in fact the only person we can be sure attended the party with the accuser himself\n[laughter] if there's another one to hear I I Can't even I I Can't even find them all now but\nA ... now there's another story here this is by I think by NBC text messages suggests half an hour wanted to refute accusers claim before it became public this is a Ramirez claim you know where she says there gaps in her uh her her\nMemory because she was drinking so heavily and she she had to spend six days talking to her lawyers and a ... and ... before she could decide the Capitol I may have exposed himself to her\nAnd she also was texting friends asking that I ever tell you about this and uh so so now now that now it somehow bad that Kavanaugh want it to refute the accusers claims before they became public\nSolve this I mean this is what the this is what they're up against this what the he's up against here and but I I don't think it's I don't think it's working I don't think anything is fixing cars that there's nothing there is no they're there to quote

he heads to Mississippi for a campaign appearance tonight on behalf of the Republican Senate candidate down there and um\nIt's a Trump engaged in suspect tax games as he reaped riches from his father he reaped riches from his father you inherited money and\nThen here's a quote I mean a lot of this a lot of this story by the way is a is a critique of of the New York journalist who covered Donald Trump including the New York times\nI built what I built myself Mr Trump has said a narrative that was long amplified by off incredulous coverage for news organizations including the New York times\n\n[noise] of course the story of how Donald Trump got rich can not be reduced to handouts from his father but that's what we've done in the headline we've reduced it the handouts from his father 'cause that's all anyone's gonna read no who's ... who's got time to read all this they say that\nA Trump by the time he was three years old was making two hundred thousand dollars a year as part of Fred Trump's effort to hand is money down\nWell pretty good for a three year old [noise] well I you know there are guys that\nHave they have they're the guys in the launch woman's union in

aggressive journalism or back to this again I'm just you know I Can't even got time to read the whole thing\nIt at a better by less than aggressive journalism Mr Trump has made sure his financial

Nineteen Ninety three and a Washington DC bar and you're Wisconsin circle I did was going away party for\nA TV anchor I left the party to go to a bar to buy a soda I haven't drunk alcohol since my Eighteenth birthday\nAs I sat alone at the end of the bar Julie approached me she was alone quite beautiful well dressed in no drinking hand consequently my initial thought was she might might be a high in hooker call girl because at the time I weigh three hundred and fifty pounds so why would someone like her what with ...\nWhat what someone like her walk with someone like me I'd never been hit on with a bar on a bar before so he starts um\nHe's he ah he starts senior\nI felt she only had an interest in my three hundred and fifty pounds self because I was on television and well known\nAnd she he says he resisted having sex with her uh he was having marital difficulties during a conversation about our sexual preferences things got derailed when Julie told me she liked to have sex with more than one guy at a time\nIn fact sometimes with several at one time she wanted to know that would be okay and our relationship\nI asked her if this was just a fantasy of her she responded that she had first tried sex with multiple guys well in high school and still liked it from time to time she brought it up because she wanted to know if I Would be interested in that\nSo he's he sees what's going on here and he says uh I was ... he has a new wife and I guess he's lost a lot of weight and all this I was deeply troubled and felt a moral dilemma do I reach out and tell the truth of what I Know and risk family relationships to remain silent\nUm I Know I also know what it's like to be accused of something significant that I didn't do it when I Believe because of this and the turtle considerations meeting I guess the afterlife to pressure on me bill throughout the afternoon I had to explain my my wife and three years what happened twenty five years ago before we met in long

L.\nThese police in Boston as a legendary shelter for homeless women it relies completely on the kindness of its volunteers\nVoice of Boston give you a lot about one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and my heart radio station [noise]\nFrom ABC News on the richest man just\nAnd and have a girl so that's you know case by case basis but I can tell you one thing about stocks [noise]\nWell I guess there's two factors the market is driven based upon to things fear and greed okay we have the fear of obviously losing money money market correction\nBut it's also the greed of we want to make more and there's nothing wrong with that you don't want to lose out on an opportunity I guess that were greeted kind of sounds a little aggressive\nBut it it's more based upon you don't want to lose out on an opportunity you know you know not mean that you're greedy you just don't want to lose out on an opportunity that presented itself which is very common you know I I'm I'm right there with you on that\nBut you have to be practical to a certain extent you know when when is enough enough\nI don't know enough is enough that you're everybody has their own has their own portfolio in their own decisions to make so that you know that is something you need to look at but I was thinking about something the other day David I was drawn out my wife or I was looking at this uh prospectus\nAnd it said the average rate of return on this ... perspective was like six percent right mhm and when I was drawn out the numbers on it you know I was thinking\nYou know what what's the real rate of return though when I you know from from this from say two thousand I think Iran or from two thousand six to to present time or maybe it was and before that two thousand two thousand three to present time\nI think yeah I think that was a window that we rent it\nAnd when we looked at it\nThe ... you really got to look at what's the rule rate of return right and let me let me give an example I guess what I'm Talking about here\nSo if you have a hundred thousand dollars and I and I got to be a little dramatic on this to make this work but let's just say we have a hundred thousand dollars or or you know what I'm going to get it and I'm going to give you some real life ideas of what happened\nSo we have a hundred thousand dollars we're talking about stocks or hundred thousand dollars market goes down in two thousand eight actually this is the S. and P. five hundred which is the five hundred or you know supposedly best stocks in the industry today right and\nAnd the market in two thousand eight corrected itself by thirty eight percent\nOkay so if we had a hundred thousand dollars in a corrective itself by thirty eight percent what do we have in our portfolio\nSixty two sixty two thousand right you know what it took those clients to get back to just there a hundred thousand dollars several years\nAs well as ... as far as a return Oh yes and yet we took him a several years it took them sixty five percent in return to just get back to the hundred thousand dollar mark\nThere where they were their money right so you know the average rate of return if I give you an example of a hundred thousand dollars and you lose fifty percent of your money now you're fifty thousand dollars right right if you make fifty percent on your money after that what\nDo we have if you make fifty percent on fifty thousand dollars we have Seventy five thousand dollars right you have an average rate of return of zero but you're still down twenty five thousand dollars\nSo you just have to be careful of these average returns and ... or you know what's the real return right right the river turn is how much my account is valued at that's the real return so you just\nHave to look at those and be careful but there's a lot of good stocks out there I mean look at Amazon today blowing you know the top off of I mean it's just unbelievable I'm I Wish I would've got in on the ideal when Facebook came out right I mean it's unbelievable how you know that's you know it's had a little trouble eight and a deal and its way higher than when it started with\nAnd it's interesting that you're pointing out to tech stocks that have really taken a hit over the last several months in in twenty Eighteen yeah but you know yeah and and those are the yeah and those are the like the little red flags that some economists are saying is\nCould be you know a sign that the recession is just around the corner yeah yeah so I think that's where as investors you're thinking hey I've got money in the stock you know I've got a good our ally rate of return return on my investment\nAnd uh they're thinking I Want to stay in it until I get the most out of it before it turns the Newbery market yeah so that's the whole guessing game right\nYeah and it's all about balancing out your portfolio you know if you're really stock I mean sometimes people will come in and they're they're in retirement and they have Ninety percent of their Ninety five percent of their money in equities which are stocks right mhm and I'm like oh my God\nYou know you have to balance out I mean the rule one hundred you know the rule one hundred comes into play with that\nYou know you take a hundred minus your age right so if you're sixty five years of age you take a hundred mine is sixty five what do we have left we have we have thirty five in what Wall Street says this is what Wall Street says you should not have more than thirty five percent of your money at risk insecurities\nIf you're sixty five years of age now I'm not saying I agree with that but that is the rule of one hundred okay right so let's let's put it in perspective though if you're if you're Ninety percent of your money inequities\nAnd you're sixty five years of age you should probably bring that down a little bit to maybe fifty percent right so you know these are concerned that you have\nAnd and maybe you have a portfolio that you're looking at um you know and you want a second opinion on what's going on here I mean once you've just come on and I mean we can do a Morningstar report for you we can break it down we can really look at what you have which are invested in you know you can reach me at eight five five\nThree one eight eight three eight seven that's eight five five three one eight eight three eight seven or shoot us uh taxed at the same number\nWhere you can visit us a lottery financial dot com\nUm you know so there are other security is out there as well David you know there are there are mutual funds\nMutual funds or the or the key to safety\nYou're asking me [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nI wouldn't be at a yes or no I Would yeah no yeah thank you they they minimize\nRisk they don't eliminate risk OK okay if you go back and look at your portfolios in two thousand eight and you open up your portfolio and you had mutual funds I can assure you you had mutual funds or exchange traded funds pretty much similar very similar investments\nYou took some losses I guarantee you in two thousand eight you'd still lost probably thirty to forty percent of your money\nAnd so you are invested in mutual funds and I can tell you right now they're good they help you to diversify\nThey minimize risk they don't eat a lemonade the risk All right\nUm how about bonds bonds bonds or concerns of my uh I have a big concern about bombs right now\nBecause of interest rates are rising\nBecause interest rates are on the rise and ... all time low is right and ... interest rates went interest rates are low bond rates go up and then vice versa when interest rates rise bond rates go down right right so if you never any more than the income from the bond you'll be okay\nBut still you know bonds aren't aren't in my opinion something that heavily haven't you know your money invested in there is some bond replacement ideas over in the savings to side which will be talking about later you know how 'bout variable annuities\nAre to you they are like the New York Yankees of financial tools right\nYou know there are certain annuity products out there that I Am a fan of the variable annuity is not one the biggest reason that I'm not a fan of variable annuities is because they have what's called an\n... and e fee and ... and e fee\nThat stands for mortality and expense the your body in life insurance inside of your annuity product\nI Am not a fan of that if you want to buy life insurance go by life insurance\nGo by life insurance go by your term life insurance or your whole life you know ... I'm not a big fan of using my four one K. and my four three B or my my retirement dollars right my IRAs\nI Am not a big fan of using my IRA money to buy life insurance so let me give me an example of how this works is real quickly here if you have a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd then you take a fifty fifty percent ... we got to be a little dramatic or you take a fifty percent hit well you're alive\nYou can spend fifty thousand dollars okay if you should pass away your beneficiary because of your life insurance inside of your new to product brings your beneficiary back up to your original value of a hundred thousand dollars\nSo they get a hundred thousand dollars they're brought back if that's a it's a way to hedge against the loss of that investment All right\nBut you know we're not we're not investing in things to to anticipate the loss right but in ... the mortality and expense people run you anywhere from one\nYou know I've seen him at one point to one point five one point six percent just for that feel alone the average fee for a variable annuity is about two and a half percent so in order to make five percent on your variable annuity you have to make you know seven and a half percent on your money\nSo you know if you had a variable annuity please come see me please come see me we'll ... we'll look at it very closely we'll take a look and and uh make a recommendation where you're not paying all these fees so these are\nThat interest you give me a call shoot me attacks eight five five three one eight eight three eight seven that's eight five five three one eight

we're continuing our\nLook at the seven most common financial tools and it should be noted that this is kind of like what you talk about er during your live events that you have a throughout the Boston area and yup yeah and uh so we kind of looked at the security side all the risks\nSo now we want to kind of look at the saving side all the things that are about safety\nSavings tools and so we always talk about the securities versus savings tools um is how we look at it and the differences in you know how you how to balance out your portfolio right how to balance it out\nSometimes using the rule of one hundred which we talked about um you know the rule of one hundred you take a hundred in your mind is your age right and this is what Wall Street says a hundred and your mind is your age\nSo if you're sixty five years of age you take a hundred miles of sixty five ... five ... so what Wall Street says you should not have more than thirty five percent of your money at risk\nAnd when I when I think about risk I think about securities which are stocks bonds mutual funds in variable annuities on the liquid assets side now I don't necessarily agree with the rule of one hundred\nI'm just I guess there's a compromise right I mean thirty five percent is pretty low I feel\nBut you know listen if you have a portfolio that you look at the pie chart\nOkay you look at the pie chart in Ninety percent of your money is in equities and you're sixty five or seven years old and looking at retirement we're with where the market is today maybe you should rethink what you're doing because we don't\n... I have a crystal ball in my office that has been sitting there for the past twelve years and I'm going to tell you right now that thing hasn't spoken to me yet and tell me what to tell me what the market is going to do\nYou got to get your money back on that [laughter] we we have no\nIdea what the market is going to do it could keep running ... not as a bull market for the next Twenty years mhm or we could have a correction and the next year who knows nobody knows\nYou know I was watching videos or I think I might have mentioned this to you David now to get too much off the subject that I was ... I was watching these Youtube videos from Bloomberg CNBC after the market's market close you know I was just going back\nAnd um this was back in like two thousand twelve thousand Thirteen and you know how they were talking about all the markets are high you know a guy who got to be looking for a correction coming soon and you know none of that happened none of that happened it's been another six years almost\nOf just a bull bullish markets\nAnd so none of these guys know what they're talking about [laughter] really they don't know when the time is going to come right he just do not control it they might know what they're talking about but as far as predicting the market they have no idea what they're talking about because nobody can predict the market okay if someone out there could\nThey wouldn't be worth billions of dollars right mhm and they would give us all the answers and we'd all be rich so obviously there is no way to predict the market but\nIf you are concerned about not having to worry this is how I look at it if you don't have to worry about the opportunity for lost any longer right 'cause it's just more about enjoying your retirement you have this mistake that you've created over the past\nThirty forty fifty years of however long you worked right you've accumulated these assets you had this money do you have enough money that you feel that you can live off of for the rest of your life if you just had between three four five six seven percent returns\nAnd if you do feel that way then maybe you don't need to be shooting for the stars anymore\nAnd trying to obtain twenty percent returns\nWith all your money inequities okay or if you know hey let's be safe and let's move into a bond portfolio well right now bonds aren't aren't a great topic in my opinion either and those are considered the safer investments so in savings tools\nLet's talk about let's talk about the savings to us because we know there's one thing we know about savings tools your principal cannot go up or down due to the market conditions and that is a very very valuable attribute about savings tools", "show_name": "Gun Talk", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "06"}
