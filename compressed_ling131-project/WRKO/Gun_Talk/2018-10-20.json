Native American it it it could be Hispanic so her name was ... she can change your name from Elizabeth\nWarren to Elizabethan till Warren like the bust out the Texas Senate candidate whose pretending she's pretending to be an Indian and he's pretending to be Hispanic so\nMy question is if you are one sixty fourth Asian is that enough for Harvard to discriminate against you\nRight I well but anyway listen so here it is so so then about like an hour after they post the story they say a correction\nUm the range isn't from one thirty second to five hundred won five hundred and twelve that's for one thirty second to one one thousand and twenty four and so again I'm not a I'm I'm not very good at math\nBut I said to myself well if the if the upper range is faults than does at the bottom range have to be false to I mean it's not like basic\nMath\nBut the you know so we used to I we started referring to it as one sixty fourth and the Breitbart News started referring to it as one sixty fourth but the globe kept running with it because they want to allow all the moon bats that put their Facebook pays postings up saying that it's one third but she's she's got evidence\nSuch as it is claiming but she's one thirty second\nBut it was false so finally about a half hour ago they posted a second correction saying but at at most she is one\nSixty fourth India\nOr native America or non white and of course here's the thing the average\nWhite America and the average American or European descent has more Native American blood than she apparently does but she's claiming to be in India and she's claiming that she has a right to uh to have gotten and affirmative action position first at the University of Pennsylvania and then at Harvard University law school\nAnd of course we have powwow chow or cook\nWhat one fifty five Elizabeth Warren she's a member of she's a Cherokee wedding to this was before the Cherokee and her uh her her she's got several recipes and here they're all lifted from various places my favorite is called on what with crab meat which lifted from uh New York times French cookbook All right\nAh [laughter]\nYou know this is this is just such a such a crock ... and it's so classic of\nThe Democrat Party and the mainstream media the print fake news and then\nCorrect the fake those after the uh after\nThe lives have gone around the world and are are already posted and so tonight I guarantee you if you go to the the usual left wing cable news cast they will still be repeating a lie which is already a been retracted\nBy the uh additional fake news outlet to report it the Boston Globe that she's one\nThirty second India but you know what it doesn't even matter if she's one thirty second Indian that's not good enough the claim to be an Indian\nWhether it's a bureau of Indian affairs standards whether it's the a tribal role she she claims she's part Cherokee part Delaware that's not good enough she's not in India\nIf they if they were printing truthful headlines in the in the all left media the headline would say white woman's DNA past proves she's white woman or a DNA test confirm Elizabeth Warren\nFake it's a fake ending 'cause that's what she is she's a fake Indian\nDidn't achieve some attacks there says didn't the Cherokee Nation state that done her ancestry and could not find any connection yes of course yeah she's a she's a fraud\nShe's a fraud and now they're saying that the oh she's she's proven that she's in ... she is she's proven she's proven she's not in India and and we don't even know where this DNA test wasn't fun\nShe gave it to some uh Stanford University professor who is a a I guess he's a biochemist these not even a geneticist these of I think a biophysicist\nAnd dies he they let him do the analysis the quote unquote analysis of the DNA and he's and he's given her this uh this this bill of health although it's not a bill of health is just proving she's not in India\nAnd yet they're gonna yet this is going to be this will be today's big ally from the ... left media Elizabeth Warren prove she's in India\nNo she's not by the way back in the er back\nIn Jim Crow south used to have this thing called the one drop rule if you were ... were had one drop of black blood didn't matter if you were like one sixty one thirty one sixty fourth black you were considered black so now Elizabeth Warren\nHas returned to her party's a Jim Crow Ku Klux Klan reconstruction bays and she's she's reclaiming but one drop rule the one drop rule she's got she's got\nMay be may be probably not one drop or maybe one one hundredth of a drop of a Native American blood in her I'd I'd say they'll nothing and uh she's climbing she's an Indian\nEight four for five hundred a forty to forty two of the highway car show will take a lot

call a five five three one eight eight three eight seven or online at Lowry financial dot com so Jake what is causing so much confusion with annuities\nYou know David there are a lot of different kinds of annuities right there are so many different kinds of annuities you know there are the immediate annuities the new lady that can give you an immediate\nIncome and really maximize your income in retirement we call that the mailbox shack or the pension right and that's\nAn immediate annuity you give us a lump sum amount of money or the insurance company a lump sum amount of money and in return they're going to guarantee you an income stream for life okay\nThere's also people are also looking at investment or a annuities\nAs a growth tool or principled protection tool\nEverybody's always focused on annuities being there for just their income\nBut really it can be a a growth tool is well within what I mean by that is you can get the insurance company a lump sum amount of money ... your principles always guaranteed as far as are facing market volatility and second a face any market volatility\nMeaning you can't lose money based on the market returns 'cause you're not actually invested in the market\nBut they will provide you with strategies an index\nThat your earnings can be based on\nAnd you know some of these can be very appealing over the last ten years we've had clients come in with some double digit returns based on these investments\nAnd uh you know that's not something that's obviously a guaranteed to you because your return is based upon the index that she will act could be the S. and P. five hundred could be GAPP Morgan's index that they have or Merrill Lynch's index\nBut that is more of a growth strategy that do that the insurance company will have your money over a period of time usually between five seven or nine years\nYou do have liquidity but there is liquidity risk because they limit you to how much liquidity you can you know take out usually seven to ten percent so that would be a deferred annuity those are usually the two types immediate and deferred annuities\nAnd the name of our show folks his mask wealth radio creating financial freedom with Jake Larry and that's exactly what he was explaining to you and\nI'm Dave Thompson your host and Jake is the founder and president of Lowry financial group they're located on south shore on derby stream hang them and they also have satellite offices and walk them and Beverly and to reach Jay simply call eight five five three one eight eight three eight seven\nThat's eight five five three one eight eight three eight seven or online at Lowry financial dot com\nSo you're talking about these annuities and how they're helpful I mean it's almost partly like there are four pillars to retirement and you know that's protection growth potential liquidity and income and so the annuity can also be part of that protection as well as the growth potential yes\nAbsolutely one hundred percent there's there's three types that I really look at with are from writing like I said the immediate which you get to the income right off the bat the fixed indexed annuity which is the one that you give a lump sum amount of money your principles protected\nBut your earnings are based upon an index that you will act in that can be changed\nAnd then there's the fixed annuity like for instance my father called me up a\nA last week you know they have a couple of hundred thousand dollars in a checking account right now right and and he's like Jake we made five hundred dollars in returns on our money market last year with two hundred thousand dollars invested I said dad that's terrible and obviously he knew that as well mhm\nSo he's going to take you know I think we need to take it a hundred thousand dollars of that money I think that's a number we settled on\nAnd with a fixed annuity he's going to get three point eight percent guaranteed for five years we call that a CD alternative okay\nSome of them will offer liquidity options he has a ten percent free withdrawal every single year over those five years shall he needs the money so over a five year fixed annuity he\nActually has liquidity within that period of time at ten percent per year which I thought it was amazing\nRight so it works while it's protecting while it's also growing at the same time ... that's the beauty of an annuity right but what are some of the risk them that that are involved\nSo there can be different risk like I said there's a lot of different types of annuities out there when I ask a client I have clients come in my office and I'll ask him I'll say what are your thoughts on an annuity\nAnd ... and there's a fair amount of people do say I hate him and I'll say why\nAnd they will not know how to respond they will say oh you know the high fees or\nOh there's no growth opportunity with them and I say so you're telling me if I can present you would have a fixed indexed annuity that has no annual fee right and ... and could potentially as on kept growth which there are the opportunity for ... growth so it could grow\nExponentially I mean it could grow you know who knows it could have double digit returns would you be happy with that\nThey say yes I said the only risk that you're really taken on with the new things that we talked to families about\n'cause I don't like annual fees and okay there are new to that in your piece you're taking on liquidity risk liquidity risk is the biggest factor involved with the newly there's always going to be a cost to your investment okay it's either a fee on an annual basis\nOr the cost is going to be time right mhm you are investing your money for a period of time they average Inuit is five years seven years nine years ten years\nAnd they have your money over that period of time it if you were to wake up in the second year into your fix the next annuity and say I need all my money out of that fixed indexed annuity you're going to pay what is called they surrendered charge\nAnd that's surrender charge is going to be anywhere depends but pardon the product but if you're in a let's say nine your product and if you're too\nIt could be between nine and seven percent of your principal value so you want to make sure that you're not investing all your money into that all your eggs in one basket right just like any other investment you don't want to put all your eggs in one stock or one egg all your eggs in one bond\nWhere you don't want to put all your eggs into fixed indexed annuities either but I think there's a fit for that vehicle\nAnd a lot of people's ah portfolios\nThat's encouraging to hear\nYeah yeah you know the most retirees ... retirement accounts and savings

understand the majority of these folks\nPins are there for a reason\nYou know and the reason isn't always because I knew what he is something to avoid it at all costs for some an annuity can provide tremendous benefit\nIn may be that those negative opinions are shared by people who don't understand and do what he's well enough even to provide a comment on them you know I come across that so often I listen to the radio and\nI read an article and they're talking about a fixed index annuities and I'm like\nThat that this is not right that doesn't sound right to me they're not getting the big picture and others may have looked at a you know only into what they consider the negative\nAspects of annuities without having a full understanding you know David I'm a firm believer\nThat fixed
