{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "And it's not just about not hitting the gym you know it's about their worries it's about their and starting to it's about their stress you know for police officers about hyper vigilance and all these things you know you know you know create the perfect storm of you know you know that that stress woman that quarters all that makes it difficult to lose weight and that's just one tiny piece of the puzzle but\nUm what I Would tell anybody is first identify the barriers that most of the time has nothing to do with being fat and lazy but\nThe thing feeding that that that quote unquote fat and laziness then after that bears identified than we develop strategies and the strategies are custom tailored to the individual and an end to the organization you know [noise]\nThat's good I mean I Know a lot of police officers and it's certainly difficult when they're working the midnight shift you know you gotta you gotta live off of coffee and you know everyone's always joked about cops forever coffee and doughnuts and it's like well let's let's open\nAnd then you just get the food with the coffee that you needed ... donuts yeah it's it's so easy to fall into that and worked the overnight shift and you've got to get your kids to school in the morning and then now you're sleeping during the day and that's you know it's science has proven that it's very difficult to do so\nYeah absolutely and and the thing is we're dealing with a population ... ... what does the military or the police or we're dealing with a population where you know when you're feeling so low you can't go get high you know drugs are obviously not only taboo but they're prohibited\nAnd since it's prohibited what's not taboo is junk food so the closest thing to drugs I in my opinion is is junk food 'cause it makes you feel so good\nAnd stuff you know McDonald's drive through every day you know when you feel like crap you know hence the term comfort food you just want crappy food and make you feel good but it only makes you feel that for about ten minutes and then you're ... you know you're in your lives again so\nThat that's one thing is just using junk food as medication and that's that's very common place and then the other thing is I'm\nStrategy being a micro work out you know I'm a huge fan of micro workouts I wrote a blog on it but\nYou know we're all or nothing society if if we can't go to a gym to look like Colorado or you know let's see our generation saw that the loan back in the days right\nIf we can look like and we're just not going to go to the gym at all if we don't have an hour to just throw around we just don't go to a gym at all um that's when we you know talk about strategies like micro workouts how about a five minute workout a ten minute workout you don't even need the gym for that\nYou know but we're just you know we can't go to the gym so we just don't work out it on you know I I I've been there I've I've lived through all of that you know we're at ... till this day I mean I'm almost forty I Wish I were the fitness fanatic but I'm not\nI rarely go to the gym you know I'm\nA lot of public health practitioners like using this term in a health marketing a slogan is or make the healthy choice the easy choice you know so I applied that everywhere so I don't bring ... yes I Do love pizza but I don't bring trap food home\nAnd and my door way every morning I wake up\nYou know I have a ... bar hanging there so the central pull ups and push ups and and that's about it you know I Wish I wasn't across it you know like Kyle I'm I Wish I was at the gym five times a week but but I'm not I mean I got kids I got a wife I got you know I got a business to run so um I find fitness another way\nThat you basically talked about you tell us about the the the state I think that if you've term to that\nYes catchy so so that was state or was being an acronym for worry uncertainty and stress or this is this is a barrier a ... and it's a mental barrier and it's a mental barrier that Twenty years of being in the military or eight years in the you know serving with Marines training Marines um and also being in the army\nI'm I've never heard anybody talk about these factories that affects the person's fitness levels so that was state worry uncertainty and stress\nThese are barrier so if you're finding that you haven't hit the gym in several weeks or several months for several years\nUh then that self taught that that cognitive bury ourselves telling ourselves that were fat and lazy that definitely gets in the way of you're not just your confidence about your self esteem um but\nThe wish they could be in the way so if you identify those inputs that worried that the sources of uncertainty or stress just work on mitigating those slowly and then you'll see that or you'll you'll start getting your energy back because the ... state does zap your physical energy\nAnd whenever you do have time the last thing you do that last thing you do\nWant to do is ... is at the gym so that those those are all ... really really good point um\nI Do want to you know I I Want to say again that the the websites prowl platoon dot com um you talked about energy and you know there's only so much energy as having a day and um you know so that's that's a really good you know acronym remember that\nUm and then the other thing I Would say is ... ... what does science say it's like Twenty one days to make a habit\nSo even a small little thing if you can you're listening now I can start it you could you could make the you know no matter what state you're right you could be better in\nIn three we got it it's it's funny you mentioned that because I've been wanting to write a blog on habit formation for the last several months but yes it takes about Twenty one day some form of habits so you know I'm you know we all you know New Years is coming up or I'll probably going to think of resolutions well one of those kinds of Fifteen pounds maybe get ready for a wedding\nAnd then we're all going to go crazy Googling or YouTube being you know six week Neal plans a six week fitness plan to all this other stuff but what you should be researching just spent ten minutes\nReading a few things on habit formation\nForm one habit don't try to create one hundred uh meals you know Neal perhaps you know at a time just just\nLearn how to form just one habit that one habit of\nYou know replacing a your breakfast with a healthier meal or just you know doing five minutes of all of a micro workouts a five minute workout\nSeveral times a week so I Would focus on ... on forming that's just that one habit and you know like like they say on the range you know slow as smooth as smooth as fast and slow and steady ones that race\nThat I think that's all really really good advice and you know what I started with was those Twenty one day habit forming you know goals would like you know have one ... one last sugary drink or\nA no sugar in your coffee just things like that you know really want a long way yeah absolutely\nAnd I think for some of the people listening to may have some already have some health issues that's kind of a bigger deal to sometimes it's just making getting a little healthier getting a little bit you know kind of incrementally getting back on track and you don't have to be exactly where they don't have to have a six pack six pack abs to be better off than you were a month for four\nAnd a lot of it's just about you know mobility and being able to hang out with your kids and your grandkids you know what I mean I mean to his what your goals are you know you don't have to run a marathon\nWill one was just what you were describing you know if you couldn't get through and do you all were co ... all of that stuff than what's going ... a\nFew months ago I had my ... ... ... ... ... ... you know rehab bring them there will be married for ...\nDoing\nSome work ... you know women who were ... is a better word familiar ... adjusting things some funding that ... ... ... ... yeah ... yeah yeah yeah so we will slow and study\nYes on steady slow and steady and ah you know I'm a huge um\nHuge advocate on a on some nutrition you know obviously that's what I have been talking about but\nIt you don't know the wonders of uh of what sound nutrition would do just eating right and and I'm not saying like a fanatic I mean there's a term that a lot in the medical data communities of kind of a dispute or won't accept but I mean a medical doctor a coined the term I'm ...\nI'm and if it's kind of sounds familiar it already kind of sounds like an eating disorder and ...\nIs is basically being ... so fanatical about your diet about just eating right\nTwenty four seven and and and just not even deviating but I there are some people like that but I'm not one of those guys I eat right about\nEighty five Ninety percent of the time and that keeps you that keeps me fit you know that keeps me fit it keeps me in shape I'm I'm not meal prep in you know my twenties was when I was as fanatic Neal prepping all the time but\nI don't have time for that stuff anymore well\nOne thing I learned was it was march one coming up water ... no ... putting a lot more room to Mars um\nYeah ... so we can have water and cows asking OK so a little fitness hack\nA little nutrition act um I won't say I'm going to guarantee this but if if you want to lose weight if you want to lose about two pounds three pounds in a week\nUm ditch all your soda and all your sugary drinks just for that one we can switch it up to water and uh I'm I'm pretty sure Ninety I I'll I'll bet on it that you'll probably at least two to three pounds of sugar and I wake and is is what's associated with overweight and obesity\n... bacon typing and [laughter] you know that gay bacon [laughter] you got to get a without nitrogen added though that's the\nThat's the way I see that's I don't even know they added nitrogen to make it out most of it as I just thought pigs were natural now I Do want observer to this man that's ... yeah well my wife is actually I joke about it I said I guess when we go get food I guess organic gays and think happy chicken supposedly taste better [laughter]\nAnd if you eat a happy chicken that isn't a now is that free range I mean I I Do think it's funny because like you say about kind of putting it in perspective I mean you go into a store sometimes and it'll say gluten free\nIt's got to be stopped and uh you know this is ridiculous they you know if the Dems think that this is going to pay off for them boy did they get a wrong number this time and I I don't I that's what I don't understand I I mean they you know ... ... ... have apparently a\nAccording to pray party but I've said don't do the to their candidates don't even talk about this because it's just going to you're going to be hemorrhaging boats and ... it's pretty clear isn't it\nYeah beaver state funding and says Byrne that's how you pronounce born in Cherokee I hadn't thought of that ... states that again how do you pronounce the Delaware [laughter] I don't mean Wilmington, Delaware I mean the Delaware Indian language\nOr how classic of war to reference the Southern Poverty Law Center which is itself a hate group exactly exactly and then you see the pictures from the hate group rally it said uh you know support the police\nAnd uh you know we back the blue oh that that's all it was it had nothing to do with Muslims and he called it she calls it a hate rally and but she doesn't she doesn't even know how to pronounce born or you know the three hundred and fifty one cities and towns in Massachusetts\nI Know very few people know all of those cities and towns\nI Know I don't know I occasionally running\nTown I've never heard of but you know what I Do know board fine [laughter] what\nDoes this tell you about her I remember one time when Kerry was the senator he was trying to\nA metal and some affairs down in the town hall and so you know I I I knew somebody in hall at some point you call 'em up off his office and that's when the last time he was in the hall of course he couldn't answer he'd never been a whole host of the way it is out of the way I mean honestly even if you live at all you know it's out of the way\nSome of some of the little point out you know and it's true thing in the ocean but yeah\nI think John Kerry knew where how was he could pronounce the word how I I don't have that\nFeeling about Elizabeth Warren I how [laughter]\nHow ... how does she have it on her ... she had it on on a cue Carter I'd know\nBurn the was it ... it and even if your aid even if even if you're a\nYou know just just some blow in drifter from the uh you know Bernie Sanders the Alexandria\nOcasio Cortez campaign just some you know local Soros drift there you know do you know how to pronounce born\n[laughter]\nI don't know I watched both of those debates she ... she was rotten last night in Springfield but she was worse on friday night with like somebody gave her a tranquilizer or something before the debate last\nCalmed down a little bit she was just screaming yelling on uh on friday night it was awful and just lying oh it's so many lives so I didn't call\nAny mind name like that and you know that\nOkay letting it play well it was in the intro play it ... this\nIs when I was here in Massachusetts go after people show up to testify in a trial when they threaten people said that they want to report crimes when women are ... important to stick to ...\nFrames someone in their family or want us there ... I\nThink anybody any safer that's fine but we need and that makes us safer but that is consistent with our family you know\nThat's that was more BS that was on the friday night debate and bright and uh she's ... we're going to have Todd lions on from the uh New England office of ice\nTo respond to those a vicious lies that she told about ice immigration and Customs Enforcement she lied about calling but not caught she said she didn't call the cops races she did\nShe lied about saying she didn't want to abolish ice she did say she wanted to abolish ice she lied about what ice did\nShe said she said her life was an open book yeah powwow child\nShe said she said three said when I was a kid college told me cost fifty dollars this semester and a\nGod Bless them Jeff deal called around them and says you know one reason colleges expense because now places like Harvard or paying three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to a part time to professors who teach one course\nI Wish you to call their out though I'm getting the interest rate loans from Harvard to buy her mansion and Cape ... at a Cape Cod in Cambridge excuse me getting I'm I'm just having a ...

assassins on two private planes landed earlier that morning with Sally diplomatic passports\nAnd according now to Turkish officials as well as U.S intelligence it appears that they were waiting for her because she who is a former one time Saudi Government insider close to the Saudi royal family now has become a prominent dissident\nAnd they waited for him to come in he came in he has not gone out\nHe has suddenly disappear he walked in they've no there's no footage of him walking out and it now appears that he was tortured\nAnd then executed in fact be headed in which then the Saudi execution ers took a picture of him being tortured and his actual severed head to the person who had hired them to do it\nAnd then afterwards chopped up his body dismembered it\nStuffed in several suitcases and then dry the suitcases into a black man with a black dark windows where they eventually disposed of body somewhere in Turkey the assassins took the planes and left straight back to Saudi Arabia\nAll of this leads to potentially the crown prince of Saudi Arabia he is effectively the godfather of the Saudi mafia state prince then sell them on\nThis is why Congress is demanding that if

call Lowry financial team at eight five five three one eight eighty three eighty seven or check 'em out online at Lowry financial\nDot com so Jake you know this segment we want to kind of answer some questions about fees because he had a big question we have is with all your retirement planning let's make sure that you're not paying too much\nRight exactly we have an analogy it's it's the shopping cart analogy in in your family David and I probably already know the answer to this\nQuestion but who lived as the grocery shopping in your family well that's that would be the smart one that would be my wife and I I I figured you were going to say that because most\nOf our wise you know the mom's I mean you know there are moms as well a lot of the times right\nUm my my wife says she has three children we have twins twin five year olds but she says she has three children right [laughter] so you know me being one of the right age ... and then there and they and then yeah ... ... is one of one of moms children [laughter]\nSo anyway uh we have this analogy it's\nThe shopping cart analogy and what it is is you know when when my wife goes grocery shopping you know or your wife goes grocery shopping maybe I'm tagging along\nShe's not just throwing things in her inner shopping cart you know just random things right mhm my wife has been you know she's got a mission she knows what she's going to get and you know she knows what that your costs what it should cost you know if she if she think pose a thing of spaghetti\nShe knows what that spaghetti is going to cost her when she goes to the checkout line right right\nUh you know me on the other hand I yeah I'm the guy that's probably just throwing things in the in the shopping cart [laughter] ah and she as I throw him in she takes them out right [laughter]\nBut um you know when she goes through a the grocery store you know she's she's taking things off the shelf that she wants to make for dinner for the week\nAnd she knows what those items are going to cost so when she gets to the checkout line right now and they're eyeing in it in a ... there's no surprises there is no surprise she knows if it's supposed to be you know\nTwo dollars and fifty cents and brings up at you know two fifty three for the whatever she knows that yeah that's about right you know that that's what it costs me ... you know\nSo the thing that we compared to is where we like to do is when you bring in your portfolio is we like to run your your your shopping cart through the checkout line\nOkay and see what you're paying for your portfolio\nSee a lot of people aren't aware of exactly what they're paying for their portfolios for their mutual funds you know for\nThe investments that they have variable annuities gosh we talked about variable annuities [noise] you know two and a half percent fee and the average variable annuity you know I tell you right now if you have one of those folks\nPlease come in and see me you know we'll talk about it but I Want to see the whole portfolio and what we'll do is we'll we'll put it to the Morningstar report and do the analysis so you can see exactly what your pain in the ... on your current portfolio\nBecause that's huge there's two things\nThat will that will deflect you from having your\nYour good rich or your your your quality return right you're let's say you have a return to six percent there are two things that will affect that six percent return fees and taxes mhm right", "show_name": "Gun Talk", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "27"}
