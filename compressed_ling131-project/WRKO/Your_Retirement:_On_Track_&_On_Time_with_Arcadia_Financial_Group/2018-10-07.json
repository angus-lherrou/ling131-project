of CD [noise]\n\nFrom ABC News' Sean ... twenty people are dead say New York state police had the crash site of a limousine near a\nBusy tourist spot in upstate New York overnight the updated debts announced just in the past our the crash site just go Harry about a hundred Seventy miles north of New York city this person from the area for dean Finnegan is on the scene\nMike let's go back to basics here just for a moment we hear diversification we hear that word a lot when we're talking about investing or retirement planning but how would actually work\nA lot of people already familiar with the basics of diversification you're considered diversified when you have a lot of different money in a lot of different places\nIf you have all your eggs in one basket and you can get yourself into some trouble ah Justin I notice all too well for whatever reason are are young boys are obsessed with eggs I think there's a couple of different cartoons or movies I've been watching with the characters are like playing around with the eggs\nSo I think it was maybe about a month ago we were taking the groceries and and you know this is on Justin I primarily but our youngest was carrying in the bag with the eggs in it what does he do of course he drops it right and all the eggs are broken right\nAnd so it was just like ... there's all your eggs in one basket for having toast for breakfast this week right so yeah if all of the eggs were in various bags when our son drop that one bag while there wouldn't have been as big of an issue now I don't expect the grocery store to accommodate for that but I think people understand what we're going for here\nI feel the set and they always been great diverse ... even when they were like ... babies are toddlers and we were trying to take away the pacifier I think that would get them on the house and then lo and behold they grab one from the crab that was him and then credit crevice or one from the car and all these different places one the toy box them like\nYou know what you're actually diversifying where you keep your pacify [laughter] so I Can't get them all away from yet\nBecause the boys have always been a creatures of convenience right they always wanted something to chew on within arm's reach\nYeah for sure and you know we know with diversification what effectively as giving us the ability to have some confidence\nFor an unknown future because we don't know how and when a bag is going to drop so to speak and what kind of form that is going to take you know I think most people primarily diversify themselves because at any given moment at least as far as the market is concern something bad could happen\nYou know a particular stock can go down in price look at G. E. this year who saw that coming right or sometimes it's a country or a currency an area of the market or sometimes it's like all these things in the market all at once but the idea that if we have all of our stuff\nAnd we actually met people over the years that had all of their money and gee in fact just last week at a seminar okay one of our very good clients came up to me and she said Michael I could kiss you I'm so grateful for what you did you did for us last year\nAnd I'm looking at her and I said what are you talking about what what specifically did we do and she goes well you remember of course my husband\nHe had all that money and she and you encourage them to sell it and he didn't want to do it he really loved the company and so it was funny I didn't remember this because it didn't matter if it was GE or some other company any climate comes to see us with too much money and like one particular place\nWe're going to recommend that they'd diversify because I said to them not because I had some great power of a ... here you can't keep all of your money and gee something happens to the company what's the likelihood not very high but if something were to happen you'd be in trouble\nAnd then of course lo and behold what happened G. E. R. nowhere really tanked this year so to to to them I'm now some sort of like savior like figure and it's entirely under deserve it you know we're just jumping\nIn the it's just again Seventeen many eggs in one basket\nSo diversification works because we just get all of your money out of too few things where if something were to happen to those too few things you can be in far too much trouble so we just try to edit most simple level break things up as a defense mechanism against the unknown and how far too often\nDiversification is not something that gets commonly reviewed as time goes by were busy right there's a lot of demands on our time whether it be our jobs are our family our hobbies\nAnd it's actually far too common for people to say to me like I actually don't know if I'm properly diversified I have no idea especially with retirement that much closer for me now if my money is in the right places and if you're wondering if that's true for your own situation\nIs probably long past when we may be considered having a chat I think if you call the office and spent some time with us here we'd be able to help you identify if your retirement is on track in on time and perhaps how reevaluating how diversification might help you would benefit your situation\nGive us a call today the number to dial is eight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty to learn about the power of diversification make sure that you don't have too many of your eggs and two are too few baskets\nThe website if you'd like more information to get to know my chest and the tea and Arcadia financial group that better\nYou can go to on track and on time dot com that website again on track and on time dot com making Jesse outlined diversification what it is how it works but why it's so important we have this diversification all buttoned up as you get closer to retirement will\nWe become that much more sensitive as we approach in transition into retirement because when that basket of eggs drops right when there's trouble in the market the impact is just different now\nIt's been a while and to her you know extent here we've grown a little bit complacent with the story that risk I guess tells\nMore specific to how it manifests inside of our lives you know in two thousand and eight when the market drop you know almost fifty percent that hurt a lot of people who are trying to retire because if they were taking too much risk well they had to go back to work or they had to delay retirement or live off of less money\nAnd all the diversification and the world if it was just specific to the stock market didn't really do much to defend them because both stocks and bonds didn't do particularly well that year\nAnd so as a result when we encourage people to do and this is how we started our program today was to think a little bit more globally diversification isn't just for stocks and bonds you know for a lot of people if you're going to really be able to defend yourself against these types of concerns you'll need to have different money that's played like not invested in the stock market\nWhat's in the bank you know do you have a pension to rely on in other words when there's trouble can we like depend on other sources of money to get you through those rough patches\nAnd some people do some people don't some people have no idea as to how they can even measure if they've got property diversification as related to their sources of retirement income\nAnd I guess that's the least that they have to make\nWe've got to stop looking at our portfolios that's just you know this place where we're trying to grow money and start really thinking about those accounts as places from which we're going to draw income\nAnd we're going to need that income especially when we're retired whether the market's doing well or when it's doing poorly and so sometimes diversification is going to need to go beyond the accounts themselves are certainly beyond the stock and bond markets to look at other options that retirees are using to generate income for themselves\nYou know it's always great when our clients are on the same page that this actually reminds me in the store and my dad told me once about his grandparents who I never met\nAnd um every week my great grandfather's stick as my great grandmother some some money like allowing so to speak for some dresses and cooking classes\nAnd things like that and uh she you know unknown hand just throw it away all the money 'cause she thought he was being too risky whatever he was getting at the time and lo and behold he came to her you know a few years later saying I lost all the money we have nothing left and she was like no\nYou down the same in all this cash or all the time for that now we like to see our clients both on the same page and not paying money under the border or grandma [laughter] you know but ah that truly was diversification and she saved ten and the rest of the family because of that\nIn other words you had money and it might have on them that are like a floor board right or talk to a doctor or something like that or it but in other words it was it was a place that you know it was diversified it wasn't in his hands it certainly wasn't in the markets so when something bad happened to them financially they were able to get through that\nRetirees to some extent need those types of accounts now certainly we don't encourage socked sock drawer here at the same time there are about\nHouse burned down a boatload of trouble\nRight there are ways that you can actually have money habits grow but also be protected against the various wings of the market and again\nThat's really the point of this exercise a diversification isn't just for your stocks and bonds retirement planning is far too important to leave to chance those that are going to be able to retire confidently knows that they have this proper amount of diversification\nGet it for yourself call today the number to dial is eight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to seven two twenty three forty two\nHow do you diversify to reduce your market risk and position your assets to grow my can just explain that coming up [noise]\nYou're listening to on track and on time with Michael end Jessica company ...\nTaxes you know people don't like it it can be stale and confusing\nBut this is where a lot of the action is because I think we can fool ourselves when we open up the mail and we get one of those monthly statements and we see how much money we have a I don't care what the number is on the front cover of your statement I might be two hundred thousand it could be a million or could be more\nNot all of that money is yours\nThe IRS has a lien against it to some extent the question is how big is that lean how much are you going to pay\nAnd very rarely do we think about this and we do our tax planning we look in the rearview mirror every April fifteenth and you know we put our beans in the right columns and then we send that ten forty off to the IRS and they had us on the head and they give us a little refund which I always chuckle because it's our own money back right\nBut that's not tax plan and that's tax preparing\nWhat happens in the next ten Twenty years where most people think taxes are going up\nAnd what are we doing about it and the answer I think for most people is they're not doing anything certainly not enough because the dialogue just isn't there\nSo when we talk about diversification we know that when we have a dollar and we go to save it somewhere I can choose to save it and my four one K. I can choose to say but in my bank account I can choose to open up an account with Charles Schwab and put it there what each trade writing them so we have these options\nAnd all of those options to some extent or another can be safe for focus on growth maybe a blend of the two but they're all tax differently in as a result what people end up doing is they chase whatever tax benefits or like in close proximity so what most people do is they're stuffing money into their four O. one K. is why\nBecause anything that you put into a four O. one K. you don't have to pay taxes on it today\nYet today the important in part of\nThat but for one caves or tax deferred right so that means the taxes are just do later you're not saving anything it's actually really of not a lot tax benefit there\nI think people celebrated when they go their accountant to do their tax return I may say hey you know and save them for your retirement plan this account and we can save the on paying these taxes\nAnd they feel that they're doing a great thing because one they don't have to pay money or not into their ... for their future and they feel so good when they leave there but then when they come see us we take a look at their planning that they've been doing you say you're in a heap of her later down the line\nSo Megan asked us you know how do we think more globally about diversification you can diversify your tax strategy maybe we don't stuff all of your money into a four O. one K. maybe we look at options where there's tax tax benefits in our financial future one of them are retired\nSo maybe we start stuffing that Roth IRA instead maybe we can convert some of your four one K. or IRA dollars to Ross\nMaybe we should be investing in tax free type of investments like in the municipal bonds\nThese are just some examples there are other options that we could take advantage of but what we do here at Arcadia financial group\nIs we review these options effectively to make sure that you're taking advantage of you know I've every single legal tax loophole shelter investment because oftentimes if we can keep most of that hard earned money in our pocket\nAs opposed to sharing it with Uncle Sam\nWell then a lot of things are possible in terms of increasing our income or the value of our state that will pass on to beneficiaries\nAnd a lot of situations it's not unusual for us to save people tens of thousands sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars in projected tax liabilities simply because of the way we're helping them read diversify\nHow they're going to contend with taxes and their financial future\nHere's what I Want you to do ask yourself the question how by actually ever spent any time looking at all the available shelters that are available and do I have peace of mind that my tax situation has diversified for my retirement future\nBecause if the answer is no looks change it today called eight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to seven two twenty three forty two let's have a consultation and see how tax diversification will save you in some cases\nMany many dollars and keep them in your own pocket for your retirement called eight eight eight Arcadia today\nIf you have money and a four O. one K.

time Meghan alongside the penny goes Mike ingest there the founders of Arcadia financial group conveniently located for you in Salem right offers Ninety three if you'd like to set up and visit with them they'd be happy to meet with you\nListen to what you want out of retirement and help you with that plan the phone number eight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two are spending time today on the show talking diversification why it is so important\nMike ingest you making a great case for it and we were talking about taxes how to diversify when it comes to taxation because taxes can be a really big component in retirement and some people don't realize that Mike\nHow much of that money that I've said is actually mine\nTowards the big question we have to ask ourselves especially if you have a lot of your money and four one K. or IRA all these accounts or tax deferred and effectively what that means is that while the taxes are due sooner than later there do as soon as you start taking distributions from the accounts certainly but even come Seventy a half\nThe IRS actually compels you to start spending that money through the are empty which is a required minimum distribution so taxes play a huge role in retirement into it\nNext time it's kind of like in like an an like an unexplored type of thing I find with most people when they do their retirement plan\nBecause even if they've been good little ... and they figured out how much they have to save and what they can afford to spend every month and you know hey do I have the right types of investments it's very rare actually that we've seen somebody who's actually nailed\nMaking sure that they're taking advantage of every single tax loopholes strategy shelter oh legal of course but we just need to make sure like\nHave we done that work and so I Want to like play along here and maybe use the unjust you and Meghan as proxies for our listeners because\nI Want to have some like participation here with everybody and really kinda gross like ground uh ourselves as to why taxes are so important can we do that you guys like mind being like stand in for early last year and\nWe're a taxes going in this financial future of ours in this country of ours right in the future our taxes do you think guys that they're going to go down or do you think they're going to go up a\nOh you had a um yeah I mean they're actually historically low right now our tax rates right right they are really cutting spending which I don't see it happening and I'm thinking they're going on I Would\nVenture to guess almost all of our listeners are agreeing with you guys there but the taxes are going up just you're you're hitting the nail on the head this country has a spending problem were Twenty one trillion dollars in debt and that number just increases by the moment right\nSo the only two ways out of that kind of a mess is to slash spending or to increase taxes and a as a result I mean I don't care if you're like on the red team of the blue team all the politicians in my adult lifetime have done nothing but increase spending\nSo if we know that they're not going to cut how much they're spending year on year we kinda have to count on higher taxes in our financial future do we not [laughter]\nAnd I know some people might be confused or try to bring up a counterpoint well hey Trump just cut taxes well he did and he also didn't write so I'm not denying the Trump tax cuts that you know whether or not their real of course they're real but they're also temporary\nAnd there's a very specific like procedural congressional reason that they're temporary\nAnd that's because they weren't offset the the the way it works in Congress when you proposed tax cuts if you want them to be permanent they have to be married to spending cuts and the Trump Administration did not do that so since we didn't cut spending the Trump Trump tax cuts could only be temporary\nSo as a result we already know this check this out Megan taxes are going up simply because by the year twenty twenty five ... there there are there after rather", "show_name": "Your Retirement: On Track & On Time with
