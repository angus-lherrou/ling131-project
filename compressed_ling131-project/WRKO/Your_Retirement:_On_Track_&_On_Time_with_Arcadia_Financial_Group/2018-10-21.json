Bianca is Mike and myself there and a whole bunch of farm out there that's going to wrap things up we'll see you next Sunday morning\nAt ten am right here or wicked by radio I have a great weekend everybody\nCan ... radio with Whitley is a presentation of [noise]\n\n[noise] oh boy so Boston you walk the walk about one hundred and twenty seven to ... like eighty to Boston and I aren't radio station [noise]\nRound ABC News\nSo you know risk is a funny word a leaf as it pertains to retirement because I think a lot of people use risk very specifically is kind of scary word but you know in my observation it's oftentimes people who have found a degree of comfort with risk\nThat achieve the most success over time because it's risk that allows your savings to grow best really overtime so typically people who have a good healthy relationship with risk oftentimes are able to save and save a considerable amount in for a lot of people listening they right now because of the relationship with risk\nProbably have the most money that they've ever had in their entire lives not only because they've been willing to take risk but because the markets been cooperating for so long\nRight but things are a relationship with risk change I Know for me it wasn't really necessarily getting married is just that you know kind of like\nCool my hot blood [laughter] it was definitely a having kids share and recognizing that the ... you know these little bogus here they they depend on me and I can't be a wild man anymore and stay out late and do crazy things to do something happens to dead you know these guys need me around to care for them provide that sort of thing\nAnd that relationship it changes to with money because\nAt a certain point in your life savings doesn't just become numbers on a piece of paper that you see on a statement or some kind of on line\nThe portfolio these or dollars and cents that you're going to have to live off of for the rest of your life especially wants to pay checks up\nYet that money now has meaning to a very important and meaning like you do when you're a teenager like no one's relying on me so maybe you take some more arrests but like when you said when you became a parent you think wow I have a lot of responsibility now people are counting on me I Can't let them down so let me put myself in check\nWith same thing when it comes to money when you're younger you just like oh just make more buys you get closer to retirement you think wow what am I doing with these dollars because they have to last as long as I did\nSo risky as a not only the thing that it for a lot of people get them to where they need to be where they are in a position to retire strangely enough it's that same risk that can now you know potentially jeopardize your retirement because\nIf the market works decide not to cooperate right at the outset of retirement we could really find ourselves in some hot water so I think for our show today we've only want to focus on the nature of how risk changes over time and what our listeners can do about it\nAll right Mario ... let's keep talking here\nJust feed the minute that was that your biggest issue Mike was just pedaled through the metal or or driving under the age\nNo I never really liked to go fast but we would do stupid things so like we would see if we could drive all the way to Taco Bell with me handling the whale from the passenger seat of my friend in the driver's seat with all the pedal and then like why someone would ask him we went in and stuff like that\nYeah I'm or sometimes we would like you know with someone was behind us we would like throw like a coffee ... like author hood just watched like the explosion just really ... listen I have you done any of us my\nWindow once and it was back in time maybe that was you way back then before any\nReally yeah so I I don't know if I can ever run for elected office about me but you know hey I was I was young and filling them\nAnd that's you know the kind of risk you take you're giving me a preview of what's to come maybe I'm the mom of the young boy\nOuch okay so moving right along and this is a retirement show ladies and gentlemen I promise you if you want to know that so far right\nBut I you know risk really is something you have to talk about\nWith your clients and this is balancing act what you do everyday helping people retire successful you have to create that balance it's like spinning plates in the air of one of those plates come crashing down it it shatters the strategy for retirement\nHow should we feel confident about our approach to retirement\nSo I'll tell you what here Meg and I think that the exercise is relatively simple assume that you've got some money saved you're looking to retire maybe in the next couple of months or years or maybe you're already retired and you get this lump sum of money\nAnd you're assuming that at a certain rate of return at a certain withdraw rate hopefully that money will ask you for the rest of your life but I don't think hopefully as a war that we want to use like in retirement I'd rather plant around and say worst case scenario and so in our office when people come to visit with us\nOne of the first exercises that we perform as a stress test what if the market went sideways or down violently right now how would that change the trajectory of your retirement would you be fine\nBecause that's the case I mean maybe that's the ... on the back that you need to know that you were in the right spot but if we run that stress tests\nAnd we identify that you would either need to go back to work or be forced to downsize the home or to change your lifestyle and reduce that monthly budget chances are you might be taking too much risk the risk is relative what's good for one person can be terrible for another so that's why I Would say if you've not subjected your plan to scrutiny to a second opinion\nYou certainly deserve it there's so much at stake and you can get that stress test them anytime meet with us complimentary constitution here in the office\nTo have that schedule just dial eight eight eight Arcadia\nThat's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty to let us know that you're interested in stress testing that retirement plan make sure it's a strong as it possibly could be and that starts with again that phone call eight eight eight Arcadia again eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two\nAnd don't forget the Web site this is a great place to start maybe you want to learn more about my just the team they're\nSimply go to on track and on time dot com that's the Web address it's on track in on time dot com and yes you would make you hold a lot of great events people can come out meet the two of you shared terrific meal get your questions answered and talk about retirement planning tell me a little bit about those yeah we do we're we're\nIn the community you know he's four times every

W. W. dot on track in on time dot com\nBut we love these events because it's such a laid back approach to getting some great information we're not talking about well this taxation on this account does

back atmosphere and we love to have folks come out and they certainly seem to love coming out because our events are always fall every month\nAnd I think so and I think what helps is you know we always start things off in a way that I think what's the air out of the room I said hey listen to or are you hearing part expecting us to maybe pitch a timeshare or to sell you in a new witty and immediately people you can see there's anxious moment like what we're doing tonight right\nYou know retirements about so much more than just any one thing what what what brought you out here tonight what do you want to learn about and we'll take a lot of our choosing questions from the audience I Know that people out there desperately want to learn and that they have circumstances or maybe just unique to them\nWe're not interested in just going out in front of the crowd and pitching some sort of where a service like a lot of the other folks out there we're we're in the business of solving problems\nWhat are you concerned about there are so many different financial tools and strategy is out there that given enough time and dedicated effort and maybe through some education we can find the right way\nFor you to retire on your terms given what it is that you're trying to accomplish and so sometimes the gateway you know that you have to pass through to find that relationship is to come to an event\nAnd I would certainly encourage everybody if they can make the time to report come to one of our events I think you'll really enjoy the structure and the content that's covered so as just said if you jump on to our website on track in on time dot com\nIt's got all of our future events listed find one that works for your schedule register right there on line and we'd love to see\nMike as we mentioned today show all about risk risk that may exist right now inside our listeners investment strategies retirement plans what can they expect to hear from you today on this topic\nWell I think for a lot of people when I say risk they just assume that we're referring to market risk and I think that we have to think a little bit more expansive way because in retirement risk whereas many faces\nThere certainly is market risk but there's ... there's liquidity risk this interest rate risk inflation risk\nSo during the remainder of the show we're going to really break these down I Know for for some people that are really familiar with some of these risks and maybe how to avoid them but for some of a U.S these risk are entirely unfamiliar so we are going to break this down and really help people corral all these various risks\nWay to be such a valuable show and we're glad you've joined us on the program today again this is your retirement on track and on time

financial group in Salem the phone number there eight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight\nTo Seventy two twenty three forty two we're glad you've joined us today for our discussion about risk and the first thing that we've got to do in determining risking a portfolio like you say we got to add up the assets we have to understand what we have how much of each thing and you help your clients do that\nAnd he had an enormous position in it in fact I think it was about half of his money was owns ... stock\nAnd I said we can't do this too much ... and he has given me all sorts of flack you don't understand GE is doing less than non company you know he's privy to all of this like you know corporate information and he's saying they're going places and this and that I don't care\nI don't care there's no historical evidence of being piled all into one places the prudent thing to do you know the life started to come on my side we kind of gang up on our husband he was not how we argued\nAnd I'd like to make this clear here to people listening this might sound like wow like you argue with people in your office\nYou better believe it I'm not a yes man people come to us for advice and so sometimes we're going to tell you the truth and not necessarily what you want to hear\nWhich is if you want some GE stock sure we can keep a little bit we might pick a certain dollar amount or a small percentage of the overall hole that half half as insane when you're about to retire so listen I'm not you know no ... I didn't know any better than they did that GE he would have this horrific nosedive in twenty Eighteen how could I possibly no there's no way\nBut I Would have cheated GE the same way just that I Would treat Amazon or Facebook or any of high flying companies because at any moment in time they can be the next Enron or WorldCom or these companies at once they go belly up what took you decades to build\nIs now gone last so if you're one of those people who suspects or more of the point knows that you might have all you know too much money and any One Fund investment you know and it doesn't matter where it is if it's owned the bank owned a rental housing you need to take a look at that and really understand what kind of risk that you might potentially bear\nLet's have a conversation together to figure that out dial eight eight eight Arcadia sit down with me and one of the members of the team will help you look at making that plan as strong as possible dial eight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two\nThere are different ways to protect your savings from risk find out what those are ...

[noise] is it really I mean just depends on the subject matter\nLike if I Know that the children are currently tearing apart my office or something that's like not knowing\nThe fine I'll put it back together and later [laughter] I bet you will write a\nNo listen I mean most people listening or not financial gr rose or experts right whether you're a nurse a teacher or a firefighter or you're an executive somewhere you've got your particular expertise but we don't know about other things I talk about this all the time on the radio like I'm not a ... or car guy\nMight could he goes no gear had someone that cars making that ticking noise I have no idea what it is and I depend on my mechanic\nTo figure that out diagnose the problem and fix it so there's no shame and not knowing certain things but there is a kind of a problem and assuming you know what it is that you're talking about\nSo to give you an example I Know aging in the office was just meeting with a really nice woman I'm my recollection is that she was like in public service I think social work right so here's a here's a woman that's in literally the business of helping others for a living\nNow she had gone through a divorce and she needed to retire and after everything was split up you know it wasn't the most ideal of situations and she's really trying to maximize what little that she has now she walks down to Social Security and says what am I options and they said well you can turn on your benefit now or you can wait until later and then it will be bigger but you'll have to wait\nSo she's like well I kind of need to do and just turns that thing on\nSo later she comes to a seminar and here's about other things that we help people with taxes and the states and all these sorts of other things and she says you know to AJ what else can you guys do for him and he said well wait a minute can we talk about this whole Social Security thing why didn't you turn on your ex husband's benefits\nShould what are you talking about that was not one of the options she was presented with so yeah have you been married to somebody for at least ten years you can turn on that benefit or not your own which for her would have a lot of economic benefits but see the thing is as she trusted holy the Social Security administration had given her why she didn't know any better\nSo do we blame this person absolutely not but we are responsible for the actions that we undertake him listen\nIf we're going to depend on the government to give us good accurate advice I mean at this stage in your life I Would have to ask what what are you in by or smoking\nIt's it's not even that I mean this is Gary ... is legally prohibited for giving you a by the way they can just give you that back then was that that is making the facts but they didn't give up when she had one of my options and they said we can collect now I can collect later that's going\nTo be careful and walk some of the bad guys because of course we actually have very good clients that worked for the IRS and the postal service and so we actually know some of the good government employees but there's a lot of government employees especially in\nVery sensitive areas like say Social Security planning that maybe like because of their own willful ignorance maybe it's day two on the job they're giving out bad information that now this woman absent intervention is going to have to live with for the next twenty plus years\nRight how do you think that's going to affect her and\nThat is insane so the point is I don't care if you're talking about your future taxation\nHealthcare issues the portfolio that has got to be to some extent scrutinized by multiple people I mean listen if you've got an acre of pain you know especially if it's some kind of issue related to like the major health things like open heart surgery I've got cancer I get some sort of very few people act off of first opinions right\nThey get ... seconds or thirds because the consequences of treating a problem the wrong way are enormous so the same thing is true and financial aspects whether it is that you're looking at say Social Security issues those tax issues um the trading the estate for your kids\nThere's multiple ways to address the problem and so the idea is if you've only been looking at it one way or you're assuming that some government agency is giving you like the full and complete information\nListen I Hope for your sake that you are getting good information but if you're not it's just going to be silly in retrospect to know that we may be acted of inaccurate information so\nPlease don't ever go it alone I can say with confidence\nWill will be able to help fix this woman situation the good news for her as she had just turned on Social Security within the last twelve months so we can reverse all of this yeah that's a window of opportunity right but if she had way to just a few weeks longer we wouldn't have any options here so that's why it's so important not to delay getting good advice when it comes to preparing for your financial future\nYeah I mean we've seen people that have come in here and they literally have turned on Social Security Thirteen months ago and we sent man if you just came in here for weeks ago we could have got to help change some of the things that you did not to efficiently but\nSo I think the message here is if you've got a decision coming up as related to Social Security give us a call we can actually create for your customize report\nThat will actually show you and your exact situation the very best way to collect\nAnd this again is not generic information make sure you ask for our customize\nSocial Security analysis this will actually show you and your exact situation how you can get the very most out of your Social Security benefit\nAs singlehandedly at least I think one of the most valuable things that we make available to our listeners but of course but there's only so much time in a day to produce these reports that we're just going to make the report free for next ten callers right now ask for that customize Social Security analysis dial eight eight eight Arcadia
