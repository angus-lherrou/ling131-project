they're all getting Chinese buffet seven days a week and the dinner buffet [noise] prime rib China blossom route one point five in the [noise] I got over today show us again next Sunday\nWicked bikes I have a great weekend everybody [noise]\nAdvice radio with fat lately is a presentation of CD [noise]\n[noise] oh boy so Boston are you working about one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News on the rich and the storm\nHow's that going to affect Justin ... it's not very uh I'm thirty seven years old so I got a long ways to go I don't have to worry about a market crash tomorrow I'm going to be working for the next Twenty years but I I'm fifty seven certainly if I'm sixty seven\nThat changes a little bit so we often see people as they grow older Megan you know by right start to consider things like\nFixed income type instruments whether you're talking about CDs or bonds or certain types of annuities [noise] but the problem is that those vehicles whether directly addressing is market risk they tend to protect you a little bit better but they invite just a different type of risk through the backdoor namely it's interest rate or inflation risk\nA lot of this safe stuff for some time now for about ten years hasn't been all about rewarding I mean I can remember when I saved for my first house I mean just when we were saving\nYou know I think that on our like savings account even a couple of CDs there'll be purchased we were getting five or six percent rates of return Sharon but again you know and then for the last decade if I'm putting my money into something safe I'm lucky if I'm getting two percent\nYeah right I mean it was just a year or two ago CDs we're paying less than one percent\nSo that's a problem right because I'm not risking the principle but I'm not having the money grow enough in a way that meaningfully competes with inflation\nI mean out there in the big bad world my property taxes are going up my utilities are becoming more expensive I got to spend more at the grocery store certainly my medical bills are increasing and so the idea is that we need three four five percent rates of returns usually a minimum to compete with inflation\nAnd we're just not getting that with the safer stuff so as a necessity what we're finding Megan is that people will need to have a balance between growth and income the idea that the gross stuff\nThat's going to be better apt to compete with inflation but because of the risk to principle we're still going to need that fixed income type stuff your income oriented items to balance ... should the market not cooperate when you need access to the money\nIt's all like diversification that doesn't just mean with and you know the stock market you know what bonds or mutual funds make up your portfolio diversification means I Love to hear a little bit over there you can diversify your risk as well and that's really important\nI think the problem ultimately justice that sometimes people don't even know what amount of risk taking and again going back to what I said it's not just market risk but you know what kind of market risk am I taking what kind of inflation risks in my exposed to what about tax risk what about liquidity risk\nSince risk whereas many faces requires that you do an in depth analysis to look at how all these various risk can affect you and I guess our job primarily as an advisor is to try to keep these risks at bay as much as we can\nSo for retirement is looming or already upon you we believe of course it's vital to be absolutely sure you'll have enough money coming in every single month and certainly not just to cover your expenses but to live the kind of lifestyle you imagine that you've worked so hard toward\nAnd we think the first step of course is to get a completely customize strategy from a retirement income professional\nSomeone who has your interests at heart someone who can provide you with a fresh incisive perspective on your entire income picture\nThis is not some generic cookie cutter report it's customized your unique needs and goals but of course we have limited appointment availability and so I Want to limit this opportunity to our first ten callers on the show today if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand for retirement called\nEight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two now be one of the next ten callers in your personal life ticket to retirement review that's eight eight eight Arcadia eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty to\nThe website if you'd like to learn more about my jazz and the team at Arcadia financial group\nGo to on track and on time dot com that's on track and on time dot com\nMike I'm hearing you talk about making sure you're having appropriate risk in your portfolio that's really important as you get older as you get closer to retirement and it makes sense too right you don't want to have a ton of rats you want to be a little bit more conservative because you don't have the time to make it out that we do see\nCorrection you see a lot in your in your asset base so\nLet's talk about\nAccumulation phase versus distribution phase the mindset shift that has to have that happen and also just some of the practical things that you walk people through\nWell I think that a very simplistic level there is this transition overtime in terms of how you're saving for your future you've got this accumulation phase and that very simply is when you're saving you're probably taking some degree of risk you're trying to get that money to grow as big and fat as possible\n... sack as tall as again\nYeah so that's pretty simple again I mean the recipe for success when you're in accumulate or is saved take risk stay out of debt you know the basics ground distribution is markedly more complicated that's when you're turning the corner you're going to look to back out of the workforce and as a result other things are going to need to come to the fore to replace that paycheck\nThat's where the distributions are going to come in and you're gonna get distributions from Social Security maybe if you're fortunate enough to have a pension or you got four one K. is either raise those are going to have to distribute to you but the question is when in what order\nHouse should you do it what am on a tax or you're gonna get separated from right so it gets pretty complicated once you turn that corner and I would say that probably predominantly the biggest question that we get over and over again from nice people who come from all walks of life is\nHow am I doing what should I be doing different am I on track and what all those questions have in common is that really it's a question mark people don't know where they stand\nAnd that's understandable just really for this reason just\nRetirement is complicated and and I think what keeps people up at night is they're not even aware of all of the risks they have ideas right they're worried about market risk but they don't know how to get a handle on inflation risk tax risk liquidity rest\nAnd not knowing how to identify what they are exposed to and what those risks mean to them I think keeps people from you know courageously pursuing their future and making transitions because the unknown is scary\nYeah I mean it's like that saying you don't know what you do now in a lot of people come in here and they're very brave souls or saying listen\nI think I've done everything right I've saved as much as I can I delete collecting Social Security like ... I don't\nI don't know what else is out there and one of the ... you mentioned earlier might that Israeli enter saying it's tax risk and we've seen a couple of come in here and just by withdrawing from one account and seven other at the opening ourselves up to all this unnecessary tax liability\nYeah taxes are real pickle I think that we spend so much time focused on the market and our rates of return and the fees are paying and we ignore to a certain extent I guess 'cause we just take it for granted or assumed that it just is what it is we were not looking at what we're going to get separated from in the way of tax over time\nYou're going to hate tax and retirement just as much as you hate it while you've been working but the idea is that it has a disproportionate effect because well here we are on a fixed budget\nAnd so every dollar that's going towards housing or medical and certainly taxes is just adult it's a painful expensive against that much more painful because every dollar that's going towards tax\nIs a dollar that we can't spend dining out or vacationing or spending on some wonderful gift for the grandkids right so ... becomes crucial\nSo here's a quick question for every one are you going to be at a higher or lower tax bracket when you're in a retirement if you don't definitively know the answer to that question is probably long past time to really look forward\nAnd take every effort spend every ounce of energy that you can lowering that tax burden to its absolute minimum I Know that myself and our staff here at Arcadia financial group would love to perform for you a complementary tax analysis\nSee where you stand today what kind of trajectory that you're on but then also see what could be how much money could we put back into your pocket to maximize your retirement income it's as easy as reaching out\nAsk for complimentary tax analysis today called\nEight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two

maneuver for them as pay back your Social Security and this had dual benefit\nNumber one the investments that they were selling to generate income but then as a result the immune from capital gains tax\nBut two and turning off their Social Security and allowed that benefit to continue to grow on a different basis which grows by approximately eight percent a year so they're getting a bigger Social Security benefit down the road they are taken out a bunch of money in a way that avoids tax\nWe became practically best friends because for them they're saving tens of thousands of dollars is this going to hold true for everybody listening of course not but the idea is\nFor them as I'm sure it's true for a lot of people they didn't even know that was an option now I don't blame them for that retirements complicated you have to look at the investments in the Social Security and the taxes there were three dimensions of a situation\nYet retirements complicated the tax code ... says is security it's complicated and then how do you all inter we've with one another\nAnd I love cases like this because it really allows us here at Arcadia financial group to spread our wings and do what it is that we do best which I think just has always been and will always continue to be to identify and solve\nProblems there are problems that I Know that you know that you have right I'm taking too much risk I'm probably not sheltering myself enough from tax\nI have way too much on the Amazon right [laughter] I have\nToo much Amazon so maybe you're buying too much stuff on Amazon I don't know I was an Amazon ... but people have problems that they don't even know that they have and that's what kills us right they don't know what Medicare covers and what it doesn't\nThey don't know if they should have the will or a trust and if they do need a trust what kind is appropriate for their situation in on it goes you know you marry in taxes you marry in investment risk investment fees\nGenerally speaking there's always some sort of chink in our armor and identifying it can be the tricky part right the idea though is that that's what we're here for every single day I'm proud to

[noise]\nGlad to have it in line with us on the show today this is your retirement on track\nOn time Mike and destiny co founders of Arcadia financial group helping you retire successfully here's the phone\nNumber if you'd like to get in touch eight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two more than Fifteen Years in the business we're talking about growth and income today both are important you have to have both those aspects in your retirement portfolio\nBut we also have to determine what the right mix is correct Mike\nYeah I Would say that for most people putting together a retirement plan has\nHad only putting together a jigsaw puzzle because various pieces are going to support various legs of the plan right what might your pieces be they're going to be things like Social Security\nIRA both traditional and Ross could be brokerage accounts might be bonds stocks annuities mutual funds we have all these various tools at our disposal\nI guess the issue is that there is no one universal blueprint to follow not everyone's going to combine the same pieces and the same proportions because we all have different designs on our retirement\nSome people want to be retired today\nOthers want to continue to work as long as they can some Neal a lot of money to be smiling some need a very humble amounts right\nSome of us have big families small families health issues no health issues I could continue to go on but because retirement plans or like snowflakes you know they're all unique we have to look at all these tools on an individual case by case basis to come up with that right mix\nAnd fire reminds me um if we do dinner seminars about four times a month while I was on the community and we get to see so many great people that come out and a few months ago this one woman came up afterwards and said you know alone countries say she's like well you didn't talk about what you sell I laughed and said well what\nDo you mean when I saw and she's like what are you sound you sound ... or life insurance company in the marketing is pretty right under the and I was like I have no idea what we would recommend for you I I Know nothing about you you just you know a sad here I mean the answer the questions I had a good conversation by how would we ever get up the air\nAs to share it and just said everybody all you need annuity it's all you need life insurance you should be taking more risk in the stock market I have no idea\nSo telling you know she she had a done what I call a run the circuit just right\nWe're not the only financial advisory group that puts on public education seminars or is on the radio um or certainly reaches out to people so a lot of people they run the circuit they try to meet as many advisors as they can go to as many uh informational seminars is possible listen to all the radio shows\nUm and it's understandable they're doing the due to their due diligence are trying to learn and expand their horizons and what they run into is I think what's most firms those firms are trying to sell them something right or you're a mutual funds are lousy our mutual funds are great you just need our mutual funds to get on track\nOh goodness things would be going so much better for you if you only had an annuity so you need to buy an annuity and here's how it works so what are you doing running around there man with a long term care insurance you need monitor so what's happening is that they're leading first and foremost by talking to you about tools the puzzle pieces right here's what you need\nHow can they possibly recommend any of that without getting the first and foremost get an understanding of what it is that you're doing what your goals are where your anxieties lay what kind of biased easy you have what you know what you don't know\nIf they don't understand you what difference does the quality of their tools make so I'll never apologized for the fact that if you come out to a seminar I'm not trying to sell you anything\nJust you've already said it being independent he can solve a problem with just about any financial strategy that's publicly available run license to belt both help people in the security side of the business the insurance side of the business we don't have many limitations\nAnd so as a result I'm less interested in the specific tools and more interested in number one getting to understand you and your goals and to\nUnderstanding where the problems are\n'cause I don't want to talk about solutions without understanding the problem\nI well I Know what is the outcome that you're looking for and then the tools were there just sat there and help us fill in you know in the background and the ...\nAnd it's so funny so for that poor woman because we weren't actually describing like whatever it is that were quote unquote selling it made her be like well what's up with these guys what [laughter] what kind of agenda could they possibly have right\nUm gosh I mean it it's it's the fault of our industry I think to some extent that we allow business to be conducted that way right\nI Would never want somebody to perform surgery on me unless they understood where my aches and pains or what the various techniques for how long I've been having the issue you don't just cut me open man you have to find out what's going on and understand really what's going on with me and what makes my situation unique and then at that point\nYou can heal me but not a moment sooner and so we have that same kind of core philosophy here at our kitty a financial group or I just you know we kinda just set up like a Tommy the pinball wizard we are in the business of healing I think All right but it ain't spiritual healing not necessarily I think sometimes though we do feel the spirit\nIt's done though through financial techniques tools strategies more importantly it's done by a plan\nAnd what is the plan a plan has to marry what's important to you\nTo the best way to set you on a course where you can accomplish what's important to you\nWhat are your goals what are your resources what are your problems is connect all those things together get educated learn about the various ways that you can build a plan\nAnd interact with somebody collaborative a collaboratively who has your best interests at heart\nIf you're more so interested in a conversation as opposed to a sales pitch I think you'll find for yourself maybe a very nice harbor here at Arcadia financial group certainly I think all situations are entitled to a second opinion if you're looking for a second opinion on your particular situation be one of the next ten callers\nGet a consultation with us over the next week or two let's see what it is that we can
