presentation of [noise]\nThe voice of Boston\nYou walk at least ... in one hundred and twenty seven till UCLA eighty to Boston and heart radio station [noise]\nCarefully when we constructed this mission statement because we want to be that fought and won't be that resource for people that are getting ready to retire have clarity to understand you know what it is that we're talking by here and have the confidence to see this retirement plan all the way through\nAnd I always think of confidence as as like a fire right\nI think for some people they have a lot of confidence because they're having some success some good luck whatever it is you know sometimes that fires burning bright\nBut it's not unusual like I said before as you approach retirement for the fire to maybe died down a little bit maybe even get down to embers why because the fear that dark around that fire\nIs so oppressive it's so scary right so even if you're down to ... how to reignite the fire well we just go and we you know we ... what is right in the face\nBut we can do and we help people every single day Megan we help people asked the question what if what if there's a market correction how does it affect you\nWould have taxes go up what if there is a health\nWhat's the stair these concerns right in the face see in black and white when we run the numbers how you were affected or more importantly if you're not affected because once we know that you can achieve\nWhat it is that you want what changes you need to make to achieve what you want despite all these what s that's we're confidence is born that's where we can reignite that flame you have to stare into the darkness in order to reignite the fire\nSo that it it's not always easy\nThis path towards getting confidence but we know the questions to ask the tools to use the things the solutions to look at in order for you to build a plan that can give you that confidence because we have a firm belief here at our kitty a financial group\nEveryone deserves that confidence have you been working if you've been saving if you've been trying to stay out of debt\nAt some point you're probably deserve to have that confidence but it don't come for free and it can certainly be elusive so let's get after it\nWas the last time you stoked your fire when's the last time you really looked at where you stood as related to your income goal in retirement what things could potentially jeopardize that income ... have you looked are measured your market risk\nHave you looked at her measure the amount of fees that you're paying have you really walk through it and analysis which show you what kind of income that you're entitled to\nAnd what are the things that might stand in your way every single day we help people explore these very issues so they themselves can get that ever elusive confidence and it can be yours what I'd like to offer our next ten callers the complimentary retirement income analysis\nGive us a call me with a member of our team find out for yourself what it's going to take\nFor you to have confidence into taking that transition go into retirement feeling great knowing that you can have what it is that you've been working so hard to achieve\nAll it typically takes us a little bit of education and the elimination of the risks that stand in your way to get that story told in underway give us a call today the number to dial is\nEight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two for your complimentary retirement income analysis\nHere's that number again if you'd like to sit down with Mike and jazz they have a great team standing by eight eight eight Arcadia\nThat eight eight eight to seven two twenty three forty two and another way you can gain confidence as you think about retirement is to attend one of my congested dinner workshops just tell us more about those\nYeah we love our dinner workshops we had the ... for every single month right here in the community where we invite\nEveryone to come out and just get some education you know we talk about so many varying subjects when it comes to retirement and income planning and it's just\nA really nice relaxed laid back way where we can have a conversation and asked the audience what do you want to talk about what do you want to know we don't have a pair to sell anything we're just up here to\nHonestly give people that education that summer so desperately seeking and then we have a nice meal to boot so you really can't eat that can't beat that\nAt all and it is just a good way to get to know the two of you find out more about your philosophy\nOf retiring well providing that income that you're going to need and retirement all the different bases that need to be covered as you look forward to this next phase of life and we're talking about confidence today maybe your confidence was a bit rattled as you saw the market dropped precipitously earlier this month\nWe had a chance to sit down with best selling author financial educator David Baake asked him about that guy is impressions of that market drop and overall volatility what it means for your retirement future stay tuned for that\nComing up a little bit later talking about confidence today on the show with Mike and jazz and\nI Know there were people as we mentioned just a moment here ago that were rattled I don't know what the word to use they were nervous scared full of anxiety when they saw the market there like it did back on October tenth\nMike in jazz that's not how we should be responding if if we do have a plan in place we should have a lot of confidence about our retirement no matter what the market does right\nYeah if you have a plan in place whatever the market's doing on a given day honestly it really shouldn't matter you know one of the things I like to explain to people just is that when the market goes down you know how nervous it's making you feel is really just a function of not only time but need\nYou know we're on the south side of forty so if the market drops twenty or thirty percent of our it literally makes no difference to us\nI don't need that money and I don't need it anytime soon\nSo it makes no difference to me but if you're sixty five and you need that money in a week after you quit your job\nWell that's a you know that's a bird of a different color here right because all of a sudden you got to be concerned that hey I got to touch that money but the accounts down right and we know that the one recipe for getting back what you losing a market correction is this time right so this is always just a function of time in need\nI think it's hard to make I think that just even if you have a plan which certainly all of our clients do they're still\nYou know human emotion that's involved in even if you're fully confident when you see the market if you think\nOh my gosh is this plan rally gonna hold true and so you know we talk to our clients through this all the time we're always hear from them we don't you know getting new our clients that you've been taught so many times before\nPeople come in saying I can never get a hold my advisor in the market drives we just simply you know have these conversations and they say yeah there remember we have a plan for this and our client calls go\nVery well to get to like yeah you know you're right they started just like pat me on bat and let me know everything's send me All right\nAnd just it's really not that complicated if you want to grow your money over time the stock market is just about the best place to do it\nBut we get concerned and understandably so especially if we need that money and we need it soon about the all the various ups and downs in fact you know the market is just about up as often as it is down if you look at its performance on a day by day basis so what do you do about it\nYou know years ago probably the most famous investor of all time Warren Buffett was asked listen if you could will only give your money you know to all of your beneficiaries with this one set of instructions to fall over how they could invest the money like you but in your absence what would you tell them to do\nAnd his advice was so simple he's like I Would tell them to keep Ninety percent of the money in the stock market and about ten percent and something like treasuries that way if there's a correction they've got some money that's safe that they can spend until things recover I mean how simple as that\nWarren Buffet put it down black and white he thought it was pretty simple\nIf you've got a plan if you've got some of your money hiding out someplace safe like the bank certain types of annuities certain types of bonds than a market correction you can really just shrug off see I have a firm believer that the people who might be panicking over what's happened over the last couple of weeks they probably don't have a very good plan they probably don't have clarity\nAnd that's okay 'cause that stuff is easy to get if you commit yourself to a process if you look at your options if you get educated on how it is that you build a plan that works whether the market is up or down\nIt's really just a function of dedicating yourself to getting that help and it's as easy as reaching out we here at our kitty a financial group can give you a complementary retirement income analysis\nOne hundred percent for free all you need to do is reach out give us a call today would be one of our next ten callers dial\nEight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty to ask for your complimentary retirement income analysis at eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two\nWe're talking about financial confidence for retirement and what it hangs Mike in that tell you how to get a burn on your retirement income outlook that's now [noise]\n[laughter]\nI said you native rates may applied individual results may vary the website for details [noise]\nI'm buying a huge flat screen TV so I can finally see it without my glasses why can't\nThat's what I'm hearing [noise] my glasses and contact or a pain I Love to finally get rid of these but who can afford lasik you can [noise] because at least ... billion instituted operate dramatically low prices\nWhat a new things do is they promise you things they can promise you protection around your principal or a promise you things like guaranteed income and those promises can be wonderful but they're not free [noise]\nSo what do we give up and return oftentimes there can be fees oftentimes there will be lower rates of return so you know there are a lot of financial products out there that people are already very comfortable and familiar with the kind of operate off the same premise about you know CDs and bonds\nCDs and bonds are safer than things like stocks but their rate of return isn't good so you're paying a price for safety\nYeah I think people understand CDs pretty well and it's funny because some people will come and say well I don't want in unity but I because I Want to have control of my money so I'm going to buy a CD and stat and [laughter] and they have the same amount of period of time where you can't touch it for ... they do at rather similar but different as well\nI just think that there are situations where annuities might be a fantastic fit and there's other situations where yeah you probably don't need one might not even want to consider one\nIt's just it just depends and so what I've always kind of a given out for advice really boils down to this you want to walk away or not listen to I think anybody who speaks in absolutes anybody who says oh everybody needs an annuity or nobody should have an annuity\nThat to me doesn't seem like very compelling are thoughtful type of advice\nWhat I'm more so than somebody who's going to look at my situation and say hey listen in your situation with the goals that you have\nThere's so many different ways that you can solve your problem\nSome involved more risk than others some had maybe potentially higher returns than others so might have bigger fees than others what do you like what are you not like what do you understand what confuses you what is going to be ultimately whatever combination of these tools are going to allow you to stick to a plan long term and deliver to your confidence\nThat plan might including annuity it might not but how can we even make that judgment until you go through a process of really understanding where you stand\nAnd also knowing what tools are available to help you solve your problems maybe you have an annuity and you're not sure how it works in a confuses you maybe you've been recommended an annuity and you're not sure if it's the right fit or not\nMaybe you're just getting ready to retire and you're not feeling confident you feel like something's missing maybe that you haven't looked at the big picture\nEvery single day and Arcadia financial group but we help people do is achieve a sense of clarity\nGet for themselves some confidence process designed to break down for you what you need to have employees planting wise to be confident in your retirement future\nHave an understanding as to what risks stand in your way and walk you through a process that seeks to try to eliminate or at least mitigate those risks so you can feel better and more confident\nAnd the moves that you're making because at the end of the day if a plan is not making you're confident it's not much of a plant at all and if you don't have that plan if you're looking to build it\nThe best time to start is today called eight eight eight Arcadia

earlier this month by the market drop that we saw you going to want to listen to the interview with our special gassed we had a chance to sit down with\nOne of America's favorite financial educators he's in nine time New York times best selling author David by you probably have one of his books sitting on your bookshelf smart women finished rich smart capitals finished rich the automatic millionaire just to name a few\nListening as David talks about why this market dropped number one but also what the volatility we're seeing means for you for your retirement future let's listen in October tenth saw the worst day for the Dow since February\nA big drop in popular tax stock splitting impactful sell off in motion so what does this mean for you and your finances and most importantly your retirement David by a well known financial educator is here to make sense of what's happening on Wall street\nAnd David been featured on Fox CBS CNBC the today show and Oprah\nDavid been out there teaching America about money for more than two decades he's at nine time New York times best selling author of books including smart couples finish rich\nAnd smart women finished rich and today he's co founder of the aim wealth management one of America's fastest growing our eye gaze David wealth and we are thrilled to have you with us today\nShow let's talk about that\nAnd eight hundred plus point drop or the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens do to get one event so set the stage for us here what sparked a sell off\n... well it's a handful of things first of all and and so the question becomes all is there anything specific that's going on and I'll give you a handful things\nThe first thing is that rates are going up and you even heard the president talking about this well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear rates are going up and that is raising rates\nThe fed actually been raising rates really since two thousand and teen\nBut most recently the fed raises rates on the money that things can land they call it the Federal Reserve fund rate to tour of course happened in September and when those rates went up a couple of things happened first of all the costs to borrow money goes up right so you're going to borrow money for a home\nIf you're going to refinance your home if you're going to buy a car and you're going to finance that car\nOr you're going to use credit cards that matter any where where you're borrowing money the cost to borrow that money is now going up\nAnd that's ... ... spoke some market right because of your home maybe people will buy the buy less homes or they'll refinance or home last so they'll buy less cars or they'll shop less when it costs more to borrow money\nThe markets can spoof that consumers will slow down on their spending and so that's the first thing it's really been a story about the fed\nRates going up now we have to put down a little bit in the context because let's be honest rates have been really really really really low like you know we've had historically low rates for well over ten years and those historically the rates which the fed put in place after our great recession\nWe're successful that's what got the economy going again and that's why we are right now enjoying what is the longest bull market in history so you have to put that in perspective\nUm and they're all some other things are happening that are influencing the stock market which is as rates have gone up\nThe tenure treasury the rates have gone up on that right now and that's the highest rates we've seen on tenure treasuries and like seven years so that's also a very interesting thing that's happening and then there's the fact that the tech market hasn't way like this right let me see now", "show_name": "Your
