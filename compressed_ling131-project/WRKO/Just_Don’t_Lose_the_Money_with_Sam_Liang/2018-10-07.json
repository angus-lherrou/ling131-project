that but they're they're pretty amusing letters and they're in their own way\nI'll just read you one year before we go back to the lines this is that for me a letter like any Dennis chatter\nUsed to be the uh meet the weatherman for channel seven in D.C in the nineties I first met Julie sweating in Nineteen Ninety three and a Washington DC barred and your Wisconsin circulated was going away party\nFor a TV anchor I left the party to go to a bar to buy a soda I haven't drunk alcohol since my Eighteenth birthday\nAs I sat alone at the end of the bar Julie approached me she was alone quite beautiful well dressed the no drinking hand consequently my initial thought was she might might be a high in hooker call girl because of the time I weighed three hundred and fifty pounds so why would someone like her what what\nWhat what someone like her with someone like me I'd never been hit on with a bar on a Barbie so he starts uh\nHe he uh ... you start seeing her\nI felt she only had an interest in my three hundred and fifty pounds self because I was on television and well known\nAnd she he says he resisted having sex with her uh he was having marital difficulties during a conversation about our sexual preferences things got derailed when Julie told me she liked to have sex with more than one guy at a time\nIn fact sometimes with several at one time she wanted to know that would be okay and our relationship\nI asked her if this was just a fantasy of her she responded that you'd first tried sex with multiple guys while in high school and still liked it from time to time she brought it up because she wanted to know if I Would be interested in that\nSo he's he sees what's going on here and he says uh I was that he has a new wife and I guess he's lost a lot of weight and all this I was deeply troubled and felt the moral dilemma Dwight reach out and tell the truth of what I Know and risk family relationships to remain silent\nUm I Know I also know what it's like to be accused of something significant that I didn't do it when people leave because of this and the turtle considerations meaning I guess the afterlife the pressure on me built throughout the afternoon I had to explain my ... my wife and three years what happened twenty five years ago before we met in long before we married\nSo then he decides to go to was a pastor and talk to him about it as I watched part of the afternoon confirmation hearing the next day and so I'm Mrs Kavanaugh looking so sad I felt that she needed to know that in this instance her husband was being mischaracterized\nMy heart's still feels heavy for me as well as Julian capitalized that said based on my direct experience with Julie I Do not believe her allegations against Mr capital\nSo that's that's one letter we got more letters to read as we go through it a mark your next with highway car go ahead mark\nThank you alley and thank you for a truly entertaining and informative show President

you'll see for free lipstick is right for you that's S. T. A. R. T. two three five zero three five zero\nVoice of Boston you walk working in one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station\nThe problem was when they retired was year two thousand\nAnd we remember what happened in two thousand so they take out fifty thousand they start with nine fifty\nAnd by the end of two thousand and three Mike the million dollar portfolio was about cut in half which was like four Ninety five half\nOf them to leave all under why because they kept taking fifty thousand dollars or the market went down for about two and a half three years so boom half\nThey go back to have this discussion with a broker the brokers says hey don't worry state of course don't panic I Know what I'm doing a you know the market over time as average eight to ten percent you'll be fine\nAnd for the next few years it actually worked okay to the market rebounded they took their fifty thousand dollars and by the beginning of two thousand seven they had like five hundred and fifty thousand dollars in cash so they felt a little bit better their lifestyles good enjoying retirement that money has come back a little bit\nBut do you remember what happened in two thousand and eight oh yeah yeah what you do have saluted from October of two thousand seven for the next Seventeen months the Dow Jones industrial average was shaved by boat more than fifty percent ... so what happened was\nAfter they took the bear fifty thousand do they need it that the pay their expenses they had about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars left and you should have seen the look on ... face when I told her you know what there's nothing I could do this as much as I Want to help you and I feel for it\nThis they didn't follow my two rules ruin number one just don't lose the money and more importantly rule number two different forget rule number one because\nThey're in they're now they're in the you know early mid seventies the healthy the playing golf playing tennis and the writing was on the wall do run out of money\nThat's not what you want to go into retirement thinking about a worrying about each and every day\nSaying I Want to go back to this couple they started off with a million dollars yeah by the time they came to see you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nYou know they live to almost ten years eight nine years living the good life they took out the money that they needed and that goes back to the blessing and the problem the blessing is we're all doing better with living longer we're enjoying lives sure our retirement lies the problem is that sometimes if you don't have a plan in place\nYour money is not gonna last as long as you last\nAnd that's that's really the problem might and as I'm saying that\nIf we could just slow down maybe shift gears a second I think there's a lot of people that are listening right now in the sand you know what\nI'm I'm almost there I'm getting ready to retire and I'm looking at my four one K.\nIt's pretty healthy I like that but I really don't have sort of a a game plan\nAs to how I'm going to last the next twenty five thirty years and I don't want to be like Mike marine so we're going to offer a complementary full blown retirement plan a second opinion essentially on what you're doing or maybe you're doing nothing\nAnd the problem is retirement never takes a day off so you know you

understand what you have or don't have\nAnd then very important we were going to implement an income plan that will give you a reliable and sustainable and predictable income during those twenty five thirty even thirty five more years and if you take that\nProblem like off the table mhm which is where am I going to get money to pay my bills to pay my health care\nTo pay my electricity for me to

money dot com now for your complimentary personalized full\nBlown three sixty five retirement plan the number eight seven seven\nSix three zero eight seven eight seven that's eight seven seven six three zero eight seven eight seven so saying let's go back to the story of Mike and Maureen that we heard earlier here in the show how do we avoid that what's the solution so that we can have a successful retired\nThink you've got to go into retirement with a different mindset than what Mike I'm Maureen went into hey what they went into was let's let's continue our track what's not change anything let's continue to make money and we're just\nPillow fifty fifty thousand dollars a year will be fine hoping hoping exactly that's that's the key word and I think really if you had the mindset as you get close to retirement in your fifties and sixties you really have two jobs\n... jobs to make sure that you don't lose what you have\nNot simple this is probably at a time where you have the most money than you've ever had let's make sure we don't go back which\nIs second job is to make sure that you prepare and ... and lay out a plan how to get income for life how to get reliable sustainable income that's going to last you through retirement\nSo you know my mom didn't really have that mindset and when you go into retirement you you can't do what my marine do which is keep your fingers crossed and I hope everything's going to be okay\nLet me let me share with you a story about a client that we were able to recently help a few years ago they came into us they were in the early sixties uh dug in I mean\nAnd Doug was a dentist so as a dentist loves what he's doing and will probably continue to work for another seven eight years\nHis his plan was to make it to full retirement age so we can collect Social Security I mean stayed at home she raised a family uh they have no debt all the colleges have paid for the kids are off on their own and when they came to us they had a million and a half\nIn total savings ... sixty years old okay\nSo it's I mean in our discovery and a half per se meeting with not only did we get to know each other\nBut one of the crucial things was that we discovered they wanted a retirement lifestyle of ten thousand dollars a month and craft their plan was there when I go and be snowbirds for maybe four months or so um take a big family vacation where they were going to pay for everything\nThey didn't have any debt so they had ten thousand dollars a month there would be just fine\nSo we took a look at this stuff and we say hey look how about we try this instead of just shooting for the mon keeping our fingers crossed hope everything works out why don't we have different retirement outcomes\nFor all the money and we segregate your money to do certain things and only have really one job [laughter] so they had a little bit of money in the bank and that was fine but the biggest thing that they want it to sort of change was where am I going to get ten thousand dollars a month\nSo we set up your million and a half and we took a million dollars earmarked to to do just that job which is to create ten thousand dollars a month\nWhat would we do we suggested that they take a look at creating their own pension and we built in income plan using principle protected retirement income annuities ... let me share with you how that works is essentially you can set aside in this case a million dollars and it was going to earn interests\nHad no ability to go backwards so the economy did well while we earn some of the interest that ... that we were going to be able to capture becomes our new principal\nAnd if the economy did poorly whatever we earned plus the original principle that we started with is ours can never go backwards so that by itself is a pretty good thing to have in anybody's retirement savings but what we were able to do was put\nThere and we added a feature called the rider and that writer essentially allows us to in the future\nSix zero eight seven eight seven or visit just don't lose the money that\nTom Hi this is Sam Wang found over ... and just don't lose the money dot com how many

see Susan I makes me feel\nBad about myself well or logging on it earlier [laughter] everybody\nLoves to Susan how are you in the real this is so exciting for me to like thank you for having me on a great role from time to time we get lucky my only at ... absolutely\nSusan actually flew in just for this this recording and I'm joking here all the time she was here more and more and it's wonderful to see you\nYank you it's great to be here it's it's such a pleasure ah because we hear the two of you so much I really like just because they were going to be able to get an inside look at Susan your and Sam's relationship because it really is one that goes a long way back and has a lot of history together\nFor sure you know we'd like Susan you and I've known each other for quite some time and after a retired and we started having some fun doing some things professionally and and you are my clients and we're having we're having a lot of fun helping people educate people on how to sort of do the right thing as they approach retirement\nShe I was really lucky ... would you do know is that um I grew up in this area and then ... area and hadn't had my career you know my my TV Clear Channel five Boston for like almost thirty six years\nSo even before I knew Sam personally I knew of being in Lang and as a consumer reporter I knew I'm Sam Wang and his reputation\nSo I had a very unique opportunity to get to know this guy before I ever knew him personally while so then when I get to me he'll reruns rightly [laughter]\nNot to mention his wife and family I mean so this has been a great opportunity for me also because Sam and you know I tell you this all the time and I take you publicly and this is a great opportunity ... has been really you know I'm not but it gives me an opportunity to continue doing what I always wanted it always wanted to do Mike Lee just\nHelp consumers and now I just have a different platform to do that during the ... ... exactly people\nHelping people Mike as we do every Sunday to into retirement and helping people follow those two rules were number one just don't lose the money\nAnd rule number two don't forget role number one that's\nIt that's it so we're going to have some fun today we're going to talk to people a little bit about smart retirement strategies and there's been so many studies out there as you and I both know that you know retirement is harder and harder the ... the disappearing of traditional pensions\nMany people I see are concerned about the ability for Social Security to be there to sort of keep the promises to wash\nAnd really when it comes down to a lot of the burden has been now put on the consumer and so you know and and I say this over and over again but it'd be nearing retirement and you know if you're five years away maybe even ten years away\nYour your vision and what you need to do day to day has changed a little bit right 'cause when you're thirty when you're forty it's all about growing money and it's always about earning more and having more but when you're close to that red zone\nYou have really two jobs the first one is to make sure you don't go backwards you don't lose the money following our two rules ... chances are that's the most you've ever had right and then the second thing is at some point in the future when you stop working as soon as you can speak to that a little bit\nWhen you stop work and you don't get that paycheck anymore so now you've got to figure out like how\nThey're gonna pay my not only in my central expenses but and my lifestyle it's my everything everything right so you're not need to create a source of income that reliable stay in a bow and just pay the bills and we'll talk a little bit about that later on the show we have a great study\nFrom fidelity investments talking about smart retirement income strategy ... will come back to that but as soon as you know exactly what I'm Talking about\nFrom every possible angle I'll start with my four nieces who all late twenties early thirties who are working so hard every day just trying to get by maybe you're more than one job\nI think said earlier and they're not thinking about retiring you know they're just thinking about next week month and we talk about this a lot and then I say hey kids looking I'm Susie I never really thought about as much as I should have because I had this tension in the back of my mind but I was never talking nobody said to me hey Susan you know at this is what you're going to be thinking\nNobody said hey this is what you how your pension works you just had\nOne nothing nothing I didn't even know how much he was going to beat him and I mean I just was sort of like leap of faith and then you know um we talk about my mom all the time to do amazing ... billion lived to be one hundred and three years I'm Haley thank you so she was such a great person down and she loved you and I lay in bed\nBut that her she would say on the time she would talk about as she talked to you about it Sam she didn't expect it lived to be a hundred and three first of all second of all she never even thought about what was going to happen in later\nAre used to tell the story how she saw the condo came into you know several hundred thousand dollars into somebody that's eighty nine years old they're like wow I got to worry about it on the world\nHe was leaving it to the kid she added it all set up bank accounts for everybody\nAnd then she went to it all at the time she was into the nineties it's gone gone so luckily I did have a pension and when I retired um was four years ago that's what I said whoa nobody told me anything and that's why I Love being able to tell people now you've got to do\nSo you got to do something yeah and you know one of the things that I think people as they approach retirement they are very apprehensive about you know making some changes and really it's the time this is the time to do it it's it's not we see people all the time that have\nA bunch of a ... I saw some of the day she's fifty fifty seven fifty eight had like two or three different jobs really doing well and the current current position but she had she said to me I I think I'm I'm okay I got this account here I got that account as an irate roll over fidelity I got this other account here\nSo my my point to her was listen you've got you got a bunch of accounts\nThat's not the same as having a retirement plan because you know specific outcome you don't really know what that money is supposed to do I didn't either I Know exactly so he might you know what can we possibly seconds talk a little bit about how people can take advantage of our offer", "show_name": "Just Don\u2019t Lose the Money with Sam Liang", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "07"}
