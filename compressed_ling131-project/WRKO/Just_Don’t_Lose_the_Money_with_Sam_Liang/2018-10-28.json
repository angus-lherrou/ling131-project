I didn't hear that over ... thanks for having\nA it was so funny 'cause Jim said to them was really kind of gave you a break because we pushed it back Fifteen minutes as if that gays and all that extra sleep that will change the course of your day no doubt to push the ... one time oh there you go [laughter]\nSo er here you are it's hairspray and both of you have said you've played these roles before and for those of you who have never seen\nHairspray a Blake is at now which is mom that's correct and and then of course we have Tracy ... Tracy who is ... is that at the young girl who this or a sort of based around her character\nAh and so if you haven't seen this before I you're missing something 'cause this is a great show\nIt is it's a lot of lot of fun and she's a girl with a dream that's\nRight just like in real life that I Love it [laughter] what is it a dream is bigger her hair [laughter] [laughter] but this isn't the first time for you guys but what's really cool is the first time for the two of you to be together but both of you played these roles elsewhere\nYeah we have I think we both came in with some knowledge of what it was about and what the story is to be told and that was kind of it's a it's a help when you only have a couple of weeks to her something because it's not a lot of time to\nYou know develop that relationship and tell the story but we had a little head start and it's funny I was driving up here and so was she and I was at a rest stop getting something to drink and I'm walking in my car and a here\nBlake is her out of the car I think that you are we so we met in a parking or you got any money you\nFind out who the cast is before you get here and you know everybody looked at each other on Facebook and all that stuff\nAnd I saw his photo and he's walking behind my car and I open the door and said play\nLike [laughter] my\nWay out again and then we really meant in Massachusetts it's meant to be seeing ... hours but their bikes good about it [laughter]\nWhat would have happened if you've gotten there both you didn't like each other which one of these turned around going oh my God allow a child you're that that's right but I have it like so Blake was saying\nThat it does really brick has actually performed at the north shore music theater before so she's been around\nUs not know never doing this this show in around you know you ... I've done it\nTwo times a Broadway and then another time in Wichita, Kansas but we do the same exact probably blocking it was eleven twelve years ago but now it's like something everything's brand new to me I mean the lines of the same but there are people nobody where you turn someone can see you\nThat's a whole new thing for your brain what you said I I kinda I kinda like it too because I feel like\nIt frees you up to play everywhere yeah you know you can turn around and someone still looking at your face and that sort of like makes it fun\nIt makes it even more real for an actor to feel like you're just completely consumed in that world sure\nYou don't turn your turn your back and suddenly you're you again because I just you're always and Ken mining right right exactly where to have to know the dance moves there's nowhere to hide [laughter]\nSo here's your challenge okay if we accept that huge hairspray and desperately wants to go to the show said before the show she was going to kill me after the show for saying this on air but said there's no way I cannot my schedule I Am so cram I cannot make sure I Want to\nDo to figure out is oh I\nDo know what I Know that that's all she can get there she's going to have to make her husband genes are you guys got to be make her go\nWell I I you know I think that we know you want to come\nIs that we don't want to know them well I think we're all in very busy schedule like yes I was going to have rotted out and a half the lines are long one night you know that they\nThey got the wayside shows are just as great course\nThey are um but here's here's the challenge you know I get up at three so I'm thinking if I go during the week one of the two of you won't mind driving me here [laughter] well\nYeah sure [laughter] for hunting is that okay [laughter] how are we on down hey what about like\nThe mom [laughter] oh I Love it I Love the you know\nI've I've played other roles where I've been in drag say like you know the cause of fall\nBut like this is something that you're not a drag queen your someone's mother it's All right we'll be different thing as an actor\nAnd you know it's funny 'cause I've I've also played another other in but I have covered it before I also played Wilbur the dad so I covered them both so it's kind of fun to have the both sides was always a big ... parents on both sides but I don't know it's so much fun to play a mom and and to get to have a motherly love towards him\nBecause it's different than that it just does sure it was a little girl she's daddy's little girl and missed when I'm the one that's mean to her cells that are when I think about that role I think about for ... playing and obviously fighter movie was always cast to be a man playing\nMom yeah yeah I mean that's always been poor because it wasn't just the idea for a while to get away with that idea right right right and and the John\nWaters original original movie it was written for a divine so it's always been done that last year\nWhich is what's so funny I I we were laughing that was a movie that John Waters wrote that they made it into a Broadway show musical ... made into a movie of musical if they've been made into a TV version of the musical it's like really had an interesting little journey of a life\nYou know it has I Love I Love the Tracy part I mean she there's a little bit of Tracy and all of us yeah right so for anybody who doesn't know the park tell everybody you know sort of what Tracy's goal and she's got a dream\nSo she she's a young girl who was a dream a passion and she's very she's very exuberant she has got a lot of\nLife and her and um I Love this role because the first time I played it I was I was really young and it really\nTaught me about how if you have a dream it doesn't matter what you look like it doesn't matter what size you are or you know what color skin you are it's just if you have the strangest go for\nIt and that's really what Tracy dies and it's a great lesson for everyone you know you can achieve whatever you want as long as you have passion and talent and hearts and I asked what she has at the bottom of everything else we were talking about this yesterday to Blake and I about how\nThis show just has even though it's it's so fun at some point then at some point you can cry at just the centered around heart\nAnd not what makes it so much fun to be in and to watch and to play a role like that sure\nAbsolutely you get the feeling that cast is properly I think I've ever heard this I don't know what I Would like they were written ... they did they cast\nAs quite well ah so north shore music theater yeah tell everybody come on they gotta come down to the end of\nThis I [noise] I think it's a you know do a lot going on right now in the world we all know that and we're voting for things and we're doing there's World Series happening and there's a lot going on but I think it's fun to sometimes used to get away for a couple of hours and just leave us all behind that was a great show to do that because you can come just have a good time for two and a half hours this has some great song and if\nYou're not smiling at the end that's when you can't stop\nThe B plans then I don't know what\nWhy do you have your own you know very clearly [laughter] yeah\nThe music is great it is ... is so much fun yeah it it really is this is one of those infectious uh shows\nSo well we wish you the best of luck I I'm assuming the rest of the cast is equally as great as you guys but I have a ... I'm going to work hard to cast their shows here they don't take that they take that very seriously at Norfolk because\nThat makes it brings your show yeah so it's really a talented group absolutely well you guys again if you want to get out and see the show and you should and I got to tell you something maybe he's called me out here on the air I'm going to do my best I'm going to try to kind of the right now I Love I Love the theater everybody knows that and I love this show\nIt starts October the thirtieth runs through November the eleventh if you need more information you can go to an S. and P. dot org [laughter]\nA good luck to you it's going to be terrific oh how to break into your morning thank you and thanks for coming in with\nThe two words you got to say right now\nYou can never promote the north shore music theater without mentioning go ahead you're arguing [laughter]\nHuge there I don't even know why don't you can't if you're going to wind any I don't know [laughter] got such a big deal so true that's true a lot of places that you know the secret certainly fourteen dollars for its eighty five dollars a pocket [laughter]\nI'm announcing this there is so GOOD Music theater hairspray don't forget\nSo boy so Boston do\nYou think the only working about one hundred and forty seven till UCLA eighty to Boston and heart radio station [noise]\nAnd some worry more than others so I Would say some have small concerned but I Will have big worries and you can't really identify what those people need to do unto we figure out what it is that they're concerned\nAbout you know no two retirements her like a some people want to travel some people want to um be down in Florida for six months out of the year so in in that first meeting with what we want to do is get an idea of how these individuals envision their retirement\nAnd then we want to do is take a look at what are they doing and what have they saved a much income did they project to me what are they going to grab a missile Jeffrey Wright already so we want to get an idea of what they've been doing and in that first meeting and we're going to ask a lot of questions they're going to do a lot of the talk\nYou know we were so to the questions we do a lot of listening and that's really the first meeting it's not just take ten minutes telling me about you it's an entire hour it's a process we called that discovery and John you said it best it's not\nIt's not really always just about money it's about lifestyle you know do you want to be in Florida for six months maybe you could care less about traveling all you want to do is just you know get the grandkids off the school bus who knows but it's all about understanding what they're trying to do\nAnd then look at what they've done we'll ... we'll do the job will support their lifestyle and that's one of the most critical components of really a good relationship at first up understanding what they're trying to\nWe want people to come in both five to ten years from retirement because I think that's a crucial time that allows an individual will say five years out they want to retire we start taking a real close look at what they have with the invasion\nIn that five years it's going to allow us to really if this changes to be made it's going to allow us enough time to make the necessary changes that are going to have\nMeaningful impact on their retirement\nWith what's going on right now sort of very roller coaster three in in terms of the market and the economy um what is risky to one person might not be risky to another person you know so we want to discover all of that right from the beginning\nWell same a TI ... chief Roger Ferguson sums up what you just said brilliantly in his last speech here\nWe know at some point this will slow down we don't know when so if there's a ten percent correction power that make you feel if you think you can live with that than stay relatively fully invested if you think stuff like that might distress you pull back a little bit\nAT T I a craft chief Roger Ferguson So Jon is that the question that people need to be asking themselves how much risk am I willing to take a before running out of money\nMight exactly what happens is when we sit down with individuals we go through a pretty thorough analysis uh to check a person's risk tolerance to gauge how much do they really want to take and you know you hear an individual say\nWould you get uncomfortable with a ten percent loss and we asked our clients that all the time in oftentimes I say well that's a big loss I Would never feel comfortable with that and if they don't have certain tools in place currently taking on a hundred percent of the potential\nOff ... you know it's it's amazing we had you know the the lottery fever or the mega millions and the you know one point six billion dollars a few weeks ago\nThe reality is is I think people John you put it very well they don't really know how much risk taking you know I sat in a meeting with the other day and you were showing a Morningstar report and these people said to you it beyond them I'm very conservative and you actually pointed out to them that there were far from conservative\nYeah I mean when we do these reports when we go through the process with individuals ... especially today like you you watch the stock market the U.S economy has been doing well but you know was seen the volatility of it lately\nIt's easy for people to say I want to become more aggressive I Want to chase the S. and P. returns and not have a disciplined approach and have a well diversified balanced portfolio so in these times of volatility that was seen we have to remind people now's the time to be disciplined and to follow that process of\nThe throat and and and also understand the risk that they take and I was talking about you know mega millions and there's no way I Would spend twenty dollars to try to win thirty dollars\nButton I Know I stood in line behind those used to it that way and I spent twenty bucks 'cause the pot was over a billion dollars worth of chance was worth the risk sometimes there's really not worth the risk\nYou've talked about having a diverse portfolio does that mean having a a bunch of accounts\nNo might and you know we have people coming here\nEach and every day they come in with uh the box full of a statement is different accounts different for when caves all die or raise them all the different employers and it's like a road map of our way they've worked over their lifetime and\nI think most people have an accumulation of playing everyone is saving money for retirement to a certain degree and therefore when caves Roth IRAs and so forth\nBut no one really has a plan of\nYou know are they are working together what is my retirement plan\nAre we on track and that's what the three sixty five plan how to do is take a look are you on track and then in the next meeting which is the step two which is the the analysis we're going to shine a bright light on what their financial picture looks like what do they have\nWhat are they truly pain and expense ratio is what are they truly pain and fees to the advisor in if they never changed any and they might give they\nKept that plan what is the projection of their financial future looks like ... with their Social Security with their pension maybe four one K. requirement of distributions are they on track and we're going to shine a bright light only am I going to tell what's the probability of success\nJohn I think you're right a lot of people just have in mind hey I Want to make more and more and more and accumulation plan on one thing I think we bring to the table is we want to make sure that while their diversifying the accumulation phase we want to make sure they have a diversified source of income which is really\nIn my opinion when you're retired the most important thing like where are you going to get reliable income to pay your bills and to you know enjoy the weekend going out to dinner so a lot of those things is what we discover in that process and you can't just hope you're going to have enough in retirement you can't just hope\nYou'll be okay you can't just you know keep your fingers crossed you need to know if you're going to be okay you're going to have enough income and not run out of money\nYou can hope that you're going to win the lottery but it's not a good idea to hope that you're going to be OK in retirement for twenty to Thirty years that's why saying John and Ryan and the team at rubbing on laying that's why they're here and that's why they work so hard every day to make sure that you can make it to and through retirement so for the next five radio callers\nWith at

important workshops for you to attend talking about the three sixty five retirement plans today it's they're tried and true retirement plan that would be on land with Sam Wang\nAnd a John Connelly guys we we've gone over the uh the process discover analyze recommendation we're going to go into implementing a the plan coming up next but\nWe talk a lot about a plan on having a retirement plan and a lot of people may think I thought this myself I've got several different retirement accounts that means I'm diversified I'm going to be okay that seems like a good plan I'm going to hope everything's going to be OK save save save\nBut how did that play and work out for you for most people a couple of weeks ago when the Dow dropped eight hundred points and and same John you guys remember this I mean people were all over the news you know they were just going crazy 'cause the Dow dropped so much\nNo one with the drop eight hundred points on one day the following day I think it was down by like five hundred points when I got to tell you a lot of our clients were sitting pretty our phones then sort of rang and panic and people were saying oh oh my goodness what what's going on\nBecause not only did they have a plan but really the DNA of the plan\nIs to follow our tried and true our tools that we really used for the last Thirty years rule number one just don't lose the money and rule number two don't forget ... Mike as you said earlier you know you thought you had a plan and old four one K. your current four one K.\nDoesn't add up to a plan and that's where we I think where the differences learning more about out three sixty five retirement plan we said three sixty five because you know retirement never takes a day off since there's three hundred year\nSo we named the trademark three sixty five plan and it really works because not only does it sort of take a step back the first step was we talked about earlier toward the show is to discover what somebody's goals are my worries are different than your average do I want to travel a whole lot\nOr maybe it's just about leaving a lot of money to your family maybe it's about not even about money maybe it's about lifestyle and taking care of the grandchildren from that point on John you do a great job with the analysis stage where you really just shine a spotlight on what they're doing\nDuring these on certain Financial Times we want to help people navigate through this time and by having a sound investment process in a plan it doesn't take all the ... but it makes people understand that I have an understanding\nOf what I have how it works and how I'm going to get from point a to point B ...\nAnd we also communicate with the clients hey listen to the markets acting very volatile right now we explain to them we give them calls ... ... email them explain to them what is happening what's causing it oftentimes people don't know\nWhy they're accounts drop and they just see the news on TV and that makes them uncertain having that sound investment process and having a plan\nIt should be able to weather all aspects of the market\nAnd I think one of the big difference between what a lot of people do and what happens when they get our three sixty five retirement plan is because after the third step which is right\nThe nation's often we say to them hey look you know you've been to an okay job growing the money but you can't just rely on the money continues to grow and earn more and more data distribution plan to have an income plan\nBecause you know back in the day you don't have to worry about that he had a pension you need a five thousand dollars a month in between Social Security and your pension it's forty five hundred dollars a month so you didn't have a big difference to make up today it's obviously very different right so\nBy having a solid not only accumulation playing John which is what you can ride to a great job that you also need to have an income planted distribution plant an exit strategy\nTo make sure that you have reliable income each and every month to pay the bills and when we do have days like we had a few weeks back\nThe reason why the phone's been ringing the reason why when you have a conversation with a climbed to say look you know this is why the market went down but it's okay because we're not relying on the part that's going up and down and put food on the tape you know\nWe're not using a growth component for income so we were using come components to generate a stream of income that the individual needs um I think the income component is often the most overlooked component you any financial planning without them they don't take into consideration the taxation inflation\nThey just have a pile of money and they just don't understand how ... money from the un extraction paying the ... these individuals they're trying to extract money from a plan with the markets dropping so\nThat's when you panic now now it's compound the problem for poor individual who doesn't really have a plan he's making withdrawals as the markets decline in front of a declining\nAsset that might you know what we often see is that a lot of times people at this stage they lives\nEspecially when they're very near retirement recently retired they're making a lot of decisions good or bad based on emotion yeah than killer as you say hello to kill her you know emotions oh my goodness I got to get the heck out because I'm going to lose everything tomorrow or I'm I'm gonna hang in there will be fine I'll come back\nBut that's why diversified true diversification and retirement is important having money that's set aside to grow having money that's set aside to give you that income stream and you know you you really need both\nWe use smart portfolios and smartphone those to help us automate those good decisions and also to help us prevent making those emotional decisions in those tough market\nIt's just don't lose the money radio and just don't lose the money dot com sand and John I'm so glad that you guys are talking about this emotion and how it can basically paralyze us from making good decisions you know we see the market climbing and climbing climbing as it has been", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Just Don\u2019t Lose the Money with Sam Liang", "city": "Boston", "day": "28"}
