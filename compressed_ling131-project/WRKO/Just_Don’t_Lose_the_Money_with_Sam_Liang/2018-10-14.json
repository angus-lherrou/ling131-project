to the gym like I used to and I just didn't feel like myself and I tried vitamins supplements every snake oil products that was out there I tried it but nothing ever worked\nCalling the northeast man's clinic was the best thing I ever did I've been on the testosterone replacement therapy for several months now I feel fantastic I feel you full again I'm getting a great night's sleep and I actually feel like I Want to run the Boston Marathon again like I did Twenty years ago\nI'm never getting off this program I Want to feel the way I feel now for the rest of my life I highly recommend northeast men's clinic if you know you should make this phone call don't waste another four years like I did it will change your life it did for me\nWe help Chuck we can help you to call for your confidential if women today six one seven five six four thirty eight eighty eight or northeast men's clinic dot\nCom so boy so Boston are\nYou working in one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nThat I met a client or prospective claim the other day and you know she has some highly appreciate this start that she inherited and\nWhat happens is that stock has gone up in value but she has in control the game so now all of a sudden she has such gains in there that those those positions have become very ill liquid to her because she doesn't want to pay the tax\nAnd then you get frozen in time on that but now is the time and maybe think about that and then on the flip side you know what the new tax law that we have put in place with our President Trump's walk if you look at what say we'll go back to World War two and Nineteen forty four years in fact a lot of people don't know\nThe highest marginal tax bracket that we have today which is actually thirty seven percent last year was thirty nine point six John back in World War two Nineteen forty four what do you think the higher marginal tax bracket was attacked a little say fifty percent\nNinety four percent of your income was over two hundred thousand dollars would you would you be called in about two and a half million dollars today but back in the Nineteen eighties the highest marginal tax bracket was somewhere between fifty to Seventy percent\nWell have been heard a story where Ronald Reagan when he was doing movies he would make a movie is Maxine come he would do was two hundred thousand dollars because the tax bracket was fifty per cent above and beyond the two hundred widely about why he would never make another movie to make his income more than two hundred thousand or so he kept\nHimself or herself I actually brought up a a point the other day tour client he makes about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars and he said to me it's the same so are you know I hear all this buzz about taxes and less taxes today what's the big deal I said John would you were paying tax\nLast year and a hundred and sixty thousand dollars you were actually in the twenty eight percent tax bracket what end today with the changes of the tax bracket hundred and sixty thousand dollars a taxable income\nUh filing married filing jointly you're actually in the twenty two percent tax bracket now you think about that it's not a lot to six percent the fragile\nBut six percent on a hundred and sixty thousand bucks that's a Ninety six hundred dollar tax things off and in ... in your party that's real money to you so the perfect storm sauce storm of opportunity Michael is to\nCapture some of those games especially being near retirement when you're gonna need that money in your pocket and at the same time pay less taxes and that's really what we're here to educate people on doing and um you know there's opportunity so that people just need to see through the forest and capture those games\nAnd there is a there is a time stamp on these taxes because they are correct me if I'm wrong but I think there's there are set to expire in what is it seven years I was\nSeven years two thousand twenty five December thirty first so you know I mean I look\nBack uh I don't know what happened to summer but it's over [laughter]\nI don't know how I got an environment but here I Am currently our bankcard seven years in the long so we want to make sure that our\nListeners understand we have a window of opportunity\nTo make good and that window again is it has an expiration date on at seven or so years for the taxes and to take advantage of those so John if somebody is in the retirement red zone as you guys put at five to ten years out from retirement it it's

to a successful retirement workshops\nGuys thanks again for for staying here with us second half of just don't lose the money very excited about talking about the\nPerfect storm of opportunity because folks I guess you don't realize what a good position we're in right now if you are planning for retirement a it's a hell of a more you're right yeah\nYou know you could be at the wrong place at the wrong time on this case the right place at the right time and I do I mean by that the perfect storm of opportunity to what does that all all come down to you know John on you and I were talking off line how great the market has been\nAnd how nice it is to you know have a discussion on a conversation with our clients about how much money they keep ... been making the last several years\nYeah the last ten years we've been nothing but a bull market harvest in those games are seizing the scope of the uh the the run of the market has been very impressive\nIn now is the time to capitalize especially if you're near in retirement or in retirement you got to harvest those gains put those gains in your pocket in the same time we really have an opportunity now to pay\nLower taxes probably the lowest tax bracket and the last century and that's not going to be the case forever because that it's going to expire in two thousand twenty five so you have those two forces coming at you and if you're five to ten years away from retirement I mean you know we talked to so many people are people in their\n... let's say fifty five to six to ... you're thinking about retirement now it's it's more insight you know one day I'll retire well that one day is nearing ... is getting closer and closer\nAnd then it's sixty two you know a lot of times we have discussion about what people should take Social Security saying what do you think you know where I read that they're not going to be here forever or should I not take Social Security I Know if I'm going to leave it alone is going to grow some more\nAnd then at sixty two to sixty five you really in that sweet spot and you're thinking about can I retire and this is the time to harvest those games and that's what we're talking about the perfect storm of opportunity\nAnd you know you talk about that perfect storm of opportunity and and same you mentioned taxes and people's eyes just light up and they lead a little bit further into like more of a ... says yeah yeah yeah so so tell us a little bit more of that because\nIt really when you think about it uh it's kind of like a clock ticking down and you have a limited amount of time to really take advantage of this and it's really a special opportunity for people to do that\nWithout a darn people will say well you know that sounds great but you know I don't make five hundred thousand dollars a year so the fact that hires marginal tax bracket went from thirty nine point six thirty seven doesn't really affect me well if you're making a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year I'll use that example\nLast year you were in the twenty eight percent tax bracket this year you'll be in the twenty two percent tax bracket which means if you made a hundred and sixty grand\nYou just put an extra Ninety six hundred dollars in your pocket almost ten grand ... you know what if you don't capture that opportunity you're not going to get that extra ten thousand dollars you're not going to\nKnow that you have that opportunity now because out of our between also expires in two thousand twenty five so that's when we keep talking about the perfect storm of opportunity\nWell that perfect storm of opportunity is right now and I just saw you come in a little while ago with these ah books these stretch for retirement book she got a bag of these uh for our listeners today the author of that book Patrick Kelly he talks about some of the strategies\nThat can get you that potentially lowered tax environment in retirement let's listen to Patrick and when he has to say about that\nI think the Roth IRA is a fantastic tool it allows you to pay taxes today not worry about having to pay taxes later on your growth\nSo paying taxes today versus postponing a our taxes John uh and paying those later on as you explained it in the past paying taxes on the harvest versus paying taxes little tiny taxes on the seats right now\nYeah I mean like we sit there with the client recently they um we're contribute to their four one K. and they weren't taken advantage of the the Roth option inside the four oh one K. and we try to explain to them it was titled taxes\nAnd what happens is you have a four O. one K. not all the issues so ready to Uncle Sam ... a silent partner\nThe the person who has his hand out waiting for you to start extracting money or taking money from your four one K. whereas if you were taken advantage of the Ross portion inside your four O. one K. you're going to use after tax dollars but that money is now going to grow tax free versus tax deferred\nA tax deferred means is kind of like you're getting on the mass pike you don't pay a a a toll getting all you're going to pay the toll when you get off the magic paying the toll\nIn in sturbridge rather than an astronaut times the amount\nThat exactly too so we had a conversation with them we help them start contributing to the Roth portion of their four one K. because that's money that's going to be coming out tax free so when we sit with people we we go through the process and not playing with them\nYou know taxes play a big role in this uh often times people have under estimated what they're going to have to pay in taxes on the eye or raise a requirement um distribution so you can't go to you can't go to the supermarket\nJohn and buy groceries with gross money can you know got to be a net and values had mothers taxes mean a whole lot and as you were talking about that part of the whole process is really have a conversation you know and we had a conversation with these people they heard about raw for one case but they never had somebody\nSay to him did you check with your age are department the CB had that option oh I didn't think about that\nAnd sure enough they had that option and they took advantage of that option and gave them a little bit better balanced when the money was to come out some would come out tax free\nYeah and they don't people think they're a tool like I thought it was too late you know coming down the home stretch but you know you have those um [noise] I ... a ... a catch all provisions and so forth so you know there's there's a lot\nOf always opportunities and what I what I'm basically getting too is have a conversation if you haven't started a conversation with you know maybe your advisor maybe it'll happen advisor\n... we give this opportunity people have a conversation with us learn more about our process learn more about the three sixty five retirement plan\nIn fact we'll give you an hour of our time John and I will sit down with you your undivided attention will listen to your wish list what your goals are what your concerns are and then ultimately put together what we call the three sixty five retirement plan\nWhich to them like let's let's tell people how we can we can help them\nAbsolutely folks are the number to call his eight seven seven six three zero eight seven eight seven eight
