{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Um I I I think that so many of the stories that have been told\n'em about you know anything that is you know spiritual a psychic paranormal any of those things have been told from the standpoint of people who were either born with gifts\nOr people who have died and come back to life and those stories are amazing in fact I Know these I've met many of these people they become my friends and I wanted to and I thought it was important to tell the story from my perspective because I'm not terribly special meaning I wasn't born with gifts I I didn't have to die and come back to life\nUm and and and the message from that for folks that you know you can actually experience this\nWe all can because I did and I was in my forties when this happened to me\nUm and and it's all there for us because there's so much that happens on the other side there's like a balance a light in the dark to it\nAnd if you want to experience you know the light part of it you have the assistance of the other side it's there for you if if you actually feel like you're you have go see in your house and there's a hunting going on I address that in the book as well I'm not really addressing the question I more than just felt like something that I had to do and I didn't have a choice\nAre you a medium as a result of this\nI actually have some medium ships skills I Would say that I'm OK at it\nIt comes up and it interesting times it comes it it shows up at restaurants in the car which is very strange probably when I'm my mind's more turned off is one that shows up but yeah I ... I Do\nAre you afraid of it [noise]\nNo I'm not afraid of it the only part of it that I'm afraid of is you know is it the other is is the person's response so I'm I'm careful about how I deliver a message I I never hold anything back\nBut I'm pretty gentle about things for folks um and just just for them to know that there's somebody there for them and can be scary for them\nUm and I never throw it on some and trust that upon someone right um so I've learned a lot of lessons about all of this you know through all of this and\nA lot of those lessons um I think are really important to whether you believe or you don't believe I mean I'll tell you the number one thing that I've learned is about I'm not having judgment on anybody about anything\nAnd it's a pretty amazing way to live if you're not judging it's pretty peaceful actually and I learned that through all of this\nJulie I Know that you say that uh everybody in anyone can be open to this and it can happen to anyone or does that mean anyone who is grieving or do you just think that anyone you know that you know\nI'm I think that actually anyone can um and you know certainly if you're grieving it's uh it's you know I Would never tell them how to grieve but if you're a grieving it is I'm In a certainly something that is possible if you you know to to look into ... on your past the healing [noise]\nUm but we all have powers we all do um and we all have different ones\nUm and so if you're in that place in your life where you're seeking and then of course you can and and I and I talk a lot about the different players which are the you know the ability to communicate with the other side whether it's through site um vision hearing all of that\nAnd I think some of the important things if you are seeking that you look at is what are you dominant in\nUm in your daily life so you know people who actually are um photographers probably have a better ability to be clear boy and people who work in the music industry right better ability to be clear audience and the most important thing is is to just begin to start to pay attention [noise]\nUm because what I learned I didn't experience that happened to me um when I was driving on the four oh five which is our nightmare driving and Los Angeles\nI'm where I heard the voice I'm of a man a male voice from the other side that warned me of an accident an impending accident\nI'm One that had not happened yet it it actually happened sixty seconds later but um that voice actually had me prepared and I ended up being that dominant that did not fall in that um car accident and likely ultimately saved my life and so you know sometimes if you pay attention you might help heal your heart but you can also\nAnd sometimes actually [noise] um the evil again be the dominant that doesn't fall\nUnder the name of the book as that goes to a photographer a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of make believe Julie thank you so much\nThank you it was great to talk to you too it's\nAbsolutely fascinating and folks can buy that book I'm assuming a Amazon or anywhere else\n... yes yes and ... yes yes thank you Julie thank you very much already\nI'm always wondering how people find their other careers or their their hobbies are there things that they like and whatever some find them and sometimes it binds you buy\nHer too don't have any not only do they not have anything to do with each other they run counter yeah they do data crunching is one thing and then trying to tell people that you see ghosts ... photographs has another nana my hard to hard to put that in numbers\nI just find it interesting that she now I mean\nShe she ... she goes in photographs and she why\nIs it to her iPhone can pick up a ghost in a in a photograph but my iPhone doesn't because I don't believe hard enough\n... yelling at me I Know that that's that's my you know what I mean ... my mind because you've got a crappy iPhone I've ... like I think she did when I asked her I said I Know\nDo ... what I see it and she said yeah you would\nThink you but what I Would you see it in her photograph fine but if you took the same images she does I probably not a reason why do people hear the voices and you don't ever you were in that car would you ...\n[noise] well no but I can understand where she can hear that in her head I can't understand why this technology can pick up that ghost because she's behind it versus when I Am\n... and it it's the spirit of it right isn't that how this is I\nGuess it I guess that's it it's that the spirit has presented itself\nTo her it shows itself Howard watched her and you can ask could let me know show me a sign that you are here yeah an amendment Campbell flickers or ...\nWhatever on this case they what their picture and their image into your picture\nYeah that's I just that's the part I kept I actually sort of got lost listening for one thing she said because it gave me all why why is it through technology\nI understand if she can hear things that I Can't hear or whatever but uh\nI don't know\nI find it really interesting that she's doing it in in the heart of her yeah\nUsually you do this on the down swing or when I left that business a couple of years ago I thought what's next in one thing that's always interested me and little did I Know I had a connection okay fine\nShe she's got a lot going on she's pretty damn busy and she's pretty damn successful and yet she's willing to make this sort of thing\nWell and I I Would I [noise] I Would argue that she says she hadn't really thought about that but I I actually I\nDon't know but I Would find that hard to believe because I think she has to know that the reaction that she gets from some people is pretty skeptical that could very possibly include the people she works for and around and it takes you to a place you know it's not like\nShe's using a a face cream and she's out there promoting it and people like wall at face cream doesn't work\nShe's saying she sees ghosts and she hears ghost right\nThat's pretty dramatic basis no she very ... very well may but I mean it's pretty dramatic right\nThis is not Ellen DeGeneres for cover girl this Dionne Warwick for the psychic network yeah\nPretty dramatic all Shirley maclean is the one that the ... and her bio that comes up and yeah she's gonna be lumped in there because Shirley maclean said she none I Believe in reincarnation she's multiple different people and blah blah and this is along those lines where that's where some people are gonna border for sure so\nIt is fascinating you're right that it's someone who is that what I Would argue the peak of her career right certainly right in the heart of it she as she pointed out to me she is president\nOf a you know ... Century Fox she's the chief this and that you know she's she's holding up the title\nBut normally a Tom Brady okay you want to do the Alex Guerrero thing and you want to have your T. B. twelve maps and well that sort of connected arrive link you need to write this has nothing to do with anything for her and it could be seen as a detriment right\nBoy so Boston\nNew York about one hundred and twenty seven to UCLA for eighty to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\nRetirement income generator is what we call in the industry ... and if you haven't heard about that stay tuned we'll talk certainly much more about regs\nBut essentially be Frank about Iran you help a lot of people a lot of our clients\nDiversify um have an asset allocation as they accumulate money as they as they grow money and you're you're educating them on why they should have money inequities why they should have money and maybe some safe for things\nBut really diversification yeah in same on top of that you need diversification within your retirement income portfolios that's exactly what rigs are younger exist\nAnd opportunity for people to understand that not only do you have options as the money's going up\nBut as the money that you're taking out you have to have a diversified income shorts so what do we mean by that most people understand Social Security we have it and retire and let's say you have your your essential expenses you housing bow\nYou know your real estate taxes maybe your car payment let's say five thousand dollars a month and your Social Security is four thousand dollars a month between you and your spouse will that will go a long way and you you can count on that you know no matter what\nYou know no matter what happens to the economy not four thousand dollars a month is going to come in where are you going to get the difference where are you going to make up the what we call the income gap\nAnd that's where rags really come in and it shows you different income sources and that's part of what we try to help people and educate people with how to diversify their income\nYeah you don't want to have to pull from your portfolio on a day it's down eight hundred points right so you want something that is reliable you don't have to worry about you can sleep at night at the end of the\nDay actually when it comes down to is enormously factor having added confidence knowing that you can\nEnjoy retirement without ... sort of like looking over your shoulder every month where's my money going to come from\nYou know and that's going to be a tough situation you see folks that are in the way you pointed the south's same whether you are just retired or you are in those critical five years out from retirement I mean you see a week\nLike we had to wear the Dow dropped eight hundred points and you may think okay you know I can maybe you know do okay with that but uh guys I'm thinking if you start to string a couple of those weeks together that's where you really start to get in trouble but you guys have already factor that in with the three sixty five retirement plan\nExactly Mike in in those days are going to happen nose or you can avoid those right you just don't want to be in a position where you really have to worry about it so you have to know what you have you have to be able to have confidence that you can still pull money even on the days you're going to lose ... going to go dropping what Ryan White\nBut it's not there's nothing you can do about what might or might not have short we can't control you know the economy the markets\nBut you can certainly control what you have and be prepared\nAnd you know we have the ... tried and true saying of our two rules rule number one just don't lose the money and rule number two don't forget rule number one and it sounds corny but if if you think about that and you follow those two rules as you are in retirement\nMan that would be a lot easier to sort of whether those bad times\nYeah hey listen in may sound corny Sam and I don't believe that it does but if you go back last week and the Dow dropped eight hundred points suddenly\nThose two rules are sounded pretty good at and and that's really what the three sixty five retirement plan is designed to do and that's how you guys are helping and not only your clients but folks that are coming to see you for the first time whether it be from the radio show here from your website or from the workshops that you guys are happy\nThat is how we help people without tried and true proven\nIt works it's a process called the three sixty five retirement plan and it's not one of those you know I think sometimes we meet people and they have this notion that they're going to come in and we're going to talk about high level stuff a lot of numbers are going to tell me exactly what to do\nI got to tell you the first meeting is really us listening I was listening to what somebody is you know worried about what somebody's goals are harming to they want to travel a lot of do they want to just you know a hang out and play with the grandchildren\nDo you think people are a little taken aback by that that that they're expecting that high level of conversation when you guys are just asking them questions and really getting to know them I mean that's got to be a little bit of what they didn't expect\nIt very well might be might but it's ... it's necessary for us to put together a tailor customized three sixty five retirement plan that will allow our clients to sleep a night in a day that's all the men\nRight I think a lot of people are surprised because when sometimes you ask people and the first few minutes hey so nice to meet you why you hear\nWhat do they always say to us you know my ... my girl and they don't listen to me I told him I wanted to slow down and not take as much risk in last week I lost five percent they don't listen to me so part of what we do and the very first stage not first process of that three sixty five retirement plan\nIs to listen to somebody's goals wants needs and concerns and then we come back with what Ryan said earlier\nI'm we take all the information and

days the ups and downs you need a way to get out of that and how the three sixty five retirement\nPlan can help you do all of that\nAnd of course we're here with Sam Wang and Ryan marched in over ... guys let's talk about the market because that's been you know eating up the headlines are as of late ah recently the Dow dropped eight hundred points\nIn a legal day but oddly enough guys let's talk about this to thirty one years ago also marked a black Monday which is when the Dow dropped\nFive hundred points so let's talk a little bit about that are there any contrast ... similarities and and what are you guys you know saying that your clients about these drops in the market\nWill it's been a really volatile time Mike I'm I think a lot of people are nervous or unsettled that especially the ones that don't have a plant and they don't really know what they have and it's causing I'm concerned when they see these drops of eight hundred points to a significant amount over two percent to their entire retirement or leave out you know that\nSort of you people can picture a ride to drive down the road and it's pitch black and the lights shining on the deer and more than they do they do nothing they stand than they do nothing and that sort of cars precaution\nYeah part of it is they don't know what to do exactly they don't have someone reaching out to them and say hey we're still on track we're not on track we need to make some tweaks right so they are here in the headlights\nAnd more importantly you know if you are\nThirty years old you might have the time to ride it out Ryan ... but you know we deal with a lot of folks oughta noon and retirement and in fact the other day we had a phone call with somebody that came to see us and they said you know it's critical that I don't lose any money because I'm gonna retire in about a month you know so now we have a conversation with him we're going to see them for a meeting\nBut imagine for a second if you or that person I retired two months ago and you're saying you know I just need to take five thousand dollars a month out every month because that's what I Need to pay my bills miles and goes my cell phone my gas bill\nAnd everything's going fine and then all of a sudden blame last week you'd be a little worried about taking more money on cars down right\nYeah yeah ... marketing amnesia they forgot what happened in two thousand eight and they didn't plan accordingly to prevent another\nTwo thousand and they actually you know Mike we came across this really good study by Stanford University their retirement study and they came across really what really intrigued me as how\nTo set it up so people can understand in part of what we do here on Sunday is not only are we here to have some fun\nBut we're here to help people you know we have to educate people on the things I Need they need to be aware of as they get close to retirement things are available on the market investments and all of those things in a Stanford University study talked about\nRetirement income generator is what we call in the industry ... and if you haven't heard about that stay tuned we'll talk certainly much more about rage\nBut essentially be Frank about Iran you help a lot of people a lot of our clients diversify um have an asset allocation as they accumulate money as they as they grow money you're you're educating them on why they should have money inequities why they should have money and maybe some safe for things but really diversification\nYeah in same on top of that you need diversification within your retirement income\nLanguage that's exactly what rigs are younger exist and opportunity for people to understand that not only do you have options as the money's going up but as the money\nThat you're taking out you have to have a diversified income short ... so what do we mean by that most people understand Social Security we have it you retire and let's say you got your your

that you can enjoy retirement without sort of like looking over your shoulder every month where's my money going to come from\nAnd that's really what the three sixty five retirement plan is designed
