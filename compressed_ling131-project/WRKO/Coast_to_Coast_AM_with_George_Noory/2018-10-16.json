Justice Ginsburg will say yeah this is a good a good idea because you never really\nYou know 'cause actually took it out on this and has said that this kid eight we should be fair we cannot take away the process right man that is not um it it's not right I mean get Justice Ginsburg is very much on the side of her acting day process\nWell I think that was a big influence from Scalia don't you\nProbably can\nReally do understand the process and they they you know they're appointed for life I mean they don't have anything to really craved anybody and I and I even I think that they let the law and you want to see the right decisions made\nI think that's how I look at the truth is I Know what this is a different subject but several times there were nine to nothing you'd Adams decisions against ... Obama and that included of course a\nA Kagan and Saddam iron prior uh and then Ginsberg on the left they voted against him on certain categories of ... through a three or four times there was a unanimous decisions against what he did\nSo uh yeah they take it and look at ... was thought to be conservative wasn't a Sandra Day O'Connor didn't live out to be what people thought she would be so you never know I'd once they get to the position they are going to carry it out as they see fit\nBecause president no longer under the influence over them or we only have a minute left what do you make of Hillary saying that building not abuse it was not an abuse of power against Monica Lewinsky even though she was an intern and he was a president of the United states and that they should not have resigned what what's your thought\nWell [laughter] I just think that that applies to everything at dealing with the title nine cause you know and then I had so many\nProfessors tip and kids and that you know what happened there was not an hour or an infant then why in the world are we having these cases you know that I'm fighting or with professors it's ridiculous it's it's absolutely ridiculous\nYeah and I'm a ... a clearly even though she was consensual\nObviously she's a in early twenties at the time or he's the president and um and even if she was open to what he should have known better that's the real point uh well I just don't get it all\nRight let's just say that I mean I Know that or what\nIf it was just a bit and and that's\nReally all I have to say about that that was\nYou know I agree with you it was actually correct well listen it's great to have you on the program have to have you back a good working continuing the great works that you're doing a Brit really protecting justice and I don't say that the academically I see it as a real world a description of what you do so if I could bring on the show good to talk to you\nAnd thank him I have a great evening to Mike Segal here because of the world the world will be good to you\nLet's let's do come to talk about down home values made in usa blue jeans\nLike you wore as a kid I remember\nThere's now saying\nWhat am I moved\n\nHere in the way they\nVoted down a Syrian crash\nIndian\nMan\nGood old fashioned comfort getting dime a dozen genes\nEvery stitch guaranteed in order to vendor motorcycle gene guns Kevlar reinforced see them a G.

also oh an award winning historian longtime friend the coast to coast am a porch and Mitch is a very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here I'll always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the ... which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and it's a big bridge that I've cross this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\nYou know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do\nYour show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group or their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my informal motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members some of that club\n[laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little group on the side of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting with sand says and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on\nThey weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with their sense of just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about God and spirits any invisible world and these people said\nListen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not was a member of the original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan doubled day we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written\nAnd I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself\nI Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe the thoughts are cause of death I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this\nAnd I wanted to write a book that we give people concrete hands on math is\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical\nDeparture from or natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away\nFrom everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise from circumstances and\nI've experienced miracles in my own mind the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off until I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization\nWith an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're a very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long interval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a font and the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives they will find an uncanny ... grew in sea\nBetween things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found the people who dabbled with the dark side tend to do some lives is this similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we faced these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist\nAnd they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities that responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that\nHowever we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in events mentally and and often these shows up in ways that we don't suspect so my message is also be careful be careful because what you're thinking\nAbout absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives of other\n... before you came on and he was in Israel and of course great mental list and it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland and over the stadium they put him in a helicopter\nAnd he was supposed to influence the ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved in and the guy missed it or something like\nThat [laughter] now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I ... when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor arrive and go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I haven't went in his bedroom drew a picture came out and said you drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know in gr Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program\nWas talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class and it ... or or type pin and he lost and you couldn't find it and he was telling or you bought into and out of the sky just out of nowhere\nThey heard upping and it was the tight class that that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the\nOther part of it the part that class into the the pointed at the end of it yeah was in ... ice cream [laughter] yellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing they're living there for that [laughter]\nIt's amazing but back to these miracles and we take calls next hour I'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but\nBack to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but nothing too but you know people dabble in the dark side the curse of other people they put ... on other people\nAnd in a lot of cases those things happen to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum\nAnd my contention is that thoughts are positive and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect\nHowever one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind power tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project negatives spell or thought on to another person\nIs if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else if he or she could not get rebounds tea is so in a certain sense where we grew up calling the golden rule is protection\nAgainst evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully\nBecause we're apt to overlook familiar things we're apt to overlook temple things\nIf you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there's an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't

you want to select announcing a reality that you want to select and a great time to use an affirmation of just needs to be spoken it does not need to be spoken out loud a great time to use an affirmation is those\nFew very relaxed moments just before you drift off to sleep at night sleep researchers call that the hitting the gothic state it is a state of time when you can not only reprogram your own psyche\nThrough repeating affirmation Z or prayers or holding visualizations but but cyclical researchers have also found that those few moments before you drift to sleep at night are prime time and ask those protests ... extra sensory activity mysterious things occur\nWhen people hold African nations in mind or silently repeat them to themselves in those few moments just before going to sleep at night that is an exquisitely unusual supple suggestible time it's a time\nThat each of us experiences every day you also experienced it just as you're coming to consciousness in the morning use that time that is the prime time for silently reciting affirmation stew yourself\nIn seems to work doesn't it\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my mantra is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nWaters some of the positives of mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals and I don't mean on a computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it\nBecause once you do that you've actually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the things that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not\nOnly helps persuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit\nDown and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life and you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential\nLife goals take that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night think about it as much as possible\nAnd when things on that list come to you and overtime they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and\nMost important of all don't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent because sometimes you share these things with other people and they'll roll their eyes are those say it's nonsense and they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day\nMemorize it and when the results arrive\nExpressed thinks that's a method we can all do\nAnd it's easy isn't it once you get into it\nIt is easy the the the the the important thing is to do it with consistency is to do it with silence and has to do it with total stark honesty arriving at a definite aim in life or a a a a a small\nNumber of things that coalesce around one aim has enormous power an aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass were prism they become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light natural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing\nThe idea that you have to really nail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's we're focused comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George\nAnd I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions that I never could have expected I've done television narrating\nAnd and and and written many books and articles including in places that are not known for their cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so\nI feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these methods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that I wrote tested myself I Would never ask\nSomebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know it's a dream come true in the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes the gestation period has also necessary\nIt is amazing work how people get this membership into the miracle\nGlide the miracle club I used to say that anybody can join the vertical club you didn't have to\nSign your name up anywhere there was no magic decoder ring in anything and of course that's true everybody who's listening is automatically a member of a number of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun if people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in America club but anybody who emailed me and I'm\nSuper easy to find throw my name into Google it'll take it on my website and my email email me and I will send you your own membership card to be in the miracle club you could find it you could folded laminated carry it in your wallet just something fun to have with you to sort of keep you on course throughout the day\nTo keep your thoughts steady and productive so I I thought it would be fun for people to have an official card\nA designating their membership and the miracle club so send me an email you get America club membership card\nWe're going to take calls next hour with Mitch or what's in of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising how many people have miracle stories overwhelm you know\nYou know we have to understand that life is made up of of of joys and and sometimes great tragedies but in as much as we do experience catastrophes in life and let's face it that's the part of why\nWe also experienced extraordinary absurdly unexpected moments of good news there are in fact kinds George where we get just what we're looking for and I would say that's more than just the turn of the roulette wheel our mind play a role in\nThat again a miracle is a departure from all expected at all reasonable circa\n... high school come back with calls next on coast to coast Dale find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to

along with Mitch or what's Mitch told me about the power behind writing down a goal women going for it\n[noise] you know it's interesting when we write down a goal and really demand that we put something out of a book that Dick and that's kind of magic\nAnd all of this material I Would say that absolute passionate intensity and the one hand and the buying every health health program with it\nSomething won't work without it nothing happens now one of my contention is that we really need a one absolutely definite cheap aim in life and that could be something that we very often resists\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over the course of days or\nOf course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener is whether you can come up with one overarching goals that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim\nYou have arrived at mental focus and mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\nInteresting work miniature what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put those together or did you do this on your own\nDough all on my own you know this is really my tribute to the thought of my own heroes and the mental healing tradition or things that they've thought about things that I've experimented with ideas that I came up with myself\nA you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who are stripers all of us who are experimenter is we're all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our mind\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles story that I've heard about was a financial miracle when I had a friend in New England who was recovering from a very serious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left to his name and he was on the brink of losing\nHis health insurance one night I challenged people like challenged people to make a marathon reading of the book George that I Know you love very deeply the magic of believe\nIn God and loved though\nYeah and my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happen to narrate he listened to it over and over and over for about five days on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss\nWho said to him you know you left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that you know you can carry thought it was a few dollars and cents his old boss had to have you looked at it there's over fifty thousand dollars\n... ...\nYeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend it truly felt like a miracle\nThat is a miracle it really is yeah\nIt's exactly what he experienced and was quite recent\nAnd when you least expect it you know yes\nYes that's what I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of hacked needs to say never give up but these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take in as much as life visits catastrophe on us and it does\nIt also visit extraordinary absurdly good news on us and you never know you never know what twist life is going to take in twenty four hours I always in poor people who feel desperate among other things among other things given twenty four hours more\nYou are a believer in visualizing before something happens aren't you have\n... absolutely I think that if you can get yourself into a quiet meditative state and we all enter this wonderful drowsy but still conscious and Congress and state just before we fall asleep at night\nAnd they act in image in your mind enact a scene of something that you want to happen but don't enact it is if you're looking at it on a movie screen\nAnd acted as if you're in it if you want to climb the ladder for example don't see yourself climbing the ladder like climb climb you know really feel those rungs in your hands really feel the weight of your of your feet pressing on each run\nAs you climb put yourself in a simple scene and then run that seen through your mind over and over again it's important to choose one simple scene in order to keep your mind from wandering because you will find that your mind wanders and you always need to bring it back if you can feel the emotions\nOf what would be happening as you're acting out that scene like somebody shaking her hand and saying congratulations maybe your boss telling you you've got a promotion at work in time and time that will Congress ties into reality may be in ways that you don't expect\nThere may be a long period of gestation or an interval but in time it will occur stick with it you were ...\nHarden into fact eventually\nLet's go east of the Rockies to begin your when Clinton township Michigan Hi Joseph go ahead\nI you're you're a great earth you violated and many

was doing right now the way All right then\nAnd I'm a miracle\nMiracle it is a miracle and I don't believe that even a yacht for that I heard a lady and all that a lot of how well you\nWell good for you but they do happen Mitch don't they\nThey do happen and it's also very important that we pass things on you know what we wish for other people ... to us because in effect\nYou know if if the mind is extra physical and then we all belong to some great over mine Ralph Waldo Emerson called it the oversold pneumonia and he'll called an infinite mind in a sense once we've determined that the mind is extra physical we determine that we're all\nConnected that separation is just illusory so what we wish for others were in effect wishing for ourselves and it is at adept to the phrase pay it

life isn't then said Georgia's nobody else in the cap the I don't know what that hand was er word came from but yet it to me it's a miracle\nYes it's it's it's absolutely extraordinary whatever the the causes whatever the circumstances is extraordinary that the challenge that we face has had to remember these things every day because what happens is\nWe become extremely forgetful this is where we doubt that our thoughts affect reality because we have a thought or we have an extraordinary occurrence and then we forget about it\nSo the challenge to each one of us and to every close listener becomes when something like this happens to you how do you get up everyday and remember it and not slip back into complaining or taking life for granted that's the challenge that we face in life\nWell
