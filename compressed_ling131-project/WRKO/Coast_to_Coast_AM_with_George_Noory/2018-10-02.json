Republican I\nWouldn't that well you're right but that's only going to be into Ruth Bader Ginsburg ways but court which she probably well within two years\nShe claims she's than another five years or\nWow that continue on our health but now she feels and there's a lot of factors are just start getting into that age bracket so I don't think she's going to outlast Trump so I think tropical ah nominate or a fight\nAnd is there any doubt ah of course we we don't know what's gonna happen anything could happen but as of now is there any doubt your mind that the Trump gets a second term\nOh no right now he's got over three hundred and fifty electoral votes in my work that bottle nobody can beat him right now\nYeah I mean it's it I mean the only places that same solid for Democrats of course the or California Illinois Illinois just as a ... going to be one of them was states the changes but all of those other states in the Midwest\nThat voted for him because of the economy and the ... and the good jobs and manufacturing jobs they're going to see what he did and then they're going to be with them it seems to me those same states will give him bigger wins next time\nYes and you have to walk away move where a lot of Democrats are moving because Trump because of his policies even if they don't officially leave the Democratic party it's amazing because the people on the Democratic party feel like they're more aligned with crime and they are with their own party\nWhat do you make of it it's a trend\nYeah no I think you're right and and if the Republicans do how to build on it they'll do well um and and\nIf I'm I'm at now having him don't now they'd better here the message um\nAnd then the I don't have this with obviously anywhere near the voice Russia has but I'll tell us in a rush who made the point if they don't get judge Kavanaugh's through to the Supreme Court they might as well walk away and even actually Lindsey Graham said today\nThat they don't deserve to have the house or the Senate and they wouldn't have the house or Senate because Republicans would stay home if judge Kavanaugh is not approved for the Supreme Court by this coming by the Senate\nOr you know sense that statement Russia's modify it quite a bit and he's coming more in line with ... or ... which which says that the anger is building\nAnd that even if the Republicans don't support Kavanaugh which I'm pretty sure they will but even if they make a mistake if they don't that are the people are so angry they just got voted out Republicans that aren't concerned but now\nAnd well that that's actually that's getting very\nMicroscopic most voters are going to look at it as safe as they're not going to be ... but most of them I Will not be that precise they're gonna say that well if the Republicans distance Kavanaugh we've all like the Trump to get those those kinds of Supreme Court justices and it didn't work evangelicals will walk away from them what do you think ten seconds a Republicans on the house in the south [laughter]\nOkay we will talk to a Monday Night about that very same thing for the feedback cycle Merrill thank you but the fact is or\nLet's talk ... let's talk about down home values fade into us a blue jeans you more as a kid I remember\nThere's now saying\nWhere they make me\nCry every\nYear and the way they\nVoted down a seat in crowd\nWhere you needed\nTo them and\nWere good old fashioned come for a dime a dozen genes every stitch guaranteed in order to vendor motorcycle gene comes Kevlar reinforced C.

Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two\nBut Jupiter will go into his home sign for the first time in twelve years it's the morning of November the eighth and that's going to last for almost Thirteen months\nThat is a sort of happy go lucky enthusiastic energy it's certainly good for anyone who's the sun science ... in general the next year or so\nOr by the way when you estimate the retrograde\nVenus goes retrograde this Friday I just mentioned that you know which could be the day of the vote up or down and Venus is a Scorpio and it's a ... I Want to tell people it's affecting anyone who's born around November second or third of any year so those people are going to get an extra dose of Venus over the next several weeks which is\nFocus on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sure that\nIt does feel that way um well you know part of it might be as out well one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know how the media is always there they're they're amazed because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information\nAnd so from the political realm it when people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they are being reported like Lincoln be split hour after hour and I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like\nThis whole thing about social networking we're you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there and so\nIt's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere and I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nCan you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me back in July and you're always popping out on New Year's day with us and right can you check out you know charge the rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] [noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one and you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you can take a look at the whole month of November by looking at the same midnight\nIn in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nAll be on the air with everybody\nWell yeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always rising and the son is in Capricorn at the bottom of the chart because it's midnight and so there you have to feed and all the other planets like for instance midnight\nNew Year's coming up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional positive war will go into its own sign actually late on December thirty one\nAnd then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars and um exercise and engineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but suddenly Saturn at the beginning of year is often you know too many frustrations a lot of blocks coming in\nBut I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand nine team for the world\nWhy does it work more why does astrology war\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this is what the old\nIdea exactly and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness the pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words\nIf everything depends on something being born at a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb if the ... still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that it's free then taking in the first breath like the declaration of independence is usually\nIt's really America's Choice because it was a first breath were were thing gets wedding when we're independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that choice but most of them do [noise]\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon and the various on it it's not that they're making things happen from outer space it's that whatever is born a person a president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time\nUh that that happened you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what that saying about the potential of my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers ... new one great barrier enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com when we come back in the moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month day in the air or if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time make it more accurate\nYou are you well look I could if somebody said to me I Know one on board and ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month\nAnd year I could do anything for that person not as exactly ...\nDo it because timing allows us all kinds of things sunrise or is it near noon is a ton said is it a midnight we're or the planets falling at that point because in twenty four hours most of the planet are going to be in the ... they're going to be in the same lines but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go\nHalf of the time and so the moon has a lot to do with our instinct or mood even reincarnation and looking back who may have been the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has what to do with personality\nThe sun is more of the character and kind of a life force and a connection and a little bit more just spirituality but so polarizing and which is fine rising the eighth that is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nAnd uh and tell me this march since you've been doing this way about thirty seconds before the brunt of your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done\nEver yeah is this field well unfortunately I well there's two things I'm studying the chart for when President Kennedy died okay because I learned so much about astrology and I was there well I wasn't

the L is Bailey teachings and so on [noise]\nUm and I found my mentor Dane Raj or who is one of the great ... century and he studied not just the strategy but philosophy of psychology and metaphysics of thought so I read all of his book and cut it memorized everything and the reason which if their students out there\nOf the planet mercury withdrew mind thinking communication at the time of his birth Pisces\nExactly at the same spot where mine was and I knew what his chart was and when I started reading this book that you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and off and underrated was on the same spot but any rate I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City\nAnd but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much more than just an astrology charts they ... they have to learn what's called transits and progression with a plan to keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince since you've been doing this and what was it that got you interested in it and a bench something happened\nUm I started going medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have\nStudied medicine in college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into ah all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics\nI'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of a psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first date or the first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home\nAnd just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned TV for astrology the space age science and it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people had studied\nA more of astronomy telescopes Galileo and so on they were all astrologers but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault they were all went to that\nPhony thing of astrology because they biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand you know why why was the greatest scientist before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology now how could that possibly be what what's wrong with a guy\nWith what they didn't realize is who was the science was taught in the universe is if Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt Rome greet you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's burned the December twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay more than one forty two in the afternoon\nIn Jersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know what I'm doing is just for people out there I'm not putting on my head I'm actually type it into\nA computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of get that information pretty quick in\nAnd you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean ah if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell them we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob you're good welcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah I thank you okay great you you're on with mark Lerner of given mark your birth date you know your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say\nUh of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon and tourists rising and he's born very close to a first quarter moon I'm\nA ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour people don't often study the moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an areas moon\nComing from other lives and like instinctual early this individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive personality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he\nHe has leadership qualities developed in other allies particularly in the last life and now with the sun and Capricorn kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual sons so it's an extra kind of a this year and the and coming into the fall of\nDiscipline responsibility being focused and he should be make sure he's strengthens his immune system and stays healthy to that um he doesn't become pessimistic about things\nUm but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\nOr do you have a question to\nUh yeah ... ... I'm not healthy now [laughter] well if you're not held on now again you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should study things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on another people didn't get it on\nUm go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics\nAstrology the power of numbers in neurology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you accept inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I've studied that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people and mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there's a whole field of esoteric astrology there was a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the ... trains and Edgar Casey\nThere was a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically\nBut spiritually when we're asleep psychic lead people who who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kind of thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else\nSo that's all part of things and definitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and\nOur incarnations like in the chart we're looking at the like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan a higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun moon and the planets and the configuration that we have\n... reincarnation astrological you speaking you were the born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that well were they born during the same time period\nOh no no no ... ... ... there's a whole question about that kind of thing\nYou know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought people would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I ever had in my life\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light worker kind of work at this stage in twenty first century\nMight come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from from a man and a woman that really being able to come into the world at an auspicious time to take advantage of astrological vibrations they're to me absolutely in other words the sold the spirit comes in\nAnd chooses parents and family based on family karma Dharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing when to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nExcellent let's go on to Cleveland Donna's with us\nIt's going to the program and that's my buddy Geraldo Rivera is in Cleveland now Hi Donna\nHi I was born in Cleveland, Ohio by the way okay\nPhil Donahue is February second that's my daughter's birthday by the way down the same thing okay every second Nineteen sixty in Cleveland, Ohio\nPossible by someone else me of course they don't have\nMoney to give me a raise or if you really want to give credit where credit's due or your weight I mean I don't know better you didn't need to take the chance to a day to win a thousand dollars all you've got to do is to listen to win every hour after the news from six AM to nine PM woke up here on the brakes\nW.

suggesting people have a bitcoin ... gold or silver IRA\nNot at all we give investors the option don't both in their IRA\nNow explain that force\nWhen I first heard about bitcoin traded for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how one guy by two pizzas with ten thousand bitcoins that were worth about twenty dollars at the time but here's the shocker today those ten thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars\nAnd what stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWow that's quite a pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight bitcoin is a

and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people want to own it\nI think it's there somewhere with probably four thousand other people have photo books\nOr do you covered pretty sensibly Romney yeah yeah yeah have you ever seen a you who Gordon three of them tell me about some okay well the\nThe first um was on this hour in Nineteen fifty five now I Lived on the Chesapeake Bay the little town in Solomon's Maryland\nAnd uh I was when I walked out into the there was a long half mile here all of them from the uh belong to the Chesapeake biological laboratory where the protection early meets the Chesapeake Bay\nAnd I was sitting there late at night when I saw a large light heading toward me that\nWas coming from the mouth of the Chesapeake then I noticed the outline of a large dish shaped object which suddenly dove into the water then rose back into the sky and headed straight for me\nAs it flew over me I saw bottom panel open and the UFO spray me with what I called in the book but tux and shower\nMany row straight up and disappeared and frankly the things scare the hell out of me and then the second citing occurred on April second Nineteen fifty eight\nI was returning home from Baltimore because I was a student at the Peabody Conservatory of music\nWhen I saw a large white light harboring over a barn\nAnd a few minutes later began blinking on and off and followed my car for most of the remaining miles Solomon's island and stopped and whole Harvard over another barn than a minute or so later is starting to perform some fantastic maneuvers\nIn an instant it appeared in one end of the sky than a split second later it would appear at the other hand\nIt did it did this for about half a dozen or so times than the stuff and then suddenly I saw a brilliant large red light that came out of the sky and merged with the larger light at this point in my car radio admitted allowed screeching Sam\nAs I approached the protection wherever the light cross the river headed headed south and disappeared and then\nUh that same that same year on November twenty Nineteen fifty eight\nI was standing outside my father's oyster house that faced tucked river at about five o'clock when I saw a a a a red street lights hanging over the river\nAnd there were about Fifteen or the co workers with when we saw three slender shake are shaped objects that we're moving slowly over the river to St Mary's county on the opposite side\nThan a fourth much larger object to approach it seemed to come out of nowhere and it dwarfs the other three UFOs as we watched the large objects began expanding from both ends at once\nAnd it quickly rose up into the sky at an estimated but I estimate of about a twenty thousand feet outlook to then they changed to a silvery desk and disappeared a tremendous speed and the other obvious followed suit and I had all these reports and the night cap and\nAll acknowledge that their um their existence they're\nNineteen fifty eight we didn't have an ear perhaps I could do that that's correct\nWe sure didn't you
