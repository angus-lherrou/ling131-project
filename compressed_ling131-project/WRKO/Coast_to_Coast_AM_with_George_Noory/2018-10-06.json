I'll find you the crime and that's how it works here\nWell that's how I was in a in a in a different way there's no ... well actually it is about the crime and Kevin O's going through that now and I mean certainly there and I'll find it I'll find you the crime they found the crime I mean if if he had done and I don't believe for one second they did it but if the ... the doctor for and what she says that's a crime\nBut I'm Still with and vital and then there's the other question was the under age at the time I mean uh it's not even worth discussing because I didn't believe it happened but there are some legitimate questions about that but\nThat's what we've come to hear now you can make the case that he's a of a statute that he can defend himself he's got half the Senate defending them the basically the Republican side he's got half the American people pretty much the fending him\nA but when you get to people like I described in Wenatchee, Washington who are basically apple pickers people the many cases were from Mexico and couldn't speak English very well\nOr at all and couldn't hire fancy attorneys you've got a real problem there and unfortunately in the end because of a net attorney volunteering as time attorney of great stature and they've got turned around but their lives were basically screwed up for for those years and in some cases ruined because of this\nGoing through and you say All right go without it can be railroad mind discovery in every court is ... ... ... and pull it out it was that I've seen them the railroad\nBecause there's so much or write a and a special will have the media or side they can basically destroy it I'm\nNot looking judge yet but I Will never get his reputation guy whether they can grow on them tomorrow and\nWell then there's that that's true and he said and they made that point\nUm yeah but you know um and it's just stunning\nAnd ... and ... there is no standard being used to I don't have any problem if you've got a person\nWhere there's reasonable evidence Senate doesn't have to be beyond a reasonable doubt because the Senate can make its decision on one of her rounds at once but at least those grounds have to be justifiable in some fashion and now it's come out that her ex boyfriend\nA doctor Ford's ex boyfriend is saying she did help a woman\nWith a lie detector um she can fly a and she just she sat on the road has she never help anybody ... as to how to use on a lie detector a polygraph test um and then now the foreign for instance he wants to do it I in other words we've got these\nI'm clear violations of any standard of justice and even though there that you don't have to have the rules of evidence as you would in court it would seem to me at least that you would have to have some standard of fairness before you tell somebody you can't have this job because\nYou committed that that crime against Dr Ford when we see that she has all these discrepancies and hearts and our presentation and there's nothing there to tangible you go on\nRight well you know Mike Pence why Diane ... is that um that's a good thing for all the time I mean the bottom line was they didn't want to investigate and they want a good toilet alive\nAnd for the middle of these hearings and the way the vote and they pulled that off\nWell clearly they have\nA to disagree but I think he's going to get confirmed\nIn the end I Can't imagine a and now that the reporters in and then then that's all done but the the ... the other question becomes what is going to happen in the future and the other question becomes a I mentioned a minute ago\nIn the criminal justice system we have protections in St cards for defendants when you just pointed out and I just pointed out defendants who are wrongfully convicted\nAnd the case in Philadelphia and the case in Washington state that these people were wrongfully convicted\nAnd how many more of those kinds of cases are there by the thousands over the years that the ... from ... in the system didn't work with the way it was supposed to for people because somebody short circuit the system\nAnd shouldn't we have been some kind of severe punishment than that and then and then a prosecutor knows if they do this they're going to lose their license to practice law and maybe even go to jail I mean shouldn't there be some clear guidelines about this even though there are laws they don't seem to get enforced\n[noise] really wouldn't be able to walk across as face to share it\nI'm about to get the points of special investigator and you know they care and open to other\nThan that you know that\nThey do and if they can show they acted in good faith which they probably protect themselves even if they're acting in bad faith these prosecutors know that only after the show that they're acting in good faith and ah ... evidence of that\nAnd then they're going to be protected you're right they facts and bad face and you do something intentionally like uh like for example or denying the defense evidence and you knew that it was evidence electrical paid the defendant or you've got a problem then because that's criminal\nBut I'm\nAlso from the stack line is you know against the gold Ninety percent of federal indictment that under the plea bargain you know and then the\nPeople that are already to go to take the case to court\nOr like the ... I wrote about in the book though they always say it's over Ninety percent of those cases are one as well\nAs you know most of the news or or you know when the appeals court she got like three or four percent chance of winning also some stacked against criminal defendants\nWhile the other part of it is that the prosecutor typically has I mean they've got a they've got deputy prosecutors on staff\nSo they can choose to go go after whatever defend that they want to go after and uh they're they're paying these people anyway so it's not as if there's more than maybe more expense for travel or investigating or whatever else\nGoes on during the investigation but they've got the people on staff a defendant doesn't have unlimited funds I'm right you know ... or so and then the defendant can never stand up to a prosecutor if the prosecutor has it in for that defendant\nUnless the defendant has great well or the money to continue the case they're going to lose\nAbout in the book that I've gotten 'em yet it is that it was well\nAnd I'm going to store because the whole system is back when they were asked I don't know no I Know you got on the way as well as all the bottom line is\nThat we're supposed to be the case we're supposed to call the costs of care is accountable and typically in some cases especially the most ... filing journalist Amanda ... says his goal to all these guys accountable and ours is what\nThey use the horrific thirty seconds do you think that there was that the Kevin our case in what you're describing slowly to greater justice or are we going down the past of a more power and less justice for prosecutors [noise]\n\nLet's talk comfort let's talk about down home values fade into USA blue Jay he was like you more as a kid I remember there's ways now\nWait a minute\nWe're adding every\nYear and change the way they\nVoted down and cry\n\nDown and then\nGood old fashioned comfort getting diamond guessed that genes every state's guarantee in order to vendor motorcycle drinking scandal or reinforced seat of a G.

owe so\nNo he was a consultant on the show to are also but he did and uh but he really couldn't help set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do it's like when we were in one of the studios\nAre doing a um\n[noise] a something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a a missed Barbara stand with standing there\nAnd I I looked at her and I in my mind went totally blank all I could remember was Victoria Barclay from the big Valerie\nAre exactly and what she was classic actually\nAll while and she was a little whip up I think she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm start offering because it's like oh my gosh\nAnd uh and she was her ... and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in James the mistake of some one of the cameraman said who is that and James Mates mistake of saying some old time movie actor\nOh no oh yeah you know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going\nI literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it and I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's that going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead\nAnd she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you can do if you went to the light\nAnd she said\nHuh and I said have you talked to other people live people she said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go but you show up and talk about an inch she went in the light so\nI Hope so one of the people that when I get up there she screams\nDo you remember that movie pulled guys in the the little ... little lady kept showing little I don't go home I won't want why did she say that\nI don't know I I have no idea I\nI thought that they possessed or tricked or something some strange way it changed your personality\nOr should I Know they they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when goes whisper was being shocked for somebody to buy it out there in LA and uh the person that would take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house\nAnd sell\nIt turned out that they knew who the ghost was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't go right\nAnd so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was person on the ... whore house\nHe says and and that and I helped you know we work on that and I looked at him and I sort of squint at my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you\nAnd he looked at me I says why did you put flies in the attic what would that have to do with anything and he said we have Fifteen seconds to kill\nI said flies have nothing to do was go I you needed to exterminate or not a ghost person I says why did you even do that it's like people they just they do things that they think it's going to be scary or it should be part of that I don't know where they come up with this stuff\nIs a dangerous Marie I'm to dabble with the other side if you really don't

life Fifteen Years later you know maybe\nIt depends on how powerful the individual is\nOkay and then um as far as uh uh uh I don't know what it on the idea of energies shopping or something I've noticed that ah in myself when I feel kinda awkward and uncomfortable or around people if I think of myself as sort of a White House generating not visible light\nBut then for red warm you know and you're not supposed to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this guy

you want to go and not a well I had just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt I thought well now he goes well you might as well get up and\nMove around on others as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like\nI said it was about an hour away and we got up that direction and hung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe another thirty miles from\nWhere we were there and ah I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got up there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into the bar or they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar well focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck about\nLike a bar full of empires or something yeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or at the swatter bright and sign up on a rope or something yeah\nAnd and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country\nAnd it was an old I mean this was an old dad gummed seating bar yeah and I went in there with them\nAnd to this place and that was a bunch of old\nPeople that there again I felt that are in the in the air and\nI told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I've worked with him um and ah yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in a car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a war off on the farm and the caller won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven of us in the car\nAnd uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum\nSo they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening\nAnd the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people when and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was uh our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name\nLeaders are doing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's\nPrayer and it was weird because\nThose guys are this one girl that was what this dude and I went up her where she looked at me and I was an outer ring a word she says are you\nPray him and I says yeah and she goes even better\nShe knew one looming up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and\nSays any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb where we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that bothers the lord and\nJesus in my heart which we had these strange Myers about nothing is going to be stronger than the the like it's in may\nWhat do you think that are rolling what do you think there are game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they were somebody into um where they're going to kill you
