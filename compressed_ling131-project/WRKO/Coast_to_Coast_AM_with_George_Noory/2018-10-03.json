{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Bloomberg is now donating twenty million dollars to help democratic candidates running for the U.S Senate\n\nWhy the Republicans think that the Democrats are a threat to taking majority control of the Senate is not clear to me because as I told her I said earlier in the last segment\nThere were twenty five Democrats seats that are up in the Senate and only nine Republican seats that are up do the math that's nearly three to one which means by nearly three to one Democrats are in elections where they could lose\nFor every one for Democrats for every one Republican so I don't know what the real problem is but the twenty million is going to the Senate majority pac of the Democrats\nBloomberg also pledged ... million to Democratic House candidates this year eighty million for them twenty million for the Senate there's a hundred million dollars is giving to Democrats as a former Republican\n\nHe became an independent after leaving the Republican Party and now of course he's donating this money I in large measure in my view because he's thinking about running for president in twenty twenty\nBy the way the amount of a hundred million dollars in that in the house and Senate races that he's pumped into these races is more than in prior races he's paves the given money to liberal causes especially as I mentioned the pro gun restriction crowd\n\nThe Democrats need twenty three seats in the house to get the majority\nThat's a substantial number\nAnd uh they they need to get twenty three if they're going to take control we'll see if that happens\nIt is true though that there are some tight races for Republicans\nWe know about the Senate race in Texas Senator Ted Cruz in a dead heat with the Democrat Beto O'Rourke who said some nasty things about women by the way the scandal broke today so that might hurt him a lot there was a case of a Republican candidate for governor years ago and in Texas against Ann Richards\nAnd when they were debating at one point or on the same plant podium same stage in one of the campaign events he came up on the stage she went over to shake his hand and he refused to shake her hand\nHe lost the election and many argue that was that symbolic gesture refusing to shake enriches hand the costs in the election because Texans are very protective\nOf treating women and they gentlemanly fashion and even if you disagree shaking hands as not supporting the other person's views that simply being courteous so many taxes arguably\nOpposed that candidate because he wouldn't shake her hand that's I say that because this democratic candidate now has been out and today we're seeing so very nasty things about women\nBut that's that's been up to now a tight race we'll see how it goes Marsha Blackburn a member of the U.S house in Tennessee\nHas trailed in most polls behind Phil Bredesen who is a former governor of Tennessee\nAnd now they're dead he they're dead even she's been trailing but now they're dead even I think if the president goes back to ... Tennessee maybe two more times before the election or at least once he might give her that edge that she needs\nThe pack that Bloomberg is giving the money to the twenty million for the Senate is controlled by people who are colleagues of Chuck Schumer the minority leader\nChuck Schumer of course has become radicalized because the left is pushing all these Democrats\nFor this radicalizing on the left side of the aisle\nThe thing about the past is that they can spend unlimited amounts of money on elections but can't coordinate with candidates so yeah they can spend all they want\nAnd raise all they want what they can only do that in parallel with candidates they can't ever talk to the Kennedy has there been cases that I'm familiar with that went to court because of the Kennedy spoke with one of these packs\nAnd not that anything even happened\nFrom the conversations but you can't even talk to the pack\nAs a candidate you've got to keep your your arms length distance from them that's the rule but the benefit for the pack is if you follow the rules is that you can spend unlimited amounts of money on your agenda and nobody's going to stop you from doing that\nSo we'll see how uh\nHow all this plays out but Bloomberg is out there betraying the party that he was once a part of and unfortunately betrayed I'm Rudy Giuliani\nWho's endorsed them and frankly Bloomberg would have lost that election without Giuliani's endorsement for mayor of New York in two thousand one and a that was that\nMany time and I want to repeat this so we all understand what's happening with the FBI investigation and what's gonna happen in the Senate\nIs that Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader said that every senator gets a copy of the FBI report on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee judge Kavanaugh\nThere'll be a report of there'll be a vote in the full Senate this week and\nMcConnell has more to say with certainty\nThey'll get the FBI report this week and they will be a report this week those two facts according to Mitch McConnell\nOnly senators can look at it as I said earlier and McConnell said he's going to fight any Democrat tempted attempts to delay so he's going to get it done\nAnd luckily as majority leader he has the power to do that uh there were some questions myself included as to whether Mitch McConnell would go to that extreme to just simply use his\nFull power when the Democrats tried to delay and of course they will as to whether or not he would um overrule the Democrats trying to stop the vote and the answer is that he will definitely says at least\n[noise] so we'll see how that ah transpires [noise] for the good news that the feds McConnell his very focused he's we're facing these in a couple of speeches in the last two days on the floor of the Senate is talking about the Democrat reprehensible strategy and the good land judge Kavanaugh was that a stellar records impeccable records\nAnd that he intends to have the vote on the floor this week that'll be good news and he will win\nIf he gets to stay with us thanks for listening\nWell and how fast as hard embody extract work to improve blood circulation lifting\nMy name is Alice and I'm sixty six years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries I had Seventy percent blockage in one large relating to my heart they wanted me to go on topics but I refused to negative side effects\nAnd body extract of a unique valley energy in proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around Ninety five percent at the cellular level\nWithin the first month that southern dramatic difference happiness and my legs was reduced within two months I felt completely normal\nDoing natural organic herbal formula for heart health is hard and body extract hiding body extract comes with a one hundred percent ironclad night that guarantee detail the H.

people have different views Steve ... book outside the green box telling me about the title first of all\n... this is a book that tells you what's your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over his think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green box because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there\nAre the ice caps melting or not\n[noise] what we've had a gentle warming again we've had a degree in the last hundred and Thirty years\nAnd so there's a little bit of ... at the north pole and I'd Greenland but the amazing thing is the ah the south pole ISIS getting thicker I Love the show a picture of the Amundson Scott station\nIn in my presentations should I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody to come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nA and they leave built\nThey built this last station on stilts it's seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow\nAnd that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole but on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying this huge sheets of ice falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about cities that one renewable energy [noise] plus or minus you\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional\nNuclear gas or coal ... when you put in solar wind or you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent\nOf renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar and people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries\nSo this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure uh some of the studies\nSay that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the a cost of their wholesale electricity and that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top\nSo this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about in my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess\nAnd now they are all modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S\nAre lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way um our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen\nEighty are six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide\nOr water is is a is not where it ought to be but the the Great Lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe the ... the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is making a comeback\nAs a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person have the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that\nUsing energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate\nThe nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get the nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming matches yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October every little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite\nA climate skeptic to climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized then\nDo you get booted no I've\nNever had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible a man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution\nClimate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of age cycles which are uh the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles\nThey cause the ice ages then we have medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that a scientist believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm\nUm the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example than the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycle so the and the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nWhat's to come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines in what people participate with you\nSign up now for

Streever wrote a book called the coming global superstorm\nAnd that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and while I was wondering was or is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what these predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with Yellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming and the Kentucky or is it very possible that the ban in both of those movies that very well happen\n[noise] yeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve is Yellowstone and that full Cain although I understand there's a big went under their\nTheir call during the day after\nTomorrow is based on the idea that um manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slowed down the Gulf Stream which is part of a the a a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sinks into it flows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian in the Pacific the the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a\nCause of water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so\nAre there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream\nWasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this is an actual thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nOh\nThey'll make your head\nStill doing its thing well okay go ahead John\nYeah but in the army who ah who quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking about\nLandfills when I when I was\nLiving in Oregon okay and I used to drive past the wind will that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and it was about a twenty four foot booth\nPlane you know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas well we're asking now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd what do you know Chris city\nNow come back and they said no no no don't cost too much I can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Want to go why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas\nOr they also want to get methane from\nWater treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills\nA but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi George and thank you for having Steve von Loor\nBump into spoken to him several times are\nHurting on many shows and he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that accuracy a there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends Steve\nNot than they are the same mistake that he's a climate game hopes there's\nA are using a ... I Believe me I Believe you said\nA one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars ... I'm Sorry two billion ... it's quite a few of those are those are United Nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nWell I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day\nOr we wouldn't have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double their two dollars a day just four dollars a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject may end or a ... a\nA young child than a\nHere's the point is you've already said they were willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what's the process is told us is this is your sense shift in thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people daily\nA dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massive really improve the airlines they're doing All right well how does this last we will ridge a lot of them are are turning illegally into this country because\nIt has been tricked and deceived into thinking you're going to get a better quality of life and they had down there because you're having a lot more money in their pockets but yeah I didn't\nSo let's see what they've done they've given at sixteen thousand dollars to give away\nEvery day made possible by house me of course they don't have money to give me a raise or if you really want to give credit where credit's due or your weight I mean I\nDon't know better you the me dig the chance to a day to win a thousand dollars all you've got to do is to listen to win every hour after the news from six AM to nine PM yeah welcome you're on the great\nW.

all forests and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to\nTo NASA uh their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age no scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years\nOr any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet oh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nWould obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm uh there are some some um\nIndications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast but this ... it used to be a big court or a big port on in in the\nNorthwest Italy an excuse to report as well so there were some times when the oceans were higher\nBut again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise will matter what they what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like to mention I perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and done what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time to weather stations a news article scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections they're\nSpraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky and they no doubt this a lot of\nBut harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it first of all any time you watch the news you are watching at Emanuel factored why\nYou're not seeing the real ... weather satellite max that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon but there's a site I it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood\nThis guy is obviously a former meteorologists she keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite maps but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm fronts hurricanes tropical storms low pressure is on coming directly in the California and they're being blocked\nAnd is being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up there very powerful I Believe they can play out as much as three billion watts of power and can the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can ...\nHurricane they can fall hurricanes they can blast under head they can break up low pressure zone and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act of the military industrial complex what's happened our with our weather\n... when I hear about it and the new law sketch team's reaction to that Bruce like you\nSaid some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead [laughter]\nWell is it going man just said it exactly right I'm One of these conservative it happens to believe\nThat the way to add on is being gay oh engineered the came trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently at gentleman on his show talking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the body out son\nWell people are so much shoes Jorge about the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's it's to the point now you can go to Wall Street and bet\nOn the stock market on the weather if they want hurricanes that they want to intensify the hurricane through the heart\nAnd now on top of that then you got the geo engineering of the story on the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea that man ever come up with man is not smart enough\nTo harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing with Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham men they want they were doing is gripping the oil industry all nations away distributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd mean China's there with their sky completely online with pollution not paying a dime and do it either as Russia but the United states of America would have gone up quite okay now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had to wear out of time Steve and ed thank you for your comment Steve thank you good luck with the work outside the green box

[noise]\n\nAnd\nWelcome back to cost a cultural here with William ... author of the big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when a break on us\nOff and on this particular day he was standing there and the noise or the falls and on the opposite bank of the creek\nWhich was rewarded with toll kind of pointing ... uh pines he sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee\nSo he's watching this thing going up and down and thinking to themselves\nWhat on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here\nNow he couldn't cross the river and\nWhen the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees surrounding it a little in other words there were like low boroughs ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it and went to climb down\nWe couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up\nSits there and one position and staring at him so now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later he sees the ... in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the pools\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy\nComing along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one\nCarrying the other one who knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was known maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with your kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a there's been a number of people that moved houses are a\nUnited sooner aren't and rural areas right\n[noise] ... yeah for the most part are people backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about Maine oh this is a very interesting a story a\nInvolving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business uh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the risk of New England combined\nAnd you're Ninety percent of it is uninhabited\nSo when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state\nAnd so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine or the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them well gardeners they will gardeners\nThis was like a match made in heaven well as it turns out\nOver time they found they were accusing each other of losing the gardening tools the wife is saying the husband was a shovel where's the rate was this so finally the husband get the idea that they're going to gather together all the tools they have doing inventory\nAnd then they were going to keep them all locked up with the exception of two small hands spades so having to accomplish that they realize they were missing some tools\nAnd they started they left\nAnd based on what she called the the wife pulled the stroke table on the patio and they were using them for partying plant [noise]\nAnd no sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hand spades withdrawn [noise] they had actually called the police report on their property of you know\nTools and this and that number could understand who would come on their land and take tools and take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel\nYou gonna run the place Rob the place well [laughter] bright TVs and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods [laughter]\nThey found one of the shovel leaning under a tree and the wife go out nine feet off the ground one of these and what one can garden trial with a rubber handle on it showed into the side of a tree nine feet up\nNine feet up so they went back to the house they got a right I guess an iPhone shrimp that took pictures of it they brought a ladder out the husband couldn't butch drifting buried under a tree several inches thick couldn't budget\n[noise] so they had recalled the police and\nTold them the story about finding the shovel in the woods showed the cop shoveling the ... everybody was baffled by you know the turn of events you anyways the long and short of it was\nThe cop told them look if you have any of the problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass it on to the detectives [noise]\nWell\nI said the long and short of it was a couple of days later\nThey came outside and the guard and behind the house had been trampled down there were huge footprint in bed or tomatoes were taking the head of lettuce one mash and whatever had done this which was obviously a big but\nI kept right over the fence not using the gate there was a gate on the garden and it just kept right over the warrior went in at its full speed\nAnd then they recall\nThe uh the police over the what had happened that transpired and he actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had report\nPeriodically of people saying they show these big ... creatures coming in their property of walking now so\nIt isn't convincing yeah it's not like it's not like these things on being seen it and not being talked about which\nIs a very odd thing you don't you don't you think back to us to\nTalk about

Boston and only heart radio station\n[noise]\n[noise] okay\nWelcome back William she and what those William the abominable snowman but yeah the from the Himalayas is that the same as the big four we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so although I'll tell you something really interesting uh I had an account of coal to me by all things a Russian professor who was out hiking with his landscaper that had befriended\nThis if this vast knowledge of things but time Nicole and they form this unlikely friendship and turn that into a hiking partnership they had run across a couple of big for its\nMessing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor\nSaid that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was on familiar with no this is a Russian speaking immigrant saying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was on familiar with\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman it's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea\nAnd did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing and Minnesota and they talked on a\nPulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought the look clear and they could sit\nThere and rest for a little while and they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ... and they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant\nAnd they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as\nThe uh the uh uh yesterday and the abominable below snowman I have no idea uh I have a ... book the abominable a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature a and yet getting back to what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything\nTo the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about big foot or a hoax the film is a hoax all of the\nUh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taken everything's a hoax to them so you know we have to just keep doing what we do\nA in spite of ... what the majority of the people out there I think about that is one of the things I Love about coast you know a a we'll tune in because we're hearing things that we can get\nA little changes nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos in big encounters where's the Tania\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the dead falls incident\nBut one day they'll share with you a\nWas named the orb and it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys ... we're working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania\nTo do a weekend of survival training or on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and then the second day uh the focus was on that of ah getting attention being saved so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words held than SOS uh using branches in ... and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green bows and that night they decided to go on a night hike\nTo see what it was like a navigating around in the dark\nAre now during the day they had climbed up the side of the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area right night\nFor the hike well when they got up to it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was\nVery bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision or by knock you lose your own monarch yellow or that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail\nOne of the kid says hey what's sad\nAnd they noticed in the distance of light moving around in the woods now of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a battery operated lantern\nBut then they realized that this thing started ... daughter around in a crazy fish and which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in or around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they've been trying to get closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believed there were a buck Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey can see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming eating the trees around it\nSo that the parents and the guy who was that bright\nYeah I mean it's it it it's a glowing or above late ... around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's doing something really weird he described a number of picture this George a two inch wide let's just say ...\nA two foot wide beach ball he described a globe ... coming out of the size of this thing as being like when you blow a bubble through warned as the trial okay\nSo this thing is coming out of the side of this or and making its way down to the ground [noise] and what blew the mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like twenty times are thirty times the volume of the orbit self\nAnd yet the war was on changed and this thing was attached to it\nNow they still want to see a big foot appearing in this secondary glob coming down and they described it as being like in his state of suspended animation that wasn't moving whatsoever but they were certain to what they were looking at\nAt some point the glob separates from the orb and now you have like this power of blue and white like with this big foot in it and the orbit sitting separately it was then that they said\nThe ... white light that was surrounding the big foot\nStarts to dissipate where now the creature was left standing in the light of the circular roller ... and then they said it started to move at that point they got out of dodge\nWritten on the trail blame oh yeah I Can't blame the broke camp and while they were breaking down the tenth and everything just to get out of the place looking up on the mountain they saw that the war which\nHad originally seen was back to ... around in the woods or which got their attention initially and what had happened to this big foot they had no idea and nor did\nWhen the big stories break judge capital as a second woman has come forward\nNo one has backed up her story shoveling baseless thank me believe I Believe in telling the truth a smear campaign
