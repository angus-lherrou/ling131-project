when those stories were unfolding in seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something to put somebody in a costume or\nA ... an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell in this book about something called the wind man this is a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\n[noise] oh yeah ... ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chase in central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid so I Know the area very well and it's a it's a large area of a woodland far Iceland\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be too hot spots for paranormal phenomena the kind of chase he's just the same you know they become known as window areas where it seems every fit in each brother come through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post and somebody had seen this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better term to use over the woods a at a high speed um you know kind of a like a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess the you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... it in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of the name and spoke to the local police so I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spite of weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough like the dog man and a defined to black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nI'm I think for that reason um you know ... that's the I think that's the responsible way to do is to sort of look at the day to\nAnd and share rates and that's what I Do I put the diatribe for people to say I mean if I got out and says I tell people if I don't have an says I'll tell them you know they should they should just say ... or ... or or possibility\nUm [noise] you know I'm not going to tell people that big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of the moon\nWhich I don't believe he said by the way [laughter] but\nUm you know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is\nIs not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you go that's called that squash and you share that with us\nWell yeah the the the ... is he really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that\nSort of pops up he's not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who do I want to know was the fact\nAnd then he'd never seen again but this particular case is an interesting one um it ... and I pulled Nineteen sixty four in ... Washington\nAnd I'm actually quite close to my room there on the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed um he sold the strange ... he was driving along the road and it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings\nBut it was kind of Harry as well [noise] scares me and how the shining a yellow eyes but the sort of the ... the hair angle\nCombined with they the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like\n... ... square and um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I have talked about that before a that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mistreating and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I'm going to be honest with you Georgia I'm doing five books now on on these phenomena foreign the men in black and one of the women and black and I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they typically are described as looking\n... you know go on and the skins lied white white\nUm [noise] um people talk about how vaccines have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them\nBefore they even talked about when they're in close proximity to them by full and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women and black of turned up in homes right after paper being using wage bullets which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a golf a horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe this but many black mistreat it's fall be on you know just guys in a black suits\nWalk you know I guess I'm\nKnow I'm asking it into contact sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um\nUm humans and helicopters are that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we're going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction files but where in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nOr pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you are people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well I mean I think you know when you talk about the economy the tuitions you know you've got a really we won the next couple of some which are apps to explain\nVery demanding black guy but in some cases I think government agencies are responsible for the paper I think it's a very small gotcha great\nThey really unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support\nIt over the years agencies may actually unemployed that elections are demanding black I was amazed to cover their tracks in other words\nIt might be able to think of them and know that many black radio but I don't know what they are but it doesn't even from using the legend among hey resumes too quiet April or\nMay not one of them chose cases so the government might actually not know the men in black really are and I don't like to fully\nBut that sort of lead us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction ... what the government doesn't want you to know that next latest book\nUh whether or not you believe alien abductions are real the files on elite abductions are real when I tell ya what might be going on there based on some of the real life a document that Nick has

Boston in a heart radio station [noise]\n\n\nBack we're talking with Dick red burn a you know there's an old joke about paranoia paranoia ... something along the lines of just because you're paranoid that doesn't mean somewhat isn't really following you around that sort of the the the inspiration for this new book or yours top secret alien abduction files you're\nIn which we live we're mass surveillance is sort of a given now right\n[noise] well unfortunately in of course you know a subsequent generations Tyler do grow into a world where I've never known any different you know I'm right\nThey live a certain age you know before the Internet age will remember that um that was not that sort of um worldwide surveillance that we have now and um\nYou know I think that's one of the unfortunate things for future generations it's gonna be a ... a normal thing for them and and probably accepted as well\nYou know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea the fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to talk us into getting a computer chip stuck under our skin and then they can follow us and they don't want to be for all the good reasons you know for health and wellbeing and\nAll kinds of ways been in effect they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance devices like that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would what time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things of that sort of healing abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what would you in abductions are all about that that idea ... too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\nYes I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually the official publication diabetes the first to November but people can already got it [laughter]\nBut um the the reason I wrote top secret I mean abduction falls is because over the years I've collected a number of official documents on abductions which are being day classified through the fate moved from ... in the ... um the u._s. and finally I was in a position where\nI could actually sort of put the book together and you know provide the raid the wave yes it's another book on Eileen abductions bus instead of going just overall ground you know\nWind up present paper with the guy just showing how falls would be put together now I'll start the book actually with the contract a movement\nOf the Nineteen fifties which preceded they abduction phenomena by just over about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would go so to speak\nBut um government agencies do ah put together falls on paper who claimed to have had I in Kansas for example just about all of the ... of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia dams scheduled trans hassle true and bathroom ...\nAll of them had FBI falls out putting on them one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI\nThat yes like ... ... ... aliens but they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a governmental governments very different two hours and bordering on\nCommunism and I'm so that really opened the eyes\nOf the FBI to the extent that\nFor example George finds hassles FBI file 'em is extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages I'm ... she was about ... and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon\nWith the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties things really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one\nI'm with the bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess is the defining moments you follow gee when\nIt wasn't the first abduction case on record but it was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn fool around his book on the case they interrupted journey now in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail rights they you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange and I get back home and then they start having these where dreams and nightmares of being taken on board\nThe strange craft would they be strange creatures and being subjected to a stranger and intrusive experiments now what's particularly striking is that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man\nWho was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning to I Am\nAn essay was driving the vehicle to the location they the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd they say they should become known as they the vehicle interference phenomenon where they knew ... what's intriguing\nIs that they they uh British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised in security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved in espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the ... he talks about how they ... they promised in the security services interviewed Ronald wild man by the same time to with the with the ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him and the most\nTelling an intriguing aspect is that he told the police and this is a direct quotes that he was modeled by the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time on goal of abduction little in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO coming down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to be strange checked his watch\nAnd there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking\nSort of bemused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about him the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys telling you is crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA scientist studied UFO topic and they conclude\nThe UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion is that a justification for going round people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers have landed published in the early fifties that that's sold him huge figures are gigantic numbers of books were sold\n'em on and a damn ski went on the ... it's a little around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a call me and this type of governments um the communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file on a damn ... um\nPredominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with aliens busts the FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by this\nA lot of you saw on our guys want to get in November's

Boston in our radio station [noise]\n\n\nNicorette burn just before the break we started to delve into Canada mutilation and of course there are many different kinds of animals that are carved up in the same manner cattle and horses and deer and the other ... other kinds of creatures but a kennel or the the ones we know best that have been publicized most\nI Can't imagine what the total dollar amount of losses for a livestock losses for ranchers and farmers could be but it's a pretty substantial\nAnd when you look at how the government has responded the FBI\nHad some ... agents who looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and in combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you're discussing this book\n[noise] well I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and I'm clearly a real one and it does seem to be tied to both ... and um [noise] the eye and abduction phenomena and\nOne of the things that's as being no taste and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these\nWhoever's flying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organization that operates outside of government you know my actually\nAny of that um the woman was waking when my mom and she went outside and that was a ... ... ... and they had the names tend to [noise] excuse me one was named backing Lewis named ...\nAnyway she took a man she never get on to the parents were or anything like that\nSo she took them in and raised in Missouri on and uh they uh when they got him to their teens I notice that they didn't have any hair on their head on or anything but it wasn't a bond movie where\nThey had moved out the ... ... she took them then they went to school and we were fourteen years old they a duck out of school because they were in string the calendar as a matter of fact they ... they built a cabin Adams there's little farm rate my late German and um they um\nYou know like I say ... voice move on with twins well any of that one on when he was about sixteen Seventeen years old and a very bad a cut on his own it to him from the action that where they took the local hospital and they ah\nIt felt like they will have to let him 'cause he lost so much but when when they took his much tight they couldn't find any type of match anyway and they check to place and then he\nChecked his twin brother and he had the same lead tight\nShiny and then they had to use his blood with a chance the lean rated went back to the phones and nothing happened\nAnd they went into the army they draft and young the Nineteen forties to when when they came back from the army they went out in the swamp and they um when it can let's say that there\nAnd they link town maybe once a month for some ... and so forth but then they had set up a ... I'm ... I'm water\nOn I think you told us this story before on the air today later learned but you're getting burned down yeah did you get burned down\nNo nothing but now I'm\nNot what happened to these guys because we're running out of the time you're ... oh yeah they ...\nThey um they like you said the swamp and or some people when they have to see him because they hadn't seen in town any of that they were missing they they couldn't find anywhere and the only thing they could find was wrong it shatters the cabin with some ... some of them wrong and they called the College of William and Mary you came out\nLike that and he couldn't figure out any advance are they missing and they they never heard anything from even want to\nThank you for sharing that story I'm going to get Nixon take on that Thanks John appreciate your calling Nick you're that one before anything like\nThat story but what I have heard a kind of similar situations where you know ... in within the family was now but it's um you know one of the grandmother you know back in the thirties or forties long before you know the whole mountain to review followed you took off that\nThere were abduction like experience used by fan you know the words it's not just something that began with\nA bacterium bony heel case it's just it's just a case of trying to find the earlier ones and very often that does come through\nYou know when a family member decides to to contact someone like me you know and and share a story that goes back to you know the twenties all the factors like that one so I'm you know I think we can push they the battery is back significantly you know when it comes to when this whole phenomenon actually kicked off\nTrying to get one more call in the first time caller Josh in Toronto hey Josh you're on the red burn\nYou'd evening gentlemen how you doing All right thanks to undermine\nYeah basically had something on my mind it was a Nineteen fifty nine case of main Russian student hikers who went missing will not missing but it looked like they were attacked and according to many people in Russian uh yesterday I don't know if your guest has any conclusion to that story was a\n... yeah and I love yeah\nYeah the death of a ... stories and interesting one you know it was um [noise]\nYou know a bunch of ah of Russian people um you know work together with friends and um died under very odd circumstances and I'm reminded him ... to this day I mean there's everything from like violent big foot type creatures attacked and killed them uh\nSo the Russian military experiments and despite all the race and the several books written on the subject there's no one hundred percent consensus on what actually happened it remains you know street with a lot of\nWeight aspects to this story which I guess I'm fortunate we will never know so I think it can remain a mystery unfortunately\nNeck I don't know how when you sleep but you are you are as a prolific author as I Know in the world or any what I Want to talk about anything else you got coming up we got about a minute left\nBut you know the top secret abduction fall that's what I'm sort of\nYou know promoting the reason I wanted to write it was because\nA lot of books about abductions but it's sort of actually address she's cradling her by showing on everything from abductions missing time a black helicopters you know it it presents a new\nAngle on the abduction issue if you like to\nThank you Nick it's always great to be here when a urge people to take a look at the new book and also the monster book it's a great one to have your library if you're interested in these kinds of subjects always good to have you here thank you Nick\nAll right thanks\nAnd coming up something that uh that the might put a different perspective on that kind of subjects we talk about on their show it's called other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions\nRight Christopher white a whole different take on these

spirituality and on church religion\nNew religious movements electronic media and popular culture and there's currently a professor of religion at Vassar College his new book other worlds spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions is a spectacular and mind bending Christopher welcome to the program\nMorning George thanks for having me on the show\nThanks for staying up so late or ... I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're gonna catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] give me um [noise] no it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or\nYou know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experiences and unusual states have consciousness religious experiences\nPeak experiences what whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of the privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interests and that's really what how this book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know there's some movement in New directions by thinking about science and physics and cosmology and how it's sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to\nUm have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about their death experiences and and the Syrian says and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture\nYou mentioned in the beginning how a believer in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of ... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase\nThat that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this\nPuzzle you know the problem which is you know people still an America seem to have a lot of I guess what we call spiritual beliefs they ... him pretty high numbers in America um believe in and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say\nA participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregation so things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about this how can we talk about those you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very robust sense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of\nParticipation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and try to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter or dark energy\nOr even thinking about infinity a or thinking about the the multiverse or thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves and embrace with ... with a fence of a mystery in and wonder\nI think about those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for a new spiritual conception and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard time too late ignoring me George it's\nToo late [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out look and look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it's it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um that that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I can I ask the question of well what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say a word about that for them for the listeners tonight yes you know I'm going\nAnother the ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions if there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um send Feinstein in that time so we live in a four dimensional space time a world\nAnd I find I spoke about this but a lot of people I talk about in my book talk about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space but different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of a one dimensional object has length\nIf you then draw flap where on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions that has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and height\nAnd then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else and that there's something else as the tricky part something else is the\nIs the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive I'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nBack to the Eighteenth century but really the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equation and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that

Neal Boston in on the radio station [noise]\n\n\nWe're back with Christopher white a Christopher I at one of the great things about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you'd tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah yeah his his wife is is quite a story um but you're right there there's Hinton and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the\nUm you know sort of like a habit being raised religious and a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer or an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual low levels are worlds to reality I'm hesitant in terms of an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything any more and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right and the situation as he he embraces map Madison geometry as a kind of a\nAnd he kinda hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty onto him but I think is his story is a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nDreaming consciousness has a kind of a freedom that are that are are regular everyday consciousness doesn't have any and he uses a lot of scientific ideas that we can talk about if you want to how he does it but he has a has a set\nOf scientific ideas that he that he uses to think about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and\nSee see I'm into the future and he writes these ideas up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happened or didn't happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they seem to be in some other reality\nAnd then they come back to this one sided audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that your explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of those experiences as well so in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on C. S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made of that of that book but she talks about time slips and time travel um and so on and some of her books\nSo yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my presence could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time is just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward um in fact though you know Einstein had a number of\nCounter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations on her own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist so um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe\nI'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but\nEvery moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future and and all of our defendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions with Scott defending wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of blocking universe so\nI'm done and all of his own laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of the questions that you as a professor religious studies back all the time\nYeah you're right you're right and it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how freer to make choices um and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming\nSo it somehow lifted up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should their ... world right to exist ... dimensions and one temporal dimension the dream and he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment\nAnd Don believe that um you know you're in a bit of on time here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space law for their um that's what he believed to happen and some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we can talk about that as an additional facial dimension or we could talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and have everybody\nEverybody's sleeping so had this degree of freedom and he also believe that everyone if they haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and when they fall he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believed that everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of the future of an anti after that I'm sort of mixed up together well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about science is a sharman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before like fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David

could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached out and grab Boston pull us up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimension and what in them but I mean you certainly have had you know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you had people um even even\nLouis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as beans that calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that and and I'm an avid spoken flat land so yes people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher rounds or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional um and as I was kind of these higher dimensional objects that than the ... entire world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal bleeps good coexist with a scientific yeah ... is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people\nIn the story so I have people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experience like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and some skeptics I have different voices\nIn the book I'm Talking about\nWhat the meaning of these events are ... and\nYou know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret what's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is\nAre these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences moments of insider and tuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences um and so on and and that they are ... than using scientific concept to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like\nLike all of us today I mean I think that we all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set of discourse is that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like Jay ... you've done right to have these dreams that seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he didn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out\nHe went to Einstein and he went to he went to sort of popular science book um and I think that you know that's one point I tried to make in the book that I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by a man interested and fantastic scientific concept um\nWell I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time ... would be an example we're reaching out to some invisible world there I'm absolutely yeah I Know a remote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to to reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right I'm reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity um and we talked about dreams earlier I think a through dreams and\nYou know in the sixties and at other times you know\nAmericans use psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into another realm and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the gyms to to reach 'em transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely there they're all different\nAll different different methods\nAre so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project your consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that that doesn't that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about remote viewing and other a pair of an\n... ... has higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because you know and flat line what happens is\nYou know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a length than wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is um up or down so when you're if you're a figure in in flatland and let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um you know you look around and and what do you see well\nIf you're a flat square sliding around on a flat world you you actually\nDon't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle on he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line um every everyone and flat land can just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flat square gets pulled off of this two dimensional world\nUp into a higher space a three dimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full dimension analogy of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly a he suddenly has powers of vision and he never had right he can look down at flat line he can see for the first time not just lines that he can see\nA People's homes he can see into their homes right because he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see\nHe can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines he can see all of their dimensions he can see even inside right say let's say he has a friend who's a triangle 'em all he saw before was their line coming towards them but now he can see the whole triangle he can even see inside the trial you can see inside homes\nSo I raise this as an example because\nSome people have used as to say aha you know um well if we were raised somehow in consciousness up into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we could look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power is a vision so um\nYou know maybe we are just like the square right when raised to hire the mentioned we look back on our world and what we see we would see all sides of everything at once you could look down on your home for instance and see all the rooms laid out\nNow you can see the insides of everyone's bodies you could see the outside that are run by you can see the top of the house and the bottom of the house um so you would have a kind of a higher dimensional vision\nUm and so people do indeed use these ideas to talk about things like remote viewing right um or or they use these ideas actually to talk about near death experiences because sometimes people have near death experiences they talk about having this kind of um having this kind of special vision where they can see things I never saw before [noise]\nSo so yeah and so maybe remote viewing is a a you know is higher dimensional phenomenon I I don't know you know I'm certainly\nPeople have talked about it I'm that way and I in my book and especially in the later chapters and an epilogue um is where I talk about sort of near near death experiences and some parents Paris psychological phenomena like like remote viewing\nYeah Raymond Moody is somebody I've met in a ... interview and it's just you know he's a trailblazer in in discussing that those experiences in so many people have had and trying to put it in context that this I think this kind of idea makes it easier to understand those experience yeah\nI looked at his his books to ah he's he's a really interesting I Love the book um I looked at his books too because I was studying um near death experiences for like the epilogue of the book and that the last couple of chapters of the book and you know what you do find or what I found\nIs that people do use this kind of language you know they it's almost like they talk like the square and flat land as as a character you know the characters suddenly lifted off of\nYou know they're limited world they're they're lower dimensional world into some sort of higher dimensional space and many of them use language like um\nYou know suddenly there I saw an altered geometry before me I'm an end the dimensions of the room changed in shifted\nAnd others talk about being able to see like in a hospital setting right if someone had a near death experience at a hospital setting others talked about rising up above the hospital setting and being able to see into different rooms in the hospital so\nOnce again another case in which\nUm you know you you're raised into a higher spatial dimension and then you can suddenly have this incredible powers a vision that you didn't have before right you can see through walls right you can see in places that you're not um so yeah people people and Moody's book\nThe ratings are already\nA special
