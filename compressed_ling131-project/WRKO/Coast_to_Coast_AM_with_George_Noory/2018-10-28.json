I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... let out of jail then it's kind of you if you can test and said yeah it was really sorry about that then you go when was the only people said no I'm not going to get this and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them than anyone\nI didn't write that ... that the nuance of the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their beliefs to all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great work of literature and plays is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or in the population using under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the the Halloween or ... ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween\nIs is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumped like that or is it just it's like it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but as this they're big season this this this October you know these thirty one days October\nMathematically I mean some some only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more a year round kind of tourists impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of\nYou know arrows and their whole start to call a tourist and still happen their biggest one is October which will never go I\nWell I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there they can make their entire year in the weeks that the state fair is open so I I I Would never have got their shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but it but other than realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nBut now they're starting to open longer if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museum so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round if they don't grow and become more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are their rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know behavior or to or how they want ... just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring out especially like to be around that time of year there's not that many curb\nBut in October for instance the barrel route the seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town and Salem and

ABC News\nI'm Todd and federal officials have charged forty six year old Robert ... hours with twenty nine counts including obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs and using a fire on to commit murder every allegedly storm to Pittsburgh synagogue with an assault rifle and three hand guns killing eleven on Saturday morning ABC's Eric ... says the Jewish community there is devastated\nAnd that's what I study and one of the things I learned that sets true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy and proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression\nOf sentiment you know the the\nOr sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial [noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged in allegedly and how it is choose\nMainstream\nKnow notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the senses right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily and at one point by the way this is a very real\nDay to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press or there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public\nInformed but at the same time call and letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part\nIn the injustices regarding the story of the men from the train [noise]\nUh but [noise] this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting\nCan go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to to crime before her death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing\nAn ad rules never one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or a fetish ties the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn right they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think\nSo I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead in a synagogue where they should have been saying\nThe root cause sham\nThat not run for your life [noise] uh all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell\nIn the unintended consequences that can happen or these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalist need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up towards bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of\nCrimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate about who's responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's so many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up only a small\nPercentage of such things have ever happened not everything is die hard to\nNot everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media would be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today so\nI ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about people who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today say a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talked about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too late to get

Boston in my heart radio station [noise]\n\n\nSo we're talking with Bill James the co author of the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer I was playing that song sympathy for the devil not for this killer or the one from this morning but just because there's a lot of doubles and running around these days including\nSon devils getting a big win the kind of fun job so the we were just hated the interrupt you because you were doing such a great job with the explanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I I had to cut you off because we have the heartbreak at the bottom of the\nGraduate or up to that because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to\nFind a part of my services like and I guess that's like a little bit but yeah there for the murder what\nThat says like thirty four of them aren't there or something or\nSomething like that they um they uh the crime you normally occurred on Sunday night so you just heard on the weekends up until Nineteen ten the crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was blogging or one of the primary understood was logging\nThe or doors are gorgeous windows ... Jeff shot I think I mentioned the the um [noise] there's all their equipment deer graphic pattern and the murders if one of hers just south of Portland the next occurs just north of Portland a so that that would be a a link between them\nThe fingerprints and blood and it meant nothing to them\nA mutt typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight by Nineteen ten Nineteen twelve ... the ... and Eighteen Ninety eight no one knew that there were these for blood group say a B o and whatever it is the um ah\nThe ah by Nineteen twelve people didn't know that uh and and breakthroughs hadn't had had\nBeen achieved that had begun to make their way into courtrooms bought a ... it was it was a very slow process and that is a very infant pile stage\nMentioned the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nTracking this story then required you to go through a lot of newspaper are ... and other things to try to find a lot of these stories which as you point out had been a they had the dots hadn't even been conduct connected to then so you you may have been the very first person\nThat ever started putting this this case together in this way\n... well yes we were ... except for the end of the the the the last year the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was\nOn the loose from in Nineteen eleven uh Nineteen twelve which would runner and while he was killing a lot of people but the earlier crime we what we did was say\nLook this this this murderer is way too experienced to have started this in Nineteen eleven there has to be earlier crime so let's try to find them\nNow and I'm getting ordered walking back toward the first crime\nThat's what I've done as it nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year so successfully\nDumb luck and it is not all ... ... I had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes\nThat will give away who he is and I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime bucks but very often the serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes and he would cover his track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd it is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New Yorker and and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered it in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it\nAnd it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the uh with uh with with all the last last murders and the series\nSo ah we ... it's just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argue that this has happened almost\nOh but he doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crime the further prototype crush right he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime then successive Lee after\nThat it is is the years went forward and yet there was kind of a mixed media right I mean there's sometimes there were sometimes there were guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five the uh I think that he while he used an ax who committed murders\nThere are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his\nBelt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and could front of him but um and it was not what he was trying to do but it's way would do if you had to do\n[noise] [noise] oh I Want to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to cold late all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general answer the question is the crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our of ourselves that we don't like to talk about\nA all crime stories are about lost\nAnd greed and anger\nAnd hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but they are part of everybody that I've had in the play here knowing\nAnd and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of\nThe uh uh that's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader crime but by the way it alive book I read with the real crime but with the real world leader a it's a book by um that the wind stuff a lot of weight at Weinstein I could have a life name her\nAh the ah I I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you know there was surely going to be and\nAnd one of the things I learned from reading that is what America Walker who was a an avid reader of crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens was going to have them at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding ... it it's very common among writers to be avid reader post I was an avid readers of crime stories because uh ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nHuman nature that\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from sports I mean I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try to positive thing [noise]\nI hang on hang on to that thought on crime stories

saying that crime stories are very good because they they\nCome from the parts of ourselves but we don't like to talk about going normally talk about\nThe man the train I didn't make a deliberate and thought oh entry into the subject I got her like\nA I was with a document\nSorry about the murders and all those guys were called ... living with a mystery it's an extremely well I'm a documentary and far above the normal levels of crime documentary I was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was missing which is that it's relatively ...\n... murders are a part of a series so I started I was just going to put an hour and to\nAnd to trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a week and the week eventually became five or six years or so that I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a a true crime booked sure yes it is yeah you know and that's the interesting thing is to is that true crime [noise]\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the ... circuit writing preachers administers that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution and they would do a sermon just before the execution\nThen we tried to provide the context for why this person was being executed and wide to community overall would benefit from his or her desk and it became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their execution sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime near and is it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in even in which a hundred plus years later\nIn some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of I'm a ... a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities maybe this this lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On a new exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nThe um ... there was an interesting thing that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who uh was\nA a a ... his great great aunt had been was one of the victims of the\nCrime Internet here and always believed\nThat uh uh the man who uh was accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released always believe that he had gotten away with it and he\nSaid that reading it in my book that in our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief twelve\nIt was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that but it was it was a show he said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was the other fellow I I don't know why it was important to him\nToo well I understand the understanding that there was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I I I don't know if there's a lot of different but uh it\nIt still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think we can go ahead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book and a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all books all good books or church for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago\nAnd uh I grew up in a small town very much like the crime that these ... that these murders occur to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's sort of equal distance from me and them\nAnd that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was\nA whether you are or what how people lived\nThat they they lived rich meaningful live\nA ... people\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happen to you and me and people have our lives happen to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that happened ... who happen to have happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they look bad terrible Beth I'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live and and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about\nThe atmosphere of the town or the um the things that people age or the way that houses were constructed or their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThey are ... there what is it that always sticks with made it okay to party or just banking\nAnd that has to do with the the taco and the cases taco invent that it\nUh one of them I think it was ... we had an alibi for the time of one of the crime what are the crime was committed on December twenty four of I think\nNineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors\nAnd an Italian community or a pickle deal because pickled ... were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day and there were there was\nBut there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty second or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in\nOn on ice for a couple of days before you eat them see a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right that would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian as a way that the tally in American communities lived a hundred years ago [noise]\nExcept that it's important to them a crime story ... that's what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that eliminates the details\nOf a er\nFigure out what otherwise be totally forgotten\nYeah [laughter] but I think that brings us very effectively ...\nIowa I'm ended the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a ... a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nOn on the night of a gym nine Nineteen twelve\nWinning winning winning by I'm gay\nAnd I just want a thousand

Boston in my heart radio station [noise]\n\n\nBill James the co author of the men from the train to research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so [laughter] so it goes wrong [laughter]\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nThe circumstances that are defining experiences in our life because that's how we know ourselves best [noise] so\nSomebody who might have grown up with a very dysfunctional household tends to cleave toward dysfunctional relationships not go the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship to know how to act and so they keep recreating that until they break the habit I'm so fractals theory often explain whether it's your greatest moment\nYou know like you and you said you know somebody from being\nDestroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so did you spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment Kennedy thanks so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate by recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\nWell ... that there is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was\nA his secret it was it was the most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to them and that he was simply recreating at the ah ah again and again and again with more\nAnd some variation but more specimens specificity as he got went along\nSo that you know the ... the early patterns or not that type but the\nThe later patterns get closer and closer to the first crime that's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that\nThat's who he was that that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt that Mr Miller had been the victim of terrible abuse those young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHe had tiny widely spaced teeth\nOr he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look and he said he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd it's a terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrageous not that is in any sense of justification for what he did but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] you know the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the ... that's what happened um speaks to\nThe age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether and I'm sure you've done and this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to be you know do some barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation\nIn the book because a lot of things we don't know about in your interview you're going to have no answer you're gonna have speculated of answer it's up to you I wouldn't speculate\nThat he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newt and family and in Eighteen Ninety eight I I ... I wouldn't I don't I doubt that he'd ever killed anyone before that because there is an obvious lack of planning and\nI'm preparation for the event live I don't doubt that he had committed pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I see this very much would suspect that he had been dead at inappropriate\nInteractions with young girls that he had a a well he had it had a chip on his shoulder it wasn't that like a nice guy and then he said he ... it is the documentation\nOf his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried it carried a tanker pretty openly they are but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents\nDrew in about a live the um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that that's a great point we're headed gone into the navy do you know\nWe don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which he grew up in yet um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year\nThere have been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who was the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy's sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm sociopaths ... are often rage killers and they they just you know they it it's a ... thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of relief and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not um [noise] it didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that maybe he was he was a true psychopath a psychopath have no fear ever rap no normally I Do not have normal fear and one thing with a parent about this the ... the ... and the training that from his crime that he it was not\nEven not acting and fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with this for so long I this is probably not that I should have made this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller andme after the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this that affects about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in\nTen years or Fifteen and\nGoing to say well here's what the James's myth they miss this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they miss this whole story about a this crime and it when that guy Illinois and uh\nThe I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacity so we moved on and printed book but there is still more story to be discovered

Boston in my heart radio station [noise]\n\n\nWe're talking about demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer Bill James is the author and it's a it's just a terrific read very good writer\nA and a and yet you know until bill\nThere was not a lot in the ... he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was I tend to rent longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know I mean just like even today we don't think about these people just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder\nBut there are there are they get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through and a couple of weeks\nWe'll I've got a couple of questions the first of all I Need you to answer for me again over shame any ... like one of the act\nOf every what\nAny of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe uh I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the Alaska murders were committed\nThey ah it it's still it's still around and and the has been definitively guide to the to the murders and the uh uh but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAgain you know well this is Paul will will buried by any chance\nNo way down it disappeared and we ... it was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be but he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much got it all figured out that he might have worked for the world road because he got to every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but a bacon for being on the air and I appreciate your story\nThat you might like we see that hey you know actually that's a really good question though about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\n... what a in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal could make the murders on weekends this is taking to be a sign that he's employed or if a person and if it happens a lot actually out there quite a few serial murderers who will who committed murders on\nWeekends or the or\nBecause they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to the um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working I'm self into the perhaps stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that if the law this talking\nBut uh the uh just working on solving the frame of mind that he could get where he needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or what do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the ... these trains all over the country you\nKnow it was it was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen er and and he he came into town may no contact with anyone spoke to no one and this pair that was part of his\nCriminal Jane is they ah they ah but ah so it is his first crime and the unplanned crime and Eighteen Ninety eight they did buy a ticket to leave\nThe town and this this led to a trail forming behind him and place followed his\nWhere he had gone on the trains are for quite a while but later he was just it was just job as white used to railroad he always tells you that the intersection of two railroad so they were trained came by the middle of night he could just hop on and they wouldn't be caught waiting you know if you have to we'll road you're less chance the year\nThere'll be there'll be stranded waiting for trying to come\nBy saying that really never got what about you\nKnow that's an interesting point then it by the way when I told you about the the people that were murdered next to the railroad line in the town where I grew up they um that was\nThe shoe sure the shoreline it was it the the train no longer existed um after Thirty years or so but he used to be the major commuter rail road between\nMilwaukee and a Chicago I think or maybe even went further up north up to delay Green Bay or something and you're like uh\nThe other point the other question I was raised in there up until Nineteen oh eight or thereabouts\nHe a settled in an area for a period of time and committed crimes there that area\nAfter night in a way he started just morally more or less trapping it he became a Nineteen Nineteen Nineteen Kenny transition to just running loose cross the country bought an interesting thing is that he never stole\nMoney at one of the ways you know it's him as the lie this line well up here in the newspaper story about\nMoney and other valuables were found in the room that and that happens all the time that that that there's a ... and he he does not steal anything from the crime scene\nYeah and that definitely is was a ... you know there's the accusation about the first crime that uh that that guy little was accused of than it was a robbery in\nAnd it yet you know at the at the same time the let me ask you about the acts so the ... why do you think he would leave the is this the murder weapon at the scene I understand like in the godfather\nRight when you wrap the handle and you drop the gun because there's no fingerprints for them to find or whatever\nBut it would seem like even then that would it would be some evidence to to look for somebody if they're if they leave the ax behind\nWell up fingerprints exploded in the understanding of the American public in Nineteen eighty four Ninety five and its first crime he just drop the acts and left his buddy fingerprints\nOn the on the acts up mud once people became aware of the fact that fingerprints then he would wash the handle they act in a bucket of water before leaving it in the crime they did that and ... every every wherever the second half of his of his career they ah\nAh which proved that he was connected to what was going on I probably read newspapers and knew what was going on or see a but it just a drop the acts because it would have been awkward to take it with him while he was playing a it is here once he was out of the house he was\nUnconnected to the murders but if he was carrying an accident that would have connected them to the murder\nWell okay so let me just making an argument for that\nThat that still seems odd to me because you can actually say I'm a longer that's why I carry with me and I mean if there's any occupation where somebody could watch the next day would be either like firefighter or longer [laughter] you know you only two that you're going up um\nBuying but they all ... among them or did he work as a matter but then there are some of the I think he did\nAnd the ax is that he used the word they lumbering type of axes\n... uh mostly uh like an ax there was found in
