Bush Ronald Reagan when he was very disappointed the game\nThe amnesty to about two point seven million of the illegal aliens at the time I think was Nineteen Ninety six and then he was disappointed because he thought that the border security would be taken care of by that no one\nNo so here are just more [noise] yeah so I mean\nOr even the ones who and then then when Bush was president they couldn't get a bill through um there there was much tougher than Obama but it still wasn't good enough oh I mean this is the first time since ... an hour the boardroom for someone who's thinking boys on the Trump\nRight I was when I was the last president to do it\nAnd you know all this all this stuff that's been happening up up in Portland also you know what the Portland police standing down to antifa there's a lot of illegal alien crime up in Oregon my a lot and um it's you know it's pretty much a sanctuary state but it's still liberal there in Portland\nAnd one thing that I Want to I Want to make sure that your listeners understand you know the share us our elected by the people there they uphold the constitution allows that this country um\nThe police departments and every city\nAre directed by the mayor and the city council of how they will conduct their how the police departments policies are and so the ...\nI'm ... wheeler and the one directing and eat off of the police commissioner on top of that is one directing nice police officers that how they will and and and want to react to things that are going on how they will let alone and illegal alien to cooperate with the federal\nLaw that with ice and stuff out there in Oregon and Portland but\nUm when you have a police officer has taken an oath to protect the citizens of there's eight and their studies\nAnd in their hands are tied by in there and the city council thanks very policies on their mind and that's the way they want to direct their police department to handle things\nIn the quantities police officers around and think at the environment and think that the struggle that they go with every day when they when they put the uniform on and now they're walking out the door and they're going to have to deal with\nSanctuary policies that's completely one hundred percent against their belief I mean I cannot believe the struggle that our police officers are facing on a daily basis\nYou know this is a near sons no live with it I mean he was one of the people who did as a police officer and the officers today they will but now they want to get rid of ice of course which is another nightmare we could spend hours talking about that as well but the bottom line is\nThink what's happening with this migration is that\nIt's having the same effect\nI Believe as the fire hoses had when they were turned on Dr King and I'm like the ... the in the leadership of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and all of the others\nAre in that movement who were marching when the American people saw that I mean it sometimes takes visuals people don't understand when when that was seen it it was the ultimate motivator to create civil rights laws\nThat have not existed and it seems to me that what's happening now with people watching thousands trying to enter our country illegally um the destiny of that\nI think it's having perhaps the same effect and this election will hopefully reflect that\nSo that we can get back to protecting the border and the president can get the support in Congress to build the wall you know what is the national guard and not thirty seconds so go quickly please go ahead\nOn the national guard is not going to be able to do anything and and sending eight hundred active military men down there that they for Congress to even have military action on our borders though it's very scary and I think that liberals are setting them up to make a decision to protect the American citizens that will enable them to pulling out of office\nI mean um it's it's really a a where at the edge of a cliff right now and I just I'm pleading with my fellow Americans to vote the right way and vote your conscience and now they stay here life matters as much as my son's life matter to me and we need to get the right politician from DC to clean this mess that\nIt's always a pleasure Mary Ann thank you for being with us Godspeed and have a great press conference to appreciate your time thinking like for having me on you've taken care of Mike ... thanks for listening more of the\nHi I'm Dr building go M.

are becoming more interesting and nearly three years ago at the end of January twenty six\nI reported at ... dot com and my ... to ... AM radio broadcast then that a near ninth\nPlanet or planet X. Y. indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt and the art cloud me like hyper belt in shape of rock guy and I left over from our solar system creation and\nThen from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto and without\nThe astronomical unit from our son and the crowd of mostly ice and a much further guarding where the hype rebelled in and then three point to light years from earth and Eric\nIf that surround our entire solar system including the ... belt and I have a beautiful graphic of this at my or file dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like now\nI say planet nine was indirectly found in twenty sixteen because\nTo date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object but Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena here and now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident\nThere was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nPrevent their brown simply called the planet nine because he's the astronomer they got quite a knock down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our\nSolar system for decades it was\nTwenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called Eris out in the type rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto so it was\nProfessor brown who argued that put our should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to adore planted in the ... belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWell when I first interviewed prevent their brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote\nIt is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of the planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits\nClose quote now that is why so far it is an indirect discovery\nIt's now late twenty eight team after several tries at the ... and ... observatories in Hawaii to find planet nine invisible light and or infrared professor brown\nSays that it is quote till like chasing a go after more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet to be only seven\nTimes more massive than earth and just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this lose save planet nine or planted act that he uh is\nStill trying to mind and he told me that he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this\nTime he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to actually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement and for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun so that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than map June a good way out there but they had Murrow down the focus so\nHe deliberately going on November first started another\nSurge because the new calculation predict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter here now from the California Institute of technology's planetary scientists department in Pasadena\nCalifornia is astronomy\nProfessor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky\nClose to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most to we have to wait until the solution is up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far as the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected also the upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes which really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet\nIt'll be easy to see once we know exactly where it looks I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail was probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swinging that direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets\nSometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [noise] this is what we mean when we say planted in the other part of the choices\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where my does have come from why use this massive object all the way out to the edge of the type rebel going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or that he was inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition of\nAll of this was just speculation you can probably come up with so many different ideas to explain how it got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it looks sort of like Neptune we think it's a ... tune like planets just a little bit less massive than not tuned into it will be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clones it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of gray is white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be sings about it that we never even thought about that are completely ...\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think it's about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good wears out there\nAnd use that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter last year it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from\nOr is is that the border between the kinds of rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border is\nYou remember when mom and dad used to sort through your Halloween\nSome stuff was no good for you some stuff was dangerous in some stuff they

Boston and I are radio station [noise]\nAnd it showed that Miami for example the extra days of temperatures above Ninety degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century for Miami that may be eight more days he's Miami isn't already underwater\nSo what was something like a one and a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so these really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what are computer models showing to do is have you worked on the eye PCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those best estimate\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact\nIt seems that some of the larger nation the United states included my adding poll now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on\nMy guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which was or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with\nThat shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem I ... or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes in houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migration away from coastline\nCertainly there will be yeah and in fact already are places that are are having to be abandoned both on the east coast right on the Alaska\nDo rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants but it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level rise and forced to migrate as their\nCities become inhabitable\nAnd that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you've got\nMillions of such migrants at one point five degrees\nBut you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and intense drought all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises fair\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts and again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality\nIt has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was for years ago\nSo global climate change in increasing more could definitely bring more wars\nYes yeah there you go\n... well it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control and one of the big headline the summer of twenty Eighteen million for at home may see the level rise flooding\nOver the rest of the century and fact it is\nSo bad that the forty eight continental US date for that now has the most property at a study finds that three hundred and fifty one billion dollars worth of homes Whoopi risking that title flooding\nThe researchers say if that global warming and sea level rise does continue that in more than one million properties in Florida well have chronic flooding\nAnd that when you look at the map\nAs it is extended by computers over the rest of the\nCentury that the level why which is

I'm Talking to you tonight in front of it is sharing you win the general audience that is growing around the world from my work and they like my YouTube channel\nWell three weeks ago and October third I was doing update on ... category for had it with that very distressing subject how cat had a cat around the world like weird\nScotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was in a car wreck kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all and then I was off\nDoing an update about the sunspots solar observatory shut down I had a received a whistle blower email saying that are actually\nUh the child pornography was just funny deflection that he actually involved the Chinese infiltrate or who\nHad hacked into the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Holland an air force base a that's down below the\nSolar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then the third update had evolved from my asking my earth files YouTube channel audience on September twelfth if anyone had young childhood memories of floating\nOut of body specifically I was asking for ages four to\nSix approximately and I had received a huge number of emails\nAnd a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before on this is what I was\nTalking about when the next\nMorning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream [noise] so I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down\nIt was weird or I sent the puzzle to a photo shop a video analysts I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show and he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at\nA my er files report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see these loop videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got that from the photo shop analyst was that\nHe thinks this is truly anonymous and uh then I asked a that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office and believe it or not\nA second I'm One of these whatever they are\nCame between my hands and up to my right shoulder on October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me emails about their own experiences with the smoky fog\nIs it like ...\nI Do not know this is extremely a translucent and uh when I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt that there were people who were telling me they had never mentioned any of this parent to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent and his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard and he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now\nFrom Sun City center Florida\nBut what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight thinking about all of this is provoked\nBy two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now\nIs Charles hazard uh talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida ...\nThis was in the spring of two thousand in age and I was preparing\nThat morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn sure the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down a very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the poverty level my show and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with a few stars that I can see and then suddenly I just\nI was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I opened them again\nAnd through the window I can see this misty gray ball drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was\nIn this dark bedroom was luminous and I could see light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head and I was just\nRaising the fascination of I didn't know what to think and then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted Ira Glass passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was feeling of euphoria and one is with this living thing that was surrounding me\nAnd then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time I was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers becoming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously and I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it\nI didn't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because the feeling was shown loving\nCan you describe the shape of the ... that you remember vividly and try

good would shadow in life\nBut they were living in is it the same time and they would just float by me but kind of mean\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head\nAnd as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a download and information\nThat was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was beginning it was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was\nJust super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe\nWas indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it

I Would like to share with you and our coast Saudi and an example of one of the many emails that I have been getting tonight\nAnd this is an indication to the quality and the heart felt and the profound emails that I had been receiving these various categories\nHaving to do with out of body or what the fog is and here I Want to read this came just a few minutes ago\nListening to a coast to coast while writing this my father was very involved with World War two Pearl Harbor Hawaii survivors during his life\nHe passed away on December seventh two thousand and nine and was buried on December seventh before his burial I was sorting things out in his home office with his caregiver he lived in this home for almost six years\nWhich I currently still on the news do not live there while sorting out his items I was looking through the open door\nInto the laundry area hallway adjacent back door I saw a very fast thin moving horizontal Smokey grey fog\nGo straight through the back door without it being opened up it went through the door I did mention this to my wife son daughter in some close friends\nI Am an open minded conscious oriented person but immediate feeling was my dad showed me his spirit was leaving the home for good I Would have never expected\nTo see the gray color I wouldn't normally thought it would have been associated with something negative\nBut he was a very positive person I have come to the conclusion that whatever part or level of his body consciousness soul left the house may have been more like the gross more roughly matter in its purest\nForm I had never heard the words smoky fog until you offered them up all night and this is what\nIt's been in my own office and I have wondered if it relates to a below the cat that I lost a year ago and

about four months ago she was Ninety six years old sharpest attack even a passing it was her body they gave out a she always said that she would try to show me that she had survive on my mom and dad have been gone for a long time but you never know\nBecause I really do think that this\nFoggy smoke that you can find Google when you start Googling foggy smoke you will see amazing photographs\nOr the resemble what has been in my office and if it is something from another dimension trying to come and get my attention and they YouTube channel I Wonder why have you ever encountered this

going to be\nWith at least two of the people who have had childhood uh separating body and that's the question is it the very soul that leaves the body how could that be\nIf it is not the sole that needs to animate the container organic body what part is it that is moving out\nFrom the body in out of body travel and there are all kinds of explanation in ancient Egypt Egypt about there being nine parts\nTo the body and the so complex but we don't even acknowledge our soul\nIn the western world and it probably is the most important part of us and when you go back to ... ages four or five and six and you read these extraordinary emails coming from people who say\nIn their opening sentences I have never told a single\nHuman being in my life\nAnd I am now provoked from listening to your asking the question on your YouTube channel have any of you at age four to six do remember an out of body because that is significant\nWhere was the learning there was nobody teaching this is
