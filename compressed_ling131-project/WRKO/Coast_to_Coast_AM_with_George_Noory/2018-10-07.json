{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Putting its drunk under the scourge of a female who's yelling help\nAnd apparently after some online controversy over the sign police showed up online\nControversy started by Republican Texas agriculture commissioner said Miller and\nMiller correct claiming falsely that the girl on the poster was supposed to be Kavanaugh's daughter which even if it was and it's not a but even if it was\nSo what it's again free speech even offensive speech needs protection\nDale Carpenter who is a law professor and First Amendment expert at Southern Methodist university\nTold the Dallas News there is no basis I can see for removing the side it's not up saying that no court would find it to be\nYou can say it's offensive or distasteful but that's protected under the constitution he added that Stanford has the right to have the offensive side and Miller has the right to lie to people on Facebook about what the side actually means [laughter]\nMiller's the politician different too so the woman who actually created to sign a Marion Stanford\nShe said according to Newsweek the girl and the painting didn't depict Kevin O's daughter it was a Washington Post cartoon from earlier or late twenties Seventeen further she told the publication she had been receiving threatening phone calls since Mr Miller suggested the girl was the daughter of the Supreme Court nominee and then she says quote\nPolice told me to remove the sign or they would take it and arrest me so I let them take the ...\nOkay so varied Emily ... yeah the same as misleading\nHall please Mr police officer man take the sight out of my yard\nIt would've been better if she had a you know let herself got a ... so to speak you know get arrested a well I mean\nIt would have been something that would have immediately created a court case yeah to me if she allowed herself to get arrested but\nThe average person just you know I Know you're not gonna do it\nBut people don't stand up no they don't and we lose our rights we lose our freedoms we lose our democracy um and not this not that not necessarily a fan of our democracy I I don't know there's only ... yeah um but you definitely lose your freedom ... yeah I mean\nI I share your frustration yeah that's why I'm Glad I'm here in New Hampshire where the movement of people that are some of them actually willing to stand up for themselves and others and there's no I I think they\nI think the metaphor of to wolves and the sheep voting on better is a little misleading it's more like you know\nA a herd of sheep and a smaller heard of wolves deciding what's for dinner and the sheep taking well\nI'm going to be safe because I'm In the middle of the pack of sheep and so the wolves definitely are outnumbered by the sheep\nBut the sheep aren't the predators\nAnd other news Tuesday dot com reporting that and I'm sure you've already heard of this story Oh yes California\nOne of the tech capitals of the world a is now going to be illegal\nTo sell the router\nThat has a default password on it\nBlack and so if you buy a router or it typically is like you know admin Adnan is the user name and ... there's something that I Know\nThere's there's a different variety of different things that are going on nowadays with routers um sometimes they do come free configured with with a unique password and so it's not as bad as it used to be\nBut this was bumped on well but that's how it was yeah right that's what we do every route or I've ever purchased it's like admitting admission and then you go in and you change the past why one reason why a lot of ... stop okay true and and and that is a default password on that a lot of\nBike lock the door locks that you would use on a locker calm especially the ones where it's like a four digit code ... ... they were they default of like all zeroes some do\nYeah so in this case uh the story from ... dot com here points out that this new California law would make it illegal to manufacture or sell Internet connected devices that aren't equipped with a unique password or a feature that forces the consumer to set a personal password when the device is first used\nIt will take effect on January first of twenty twenty\nThe range of devices the law covers this incredibly broad it's a a clue include\nIs any device that connects to the Internet directly or indirectly and has an IP address or Bluetooth address that that sounds like a pretty ah that sounds like cell phones every cell phone [laughter] would a would be included under that yeah yeah\nNow a tactic that California is trying to employ could eventually lessened the severity of some of the most destructive cyberattacks on secured routers and Internet of things devices are routinely access and control by hackers who send billions of compromise devices to paying certain servers into overwhelm them this is called the distributed denial of service attack\nThere's no doubt that having a weak passwords on your system in a bad already flaw I agree with that concern however using the government to solve this problem\nNot it's not the right way to do it and now now it's absolutely not the right way to do it\nUm so I mean one of the one of the reasons are that you you don't want to have a law like this is because there is going to be a cost involved in setting a unique passwords with each\nEach device that you know is being shipped threat because normally you're just flashed the same code to every single divine right right right right now interestingly enough I'm there's an there's also a printing cost because now you have to associate a specific graduate this specific\nYou know using ... right so there's usually additional costs now in quantity you might say oh it's only going to add to it but\nThere's a lot of different regulations out there I mean all adds up so yeah and sometimes it just\nIt's easier to just say hey in the direction change the\nPatio [laughter] what what happens let's say it is only a penny per page of whatever what happens\nIf in the uh assembly lines\nSomething gets out of order and now everything's water on my head off\nYet Mm that sounds like a nightmare but you don't find out because then what do you do recall are ... are\nYou having somebody has to everything as they are putting out a lot to make sure that the password which was on the ... cost dramatic you're doing what increases employment caught and why are you trying to keep people from having jobs as ...\nAnd I do and I also add that in some cases it like the opinion piece but in other cases if you're looking at a small rather manufacture it might be dollars you know if somebody has a mainly go in in in countries or each individual router I Know for us it would be dollars uh you know a router um are you going to start selling to California now although you're going to jump through this these you know\nI'm not going to say good or and were were ... and ... and I'm not even sure they'd be applicable to us because we're shipping from out of state anyway\nI'm up but I don't know either a whole ... applied either they might\nBut again if they if they were judgment against\nUs it doesn't necessarily as a forcible and there's all sorts of other things that you know but anyway we might be compliant easily do start telling users to you know set a password I Believe I never I urge them yet but I don't know if they lost their they have to have it it's just directions are required or if it's this says it has\nTo have a unique password in order to be there all the ... the when the ... boots so it's it is more secure than your typical route or out of time back tomorrow joined us on line in the meantime free talk life dot com [noise]\nHello this

Boston and heart radio station\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county will is here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis ... talking with then ran for then sell as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and ... get St panic ... gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that kind of Halloween and that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that stuff\nMe and every now and then you'll see some story and and honestly cause I follow these things every Halloween about those and of course the scary clown scary clown panicked because I\nI'm suddenly the guy that talks about that but a lot of times\nAh there you know there there's a lot of them are just hoaxes I remember there was a guy I think it was in a in Cleveland or Boston or something about two years ago\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself oh and yeah when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\nYeah not to trust you exactly\nI was just such an offensive like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they x-ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I Want to offer but I wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go and train your candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen to know I Know that because uh I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist often are actually the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say\nDid you guys actually finding anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out\nYou know yeah I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure that okay but he did it yes so they can steal stuff that he wanted\n[laughter] where where are the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people are ... for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the hunted since come out because you know those are cool and everything however ... was it primarily for money isn't always raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it was primarily districts with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second wave of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials they have them when they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an abomination\nIn hand so that for for so certainly for for for many years um of course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff\nUm you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy the horror right\nYou'd actually yeah family is coming together to make a gift costume ... and\nWhat you find is that the the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid in your plastic molded and stuff but what's happened that\nOver over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it's it's B it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this was when you started getting adults who

Boston in heart radio station\n\n[noise]\nCounty Willis here on coast to coast am our gas tonight on Willis wean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating\nUm goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's say I want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the\nWill of saline theme of goes tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about\nThat let's say panic part of it I mean it can really can get pretty evil\nWith some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness and said panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted houses you know reached out and grab the crow somebody or whatever and it's there are some of that but but you know that's it for\nEvery one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who are just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean a a mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause panic because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they ... if if during summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some corn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the famous paid here what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nAnd and again you know it was before I went festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's but there's tradition of course I mean you look at exit is coming to Eighteen\nYou know ... not suffer which to live um and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this was fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that that's one of the more uh\nObviously comes up every every year so it's coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart of St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go and and\nOn the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is it a where'd you board or strictly prohibited anyone using a ... will be kicked off the property and it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so\nConcerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know demonic corals or whatever\nI I I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall\nAnd I'd never seen that like you know in the room you know sign this don't use it and so you know typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know\nAdults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties that twin because it was centered on kids that were the concern came from and so it was that a kid the dresses up as a witch or goal\nWill become interested in witchcraft or wicker or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why\nA lot of times um the the ... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party so they they they they they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff\nAnd of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything but I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and like I said again you know black lights and the uh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from\nFrom back then it was a wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scarier it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when it came to Christmas and just the way it was right down the\nMarathon bar on either right away I Am doing those\nHuge freeze those have you ever had um frozen\nOh they were great under you're just taking you back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ruler on the back\nOh man I I mean anything Googled afterward on here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was lost USC McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way\nYup yup yup member on all the producers were were watching that sell our hey you guys are going on there now so well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and they say ten of part and all that good stuff\nThis week of the Arab tickets to see in ...\nWhen we\nSay February step into the opium theater supportive or huge world tour and I'm coming album him for tickets and information visit live nation dot com if your weekly chance to weigh in on the W.

you go to the site you'll see featured a these sketches that Paul did by the way he's an artist as well and chess\nJust when you see when you see it\nComing to life well someone's you know drawn it it's a it really adds so much to the story from the witnesses\nNow POM Wonderful artist uh sketching that you did I Know that you're an artist as well and a former carpenter and so now what you do is you like to ... year retired and you enjoy going and checking out all these mysteries correct\nA ... you know that that is the story I mean the the flakes than kinds of ... ... this\nCattle grazing it's looked slum where they'd be in the old so to lake but I imagine imagine the sediments and everything is produced such a ... a very fertile ground\nWell yeah yeah I don't think that's why the cows and not race offices in it you know the first thing in the Nineteen seventies once again\nSpoke to this guy numerous times and recorded it I think that you know [noise] and he he did a bit of poaching in the Nineteen seventies you know catching has been ... some places that they should instead of being on private land\nAnd um it was a place called Fox called the world in green Dale which is\nEight miles from flicks than any still lives in Glendale and it's an interesting story he said it was with a friend said need noted for the past week or two weeks that\nSomething was ripping the prey out to be snazzy what might it might snow to catch the ... and the has the other games small game and it was ... ... is ... so to Britain\nAnd ... born and bred and he's with Iraqi them out to them it's\nNot as if it but we couldn't ... he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing it you know still a bit of snow on the ground you could say such a rose or they don't if you look over towards the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with a friend who was doing but poaching\nIn the daytime than to the lodge hedge hole forms and things about he said he probably eight to ten foot tall or they will show to turn around to speak to his friend and call this thing and is peripheral vision and looked and saw it on the oil it over the head ... he said\nWhat he thought he was a U Haul it meant holes so HBO the blessing to the radio off the first ... believe what I was looking out so what we're saying is this thing was as big as a small town it or you know your horse it's an interesting thing was he took over the edge\nAnd just one that he said well you'd expect to host a London move forward because the the momentum this thing just one that I'm stuck like a magnet\nSudden something not to look at that he said it was\nThe most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he said he's glad them before they run away he said what he was on all fours and he said he could still do it to the being over seven Fulton looked like a body builder I said you know it's a tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of about ...\nAnd ... woods and he said he's able to almost sort of Britain to link cooler you know like a box that dog all the stuff that you both areas and\nThat what he's citing he says well he said I went to him to the edge books them to try and get fence stave it says to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done it this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covert crossing the field and into the world or what quite incredible um you know\nThat's four miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast Coney but if you if you go further down the coast was whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was a piece of bumps and train featured in the u._k. papers quite often and\nIt was such a supposed to be aware of that was such a going the bombs to train them into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we'd go this way will type creature reported moving along the coast and they could go further up the coast you go [noise]\nOld folklore and I'll let you in old legends of dogs with glowing red eyes the ... bay and raven Scott ... they they tend to ... and you know these stories after they've come down to being hunted down in time ... there's\nJust I think there's grains of truth in the stories so that was a side thing\nIn the Nineteen seventies and he lived in Britain do all his life and he's never seen it since he's never seen it before that and they'd never seen it after that which is\nQuite incredible if this thing I Believe his story but if this thing was native to that Saturday you would think that they'd be more evidence so so why are we only seeing small glimpses of it on him\nHe was in a mate yeah and that's what you're saying that they pop in and they pop out along the way kind of like\nWhen I talked to people before uh we had um\nA friend of mine Laurie Williams she's in a remote viewer in I Would have heard target big flood and and she targeted she had mentioned how they\nThey are actually didn't know what it was you know she just looking at this esoteric target that I gave her and she's talking about how they had these portals\nAnd they were in time warps and and they would just go through one time warp and then another and you just see them when they pop into that particular one you know in ... where where human would see him\nUm I find I find it also interesting ah when you were saying that Ari yeah is there the world's oldest the operational radar base is right there and all this area where all this crazy stuff happens and I think I remember seeing a sure thing\nThat might be my phone about uh cooks out people just it does it's cutting in and out no well is showing Nobel laureates all now I'm a I'm Sorry about this listeners to join me to hang up and you touch me back because you know well\nWell you're flying right now for sure and will do that at the break for sure but yeah but I can hear you but again I think it I think it's very strange that this operation a radar base the oldest one is in the midst of all of these happenings that you're talking about\nThat is correct Tony ... and Joe ... briefly jumping to them to the animal mutilation is taking place\nThere's a radar base that which was eleven miles from stocks the world as the crow flies and that one's closed about one closed about Seventy to efficiently that's sixty eight but he was still operational up baseball

he has there isn't that crazy brand new song a brand new batteries and it goes out\nUm ...\nStrange isn't it when we talk about some of these things that\nI don't know I don't know\n... and the

four miles away from the coast to the point [noise] and the and the this coastline around ... to ... to ... and the rookie clips with\nAbsolute must have network at sea caves some of them have never
