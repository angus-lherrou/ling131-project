{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Actually had the hearing a you know this person testify without virtually any evidence and and kept contradicting different stories and people really were glued to their stats surprisingly a lot of people watch those hearing and\nUh they got a lot of ...\nAnd so there was a sense of the Democrats weren't very fair to start with with Trump\nAnd then this is like oh for that and all the media is not being carried either\nAnd so it's just sort of built what it really does raise the intensity for maybe Seventy percent Ninety respect for the intensity rating went up among the base plus the base spot ones who are not in the pace but are close enough to the base that go with them\nAnd so basically what they did was a fire\nUp are the folks who are buying stayed home with the election but now they're planning to vote county and city is high\nAnd do you believe that that over the top behavior by the Democrats a cost them Kavanaugh was he going to get it anyway\nOh I think Kavanaugh was going to get it ah the thing that uh there over the top behavior theater was cost them possibly their one chance of getting a house by\nHaving enough or if you will pro Trump people stay home because they didn't think it was needed if they voted but now they saw the fact that the Democrats are really not that good they're really working gets from even more than they thought\nYou know they get that Trump had ball are pretty well contained and everything was sort of going along even though all even though a session wasn't doing a whole lot\nThey sort of most the base were sort of saying you know I think things are under control economy's doing good this election's not that part but this is a fire up the base and said you know what\nPrompted still fighting a but we better get out for\nIt what about the Democrats who now for example the symbolic visual of the the the radical leftists probably living on food stamps and a welfare\nA smashing on the Supreme Court door to try to get in order to um make themselves obnoxious Lee heard\nTo stop Kavanaugh ah at the Supreme Court building itself or now that was after the election\nRight huh well the the vote there was it was an election in the Senate basically by the way I come from me [laughter] so yeah so um so now there's there can be that crowd is continuing that is a Democrat Barney party be merged with that image as the Democratic party's mainstream now\nYeah yeah that's what's contributing to the ... movement you continue to have to walk away movement taking place even as we're discussing all these other matters\nBut you have people walking away Democratic Party and sometimes not even changing their affiliation but just plain voting for them any more just walking away literally not taking the time to even came there it just so\nSo let me ask you this do you think that this phenomenon that I I agree with you but do you think that this over the top behavior before and after by these lunatics and they're nothing other than lunatics as a ... he'll brand rude\nDespicable all of that are bothering people in their private lives bothering Ted Cruz going out to dinner with his wife the think that\nUm that crowd\nHas caused the demise of the Democratic party as responsible as the responsible party and that um the selection might be surprising was greater support for Republicans that he really realize at this point\nWell that this whole phenomenon is a longer term trend than just having all this has been happening in building have an aunt is a an example\nOf one more advanced it's happening we can go back to Ferguson, Missouri we can go back to Baltimore, Maryland we can go back to all sorts of events that are in the psyche of the American voter and\nThis is one more that's contributing to the ultimate demise of the of the Democratic party it's also a plane towards\nStrengthening Trump fan and and\nIt's it's becoming the Trump party and well then you're seeing a populist party that coming emerging out of the things that\nThe radical nature of what these people are doing has overtaken the ah ... the feeling of obnoxious this in Donald Trump in other words he was always the the the punching bag for the left\nHas has this radical movement and the Democratic party on the far left now taken over and that will cause I don't hear anybody talking about Donald Trump's bad behavior anymore it's been very polite lately and actually a very thoughtful um are they now the bad boys so to speak\nOh absolutely absolutely and\nIn fact a lot of forest tolerated his point because they thought they needed somebody tough at the top\nYou know they put up with a nasty tweets now and then to get the job back but now they're going to even think that at all it's like these Democrats have got to go you know politically\nSo I think we're going to see a bunch of little wobble first they're going to be districts around the country that you think are guaranteed blue desperate and they're gonna they're gonna do\nA rat\nAnd saw them said so Schumer in Durban\nAnd Pelosi might look back at this and say we shouldn't have a cow town to the left wing crowded as part of our party we should have a modified or behavior against some of the extremism instead they bought into it by Maxine Waters of the leader of that radical nature\nI think they're going to look back and say we had a terrible strategy we live and and our\nStrategy was wrong because I think their strategy was to spray the Soros for for any aid but the right ... and\n... but not as well because they thought all this emotion was going to fire up their faith and come up with the idea that there are Republicans are white supremacists who uh herbicides and that sort of thing is that it's sort of firing on\nSo that um look Soros we know who he is but I think that must have been there probably were strings he probably told the Democrat leadership I'm going to do this stuff and you support them or you're not getting any more money for me I mean he might have done something like that to\nFair and they probably went along anyway along because you know what they don't have a vision they don't have a vision you know any ... any organization any business to\nHave to have a vision for going and you know when there is no vision usually the organization out there suffering from that right now the Democratic party they do not have a vision for anything other than\nYou know there's this prompt and that's when I got to resist Republicans were twenty five seconds\nI'm and

Reese with us his book the fourth age if I were on the line mosques delete Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was what we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine in your mind as a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye view of a hundred than two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um well my probably cost about it I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that\nWe know these technologies can do an enormous amount of good they can they can feed the hungry and diagnose illness and do all of these things and I'm not sure that introducing an element of like it may turn on those uh\nThat that may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine\nWill do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the\n... and opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um you could have an airline\nPilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people think when you got the co pilot right there you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack look that yeah that\nMay that may propagate through\nOur systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one better they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and and we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross and the ... and just really the incredible growth of this kind of technology\n... ... is it the humane\nThe main thing that fuels their technology is it's actually finally working or even the term\nWas coined in Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that very interesting reason which was\nNew ... you know three laws of planetary motion the laws of magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took a nap for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up his face up to space up to space it's delivering the goods\nIt can it if you out of business it can make probably any department in your business\nAnd ten percent cost ten percent better ten percent more profitable or it can it can do all of these things he couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now have the technology that we know how to do some really cool things if there were no more advances in a ah\nAh we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is uh they they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nThat's a fantastic question um\n\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is something weighs more than fifty pounds explode\nThat's a very rudimentary very rudimentary ah yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said uh it has a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a petite ... or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it was up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder and you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right\nAnd you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of people um there there is a quote debate\nAbout whether we're going to make a ton of killing systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budget sitter spending money on these systems I Know one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all habit but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic gun turrets that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave shoot 'em\nAnd it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally ah they only put that in because people requested it and show or it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a a weapon\nSystems it's good to have it well for\nFor three very easy reasons you could argue that ah\nThe the better the more effective it their mission\nAnd there'll be less collateral damage wherever they are you argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ... or ... and ... and whatever country you are\nAnd and the third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately what were the political costs are going to war which is there's not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapons systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if there's no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean do you see the day though by run that now we're coming up to the top of the hour show will finishes up when we come back next hour but you know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about

Boston in a heart radio station [laughter]\n\n[noise]\nWelcome back by run race with a survivor and do you think technology will ever replace postal people who deliver the mail to our houses\n[noise] you know um I I had a I have a feeling that any job at a machine can do we really want\nMachines to do it I mean 'cause there's a machine can do a job to make as you do that job this word for that that's called the\nHumanizing mhm 'cause if you just use the person forced into knit\nOr machine but you're saying nothing about you that makes us human or were you interested in reality the machine that W inventor [noise]\nUh is delivering the mail a Erdogan packages something like I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine machine washes windows I can imagine machine that automatically most my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nI Know that if you take a step back east\nOh jeez this country for two hundred and fifty years just as high unemployment between five and ten percent all the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years half of the jobs vanish\nAnd so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years\nRight and we had rising wages\nAnd because so why are we able to do it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out and everybody sees it and says I'm going to use is to increase my own productivity show what ever if you get self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city\nIf you are I mean like\nIt it's hard it's hard necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if you went back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's going to sweat thing and billions of people are gonna use it what do you think it was going to do their jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were going to vanish she would say well that's going to be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers [noise]\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't ... you wouldn't have seen at sea air B. and B. Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEvery body Everytime technology makes a great new job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter when a lot I don't I don't think a robot can do a what a waiter can do you know they use spell a drink you know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThere you have a special order and you want you want to send your food back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult yeah so\nWell the correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now hands down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movement joined gonna have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your well out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I Am happy when it gets that right when it doesn't get a an age and ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm not like you said that oh you know yet I'm\nIn that today and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative whether a computer and\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines are which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but somebody your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people who spent Twenty years working on something called the open and worm project\nTo try to take this little worm you got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model that in the computer just take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people who have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible\nSo there are so many we we are so\nSpectacularly amazing\nAh beings that that to duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe someday we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book to for the age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we are able to do\nAnd and we've used it\nTo overcome scarcity because for law of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed the productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action about what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of\nWas a match for his anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the men it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened or you invented the nation state and that's why I dozen years ago you can kind of shut your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge ... Mesopotamia missile America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that um\nThat artificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet because we are the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter huh I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or\nYou're ... you're right that the artificial intelligence and it is to be\nFrightening if you if you saw if you were a skilled cross person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and said that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers a sibling bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and uh you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it to Nineteen eighty\nFrom six AM to nine PM well kept here on the great\nW.

to be that there are there are lots of problems that aren't technical like there's hatred bigotry and all of that but there are certain things we just haven't figured out how old are you in disease how do you slow down aging how do you do all these things and so\nThey're suffering people around the world that just for waiting for technology to come through and and finally deliver on all the utopias people used to dream I wouldn't it be great if and now finally we've learned district and we can now make enough with all the good stuff for everybody and we just we're\nAlmost there and and

range\nUh I think that would be the best possible outcome because we live in this this universe and so we we got to get there are right now we're we're we curiously balanced on this you know pale blue dot\nIt's going to Ritchie in West Virginia now Ritchie taken away go ahead sir\nThe morning and thanks for having me on the shelves and say ... interesting topic\nI just wanted to ask your guest there if you think that the way technology is progressing that we may get to that and your to your age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings 'cause working alongside with technology\nI loved that question you know you know Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did kill off a poll just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education do they can grow your own food make your own clothes you can work Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty or ... people decided they wanted more and so there's no limit to human wants it turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home but not holy water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always worked forty hours and we've\nIf if if I productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now Byron this technology\nUm I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine the machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who the machine or fix my road\nCould've machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything\nThat you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\nWith hair care than ... than ... than now and they can pay for it and and ... her home care and ...\nAnd ... with that and him and then ... and ... it gets half an hour with and now they're\nTalking about automatic guns well okay I Know you're you're\nThe guest bart is entirely right uh we are using a condom his weapons were killed the ... of course we've done that since landmines wheat crop were dropped dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is rebuilding machines to kill\nA so I didn't mean to say\nThat uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we build machines\nThat we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate is allegedly going on is whether are we going to make more bad systems that operate completely economists say that you can just\nRelease in an area and it will go and decide that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a federal district but part I agree with you\nBefore the age Martin robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books were sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just restart Cobb and there'll be a lot of links\nTo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's going to out jumped to very\nSimple things one uh\nIndividual worldwide average income per capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ Seventeen fifty nothing happened what if you look starting Seventeen fifty shot up like a rocket um\nWhy because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we make the scientific method and there's no limit to where the wind is going to go so vast amounts of well created a eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical problems like disease and hunger\nYou will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming or all kinds of people said it would be possible but um\nYou know this country the United states already Throws Away in a food to feed all hungry\nPeople not world no question that the world strange to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that wouldn't be traumatic or to come on coast to coast as we talk about the ghost photographer next\nNow you

interesting things\nRight isn't that the craziest title who calls their book that goes photographer\nWouldn't show me your peers about the fact that you're you are you were corporate executives doing some ... works and now you're writing a story about the ... talk [noise]\nYou know this it's it's a ... is a great question I\nI think because what I Do day in day out is rooted in data\nAnd and I'm and I'm known you know within the organization is being in a very direct on this kind of person that when I started telling the stories\nUm they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you would make this up\nYou know you're the you're the nerd you wouldn't make this stuff and you know um I Would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people um have kind of gone with me on the journey um I I think that's a very small you know\nPoint zero one percent um you know they they just they can't make their way over right\nTo our mind um but I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could they interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet\nThey're afraid to tell the stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know\nPeople could feel liberated to just to tell their do you have talked about their experiences 'cause there's so many people have had him and I also wanted them to you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that people are all into the sunlight you should not a lot of ... minutes but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk to your ear off and you know just just for your listeners then because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah Bush\nBecause I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit about medium shift just you know some of those things a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe and go\nSo we're almost the majority were barely a minority and that's grown I bet\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second stat um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this\nAnd every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is Googling the word coast that are saying\nYes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening um but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey either way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide and you have nothing to hide\n... thank yous journey started for you because of a personal situation\nYes did did you know just\nThis started from me I'm\nI'm I mean the book really is a journey Adderall transformational Journey Through grief [noise] um I lost my mother to all timers\nA and you know I I you know not only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghost and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd opened a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes well hold her guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started this aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs of ...\nDo you have been doing this show me things what kind of camera [laughter]\nAnd I found\nI used and what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise]\nUm it was an iPhone I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sam son Kamron on the phone but like a regular camera\nAnd it was interesting because all I captured on that um we're ... not that ... you know are unimportant and special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else it's interesting\nYou know\nWhen this was going on for the entire dirty looks looks good into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did you damn sorry so you mean get me going through the journal and how did I start to heal from that you\nStarted to the strange thing\nYeah I um you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know how how make me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the streets the Sherman Oaks screaming you know hide your kids had your wife we got ghost in the neighborhood\nAnd um so ... so I had some guides I ... you know that that we're helping me understand it and an album investigated and um\nI I started you know after I saw the first goes in a photograph I um\nYou know I kind of panic was intrigued 'cause I I got to be honest with you George I was a little bit of a skeptic before a skeptic as and it's not true\nA skeptic that you want to

Adam and Eve away from God to actually\nGet scratched out of the book of life and so\nClearly he's done a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all this is the theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off in parties in the actual space on so many people have talked about the actual planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think that's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line on is when this can happen again is just a theory\nIt's a pretty good\nIt's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have it or bad because you know what\nThe light does it need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights and I think that this entity kind of makes its way\nAnd and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I I Hope people will read the book I'm a of what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that has

you say you've got to tell us\nOh yes so I yeah so I I so how how 'bout you just tell everybody incentive is the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called in one night and said I saw the ... man again\nAnd and he spoke to me\nAnd what he said to me was how her my name is Ron\nAnd I went he he said what he said how her my name is wrong because I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of my step dad who was not very nice\nAnd I said I'm he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him\nDon't think it was my extent that but I think it was the ... man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people there to say um but I think that you know if anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare either\nAnd I find that thing that triggers you right there I find that deep dark thing they're going to find it was the antagonist and this person's life and mine is if I accept that and and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accept it didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening to you [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you
