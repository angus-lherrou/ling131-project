I I don't get it or assume\nYou're assuming that courts are all Josh\nThey're nuts for\nAll the all I'm doing is describing what should be the case under the law I'm not making a judgment about the court I'm telling you what the law is and I'm telling you that I question whether the attorneys\nAnd that maybe they did a magnificent job for you I don't know but I Am questions about whether this was forcefully presented because this is a clear and I mean the decision would be clearly erroneous\nUnder the circumstances if that's what happened if they actually made a decision that has no legal grounds for the decision\nThat is clearly erroneous or agree just save those are two standards you could use\nAbsolutely I Would ... percent agree and the fact of the matter is our justice system is a mess it it's it's totally wrapped up in political motivation or in the courts or making law\nWhich they have no authority to do a little bit over felt case\n[noise] if you can cite\nYou know a lot of issues where the courts or make law and that's not\nTheir job to do there to interpret law\nThat was the second amendment case\nNo rights what supposedly legalized a homosexual marriage\nYou okay that was that that was missing Justice Kennedy of that as a\nFlowery or the opinion and very literary as as Scalia said it was very literary opinion I'm not sure I'd be substance but anyway um no I I understand your point there there's a direction the country is going but they're still has to be a legal basis\nAnd you could at least argue um with regard to homosexual marriages that\nDon't have to have a legal basis any more they can they they they get away with doing whatever they bark\nWell yes and no I don't look at a lower level court ... the lower level courts in Hawaii and Seattle in San Francisco all got the stuck it to them when the Supreme Court said the president has the authority or to stop the immigration from those six countries\nI mean and then then the style well and even Obama won even Obama said that on a on several occasions\nOr there were nine to nothing vote some of the United States Supreme court against Obama and that included Kagan and Saddam iron briar and Ginsburg who were appointed by him or we're big fans of his and they voted against them on several occasions so there there that I mean I understand that your case\nAnd what you described as accurate but in them but it doesn't always happen that way it's an imperfect system\nA and look I I can I I mean I feel the same way about the way judges will decide that ... that is an illegal alien as constitutional rights when they step foot on our on our territory um the parents of the United states talked about in the last forty eight hours\nHow outrageous that is one of the rallies they attended um you know so even and even in the case that he had where he wanted to stop immigration from certain countries because they didn't have a good vetting system\nHe couldn't do it because some some district judge in one small court decided that he was putting a national ban on it to stop a sitting president\nThe president has full authority to do those things\nSo even handle wait to get it done that you might be exonerated at the Supreme Court if they hear the case but it was seemed to me that there's a very strong case to be heard here because it's not about a same sex marriage are believing in a you know same sex relationships or any of that it's about whether in ...\nTo me at least the woman had any legal connection to the child and therefore did she have a right to have visitation with the child the woman did it voluntarily who was the mother but I don't see any right to have that visitation\nSo you know there are grounds there now I don't know how was your attorney's argued the case before the second circuit court of appeals they won't they won't listen on bunk they refuses that it\nCorrect\nWhere does this is where does the second circuit said what what's the city that they said in\nWell they do uh they're probably going to put them on the partly friends with the ... maybe he's a a buddy of actually\nYou're you know we write each side what ten minutes and\nIt depends it depends on the court I mean I think you are they disapprove\nOf that we have ten minutes\nAnd then they have questions so at least you get a chance to read on but I don't mean that would be the central point I Would make the woman had no legal connection to the child and therefore no right no right under the law visitation or Iran and we're not questioning or the civil union that existed between the parties the civil union existed\nAnd then it was terminated by agreement of both parties\nThe non custodial woman I wouldn't even call her parents 'cause she wasn't the bunker story a woman a year on a refused to adopt a child so there is no legal relationship between that woman and that child\nI mean if they they would have to say it that clearly it\nTo the very least embarrassed the court into somehow justifying how would would go against that statement which is which is clear on its face\nIf people want to follow the case a little bit and I want to get updates there's a lady to put a website together that\nA crowdfunding website but it's also puts regular updates on there's one on dot com\nSo the the numbers for one nine fund dot com is that correct correct that is correct\nThe other thing I'd suggest to them and said it's late in the game but there are there is a number of a legal\nOrganizations legal um think tanks um jobs they're good guy comes to mind is Jay Sekulow on when he's not representing the president and he's he's been running\nA one of these are legal foundations that does a lot of the cases that you're talking about a ...

beltway cabal of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes\nServed on the board of Sallie Mae back when\nIt was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert lowered a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise] ah like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an

do you recommend for parents who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and

is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices truth in lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned\nUh so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank get any private\nLine of credit [noise] uh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type of loan whatever\nHappened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding has cetera\nCan keep up with their budget um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to

interviewed I might add a and so it's sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch\nAnd I'm hopeful that'll change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits or have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick\nAnd by that I mean a you've got these payday loan center outrageous and predatory a dinner gear mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time\nYou've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy\nAre these um secondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... this if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans\nIt's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car and you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no brakes any wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you\nYou should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks\nYou know uh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night an expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans and the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about\nI mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a you know I'm a an economically needy group of people who you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and how cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the landing system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq crazy once once the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with\nThe the number I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I I should've pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and\nYou know the scholarships really have an increased uh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy so this has\nJust gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition\nBy working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well you know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid vine\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge Allen I got good thank you [noise]\nThey got good news for you too man a Trump rally over there and a lot of the other day\nYeah there was a big fine they throw at least ... sealed and you look at the whole ... oh [laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway I I I Want to drive a little bit of trades will do a ... a former company I used to work or I got trained on equality and when a company went under the under the company I'm a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now\nYou know and it was a sad time but uh we pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people do so I think I owe here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone or if I was I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without doing\nWell and I think well over ... years and\nYou probably in Lawrence you've been more experience than most people\nAnd I looked at the local school there and they were to voting for dollars that go in or oh I think it was a two month course just on well you know there are way\nSo I ended up going and less than ... dollars on a great little are learning to drive semi thrive and then I felt like I got ... I found out that it's not a surprise\nUh let's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jak through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's\nIt's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke tax and other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em out to publicly think Alan he's the one that pointed out to me that the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending\nUm and of course a tuition and inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the lungs especially the taxpayer on the hook on an aircraft a dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his college dead\nSo let's see what they've done they've given at sixteen thousand dollars to give away every day made possible by house me of course they don't have money to give me a raise or if you really want to give credit where credit's due or your weight I mean\nI don't know better you the me take the chance to a day to win a thousand dollars all you've got to do is to listen to win every hour after the news from six AM to nine PM yeah welcome you're on the brakes\nW.

there is\nA say in the unit around consolidation ... action program and how can I can turn on right now I'm On a ... fan base repayment program\nAnd I have no idea what there is that that was going to ask if you heard of this company or and\nAgain to me Allen doesn't it do you have student loans out there gene\nI Do I Do I got my first time you know trying to work on my bachelors\n... well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the lists or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't the scammers\nAre yes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this year's company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in default that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to re junior year loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger alone a and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nHow they're George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of upgrade Allan Poe's tell tell\nHuh that job thank you and I hope we hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and all or a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years\nAnd they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C and hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular uh\nBut their information has a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know there was a breakdown of all of a a a cough that I've ever heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can get me do I try to negotiate directly with the oh he tried to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also uh the\nSounds like another scam Alan what do you think\nRight ah and first of all I Would I Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy right back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies I'm\nThe owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education [noise]\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent of the lake it alone he'll take it all the you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with the closing up you know like like what you describe how did\nThey get the information Allen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this or a public jak clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are some beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead [laughter] and\nMy leaders down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave\nAnd well what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent particularly for order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original sign\nProblem [laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens and the Pentagon whole war what's that all about [noise]\nTo find out where George ... speaking to the coast to coast am dot com website scroll down to the bottom including Georgia's calendar\n\nSylvie what

to get in your photos and other mysteries\nHe's been called the real Fox I'm older has been working as a consultant or spokesperson a numerous alien the movies TV shows video games as well and tonight we're going to be talking about aliens at the Pentagon and Nick welcome back it's always great to have you\nBack on the shirt I don't know how you doing these days\nWhere did we lashed see each other contacted the desert we were there ...\nNow what do you live event in which we\nThat was right around that same period yeah that was\nWell you did a great job there thank you\nGreat job aliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nKids are essentially it is my new documentary that I put out to tell the story all all certainly the Pentagon's UFO credit cram a tip but she can take July it's that story and and really to\nTo try in one don't humane tree to tell as as best as I can the entire story of the U.S government for ... relationship with this phenomenon of ah watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming Nick what do you think of that\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single\nRevelation in in the UFO community for I I think decades I the only story that I think comes close and I would say this wouldn't die is the kind of a vacation and release of the British Government files but the the revelation\nThat off to decades have to know the U.S government did have a new effort program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm from an agency of the day and and like you say for years they said no no since project to close down we haven't been doing this this knowing ... there were no investigations\nAnd of course they were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on tangle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment pulls the all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this but Robert Bigelow a Senator Harry Reid told the long I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up in honey you track all this stuff is coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer that one is is very cautiously and very carefully and and I absolutely in meticulous detail\nBecause I think the problem with this story\nIn one sense for years people have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's going on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we must have too much\nInformation and I think the public I mean it's it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them\nBut for the public eye I think it's just a confusing mess if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they're they're ... story on this on December sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to first than a than a third one\nBut now with the public have been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well there's the videos and then there's this won't stock guy and then this this ... millionaire businessman\nAnd and struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back and and give people an overview of this from my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film will get a lot in the course tonight dinner gun but tell us specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on this one and it was quite a a diverge and for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and then you've done this of course civilian time yourself you know you sit in the hot seat\nA direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I go edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd\nPut that back then and I wish they'd take it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon ... did they fight teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so I scripted the entire movie I did the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think was\nScript for this and ... in that way I have absolute control of this and then literally I went into a recording studio you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right did\nThe whole thing and and then I sat down in front of the camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a director who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving seat having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one ... well I Can't say gosh this this somehow\nDidn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure for mayor dates a completely new role to me I mean there are people of course who are\nUsed to this sort of thing or people like ... just made a a a great movie but um\nYou know I I was a departure from me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with the ...\nFirst play and as I say really to try to\nGo through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've\nI've tried to do this I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field has is\nIt we know young people are interested in in the subject\nBut they don't go to many conferences and ... and ... you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand\nWe call it onto the platforms that the young people the watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play him food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd\nBut but too young to get people and and another thing is you know it's been a year since toned along ... had his press conference where he\nGot together with the to the stars of people\nUm and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times when the story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I wanted to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs\nCenter stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization Dewey ... nowadays like like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you said the organization I'm E. E. T. I. P. O.\nYes I Am well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of that\nThe U.S government has said well it always says in these sorts of situations only as little as possible and we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't\nFrankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nRash your task and there's strong evidence don't forget your cats\nGrace gray gray follow me now gray gray more a\nGrandmother could have been a Native American Indian point is America you're\nOne one thousand twenty four it's made it for the coup a report on the voice of Boston this is your cat W are kale\nIs misleading but here I hard where do you invite you to see Fleetwood Mac and live\nSuch a huge amount of material you've always go to imagine how diseases ...

think it's it's a perfectly reasonable moved to say yeah we we should have a space for us but I think some of some of the Komen trip out there so it's been a little far fetched I mean it'd be something from a ... movie finally aliens I mean it's it's more about DOMA nineteenth few trip idle space\nWell are you exactly but what do you think about the late president Ronald Reagan's attempt to get the star wars technology going some people thought it was to protect us from some kind of alien or intervention\nAnd he certainly made of course those remarks are very famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I occasionally saying how quickly we we would set aside a difference is down here on uh if if we face some alien threat and and of course people read\nAn awful lot into those remarks and then they saw the star wars program and they read read a law into that to my own personal view is that that was much more about just trying to ... when the Cold War and find crop the Soviet Union which to be fair is exactly the way it pretty much\nPlayed out I'll Try to look like there's been nice to talk of disclosure\nAre you you know I I'm\nArguing Steven bass and all the time I don't think there's going to be the kind of disclosure he expects do you think that the things that are happening now or governmental ways trying to soften us up for governmental disclosure or do you think it's never going to happen\nAs I yeah I I agree\nWith you I don't think the kind of Steve pass it um disclosure with the big the my fellow Americans people at the world we are not alone I don't think that\nIn in here they are bringing them yeah\nUm and and we've discussed this before one of the big problems of course is is not saying that there extraterrestrial spot if it turns out that we've known about this Seventy years they can be awful lot of questions\nTo answer about that no I I think it's more like clay and I don't believe either this is a kind of softening up in a climate ... program but I Do think that through\nThrough the revelations about how you tip them through the classification and release of the British Government you file your files we are seeing government say effectively will lick here is\nOur data or as much of it as we can really\nYou know without compromising certain classified information I'm ... and ... and the ultimate irony of all this might be ... genuinely gum and don't really know what they're dealing with either I'm which takes me back to the mountain we\nQuote what if we all dealing with some things so above and beyond

that we have today I'm not sure you knew what the what what he was drawing though what do you say\nWell he was clearly a fishery genius has been a time travel\n[laughter] well I'm not sure about that but um I guess there are there are a handful of physicists working on that Ronald Merrill it comes to mind yep but I think\nThere are some some others or you know I I had a job in the ministry defense where I was paid to sing the unsinkable so I I\nReally things out\nDid you get involved in remote viewing or anything like that psychic work with the ministry you did\nAbsolutely we had you can't run a UFO program without finding you sell the the focal point for anything\nThat any any one kind of comes to the government about and of course we had we had people who said that they like it and they wanted to volunteer there to the intelligence community to help out well you know like Kay\nSoviet ballistic missile submarines among buys them traitors button that sort of thing\nSo we looked at this as a classic low probability high impact probably ... ... but if it does pay off is so big wind on\nSo we actually did have a program the U.S government had three over the years that we know about real flame\nSome street can dog ate the ministry of going to the briefly in about two thousand and one\nAnd did a study which which was classified I think ... it's now classified\nAnd only ministry defense website actually or on the national archives website I'm not sure where but it's out there it it wasn't a very good study I have to say it and some of the U. S.\nProgram and and because it was an intelligent program the age old problem they they so much in silos but they didn't go out and talk to people that they probably should have to I some of the people involved in dog ate and fame and from tree\nWhat do you what do you think of rumors about a congressional hearing on your phones ... ...\nAnd I and actually they are big breaking news story actually just this week it it turns out it's more than rumors I'm calling from\nReliable sources but the it I'm ...

Boston in a heart radio station [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd back with Nick Pope your questions this hour as well ... let's get back into these talks of congressional hearings what you think could happen it could happen when\nI Know it will be because of course we've we judge Kavanaugh ... coming up to them but I have um\nI'm Services Committee have been looking for is the ... ha it\nHave been doing and secondly I think that interest has said wait until the ... question off you ate pays\nMore generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative Amy para I think it was a has had some discussions with the chair of of the uh science technology and space command tea and and the space\nSubcommittee that could actually be a little bit of a don't fight about that I mean that's another point if this congressional interest which we know Israel evolves into formal congressional hearings the question arises well where should those hearings the\nAs I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the the space subcommittee or the the science technology in space\nMain committee I think I think it will be difficult to get it away\nFrom the middle of tree frankly it was a military and intelligence program and I just can't see how you would get it out of of the armed Services Committee and indeed one of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks and it terms of reference\nAbout unconventional threats well if ever there was like a forum to to discuss the UAE pay a mystery it's it's bad so\nSo you you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact that there is congressional in traffic we know the ... law being going on\nFor formal hearings I've actually I Can't say too much about this but I I supplied some briefing\nMyself and I sit and they said that I'd be happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this\nFor the British Government would be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things\nWhich I think is is bizarre and fascinating is I think so far they haven't really been for a national daily newspaper reports that have actually going into the fight but yes there is this\nCongressional interest in UFOs and you know war all four of those articles or in British newspapers\nAmong us one us oh no not yet no no\nThank God we do what we do and we have so many good podcaster who's out there doing what they do to get the word on their\nAbsolutely but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunate play only ... the ... one one of the things is I Know do some work as a freelance journalist myself\nAh it it's kind of like like we said with aliens penned again you know if you don't like the way that you you off portrayed on TV sometimes run your own documentary well I I take the same view with newspaper articles\nAnd this this week I had an article published in the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily nearing\nAgreed on line or two\nThey yeah I absolutely as they will have to be these days and and my my own feeling the guardian basically um I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee and the house armed services\nCommittee in ... and I I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it's it's it's staggering before articles I've seen about this all four of them a great ... one US\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line oh I'd love to see a survey of twenty five to thirty in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety percent on line\nI'm sure you're right I mean I'm of course of off the age where I like a hard copy newspaper in my hand and we don't have the right things you know I I used to get disappointed like when somebody said oh it's it's certainly online version but now I guess my ... my
