author of several great books including the field and the intention experiment in a way it is the power of eight\nLynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back due to argue still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results of a few months ago\nKnow I get an intentioned a bit when the several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas or they could hit as a category four or five and we did a little\nAnd let's bring it down and it used to ship a tropical storm really fast or something happens at work so they\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep the uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now\nWe've run about six piece intention experiments trying to lower violence um last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence in the most violent place in America which is believe it or not a U.S a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri ...\nAnd we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor of statistics look at this from University of California\nAnd she saw that\nCrime went up in St Louis has a whole property crime went up in St Louis is a whole property crime went up went\nUp in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before and it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so something's going on here\nWhat do you think this is one of the people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the feel of what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I liked I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy and our thoughts are another kind of energy when there\nAre worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I run the thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds grow faster to purify water healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and\nYou know of those thirty three twenty nine have shown measurable positive significant effects\nDesigner trend the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug has his good record is that in terms of studies so so as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things\nThat affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power\nTo change things now maybe he'll think\nThe experiments you been working on all boys are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis\nAnd then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I Lived in the u._k. and we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the Deepak of the middle east and also very prominent Israeli\n... a documentary producer so we had eight and Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain\nEt cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews so these are guys who have\nBeen brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know is the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know I'm just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know ... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was\nAmazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic and it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does added to play ... in the if you're a beach in positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we didn't intention once for a kid call Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide he threw himself off of forty foot\nStructure after is he broke up\nWith this for a serious girlfriend and he'd broken everything he had brain damage she had a you know he had nerve damage\nAnd so I got my my community to start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live but he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated\nBut here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents beliefs and the power of intention was pretty stupid it worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot jar ah Gary Schwartz at the University of Arizona noted psychologist\nAnd a Jessica too is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research I worked with the late ... rural I I worked with people from from U. Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from\nPrinceton University you know just really prestigious universities so we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable and then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and with some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with\nDr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds and we sent intention to one set of seeds and\nThen the scientists didn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had no real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists and then I just invite my\nReaders all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate or I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to\nTo do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or on Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results and the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's gone on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nAnd do you know losing the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group for the test why ... why not three orange juice\nGene [laughter] will tell me really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments and I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of you know groups small groups in my workshop you know will\nAnd so so sad [laughter] it's kind of funny and Boston women just when you saw his country couldn't get weirder every rank Tim number one I Love you any non sexually I\nAm now Boston Red hot by the new the three W arcane [noise] [noise]\nHi this\nIs Joel Johnson from the program money wisdom right here on W.

you see universities are studying the power of what are they doing\nWill we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same ol' brain state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much\nBigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander um and again we've looked at it compared to other\nUm mystical states and its\nIdentical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this the ... largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nearest scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this [noise] um but one of the other\nBig pieces of this I talked about it with altruism\nWas the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments and they found something incredible that goes on a\nWith a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on\nUm things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies and\nThen the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we\nWe actually get healthier\nBut the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis they found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas nerve also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intentioned experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be your mother that would be an interesting ...\nWill you know we're doing one this at\nSomeday undoing a pilot experiment like that in\n... county in Florida um we're gonna do something about lowering violent but we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next\nNext spring um we're we want people you know a different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nUs talked about a mirror affect what does that\nMirror affect me with the biggest piece of this George because you know we weren't just seeing effects among the receivers that stuff and the receiver of the big intention experiment you know the outcome that change all that was\nAmazing to me with what happened\nTo the participants in these intention experiment [laughter] so when we started giving these teeth experiment I started getting people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly\nI asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like that [noise] um I felt like I was part of the higher network it my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek and remember these are people who are participating\nIn their own home in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly after they participated in a piece experiment their line became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners they were getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiment we had loads of healing\nWhen we had these experiments we had loads of people finding their line we're more peaceful\nIn a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to the people it changes their lives being part of that\nWhen we're going to come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for you as we talk about the power of aid but

I've had young people I've had older people and it it works for them I think it's all about using the techniques that I teach you know in becoming a master in tender essentially\nKnowing how to really focus your mind knowing how to\nWhat kinds of things to intend for and how to do it but also being part of that group and just meeting regularly and I think it's that meeting regularly that does the trick I mean there's a guy called Michel Dean I write about my book who is a\nClinical psychologist but suffered from depression which such so bad that it was often suicidal that's not a good calling card for a psychologist so he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression and he couldn't and so\nBeing part of the group they intended for that and what they intended for was that he would find the source of his end\nOf his depression and soon after that he got a brain wave to go to a Chinese herbal is who worked out that one of his liver filtration systems wasn't working and he went and got tests and they confirmed that he that he was right\nAnd as soon as that was treated his depression completely lifted but the really interesting part of Michel story is what happened over the year not only did that happen but he ended up going back to his fighting weight\nLoss wait he got back to his you know his his weight that he was as a young man\nHe um he's chi gung practice he was practicing chi gung that Gump better he\nGot a writer's block and was able to start writing again um he also developed something to help other people with I think it's with depression is special I'm a special kind of technique and everything in his life\nWas getting better and even his training you know his his um his\nHis trainer at the gym said to him\nWhat are you doing man you're exercising less and you're more fit what's going on with you and it was like everything in his life was starting to improve\nBut he he was one of the people who met religiously and in fact one of the guys in his group Robert became a really really close with him even though they'd never actually physically met and there were times when\nMitchell would say you know I had insomnia last night and couldn't sleep and Robert let's say don't worry man I had you covered and he was intending for him to have a\nYou know to to sleep better\nAnd so knowing you've got that constant support is really strengthening in every way\nOver the year when when you do these intention non experiments but when you do these intentions to do something what do they do actually I mean you sit there and think I mean what what do they do\n[noise] okay well there's a lot of little techniques that make you a good intent or I mean you know the popular view is that you just have to think about it and believe it or ... or whatever you do\nYeah um but it's you know one thing to really keep in mind Georgia's that were intending all the time [laughter] you know and we sabotage most of our intentions we we think that we're just having you know we we have a meditation in the morning we do a little power thought and that the power thought\nIs the thing that's our intention and that's the only thing the universe is going to hear but\nUm as I wrote about my book the field\nYou know we are and meeting energy all the time we're meeting a tiny current of light all the time and our thoughts are another part of that kind of mission and we're we're kind of leaky buckets we're we're broadcasting twenty four seven\nAnd so we we have this one little power thoughts saying I'd like to have this um but the rest of the time we're thinking no it can't possibly come to pass or on such a loser or I don't like my hair or whatever\nYou know were sabotaging it and so one of the things you have to do is get used to really having a focused mind a sense of positivity but probably the most important thing of all that no one ever thinks about is being specific um\nYou really have to direct yourself to a charge don't you\nYeah I mean most people think about you know we'll all do something general in the universe fulfilling the gap and that's a big mistake because the universe can oftentimes fit land the gap in a really negative way\nYou know I think of the case of Heather meals McCartney who was a Paul McCartney he's a second wife um she was he had lost his\nLove of his life Linda his first wife and he was mourning her and he met Heather who had been a she was a northern girl from the north of England who came from a pretty rough family and she wanted to better herself so she came down to London and she was a model\nAnd she was the glamour model and she got hit by a motorcycle one day and\nShe lost her leg below the knee one of her legs but she was very lucky and she you know she continued to model and stood up for the rights of people who have lost limbs and that's when Paul McCartney met her now\nHeather meals really wanted to be famous that was something really important to her and suddenly\nAfter pull married her and it fell in love and marriage her you know she became really famous you know super famous she married a former Beatle but\nI think you know\nWhat ended up happening is as the marriage guts our um she they the British press started digging up all this stuff about her about how she had featured in porn um photos and things like this and so suddenly\nHeather from being very famous and kind of revered within this and so I look at that case and I think her big problem was she wanted to be famous but she just didn't specify how and so it's\nDefinitely unintended consequence so they have consequences right\nAbsolutely absolutely so it's about really telling the universe what you want I mean I Know that you're a a
