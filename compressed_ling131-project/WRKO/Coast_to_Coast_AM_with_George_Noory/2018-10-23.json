{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "And that people don't always stay with what's coming ahead of time in my study of numbers makes me see I think a little bit clearer and I really believe ah that's one of the reasons the Democratic party is over it's two out of touch with the American people\nWhile the the\nWay in which the representative of of that out of touch they're\nThe ones and and that's that's a valid point is that there's no connection to reality for anybody's gotta sit there and shake their head and say what are you talking about a one oh but wait we'll talk about Obama as I said laying down for the king of Saudi Arabia are backing away from going after a son when he should have\nFrank and this this guy is a has the intel and I I don't even know intelligence maybe it's just simply his unwillingness or to to see what's in front of them at least to acknowledge what's in front of\nThe great way the country is going a it being productive and a vibrant the economy is great there's more reason to believe there'll be peace in the world today than there was before he took office\nA Obama set on North Korea is going to be your biggest problem it's still not done but it's certainly better than it was then\nAnd it may wind up with the dean of the clear as they used in the north Korea wants Obama gonna say then by the way Obama says that this economy is simply\nA seamless continuation kind of like a kind of like a a liberal on getting a pass from a teammate in scoring a bucket and then the team made takes credit for it or that\nI heard that I heard that about live and I thought that was all areas\nI didn't know anybody said it but that's what it says that oh you don't even get heard the President Obama say Hama\nYeah and he acts and well then you heard him say that he was just a continuation of his policies on the country was in a debacle they're not there was never\nAny one year of those eight years with three percent increase in gross domestic product he's the first president in history of the country never have that he had the highest um deficits if the UN is deficits together there are more than the forty three presidents put together before him\nThat's right and and we can do a whole long list of other are statistics that show the economy is in bad shape funny handed over to Trump and he was telling a bull during the election season twenty sixteen that Americans had to get used to the one percent growth\nA range where we're very and at the time and and what Trump said he was going to create a lot of jobs the said well what is the what is Trump have a magic wand that can't be done well\nTrump has created under his administration a four point two million new jobs and I you know and the the list of statistics that are positive under Trump is just a mind boggling there's so many of them\nWell and we could go on for the rest of the show listing all of that benefit by black American unemployment is the lowest in history Asian American unemployment the lowest on and on and on and on went for your your wonderful listeners\nIt well then find him on his essay saw his speech he always says that they always brings of everything is done so you just have to listen to the Trump tell it himself but I'm the reality is that the country is in way better shape than it was under Obama and the people believe that and understand that I think quite frankly a that it's very clear\nThat the American people see past bronco Obama and\nHe's not getting the crowds that everybody would think he should get if they were much support for\n... by the way the final total in the Houston rally tonight or RSVP is to attend the rally at a hundred thousand right\nIt was over a hundred thousand a final numbers ... had been earlier they like Seventy eight thousand I think it holds Eighteen to twenty thousand but it went over a hundred thousand RSVP is back in West Virginia I remember that speech that\nAuditorium also held around Fifteen thousand bad RSVP three Ninety two thousand and wanted to hear the president five incredible\nYup they're busy always gets big numbers and that's by the\nWay they bite and a recent speech no but I got to ask you about something here ... ... people showed up\nFive hundred people in Florida wow and I assume he was there for the candidate for governor\nAnd for Bill Nelson probably running for Senate reelection or against actually I'm a Governor Scott Rick Scott the governor of Florida running for the Senate on the Republican side I got to ask you about Nancy Pelosi was hounded by a group of protesters in Florida or cursing and calling or a communist\nUm the small group of hecklers shattered obscenities called or communist in English and Spanish she went on to a campaign event for Donna Shalala believe it or not I'm All right twenty and this\nAnd she yeah and she said you don't belong here you African Communist\nOr this one person said that and then she worked all asleep walk by didn't say anything\nAnd the ... of the protesters pounded on the door and it goes on from there when when one Democrats say that on any side it's wrong the former leading lead top law enforcement official in the country says kick them when they're down about Republicans are Maxine Waters get in their face go to their homes go everywhere\nWhoopi Goldberg does it all\nUh I mean you go on and on and on with uh these Democrats who refused to that and this or that the ... the NIH or demean the horrors of these people who are going after Republicans in their private lives they just won't won't stop it\nSo why why wouldn't there be a response on the other side\n[noise] well there's bound to be some response that people are are getting upset a warning outlet for the conservative or status boating that's why the voter intensity off the charts for this election\nThought I Would say this I think that Democrats may be thinking for themselves the Pakistan orders I truly believe what they're saying is a way of their frustration on fast with Donald Trump\nAnd the Republican but they're also totally out of touch with the American people as the American people do not want to fight in restaurant we thought or stay you know a\nA Mitch McConnell at a restaurant and the first came up bang on the table for food out the window out the door I should say\nAnd that the rest of the folks there were jumping up and started to go after that person until he was escorted out by a security guard or a best buy a condo\nSo the American people don't like that one of the reasons you have to walk away and we now have three different town both but a Twitter we have to walk away movement town red tail ... pound the great awakening or all\nOf us are cameras fast forward necessarily giving up their registration Democratic Party but they're not voting for Democrats voting well conservative\nLet's hope you're right and I we used ... and less I Hope

O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carp and cash says we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um the the uh but we didn't put them in such machines and said we just released them to the atmosphere\nAnd we were producing with the same rate we're producing them on earth right now in fifty years we'd warm bars by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth\nAnd the the uh [noise]\nAnd if you warmed Mars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the uh the soil because it's been sponge to and it would out gas and it would thicken the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this is much ... fresh water in most places there is a north of\nMel oceans will I bet well planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um but yes\nThe waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick CEO to atmosphere liquid water rain then you could start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to breed the all but\nIf we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent fish ... and ... in which case this thing could happen much much faster\nAnd um so I think Mars is going to be Tara formed within two hundred years\nAnd my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with what country\nThe Martians\nOr they're going to do with themselves\nNow when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watch us to this I assess and they bring us back\nA while we'll set a tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmonauts an astronaut that had the board but I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution\nIn space flight is really going to put the question to these people [noise] um I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia accountable face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my guess Chinese though because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they\nMoved away from command economy um but Russia\n... the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and uh because you know the Russian government is basically a organized crime I mean\nYou know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise]\nAnd uh the the eye and so if if if they are going to have their own space axis and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing [noise] um [noise]\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this that will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on the coast to coast they sign up now for\n... zone or free email newsletter today it goes to goes to um dot com [noise] Mm\n\n\nThe the president's in taxes on Monday Night\nAnd I mean there's something for Ted Cruz for what I'm most interested in is really reference Heidi cruise others you love Georgia's everybody come are out of love\nWill be looking for that will also be looking to see what he has to say about the caravan is this news closer and closer to the United States Senate for the other way they can have three hour fishing you're doing it if they asked\nHim and beaming weekday mornings they they've had the voice of Boston\nU R K oh\nDid you know if you're doing it yourself to a local good will they sell it to provide job training in your local community by donating will create jobs find your nearest donations center by going good will or will donate stuff create jobs\nI imagine if you could contribute much more to your four one K.

Boston I'm In my heart radio station [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWell go back to coast to coast rubber ... with us we'll get your calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there are vying to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\nWhat I say China right now I'm is about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven [noise] um I mean in terms of manned space flight you know they've been earth orbit\nMe there are a bit beyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon\nCourse on the other hand they did launch a small space station which we did not have them\nAnd do they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon ...\nUm they can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay it's once again I'm\n... there's a new paradigm now and ... these entrepreneurial space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can do in one third the time at one tenth the cost and if uh other countries have gone to uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access\nNational space program so not going to be able to match them and um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms\nWith understanding that they're going to need to have rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals\nWhole industries for people because um eat no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so if ... once Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity\nOr if you're going to be a first class power much right now you have to be first class in space um Russia's going to have to change and it's interesting I mean\nYou know a a a reason is still coming in a certain I mean ... ... the reason why the um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was and the twentieth century ... illiterate armies can no longer cut it well\nThey're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways\nAnd um so that's another good thing that a ... for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact of the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it\nIn a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll of us who you hire them to do that well\nYeah well it states that one weapons okay I mean because what after all is a state but it is\nA a military force that exists well ah the presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near\nMonopoly on force and um the you know um but no I I don't think ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just the uh the rich that get to go to Mars well\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um and also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm\nIncreasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiff full okay to go [noise]\nAnd um you know the ... the once upon a time\nYou really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into [noise] and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds uh they launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not feel\nIf you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a\n... you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah you know knock you on Musk office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion to orbit\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel [noise] um [noise]\nWell um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary

American deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead I'm okay All right well here's the thing\nUm [noise]\nThere there is an intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and you can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this\nAnd and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that while we did destroy some things that were worthwhile we created much more\nAnd I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no\nBuys in hurts there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks um nobody be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to

prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans the mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point uh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to\nState mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions are being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because\nIt's a mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now [noise] ah it has some value and uh and and and the exchange\nFor those claims that people could get a exploration missions finance mine the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable [noise]\nW arcane [noise] if

psychologist residing in the north eastern section about while\nHe has a graduate degree in political constantly from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on\nE. and maps environmental sensitivity and ghostly encounters Brandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the ghost studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to George I'm excited to\nI got shot at a clinical therapist get involved and go studies\n[laughter] well actually I was interested in a psychology\nOr I was actually a clinical therapist\nYeah so I actually I actually got a day job and then I studied the parents psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that\n[laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well [laughter]\nThat's good well let's see they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when I was at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to die just store shelves in the Gulf studies for what he was an overview of what you've been doing random\n[noise] well um you know I ah I have a degree in Paris psychology or when I was at the University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically at the environmental sensitivity and goats encounters um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the clinical part of things\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going in and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with a ghost studies\nAnd you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's it's um no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining ghostly encounters\nOr oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as hallucinations interpretations are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes so individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with\nTelevision shows to provide insight into these life altering experiences\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who were looking for things OR Books with more than just go stories tales of locations are outdated views\nUm and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life ghost encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights in the cause of these throwing encounters\nUm it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief or even experience and you know and you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years\nAnd it's and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspectives on these things and that's what the book really goes over\nYou know there are several firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters um you know I spent years just getting firsthand accounts going to anyone he would talk to me about goes down awful conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's when I came up with some of these new theories\nAre and that's when I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thoughts and I also review the ... the the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters with a book\nWell then you bring a dose of real science to the picture I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you just got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology a fitness a physics\nThey're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and I'm\nEntanglement and non locality and\nHow electricity affects us and I'm a ... and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just\nYou know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWould have you concluded brand new about what the ... experience might be for real big into their imagination what do you think so\nI actually think a majority of the ghost they encountered that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to ghostly encounters it's such a complex process and there's so many variables going on\nUm you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on um but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine\nAnd um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes the one of the hill\nI think there's I'm\nMy in my view I take them more by side based view on goes\nSo that's um inside is basically um pull up at the ... century perception those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of goes link counters that happen out there\nUm the base of it has to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em\nAre coming and being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on\nMy main theories in the book go over um what I call a uh tell a path distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters a so I really think that um people's ... the ... is a real or it was a real important part of a ghostly encounter\nHow important than the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghostly encounters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm\nA death or life threatening events\nOr some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happen after that and one of those things is um\nYou know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it and it and that leads to sort of these by energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to send\nA distress signal to somebody else and and the great classic example of this is the crisis aberration\nAll right so we probably heard of these\nThis is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an aberration of my aunt and she says\nYou know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you\nKnow my aunt passed away right on time that I had that\nRight and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying

not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWould environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee\nAnd Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and um you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste\nAnd smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is I'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the

enter into our universe I'm so in this example the witness in a sense was able to access the previous timer dimension universe\nAnd she was able to look back and see what's happening that location and maybe the child and the mom saw this woman dressed and futuristic cool futuristic clothing and got terrified and ran away so it's almost like a glimpse into something else\nAnd a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nYou ever when you're doing these ah these studies\nHave you ever encountered something we're even scared to death\nI'm personally no I haven't been scared that legit I had an experience I'm a I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio\nAnd um [noise] oh one morning I'm Me and my wife was out of town and I'm One morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon\nAnd I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching they get outside\nSo I'm like yeah\nWell you know my scientific brains going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it you know and I'm like you know when I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this so I opened the door the dog and me went outside in the backyard and she's sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating\nAnd I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and somehow um you know drowned in\nThere like you know building upon you know all that stuff [laughter] but I Am to myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary\nBut something drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing and I never got that feeling that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd was there is some sort of like distress signal sense to me with the cat and distress and that kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen there it's really an amazing experience\nHow many pure noble experiences recruit Brendan because the person who\nDied comes back\nNever had some ... business and had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI you know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there of ghostly encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the staff of a father or something you\nKnow I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\nThe the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion of plan to sort of ...\nWound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through ...\nOh man you might use unconventional me you know and if if collective unconscious or collective consciousness exist and memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are store to store it in the atmosphere um it might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be fat I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think the thing I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debt spouse one month after their death I'm a\nPretty high number eighty percent it's huge yeah yeah\nYeah ... and perhaps the bereavement operations er visits from the deceive shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual and perhaps ... could be sort of a way\nA process emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the disease couldn't help but to move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards the revolution and ... ... and when I talk to the these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease\nOr accepting of a loved one death after the evaporation and\nI think on TV usually go negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive um it can come out of it goes by and counter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is um something to look forward to this is not a negative and demons and things like that\nBrand and what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these kinds of preparations and encounters than others what's so special about though\n[noise] [noise] that is a that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think [noise] you know something narrow biological is different about them\nYou know when they put 'em there's there's a pet out there specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nThat I Would like human magnets or something or\nYeah yeah exactly you know the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing that this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's some some really unique experimental design that\nUm you know where they're actually doing that from our FM our eyes any jeeze and what they're finding is their their brain it actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity at very low levels\nSo there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can you know so and this is true for but then we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that arise as well so you you know you know I might get\nPoked with um a pan and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really that it\nDoesn't hurt at all say what those brand and we're going to talk more when we come back we'll also take phone calls get another couple of stories of uh some of your

the ghost studies what are your colleagues say about your work branded if anything\n[noise] [noise] you know most people actually when they find out that you wrote a book about goes are interested in it than most people will tell me a story\nAnd they've all got one don't think they do and I was really shocked you know it kind of sit back and kind of way when you put yourself out there publicly but it's really been positive\nThere's a there's still some colleagues who come up to me and go you know I don't tell me a story but then they you know follow it up with but you can't tell anyone or anything like that but the response has been pretty positive\nI'm you know if it's something that's really fascinating and it's I mean it's a mystery and it's been intriguing for human\nSince you know the dawn of time you know there's this go stuff [noise] um\nSo ... you know it's not that bizarre or out of context\nAnd listen I mean parents psychology is a subset of psychology it's a legitimate discipline just like social psychology and neuro psychology it's an academic field you know the University of Edinburgh or I studied as a top twenty five university\nThey are the ones the clone sheep and the nineties Charles Darwin went there and they have a whole department dedicated to studying pair psychology or paranormal phenomenon which is for those of us in the field it's you know that's a great thing it's taken seriously for a lot of people\nWhat's out there that has baffled you show for brand didn't that you don't have the answer you wish you did\n[noise] ah well I'll be honest with you I think or any type of um holds her guys activity or recurrent spontaneous psycho ... says\nWe're objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on and those types of cases\nYou know do humans have the ability to move objects if they're\nUm in distress um you know to me it's hard to fathom you have the ability of like where the poultry guys I'm a you know we'll call it a ghost moving objects when they can't physically touch them and things like that I really don't know the answers to that\nUm so you know it it's it's something I always read about and I go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nWhy new rules seemed to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMission is to give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours I could not fall asleep and I could not understand why I was very anxious and felt as if something was not right without warning soft glowing light appeared next to my bad\nLight gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband he did not say anything and appear to be just staring at me what was bizarre was that I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious\nThe next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child standing my accent die the night before unexpectedly\nHis death occurred around the same time I saw the image in my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time\nSo this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked\nAbout earlier so we've all heard of these but it illustrates the role of a lot but the or a sigh phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing intense emotional shift related to the process of dying in a in a way sent a hello Patrick distress message to their ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witnessed I'm the typical soft glowing light operation a those types of things um and what's really fascinating is since his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or telepathy or ... phenomenon my suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of a in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment\nA message tell a path ugly if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the wife\nMay know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well\nBut this is a great example of a crisis aberration side phenomenon but it also bags that question you know was this did this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment 'cause obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do this well\nOh yeah yeah I mean it's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal and I'm a ghostly encounters electricity and it seems to be\nYou know it was the most prevalent things but the the idea is I mean listen we're we all think electricity comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but you know electricity electrical fields comes from humans as well an animal\nShe does show you know any involvement of humans also includes the involvement of electricity because like your city is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nFrom people who walked by street lights and the lights go wild as they get on a on a range the lights go back on\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone who's walking around in a way\nUm so it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only Constand an all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being president to sort of experience that operation a Pulitzer guy so an eerie feeling a temperature change an uneasiness or whatever\nSo for humans always present electricity electrical fields magnetic field they're always president as well since since the first ghostly encounter ever um you know ... and that's an important thing to think about\nYou know we're always immersed in electromagnetic fields we can avoid them you know as as part of earth that's what it is\nYou know and the Mets have always been linked you know there's some research saying that you know abnormal or fluctuating am apps can actually cause\nA ghostly encounters um you know sort of trick the brain into thinking you're having a ghostly encounter on the other side of that\nThere was this idea that you know electromagnetic fields have to do with with ghosts and goes the encounters and you know every TV show and paranormal investigator team uses a EMS meter and that's an important part of the for them indicating that it goes to this president you know for the EMS as moving haphazardly through the house like a person walking\nThe belief is obviously the fast food goes uh whereas if you have a fluctuating he amassed next to a dishwasher you can probably say well that's a dishwasher [laughter] um so\nYou know energy electricity electromagnetic fields\nVery cool very entangled with ghostly encounters even when I hear these real life goes to encounter some people will say you know uh I just felt like you know my hair was standing up for I felt the room felt energized or like there was it felt like a\nOf electricity in the air or you know I reached towards the operation in my hand felt like it was shot you know those types of things are always comment as well\nGo to Jason in St Louis Missouri things started hey Jay going in the\nMorning George yeah Brian question or do you believe that spirit guide you in walls and listen and watch what we're seeing in and do we\nDo they hide in ... ... ...\nYou know I I don't think so you know and and then this is obviously just my opinion um there's no way to definitely prove this but but I don't see it goes that sort of I'm\nHanging around all day watching us you know like a TV um I I see the ghostly encounters and paranormal experiences happening at certain times in certain events for certain reasons like the the Halloween thing we talked about before there's some sort of need for that interaction\nAnd and sometimes when people have interaction where there isn't a need it's more people sort of like we talked about linking up to the environment and having an experience of some guy\nYou know there's that intelligent hunting that's sort of like the cream of the crop you know those types of things are harder to explain in and sometimes that falls into an earth balance spirit but I don't I don't necessarily think they hang around in the walls and kind of watch us in the way\nUm you know just like when we walk into a honey building it's not like a zoo where we have to you\nYou remember when mom and dad used to store here our\nDo stuff was no good for you stumped stuff was dangerous\nAnd some stuff they just sort of do for themselves also let us sort through the mid
