Canada game of Thrones films all over the world\nRight there's a lot of sense of films in Canada because they avoid some level of uh I don't know if it's union or whatever it is there's a lot of cost savings for film that and\nThen there's a lot of places are a lot of states where they're offering a different tax incentives to encourage\nFills your enough that's mayor here in this other story Sarah what are your thoughts here I mean do you think this is a going to change things for Albuquerque make things better\nWell I mean you'd think that'd be that I listed at age ... yeah they get\nThere because people are going to get jobs and so therefore they don't do you feel like they wouldn't have to steal things\n[laughter] survey and that that I guess that's probably\nTrue I think that's absolutely true um however I don't know if Netflix is going to be hiring the copper wires ...\nAnd a thousand ... it says creating a thousand jobs annually\nThat doesn't necessarily mean that every year there's going to be another thousand people so that at the end of ten years it's ten thousand people it could be that they're hiring people for one year contracts\nAnd they keep hiring the same thousand people and there's a good chance that people are just relieved that a lot of the the are also temporary jobs sure you get a job working on this particular show and then that shows died and then somebody else comes leave and go somewhere else and then they hire somebody for another show there are things for the\nCall tonight appreciate it it's a we have been talking about Netflix not tonight but on just over time and uh how they're providing real competition Hollywood and that's why Hollywood doesn't like them they're doing things differently than Hollywood has done things they're releasing television shows all in one batch\nRight so instead of like what HBO or Showtime or ABC or Fox where traditionally they would release one show per week or one show per day depending on the kind of show it is\nA Netflix just produces a whole bachelor shows and releases the entire season all at once\nYeah it's it's interesting certain aspects of a Netflix and how they've ah got about like trying to eliminate a\nCertain ... ah like they used to be you had to\nBuy the rights within a given territory for a a movie to to show it\nSure and ethics has kinda gone and said we don't want to do that we want to be able to you know or I'll give people worldwide access to really they don't have restrictions or for certain\nPrograms they have they been working towards eliminating a it for them yeah territorial rights and and they only going or moving towards more and obviously they can do this with their inhouse content Cher\nAnd but they can't do that in many cases with her external content and so they actually licensing a number of movies that have been declining and I don't know I I get the impression that's partially because they're they're trying to move away from\nWell bless you know some of the other companies are trying to um start their own services so I heard now I don't know if they've done it yet but I've heard that Disney head what Disney yet and um and\nSo therefore Disney will then cancel all their agreements with the Netflix is of the world who lose or whatever and they'll say if you want to see the black cauldron or whatever you know all that and uh you'll have to go to the Disney streaming right pay whatever Disney's rates are so that way Disney can make all the money off of that rather than whatever\nEvidence that as I understand that there is a little bit of the Disney content that will still be on whatever the other streaming platform is a really just because of the existing no because of existing agreements recall on those run out because the ABC old Disney and so\nYeah they can't move everything because we're existing\nOkay yeah you gotta literally agreement on right now but ... over the next five years or however long they're going to be those are going to go away so if you want to comment You're welcome to here we are going to the phones to your calls dodge Joseph is on the line in Missouri you're on TALK lab watching us

they're hearing to just be\nI don't know if they're renting yeah uh I haven't been able to find that detail\nOr but apparently this you know new acquisition is going to open up\nA and New Mexico obviously where Breaking Bad was filmed waiter medical saw was filmed\nSo Neil ... take place in in that you know ... is there are things that take place in New York City that are filmed on a lot in\n... and ... or ... or what but a New Mexico as I understand it is one of those states that has offered the various tax breaks and incentives to get a movie studios in TV studios to film\nIn their state apparently law um Los Angeles has a lottery based incentive program to gets production based in LA next week Netflix is chief content officer Ted surrender said\nThat Netflix would not be like other studios and chased tax incentives to New York Atlanta in other cities around the globe whereas math and the rest of Hollywood revolves around getting twenty five thirty five percent back\nOn below the line production costs a surrenders indicated that keeping talent and filmmakers close to their families and homes will say Netflix core value\nFor three years Netflix spent top dollar to attract top talent in I. T. building a deep slate of original content that made it a must own subscription service and you know it's true I mean they look I haven't even seen\nMuch at all of the Netflix content but the content I have seen I did watch the stranger things or watched both seasons of that and I really liked it I mean I thought it was I mean there was nothing bad you could really say about it it was fantastic\nArticle from diverge says locking down the studio that Albuquerque studio will allow Netflix to be even more efficient and flexible with its original content production again this facility nine stages over one hundred and Seventy thousand square feet\nA was actually the studio where better call soul has now been filled and the Avengers a they say that this is you know again going to allow them to\nBe more efficient and compete with the Amazon Prime Hulu and Disney and apparently Netflix\nHas spent eight billion dollars\nJust in twenty Eighteen creating early adult onset and apparently this guy for Netflix saying they weren't gonna chase tax incentives well turns out they did chase taxes [laughter] this article because apparently there's a bunch of 'em in Albuquerque and Yelp New Mexico so they said one thing than they did another but anybody surprised about that nope no see tomorrow\nFor a while and how fast as hard and body extract work to improve blood circulation listen\nMy name is Alison I'm sixty six years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries had Seventy percent blockage in one large relating to my heart and they wanted me to go on ... but I refused to negative side effects\nOf body extracting the unique balance energy and proportionate herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around Ninety five percent at the level\nWithin the first month I saw the dramatic difference in my legs which produced in a way too much I felt completely normal\nNatural organic herbal formula for heart health is high and body extract\nPart about it actually comes within one hundred percent ironclad night that guarantee detail that H.

Institute in Virginia\nAnd William cells as a certified therapist and he guides you do these incredible states of consciousness and I personally know that they exist from my experience that love to hear more\nFrom William welcome to the show and\nThanks for joining me William\nHow are you feeling good aid\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create such assistance such a a a out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience it goes back to Nineteen Seventy three\nAnd I was not a believer in the should be possible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it he was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was a message to self initiate and out of body experience so\nI ordered them and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily\nExercise um I initiated my first holy conscious out of body\nWas completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your\n... your entire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality has shifted\nOh yeah it is now you had your out of body experience which sounds engage it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise uh that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nWas just before I ask are you became a\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help or negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your hope he will get you go what did you experience how did you know it just for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reach the arm out\nOh no I was nonsensical I I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize and at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examined my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body ... guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking\nI was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here and ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it\nYeah well it's it's it's exciting because you can finally obtained answers for yourself ... ... that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that's around as you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience from in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional when I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them\nAnd you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense ... than at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them\nYeah yes and but you can experience that first hand and that's\nWhat's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I only seeing you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and with all of the tens information the dean dean why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention all at\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human\nAnd it has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not ... it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and you know they're real because usually they heal meal you and he was playing because usually not a language to really clearly defined what an energy mention is\nUniversal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed and all communication is very elegant it's by solved\nAnd there's no need in other words\nLanguage is no longer a barrier we we communicate directly by salt and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here\nThat are symbols and it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere was no um when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can\nDiscover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow your classes you teach them in really tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called it an afro tourism [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great in Virginia I'm only\nTwenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop\nI'm generally what I each person is in a checked unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese acronyms and um\nWhat is that controlled

was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research a matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and ah\nThere's a there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how the remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught any more interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's wouldn't mind near twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nThe online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that's you can tell what is what are you most responding to\nPresident that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done a nice\nBut for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound a spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking\nAnd walking through a wall and a talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that

years of research at them in roe Institute surveyed over sixteen thousand participants who have gone through the OB e training at than than real Institute Virginia\nAnd he's come up with a common reported phenomenon associated with the the ease Cleveland was wondering if you could explain some of this to our audience [noise]\n[noise] yes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe\nInstitute for the last ... years oh okay but I've been\nNursing practice you know for forty or just to go on my website ... dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did a number of surveys and I receive six\nTen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were having\nWere so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations eighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally\nTo the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset of Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched\nThat was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone and that is seen through closed islets if you're seen through\nYour clothes die lives at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body\nBecause you're having it does it mean you've actually did your body but it'd be injured in the process but most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things that\nFor instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body right is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nSo that that I see them on because that happened I'm retired I Will switch and I think his muscles and ... are you saying that now the money you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have\nFound and what many other um experiences have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body sets with sleep is\nMhm we take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint but what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating on the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a slate\nAnd you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\n... image you're looking at it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream began or they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences are is natural was breathing and think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... bc\nTemporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't have any biological ... machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay and most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death\nActually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried Dennis and I'm curious how would you know the difference between now and imagination\n... that's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience or ... and you can have multiple experiences\nFor instance I had I began to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies and I was still learning what was going on and I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning\nAnd I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander\nIn these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in\nA past lives that wasn't on my radar but then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences\nWhere I found myself as a German soldier in World War two\nAnd I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in experiential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOf what's going on ...\nAnd I think this is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated ... anyone other than you are\nRight and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAnd very important yes\nBecause all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything left backed up specialty of religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born\nIn India ah ... it had been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real\nAnd look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this ... and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you after you experience it menu sudden oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... and also\nThe average age first out of body experience have you seen ... years old people recruit recount painting and it's often heated experience it happens over and over again but he declines during early teenage years why do you think that is so they sent you forget that\nI don't know better you the me take the chance to a

San Pedro or the empty or\nIt doesn't matter how you and do the experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences that's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs\nAnd to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based\nA belief systems that have no reality to them but if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative entered its you were going to create it\nWhen your mind is going to mold the reality around you if you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever\nThen you're going to manifest that is well well\nWe are creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment\nAnd you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but the it's the truth [noise]\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a specific dream I guess I don't remember but it could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got up and let her cycle and took off your helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that um\nBrides or owns a motorcycle and\nIt was as it woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who was and it wasn't a protection of anything and it was when I was no there wasn't a premonition of anything that happened it just isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nLooks pretty bleak to be honest and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because we care to each other [laughter] yeah I'd I don't know if that\nAn added well out of body travel most likely mhm\nWell it could have banned but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there is no consensus reality there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the\nConsensus realities are created by a collective\nGroup of individuals that all agree on a reality and they create I Try called consensus there's many types of reality that exist in\nIn our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to start to learn these what is essentially the rules of non physical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to linear time right at the gravity we're used to they are yeah when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity all the things we're used to have to you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm In my workshops but it's also in my book but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing existence\nYes that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they well thank you so much Williams has been great if you go to his website which is an astral info dot org you'll find out about all of his books and his courses in classes and there's lots of free information there as well\nAnd when we come back we're going to talk about ghosts of Colorado and some of the great history but the forgotten entails is Colorado Sylvie back I only see value listening to cook because I Am\n\nWe've got a big weekend in sports around here of Eby\nSocks obviously ...

I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future\nBut what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was\nSo I'm able to do things like that um\nBut I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast and managed to Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tours\nAnd I open my big huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nDid you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this\nWe are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands so my entire family a move to Colorado and bought\nAn old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast and I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about\nFinancing the home for you and that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts vile I just loved it and um when we\nBought it it was really rundown [laughter] extremely\nRun down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down\nBut I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for and we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house in five years after five years we could do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house ... what have you\nWell after us and you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and an artist you know and it's\nVery iffy that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going roe [laughter] yes\nSo I actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this is before she died and then he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know\nIt's too high of an altitude song about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much so I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest the state so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything\nLike that while I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was epic\nMy goodness you know things fall out we we everything\nIn the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait\nWell the ghost of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nThose shows\n...

to coast am I guess is Stephanie waters and she is not only a professional to each other as we can tell but she's also the owner of the blue moon hunted histories tours in Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you when we were just talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're ... in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nYeah um I think another reason why I'm that people were drawn\nTo manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because\nOriginally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down\nAnd that those just gone it worked\nShe'll be manager confirmed that snow\nYet all of this worked up beautifully [laughter] than eating now had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was amazing during the time before the book\nYes oh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said\nHer job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand six team because this theater had just been sold\nTo the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball in this book was reaching out that's partly trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their story\nThat yes but you seem to be the\nYou like the ... for the east coast today [laughter] you I have made it is it's meant to be one you have no way really connecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live go go under\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's hard to buy the goes but like all the little girl that bounces a ball isn't she do I'm like no leave in ... but listen friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere is no devious fund spirited no\nNo that's not if they are they're just kicking you studying you trick or it's here they are\nIn prison here by their own their own their own minds they're they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during my time so yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the veil as the dentist and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely a big believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not\nYou know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the ghost that come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning\nBut I find the best time to actually look for those of you wants to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nThe transition time why it's\n... it's because of the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter it lends itself to the shadows does that make sense\nYes it does it make strapped when you see the shadow people and the light changes very fast rate and it\nOnly I call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and then the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks in the end of the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is a place that you're living in now haunted or did you met with non on ... and the gas goes follow you right yes\nThey do on line two words it's very funny see I've been doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten [laughter]\nJust kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that\nBut this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and managed to her on a timer because whenever I was walking her name's ... by they would go out when I was talking about certain goes you know the certain locations\nAnd then they might find says well why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said\nYeah that's true [laughter] so they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights flash this town is very hunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even Boulder when you walk around there and then went there once a month and doing doing uh my show in the ... if you just look at the top of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nTo you too I mean I heard that sometimes it just happens to some people at the tripping out the lights\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd and the uh did you notice that would happen to other people too or just you I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah ... I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause they'll think you're psychotic they're like oh\nYou're trying to say it's happening at well so\nThey're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do all kinds of magic kept them no really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that are there\nAre there other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and managed to springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and that's the essence\nPart right there oh yeah the you know the family hotel right there on that a native ... very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a a there's a [noise]\nI heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down\nOn managing springs and bolder and even at the heart with ... with the infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see light up\nLight up with the red energy I find that very interesting and you know the natives used to call this the sign of the ... the spine of the earth with the Rocky Mountains very thick with land it very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine and you're right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of the of the pikes peak they believe was the naval at the end of her I find that fascinating because maybe it's a portal\n[noise] you know that's what I was going to ask you know why is what we need to get into this this is very funny I Love that stuff pikes peak it's very popular\nAnd it has a lot of um a lot of stories around it and I hope that I Know that you've written a lot about this and you can tell us about it and um we're going to take a break in just a minute maybe you can tell us a little bit about it after the break okay now the name of your book again is called the ... latest one you have for\nAt five five it all came about after cancer was on my bucket list I'm a big believer in manifestation\nAnd you find now and wine and it's wonderful and I'm so grateful for God thank you for asking\n[laughter] All right we're going to come back and find out about heat from you [laughter] All right my guess is definitely waters and we will be right back I'm ... and you're listening to coast to coast\nDum\n\nDum\n\nWe got a big weekend in sports around here Phoebe\nShocks obviously born that Sunday night we'll be talking with them on the morning for sure and the board of politics people talk about that Monday morning as well because the weekend\nWe'll talk to you again on Monday Mornings exam have a great weekend everybody\nHumans DVD weekday morning six we've had a little boy so Boston\nW.

Boston in a heart radio station\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am my guest is Stephanie waters and we're talking about Colorado legends and lower and when we were talking a little bit before the break about pikes peak now there's many places in the world that have lots of legends lure but this particular one because\nA lot it's considered one of the\nMore usual places in the world as well as um because of its kind of rich waters and mineral rich area in that particular region of the u._s. can you tell us a little bit about your experience Tiffany ... you know about the beach\n[noise] well um pikes peak I think it was called T T E v a ... or ... I think that's what the native youths used to call it\nBut they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe I just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nOne why we've called that connected to the mother okay yeah\nIt's connected to the mother and think about the native as the way they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get\nUm father sky Mother Earth ... and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThat and the natives knew that if the of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it um during the pikes peak gold fresh\nUh produced more goals than any place in the whole world I Hope I have that right but I'm sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well\nYeah and if you I Love the show ancient aliens and they talked about that that we have a lot of UFO sightings over pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on the ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the all metal mining camp\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers to fly over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHearing cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that saw us so when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon it was clear day lied\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships\nAnd they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards of by the time it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is amazing and they were hungry and they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally\nBefore there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating 'cause it's even today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brush it off as being an airplane but this was before we had\nOur governor ... experiment gone exactly exactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the the ... mhm theoretically\nSack played up and down sideways ring you know like a helicopter ... a fascinating and they didn't know what to they there was no explanation now so what I did was I followed that I followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine\nYou would not there it's a lot of people out\nYet but a lot of people thought this I mean just outrageously\nCrazy and he found his story we're in\nKansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing\nAnd the story was consistent\nVery much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's\nThere was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the worldwide Web could possibly know when farmers in Colorado are saying that I mean this was amazing back then you know um what we you know that we've had the telegraph\nOf them do you think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals there to conduit for a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as the director of the paranormal conventions and one of my friends is named Dan ... and he lives in green mountain falls Colorado\nAnd um which is right underneath pikes peak and um he saw a big foot or come to his back door opened his door actually um [noise]\nHe um the big foot actually rubbed at the high neon his screen door and he actually had some big hair [laughter] and um then has really committed his entire life to the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal\nAnd he does live above green mountain falls back in these rock formations and there's Petra clips and the rocks and I've been back there with him and all of this myself\nAnd I believe it's possible you know a lot of you might not\nHave you seen in the writing\nA he believes that my friend ... ... if it's um you know it's like stick figures I find this fascinating because they are elongated just a straight line a stick you know with too little like a triangle at the bottom and then a triangle on the top\nAnd then these long arms with triangles on the bottom of it it's very geometric looking it's it's fascinating and my friend actually believes that his property is a poor hole\nWhere big foot is traveling ... and I know it might sound outrageous but why not consider\nThe possibility that may be big foot is a missing link maybe\nAnd maybe ... maybe he's coming in and out or maybe we're seeing I'm mainly seen something that happened and another time a long time ago I don't know [laughter]\nWell tell me ... how do you feel that the Native Americans feel about this uh these stories and go and the legends and so forth that isn't being reported on by Native American\nWell this is great that you brought up this question again to you'd think like a researcher because that's what I Am and I'm like well why don't we have more stories and that's because nobody was looking under the name of course like a Native Americans wouldn't have called this preacher big foot now would say [laughter]\nI wouldn't have gone Chinese with no\nThere there was a hundred and fifty four different names\nBy the ... Native American Indians depending on where they lived in the Rockies were they relocated a hundred and fifty four different names that's why we had a communication problem here I mean I can think of a few names right off the hand that I mean\nThat's why I'm doing research on this was so fascinating it open so many doors for me I went oh my gosh now this story makes sense now this story makes sense you know if all of a thing being once we decide on a name you know sasquatch I think most big foot tall it just like to call it\nUm you know that is just a name that it's been come up with in the last few years I mean relatively speaking maybe fifty years I don't know\nI yeah I I'm but I my question more it's more about the hotter the Native Americans feel and the people feel about these places that are being built on the manager she springs area and garden of the gods and the areas near pikes peak\nWhere that is really very interesting and the other good question because the the the legend is that our town is constantly flooded baptized by water every seven years and so it seems to be true now I looked into this and I'm like going All right\nMe because you work here and that wouldn't be fair to listen for your chance so that sounds in dollars on the voice of Boston W.
