Bush um Ronald Reagan when he was very disappointed the game the amnesty to about two point seven million of the illegal aliens at the time it was maybe maybe six and then he was disappointed because he thought that the border security would be taken care of by that no one\nNo so here are just more yeah\nSo I mean or even the ones who and then then when Bush was president they couldn't get a bill through um there there was much tougher than Obama but it still wasn't good enough I mean this is the first time since ... an hour the boardroom for someone who's thinking boys will be Trump\nRight I was the last president to do it\nAnd you know all this all this stuff that's been happening up up in Portland also you know what the Portland police standing down to antifa at there's a lot of illegal alien crime up in Oregon my a lot\nAnd um it's it's pretty much the sanctuary state but it's still liberal there in Portland and one thing that I Want to I Want to make sure that your listeners understand you know the share of our elected by the people there they uphold the constitution allows that this country um\nThe police department in every city\nAre directed by the mayor and the city council of how they will conduct there\nThe police departments policies are and so the marathon Portland\nI'm ... wheeler can't one directing and he's also the police commissioner on top of that is on his directing nice police officers that how they will and and and won't react to things that are going on how they will and won't and illegal alien to cooperate with the federal\nLaw that with ice and stuff out there in Oregon and Portland but\nUm when you have a police officer has taken an oath to protect the citizens of there's eight and their studies\nAnd then their hands are tied by in there and the city council thanks very policies on their mind and that's the way they want to direct their police department to handle things\nQuantities police officers around and think at the end by him and and think that the struggle that they go every day when they when they put their uniform on and now they're walking out the door and they're going to have to deal with\nSanctuary policies that's completely one hundred percent against their beliefs I mean I cannot believe the struggle that our police officers are facing on a daily basis\nYou know this is um the nearest sun no live with it I mean he was one of the people who did as a police officer and the officers did they do it but now they want to get rid of vice of course which is another nightmare we could we spend hours talking about that as well but the bottom line is\nI think what's happening with this migration is that\nIt's having the same effect\nI Believe as the fire hoses had when they were turned on Dr King and a doctor Abernathy and the the leadership\nOf the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and all of the others\nAre in that movement who were marching when the American people saw that I mean it sometimes takes visuals people don't understand\nWhen when that was seen it in ... was the ultimate motivator to create civil rights laws that had not existed and it seems to me that what's happening now with people watching thousands trying to enter our country illegally um the ... of that\nI think it's having perhaps the same effect and this election will hopefully reflect that\nSo that we can get back to protecting the border and the president can get the support in Congress to build the wall\nYou know what is the national guard you know thirty seconds so real quickly please go ahead\nOn the national guards not going to be able to do anything and and sending eight hundred active military men down there that they for Congress to even have military action on our borders though it's very scary and I think that liberals are setting them up to make a decision to protect the American citizens that will enable them to pulling out of office\nI mean it's it's really a spread the edge of a cliff right now and I just I'm pleading with my fellow Americans to vote the right way and vote your conscience and now the ... year life matters as much as my son's life matter to me and uh we need to get the right politician from DC to clean this mess that\nIt's always a pleasure Mary Ann thank you for being with us a Godspeed and have a great press conference to appreciate your time thinking

tomorrow night the uh the book that I think you will love hear the story of the men from the train\nOr as scary as that story is um it's still not as scary in some respects to some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael Guillen will ... joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd\nIf you go to coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also the ah the story about the small town which claims to be the most haunting to place in America\nAnd uh and when cameras\nCaptured ghosts all of those stories are in the news segment and coast to coast am dot com but there's also this other story on the top of the fold right in the carousel on the top of the website and coast to coast am dot com and that's this string of play a little bit of it here\nGive me a heads up on it 'cause I'd love to get

who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked ... uh uh\nUh later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the lead group\nOf science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I mean I I\nI I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific tell me and\nShe's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff a ... or packing for Mars and wish she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list them urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know if you'll pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I tried to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America Tony hunting Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that I Walk with me had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories are thought and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that like old school um what I ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto it very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can uh can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with the four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAgo and I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to up load thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even

Boston in my heart radio station [noise]\n\n\nMichael Steele and former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is ah is this is great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which might be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics\nThey were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryers and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of\nUh trying to get their hands on some DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of at all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're going to trade in other words we are flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining\nThe natural flow were to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yet none I I forget what it was\nThe Marshall was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right\nYeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for us right but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a\nPrice and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution right where we do that if we take it on or who who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen\nRobots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um I tell this\nStory about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the song but he recently applied to the our son was granted I'm\nA tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence and you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look\nInto what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots powered by artificial\nIntelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity\nThey they they are in effect God because they know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because it's gone\nIs that this technology we're creating well run amok\nAnd you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYou know there was one small right in artificial intelligence now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall man\nI mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there is no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about or we want spoke about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button it up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small but\nYou know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours at the day of the singularity that's for the day and all and ... when they will have the equipment I you you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so yeah and that\nI think the interesting these are the two is it that the equation is let's use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know accusing it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo I like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose it you lose a yeah no but I talk\nAbout I think I caught one guy that that you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquer the phrasing with that the right now I fully believe that completely and it and let's pick this up coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships [noise]\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile then people would like to think it cannot stand all the things we will be throwing added in the future we'll get back to that thought with Michael Guillen last shooting the numbers coming up and about thirty minutes for you to join the conversation\nAnd then it's open lines for the rest of the night a coast to coast am\nIn for George Nouri fuzzy and fun [noise]\n\nDb

Boston in a heart radio station [noise]\n\n[noise]\nI wouldn't be here to leave some time to talk about future of pride to see where we rest right now at this frontier of all of this home technology with Michael Guillen in a moment but I I wanted to wrap up\nThe conversation about uh about trends humans as you talk about them in the book people who are becoming part of something else or used to call 'em enhanced Smith from technology\nYou'll be able to compensate for 'em either for injury or for a deformity um and there's a couple of those that are very entertaining like the guy with the built invite breeder and some of the other stuff that's\nIn the book but the part of thought that was really interesting and I just I wanted to mention that because I I I think they're this idea the eggs those skeleton I'm ... I Know several people who have a ... who has\nA trouble walking or the lost their ability to walk in the spinal injuries and and this to them is a dream I mean the I ... just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... their muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three ...\nI I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a but where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that yeah the the discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's there's actually\nA movement a called the trans human movement where as you say they are the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there's where a ball and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of the sky from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he'd lost both arms to the vet them right off\nNow here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life\nKnow of severely crippled and and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms\nYou know that we're mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you know these are these are arms\nThat he can move with his thought that they're they're wired to his\nMind and I to me than fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and maybe even end um [noise] even in the military setting\nI mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there you know where you know write it just it just it it you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that I mean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we could come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that decades weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and I ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about maybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free\nIs that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then in ... new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff soon or using neural net says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment ago in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race right yeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know\nAll this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we had our just still the same you know so oh our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose\nTo you maybe the biggest problem we would face in the love you know unintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor ...\nNot the Terminator conundrum but to Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism ...\nYou know I mean that's that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending Terminator but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nOr at his weaknesses but but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientist I'm reminded of the story about the the\nScientist that want to put a a a a new had an old head on a new body\nRight yeah yeah okay well we had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween e kind of moments right there were like All right now there's\nThis is this is one of those ... nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I could understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit [noise]\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have so up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nUh by that

Boston in a heart radio station [noise]\n\n\nMichael before we start getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before we get because I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [laughter]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a face woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the husband\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah yeah\nThey won't have soles God didn't make them they will have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like no they weren't [laughter] so I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where a great science writing and science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not\nFor us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because\nBy that time [laughter] beds and they're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into our DNA that when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be on the ... the the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will yeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug for an up and down there I think the question you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a ... fine it says that they will pray that they would die\nAnd they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in the stones to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this period that you're talking where we've achieved and more\nHello this is this is an interesting premise again is whether it's immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\n[noise] well it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse or some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nAh and and so I I'd I'd love to think more about this reference the revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does\nDoes a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of um of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot ... ... we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot\nBut get so complex and so the ... on the you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you\nCannot unplug it yeah [laughter] you know it's like the guy now running it's like running on on\nEnergy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the word friend saying or for the crush souls of the people in stumps on on you know getting I think you get some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know the ... piece of machinery is going great stuff\nStop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so Jack Lew actor is exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject\nOf immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona and coast to coast am David\nYeah hey my question for example and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing me because it sounds like a really good question yeah they do we just leave them and we just left\nA oh no Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh enjoy your show but uh I've been on it kicking machine going on forty five years ... macular degeneration and like you know from your guest or when you feel that the shoe\nWill be overcome to Christ or or a maybe a journey either by paying I'll take my answer off the air\nHanging there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machinery and\nHe's on dialysis is on kidney machines and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people fight with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman who had the operation and you know even though her fight\nIt's still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are is already working on a second generation\nA that will help actually restore\nSight and people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these primarily a there's a lot of great research and I've reported\nOn for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell or ... it might\nCreate a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left ended with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your

and the moving jar if you didn't here's the story on coast to coast am wrote down\nDowntown Oregon City here are here it's just like at least that's the theory\nBehind paranormal activity witness that fine zero treat a can of his dispensary what's going to happen now\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy Gomez next to it\nI thought it was happening and I felt like somebody was standing there like somebody was right here\nSuddenly the jar falls off the level surface that has happened then Andy remembered the surveillance handling salvage I\nNot long after that this happened watch the Penn ... it's completely skill and no one's around when suddenly depends begin to move\nAnd if you think the videos been doctored as a candidate shop that would be against the law notify state certified many as GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with you as a farm\nIn ... so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there's no real explanation for why there are goes there\nBut that video ... especially ... and the fact that we were really got me was because it's a kind of a shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it as you want to jump in on open lines of the ... let me go to Mike in Charlotte North Carolina on coast to coast to get us started Mike\nBut anything good morning and our job\n[laughter] we're good thank you [laughter]\nYeah Halloween all out of the night the hills right in the

are where nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but I I [noise] it's impossible because we are not God that's all I have to say\nOh it's growing up I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated\nSo a lot of people would say in it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were\nWhy wouldn't it have a soul if other people out there have you know uh other meant if there are other people who have uh the problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease you know we don't see the suddenly they're less human or that they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology on soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about\nTest tube babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi I'm I or world apologize first of all for not less in for five years I don't want to get too much into it but\nUm after ... ... and I I have a couple of things to say on this whole in March ... her saying I'm a revival manner or would it have anything to eat ... that were to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and I said environment now and furthermore\nIn our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first survival situations and there are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know highly compiling surprise for\nFor years to come for for them is\nFamilies with multiple wives with multiple shoulder with multiple multiple and um and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not we are usable and we don't know even with\nTraining we don't know if\nThe supplies what's known somebody in a cave or in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt for the oil light to I'm following scare myself not to\nConsume companies suppliers but just to ... myself and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer\nA myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just hear somebody could even\nHis they themselves and interesting you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster and you don't know it's going to survive that could be a child\nIt could be a twelve year old kid who hasn't had any training on how to use the supplies that are stored up with ... or or wherever I'm\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I ... I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are\nA latter day saints and so I just would be a clear\nFor people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them

and\nWe're marking shall we are looking what else is going to happen that we're missing we're missing all this down on purpose or missing something what is your opinion on that\nWell that's an interesting claim that the the the marches on purpose or coordinated toward us I mean I I think that you'll always see migrations in the long history just bring up the Bible again\nIt is is that we're all immigrants read the Bible says that we we all move 'em and that we you know all of the stories you a lot of the stories revolt from people just trying to get food just trying to move to get food and begging people to allow them to live in in space it has food\nSo I kind of see that as a perpetual thing not something new but you know\nIt is or is there it's if it that's the smoke screen than what's behind it I guess we're supposed to wonder about or are you suggesting that something is going to come from the north um while we're so busy looking south and east is that was that part of your implication\nThat kind of my question I mean all this happening out one show or something else going to happen that we're missing and all a media concentrated in one direction and I just uh I I\nWell I think that's something I I Can't answer but I'd love to let that just flowed out there like All right so I write down what you just said and we'll see maybe a couple of weeks where there's something

need to realize in any discipline uh\nAny discipline that you study whether it be science or whether it be ah the Bible for instance\nUh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a big drink\nAnd the and the Bible as something to be studied and pondered over all three of the model the estate religions from the middle east began their roots what the Bible and and ... the ... the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\nThe and the new this and the new ... the the current New Testament yeah I mean\nThe the story the story of the prophet Jesus and the current is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and ... even the story of the floods the story of Jesus in the car and all of that validates not counting the historical\nValues a historical cruise you know that that line up with a so many of the stores in the Bible a mini the many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because\nA historical value the book uh Daniel is so accurate and ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for Daniel to know as much of the future is he is he did but\nThat that Cruz when you look at the courage there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the the Old Testament and the New Testament this has done so much for humanity you know\nOh I agree I agree we yeah we we stray\nAway from that and people and and people like to take two or three versus\nAn edge a whole right terrible whole book\nOr you know and they'll\nUs called in and you know it's called proved texting and it's a yeah it's\nThere's a there's an old saying I've said it before it goes to goes but as soon as the first in St learned in seminary was that some people\nUm some people rely on a on scripture\nI'm like a drunk leans on a lamppost not so much for illumination but for support\nAnd I think it's the illumination part that I always go for another support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just it sounds like you're a learned guy but\nI did a I'm a I was writing I wrote an article about a ... about the true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told\nAnd I was interested in how many troops on how many murder stories there are in the Bible\nAnd that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that it starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what these murder stories still do\nWhat I found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder\nWith regard to Jesus they where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the Bible in the New Testament the Greek word says kill but actually the word that's often used\nUh the Arabic word is that Jesus was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it and he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot when we think about it in a Judeo Christian\nContext but I'm just throwing that out yet I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I said this do you think that corporate Christianity has a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to build\nA legacies eat do you think that that has hurt us and gotten a so why are from the central message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime there's always the ... been the big difference of shooting a bullet in the name of God or taking a bullet in the name of God\nAnd I'm I'm In the taking the bullet camp [laughter] I'll take the bullet in protecting somebody else I'm a ... you know people go a long way far out of

everything but ah I Believe\nIn in you know seeing wisdom where you\nFind it I I yeah there's a whole lot of wisdom in the Bible and if you read it at the five ...\nUh I I don't see much\nValue but if you look at it is how people were thinking two thousand four thousand years ago\nUm it's fascinating I mean you read genesis and if you\nActually go back and look for you know the garden of Eden
