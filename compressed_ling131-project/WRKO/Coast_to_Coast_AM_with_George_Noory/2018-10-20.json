mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of the items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us\nNational security adviser John Bolton is reportedly uh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the ion ... for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to ... fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that wave tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the um the criteria is violated the criteria and of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going and talking about\nThe possible renewal of the twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because it it should concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons are and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers\nOr this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology\nUm that is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred\nA surface to air missile system\nAnd the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate and I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against show me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their their passions\nFor for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I called in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia\nAnd they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite\nRegimes ah that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir putting\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\n\nIn ... ... kind of money in Boston's

about I'm beginning to do well there are rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why you know the president and the Pentagon\nAnd wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as a true competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military it's economic it's diplomatic ah it's all these other areas that\nShow national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most

those types of things um uses the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of a the success of that\nA country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's leading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there\nUm and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way or they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road

Boston I'm In my heart radio station [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast Richard Sayre it's sitting in for George Norris lake I mean do you live from coast Toronto, Canada affiliate in depth radio news talked ten ten lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis stays with is the book is a lines of evil Russia China the United states\nAnd a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived\nThere had been a ... obviously some older patients with the Russians are particularly\nUm uh well I wouldn't call them Russian regular troops these are more like mercenaries in Syria the United states has certainly encountered or had heated battles with them a there have been some near collisions in the south China Sea was Chinese vessels how do you see this\nOr what is the the danger of this breaking out into all out war and perhaps as you point out morphing into the unfathomable uh the end and then time scenario\nWell certainly the confrontations are on they're up to ... Richard and we had one here recently with the U.S are done Decatur or destroyer\nOr in the grieving reefs in the south China Sea or the Chinese warship came only a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of ... to ... to shut up\nOver um you know the contested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these pilots uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and defense weapons and [laughter]\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers than the practice from that these are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well\nAs the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air is that indicated and of course they have their neighbors to the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or as the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we killed a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we call them and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians white their hands of that even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any in time scenario a it is is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the the dog and mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president oh el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that\nAir to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a seeks to be the leaf and to establish a Calif out and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but you know\nThe release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently\nAh was after great pressure we put on him a air to want to cooperate with us but yet we find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places Kern cologne Germany what was he doing there\nYeah he was doing his state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA and he consistently has had over the years a very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that some\nOf these are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nAnd of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the pitcher to gather you see the Iranians\nCertainly the Turks are sort of our allies the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here not confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to one and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nThat's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her ... her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to\nTake all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait um air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the U.S for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians are they're\nBeing pretty cozy with the Russians of late or the even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the med\nFrom the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to run a and on the coastline there then you can begin to make a\nPlutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants\nAll suddenly ... it's just too rich so the the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO ostensibly use to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that you know because we will not connect our a patriots and other fads to a Russian as four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his his law make a viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nAnd my ... says he was on trial was winning while I wasn't sure if anyone was one of

year in another seven hundred coming up this year a ... is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to the salaries and that's why people often say well gosh you know you know how can the Russians\nIt is part of a governing the country and protecting the country's vital interests around the globe you know the the concern on any covert act activities is\nHow is it going to be controlled governed or what we don't need a rogue agents doing things in the name of our government that you know the national leadership is not aware of\nUm and we've had a a colored history in that regard uh where we've done things that certainly the U.S has not proud of but every nation has involved than involved and covert activities\nThat the things that I Know I don't talk about 'em and you know but yeah we we need national leaders that\nClearly understand the the sobering reality of the powers that the exercise and they need to do it uh with the eyes wide open\nNow with our national interest it's involved and and do it in a way as humanely as possible um you know arguably you know what we did in the in the wake of on nine eleven\nAnd which you know a allegedly a use these words that we took captive certain individuals uh that were threatening the United states and of course we've incarcerated some in Guantanamo been there\nA and elsewhere perhaps blacks sites around the world and those are covert activities um where are they in the national interest of the Bush administration thought so others disagreed nations do these sorts of things and they have to to protect themselves\nIs it fair to say that countries have no friends they only have interests\nAbsolutely\n[noise] All right Susan

Bush draw ... look ... back the legal now your book is very eagle but we are in the long perpetrate evil around the world where these\nWeapons of destruction everywhere even theory or\nOr or ... did not do one you're going to turn to give people year we're still lives there and that he did so worked or wrong or\nYou know well I certainly had a question in their\nRichard ... it is it is perspective\nUm you know I think that the the history of the Russian a Soviet Union certainly where they killed millions a under mouth and China where they kill millions a and their foreign policy where they provoked all sorts of proxy wars um the the types of values that they support\nAh yeah we do sell weapons are defense security cooperation agency you know has done a robust year this year the double what we did last year\nSo we we made mistakes with some of our alliances in the like\nUh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is a we don't have any friends we just have interests and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself to prosper\nUm sometimes uh in the eyes of the beholder is is evil or certainly in my perspective when I've you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I looked at their history and I look at what they want today and it's certainly not what my country once\nAnd I do believe a United States is not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and care for our interests over there's\nParticularly because you know people talk about democracy and and how that is really what protects a freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization as you look around at Seventy eighty per se\nAnd all the rest of the world they don't have rule of law it is the wild west and there are no protections afforded the individual you can be literally swept off the street in the middle of the night and executed\nAh for for no reason in most places in the world a and to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims that are incarcerated in ...\nAnd a western China today and that's a un report or somebody can look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that in the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong and we've acknowledge that\nWe do bad things but the rest of the world you know I have I've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world I've seen some pretty bad places\nUm and yet you know it's always wonderful to come back home to the United states where we enjoy the rule\nOf law we aren't afraid is Richard points out of being arrested him pulled out of bed and shot him had 'em for families being carted away and yet ah unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and\nThe likes of the Chinese are doing some of that to their own people and so they're all\nGotta jump in here and thank you so much for spending two hours with us\nAlliance of evil Russia China the United

I don't happen to believe it that's just me but he was one of the things that sort of bothers me about that situation and that is if we in fact we choose our circumstances\nWhy would someone choose for example a to reincarnate into a life that leads ultimately to physical abuse doesn't that almost place the the the burden on the victim in that case you were you chose that life\nOkay there are certain experiences that we learn from and yes I I understand where you're going in and I and I really do feel for the people that do choose a life like that it is a way of learning certain things and pleasing men but we do have free will\nAnd there are times when people will uh advises us in the end the physical to get out of those relationship\nThose relationships if it's a pattern that a person has to learn from [noise]\nThen they may have to go through it but there's always the chance that they can leave those relationships all relieved\nUm I I I understand that when when the child is young there's no place they could run into a because it's if it's parents siblings and there's a ... and there are circumstances where they live on the most horrendous ... a\nCircumstance is yes it is a tragedy to begin with ... yet what we're learning what were overcoming and that's the whole key here\nIs to overcome those abuses and also it's for the parents if it's apparent abuse or other types of abuse they have the opportunity to overcome that as well and usually if it's a long term relationship they might have agreed to do that both of them\nThat this is the role that they will take and it's up to those two people that come to some kind of resolution of their behavior that they have to rise above that particular pattern\nSo we can see the negative of it but there are cases where people rise above themselves\nAnd they become a hero in their own life because of the person that they may have abuse of they've been abusing they may educate them somehow so there's always hope here and yes we do have guys in angels that do help us\nIt is up that we is up to the individual to draw upon that help we need to call on that help our angels in guides\nAll right Joe thank you for that [noise] a friend is on the wild card line she's in Clearwater, Florida Freda\n[noise] yes thank you for taking my call Richard up three weeks ago I asked your help in winning a new roof\nOh yeah ...
