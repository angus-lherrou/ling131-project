{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "When in fact the second amendment is very clear but it turns out\nAs a critic of Donald Trump\nBloomberg is now donating twenty million dollars\nTo help democratic candidates running for the U.S Senate\nWhy the Republicans think\nThat the Democrats are a threat\nTo taking majority control of the Senate is not clear to me\nBecause as I said earlier in the last segment\nThere were twenty five Democrats seats that are up in the Senate and only nine Republican seats that are up to the math is nearly three to one which means by nearly three to one Democrats are in elections where they could lose\nFor every three Democrats for every one Republican so I don't know what the real problem is\nBut the twenty million is going to the Senate majority pac of the Democrats\nBloomberg also pledged ... million to Democratic House candidates this year eighty million for them twenty leave for the Senate there's a hundred million dollars is giving the Democrats as a former Republican\nHe became an independent after leaving the Republican Party\nAnd now of course he's donating this money I in large measure in my view because he's thinking about running for president in twenty twenty\nBy the way the amount of a hundred million dollars in the in the house and Senate races but he's pumped into these races is more than in prior races\nHe's paves given money to liberal causes especially as I mentioned the pro gun restriction crowd\nThe Democrats need twenty three seats in the house to get the majority\nThat's a substantial number\nAnd uh they they need to get twenty three if they're going to take control we'll see if that happens\nIt is true though that there are some tight races for Republicans\nWe know about the Senate race in Texas Senator Ted Cruz\nIn a dead heat with the Democrat Peter O'Rourke who said some nasty things about women by the way the scandal broke today so that might hurt him a lot there was a case of a Republican candidate for governor years ago and in Texas against Ann Richards\nAnd when they were debating at one point or on the same plot podium same stage\nIn one of the campaign events he came up on the stage she went over to shake his hand and he refused to shake her hand\nHe lost the election and many argue that was that symbolic gesture of refusing to shake enriches hand the cost of the electorate because Texans are very protective\nOf treating women\nGentlemanly fashion\nAnd even if you disagree shaking hands as not supporting the other person's views that simply being courteous so many Texans arguably\nThat candidate because he wouldn't shake her hand that's I say that because this democratic candidate now has been out in today for seeing some very nasty things about women\nBut that's that's been up to now a tight race we'll see how it goes Marsha Blackburn a member of the U.S house in Tennessee\nHas trailed in most polls behind Phil Bredesen who is a former governor of Tennessee\nAnd now they're dead he they're dead even she's been trailing but now they're dead even I think if the president goes back to ... Tennessee maybe two more times before the election or at least once he might give her that edge that she needs\nThat Bloomberg is giving the money to the twenty million for the Senate\nIs controlled by people who are\nColleagues of Chuck Schumer the minority leader\nSchumer of course has become radicalized because the left is pushing all these Democrats for this radicalizing on the left side of the aisle\nThe thing about the tax is that they can spend unlimited amounts of money\nElections but can't coordinate with candidates so yeah they can spend all day one and raise all they want but they can only do that\nIn parallel\nWith candidates they can't ever talk to the candidates there been cases that I'm familiar with that went to court because of the Kennedy spoke with one of these packs and not that anything even happened\nFrom the conversations but you can't even talk to the pack\nAs a candidate you've got to keep your your arms length distance from them that's the rule but the benefit for the pack is if you follow the rules is that you can spend unlimited amounts of money\nAnd nobody's going to stop you from doing that\nSo we'll see how uh how all this plays out but Bloomberg is out there betraying the party that he was once a part of\nAnd unfortunately betrayed uh Rudy Giuliani who's endorsed them and frankly Bloomberg would have lost that election without Giuliani's endorsement for mayor of New York in two thousand one and a that was that\nMany time and I want to repeat this so we all understand\nWhat's happening with the FBI investigation and what's gonna happen in the Senate\nIs that Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader said that every senator gets a copy of the FBI report on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee judge Kavanaugh\nThere'll be a report of there'll be a vote in the full Senate this week\nMcConnell is more to say with certainty\nThey'll get the FBI report this week and they will be a report this week\nThose two facts according to Mitch McConnell\nOnly senators can look at it as I said earlier\nAnd McConnell said he's going to fight any Democrat tempted attempts to delay so he's going to get it done and luckily as majority leader he has the power to do that um there was some questions myself included as to whether Mitch McConnell\nWould go to that extreme\nTo just simply uses\nFull power when the Democrats tried to delay and of course they will\nAs to whether or not\nHe would overrule the Democrats trying to stop the vote\nAnd the answer is that he will that's what he says at least\n[noise] so we'll see how that of transpires [noise] well that's good news that's the that's the kind of his very focused his were given a couple of speeches in the last two days on the floor of the Senate is talking about the Democrat reprehensible strategies and the good man's judge Kavanaugh\nWas that a stellar records impeccable records\nAnd that he events that have the vote on the floor this week that'll be good news that he will win or if he gets\nTo vote stay with us thanks for listening\nAround a traveler among hours in front of a computer can take a toll on your body\nGet relief for your neck or back pain when you search Amazon for some time pillows heating wraps and pad often listed as an Amazon choice why take another field no from sunny day and by customer demand we introduced or extra long neck Haiti rap\nWhy didn't hands free and brings fast relief to those who suffer from Nicole back pain can easily find some time until I was on Amazon more research Amazon for our news sunny ... movie passes or look for ... heated Nick graphs for relief from back dean to miss romantic cramps\nSometimes can be ... in Manhattan for buying\nOr selling ... see why our company vitamin D.

Boston and I are radio station [noise]\nAnd they have found that if people are you know functioning in a in a normal way and they get triggered by some reminder of their mortality it can lead to very pathological types of behaviors\nBut if you can bolster their sense of um personal worth their their value in the world and you you enhanced their self esteem you'll see that when you trigger them they actually become more optimistic they care about other people\nSo I think if we can approach this idea of death and the great mystery of it with an open heart and that kind of skepticism that is productive\nI think can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no Juno gr Mitchell before he passed on\nYeah very well regarded worked\nWith him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did\nWith him for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because he was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment\nWhen he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon\nHe said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find [laughter] um but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he\nFelt that was much more important to live a good life and to be\nA good citizen I'm to be loving inclined toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nMare descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death if you were a quarter law and she knew this was challenged ducts which challenged could you prove that there's life after the\n[noise] so this would make a great reality show and I love you Ina courtroom\nLet's do it [laughter] so you have a judge and jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWith witnesses that come and go\nExactly giving their own um personal testimony based on their experiences ... put it right here and then you get into this question of what would shift people's\nMind about that question and is it that data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and\nShowed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting you know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something\nYou know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think she'll to Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please which rule but it plays with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is [noise]\nI think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness and also\nOur lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world is is that we don't even know that we have them and yet they're the most important thing that shapes their experience like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt shape our experience and so we can't see the things that lie out side of our expectation and I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware and that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example\nWe are primed to perceive those part of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them and I think that that is a remarkable\nUh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of the functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level and to the extent we can\nYou know turn the light on what those experiences are and what shape are aware now where are we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness lives outside of the brain\nAnd I think consciousness is\nSomething that has intelligent [noise] it is self correcting\nIt is reflective and so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because\nEvery nothing cranny and filled with light and with that intention\nTo manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain\nI don't think it's an ... found that out of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed\nThe consciousness or the signal or the signal exactly\nIt keeps coming ... exactly you will will science ever meet the spiritual side of all of this\nSo I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time with the the uh the Android she's a robot\nNow offered advice her yeah she'd be great for you to interview 'em and see if they would do it in a way that doesn't give me one or is a talk show host if she's in a good

Boston in a heart radio station [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] well come back\nThe ... with us Marilyn in this reality court room on do you think the jury would decide based on his third wife drafted up\n[noise] I think most people believe there's something there I think people have had experiences that give them a sense of that\nI think that there are a lot of experiences that people report you know beyond the survival of consciousness or identity you know people ... reporting things like pre technician knowledge of the future\nUh people you know doing what you did about\nLooking into your mind for information about a geographical location the whole remote viewing paradigm you know they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that the majority of our population and including people with\nHigher levels of education report so this isn't just something that people experience and we have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is\nIs something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their lives\nAnd you have written in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and full or and less filled with stress and anxiety and\nHow can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspectives and opinions but it's also possible that people\nYou know began to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences can lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious than we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mistakes and we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation send and that in that we really created kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHog them were younger people react to these things so what do you start\n[noise] well I think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of\nUh there's certainly a lot of fascination with you know horror movies you were talking about that last program\nYou know I think our imaginations are very fertile I think popular culture has a way of training us and we know that these kinds of topics are extremely interesting for people who choose TV shows or movies to go see so what's that about you know is that about\nJust something that is idle curiosity or is it something that helps them to take a deep dive into their own personal experiences and I think the ladder maybe what's happening\nWants to make some calls will pick it up are going to Giovanni in Los Angeles on the wild card law and order Giovanni\nHey how's it going jury room I mean it's been a war\nYeah and I've been a while and I'm always listening I Love the show\nAs always and a doctor Marilyn thank you so much for the work that you're doing on consciousness absolutely necessary your pioneer and I hope you continue doing your work and I hope that this uh this this birth more a wonder and and and and walk into this world\nBut I wanted to share that experience of mine but I just really springs to mind when I heard you talk about the about the forest or above the jungle it ended up being a form of consciousness or out of a of kind of a pure consciousness\nWell my parents are from Nicaragua and uh our our indigenous people are\nVery very very rich culture of a ... and and also a you know being able to travel and to you know injured mentally and and uh and explored the potential of the mine\nThrough um through an ancient practices and so it's been instilled in me overtime or the practice meditation\nOne uh one one one one moment at one time I'm On my travels I was traveling Nicaragua and the Nick and Nick and in the correct where there's a a jungle called less than ... or roughly childhood or the the black a jungle\nAnd the this this black jungle is just as an Asian jungle with most of it as untouched by man very rarely explored still still rich with with a with a with undiscovered I'm a\nLord knows what's out there but uh when I was in the jungle I sat down to meditate and while I was meditating maybe an hour is my meditation\nI felt what I believed to be this pure consciousness I felt the jungle\n... it was so strong that I had trouble breaking for my meditation and and to a certain point I became a little bit\nHammered a bit it's beautiful because I I Will I kind of lost control over my ability to extract myself from the meditation for a moment\nAnd I believe that this is your consciousness was was calling me or or or trying to pull me into it somehow and I wanted to share that consciousness I Do believe that there's more out there ...\nAnd ah the more we explore the more we'll find just like you say yes we put it into our mind that there's something there we will find it as opposed to shrug it off and not believing something is there\nWhat did you think about ... I Am so grateful for that comment on the question I appreciate ir supportive words and I think that one of the reasons that\nMany traditions have a guide you know a position in society that is\nThat a spiritual leader or you know the mistake who's been on the past before so they can help guide the process because I think it's true that you can get pulled into realms and experience that are unfamiliar\nThat are unchartered and that have this capacity to kind of take us out with them and if you are with somebody who's experienced in a lot of this kind of journey work\nOr they can help calibrate that and you know keep you grounded in the experience but it sounds pretty remarkable I Will say one time I was in a meditation practice with Francis von who uh is no longer in this plane of experience but\nShe let this meditation where she took our identity into a bubble\nAnd the bubble left to the body and went off somewhere and I know that I got pretty lost in that moment and I thought if I didn't have the kind of grounding that I had I could see how some people could be very frightened or destabilized by that\nAnd in fact there was a woman I'm Willoughby Britain who is a psychiatrist and it's really been looking at some of the\nDisk called the surrounding meditation you know we think about it always as a really positive thing but it's also important to recognize that sometimes people can get in to realms of experience\nThat they have no way to navigate and so I'm very grateful for your question and your comments and I keep exploring it's a great adventure\nFrom six AM to nine PM You're welcome you're on the great\nDoubled our gay ...\nWhat's the biggest danger for victims of child abuse which is\nThe silence when no one talks about the victim the abuser no one at all do child abuse victims we need to know the signs because sometimes the silence is what speaks the loudest\nWe are the children's advocacy center of Suffolk County to learn the science or help with the donation visit WWW dot learn the signs of child abuse dot com\nRadio\nHere the child rural more songs you dum dum ... locked out of having to show\nNumbers to dump bond with Martin ...\nBlame uh just watch [noise]\nWhite board carrot manic\nShell shocked if\nYou're more ... than similar artist now search for her Lars on heart radio\nAll your favorite music all your favorite teaching all free\nHow can I help my daughter with their reading\nSearching for help with duct in reading\nHow can I help my daughter was there any\nInformation on a wider eating you know there was a bright when she's reading she has trouble spelling out the words\nWorld music playing track now [noise]\nOur daughter gets confused about which detailed in a story are important which paper towels are melt absorbent I hear are five product review why are you not getting me see it's all the\nWeight I was trying to show how Sarah meal everyday frustrating is Annette redirecting to understood dot org\nFor the one in five kids with learning and attention issues this is my life can feel like explore understood that Oregon or free online resource about learning an attention issues designed to help your child drive into war\nUnderstood that Oregon because understanding is everything right here by understood that bought any\nAt all I knew I had a problem but I didn't know what to do\nCounting calories pills eating\nAnd eating and then more eating really one of the top but nothing could make me stop at one point it was so bad that I just don't like giving up I've felt so alone\nNobody else could possibly understand we understand where over eaters anonymous and we had to help\nOut into people just like you\nWant to adopt a compulsive eating and living a healthy rewarding life over eaters anonymous\nHelped me get my life back now eaten away that healthy and good\nLiving again\nLiving the life you deserve withheld from overeating or not and then\nYou ... do you do ...
