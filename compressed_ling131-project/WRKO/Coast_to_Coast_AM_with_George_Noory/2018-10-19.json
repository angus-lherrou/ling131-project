{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Yeah no I mean we we send a beef\nYou know some weight a little bit and they were at me and everything else we're importing from China and I don't know about you but and I and I took an app protectionist other credit not but uh yeah I think we remember the good days when we can buy American products that lasted\n... cheap Chinese products now that you know kind of like a unintended benefit of the trade deals are but we make more good quality manufacturing a you know American manufactured products here but the terrorists are just designed to get the Chinese back to tell because they weren't\nBudging under previous administrations but right now what these terrorists have done to China's disproportionately affects them so that if they tried it you know cold out or they're going to try to keep with the staring contest this game of chicken\nAnd and this and these are twenty five percent 'cause right now we're we're at ten percent terrorists um if we go up to twenty five percent come January one in China hasn't hasn't budge their economy is going to take a much much much much more significant hit\nAny kind of consumer a feeling that will have here because we've got we're confidence to all the time either so we got great purchasing power here um you know the economy's doing so well where whereas China is not doing as well um that this is really the long game that President Trump is playing and he's really aimed right base when\nYeah and the um ... basically what it's doing is putting the pressure on them and it's creating a free and open marketplace because of the Chinese which is is gonna costs twenty five percent more in January the costs now\nAnd all of a sudden here comes a I don't know let's let's say Sweden would this would this twenty five percent less or we're going to buy the sweetest which is\nYeah and that's going to do yet or ... you know going to an ally that's not stealing our stuff\nWell exactly so uh so I Do you think that at some point China will fall in line because of the pressure from all the other deals the president will have made with other countries\nWell that's exactly what the president's strategy is it's it's too it's to shore up first of all\nOf the existing agreements like we just saw with NAFTA you know we've got the U.S MCAA deal now uh you know read shoring up revising those make sure that they that they work better for United States is going to turn its case toward the European Union Japan\nUh and of course the u._k. oh we're going to get those deals done and then ... is going to actually be\nPaying you know put on a corner because they're reorient with President Trump is doing it United States companies now and companies all around the world are reorient their supply chain away from China\nAnd really toward North America you know this is why companies are I'll bring manufacturing plants here it got more manufacturing jobs here you've got all the time you know I think ah you know orange jobs that are open than there are people to fill them in the United states\nAnd so the geo political you you think about all the money that used to flow toward China no longer flowing toward China it puts a herd of their economy\nWill you know the ... that's one thing the other thing you I I thought of Iran where he put the sanctions back on and now the European companies have had to make a decision between the United states in Iran will\nOr that it's not even a choice yeah they're going to stick with us because if they did business with Iran or they lose our business so obviously runs losing that business\nAnd um and then then the European governments complain about it I don't get that because um you know we're we're we're accomplishing great economic\nUh the pressure on Iran which we should be should be overthrowing the government from the people within the country and there are movements to do that\nAnd then the other part of that is that um we're benefiting and these other companies coming to us being told you can't do business with both so ... this is working to a positive effect bulls geo politically and economically\nYet another and that's the beauty of being in a position of strength and that's why it's so important that and that's that's a perfect perfect example of why these pro growth pro business\nPro America policies that President Trump on them and you know the deregulation\nThe tax cuts corporate and individual tax cuts and jobs to act right you've got the opportunity is don't that stimulates investment and some of the more impoverished parts of the nation talking about revitalizing America but not just you know you're you're subject to talk about revitalizing all of America\nOr you know your urban environments and your rural environments that\nPut us at a huge position of strength that when we're renegotiating these these deals and were able to put these economics\nShe's on countries like Iran or by your you know the European can you know a good friend of mine Rick renowned as the ambassador to Germany you know he's he's carry that message to a lot of these German companies that listen if you're doing business with Iran you know you can expect a very serious response from the United states but you got to choose between\nYou know freedom United States you know someone who respects human rights or Iran you know if a frequent state\nSponsor of terror ah someone who accuse people and kill people on a human rights violators uh at the end that alley Seamus the shame of the Europeans but at the economic sanctions a\nYou know hurt the Iranian people not the people that the government it puts them in a in a bind it literally suffocate at cripples their entire economy\nTell you what I noticed about the policy they ... I Know that regime change is not the goal but we want behavior change you know we want them to to to cut off their their funding of a terrorist organization want to start acting like a like an adult and uh playing by the rules\nAnd so these tools these weapons that President Trump is effectively employed or you know in this\nReal genius you know you only have this kind of mentality I frankly I think it was speculate coming from the private sector where you have to you know you have to survive otherwise go bankrupt you know uh you know taken this mentality into a lot\nYou know we're going to change the way that we interact with our trading allies with our best allies and we're going to make sure we put the American people first about that he's done\nAnd then there's no question about that were wrapping up and got about a minute do you think uh this there was talk and I was the president loves what the best for her and I was doing in Germany but do you think that would the some of the talk that he might wind up as UN ambassador\nWell I'll tell you I Know that uh you know he's been family favorite uh yeah we all we all love Rick and you know he's just a just a\nHeck of a guy I Know that it was a long time a spokesperson ran with Ambassador Bolton for some time you know now is actual security advisor\nAnd so I think the president likes a predator likes Rick he really does um but it's very likely that um you know there's a shortlist that uh you know he wants to bring another star and stuff but it will be a UN ambassador someday I expected at some point you will\nWell that'd be a lot of fun to see 'em there is a as you said you know I'm I don't but I think he's a terrific a spokesperson when he's been doing commentary on on the on\nThe news channels he does a great job it's a pleasure ah of course Garcia thank you very much for the continued growth of this economy under the leadership of your ex boss secretary Ross then of course the president and the great to have you with us thanks for your time is it fair to say thank you Chris Garcia former deputy director of leaves Congress department\nAnd other sector and Wilbur Ross Tam we appreciate his time in this country's really foreign split stay Republican folks\nHated my neck back and shoulders has really gotten worse relief for body pain is here with ...\nWith the last thing I wanted to take another pill to it so good about ...

your dreams are easier right now people will want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and helped him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe're time travel is in our dreams and when we develop the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleaders counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a why is the self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we have gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other\nWill we traveled the parallel worlds for example but it will lead in parallel lives this isn't\nAs weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from what we're living right now on may be radically different so that's part of what dream traveling mainstream traveling Olson means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then in conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding that solar consciousness survived physical ... pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious not sold that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who've come cooling those people to come calling my employed glued but loving family members are ancestors of spiritual guides has some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind the science tells us about the getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information on the old ... and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and write them down will notice that they dream of events before they happen one function of time travel we see the possible future we\nCan reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead but we also traveled into the past from this my mother lives you learned about connections with drama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods\nThe multi dimensional universe so this is the key to the U.S and understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the path of direct experiences papa dreamed travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my own experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and they're giving me permission to use this story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this was one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history about dreams and dream of they believe the dreams put you in touch with a God or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest ... so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our time is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions and attitudes from a bad time and more objective perspective than we can manage for our cells in indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what it might begin to meet and if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience I've lost the sense of a deep up ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding oath on to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of some of that in Paris how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step prices the sharing a dream of a story that makes it sound you can get it done and minutes you get some help with feedback and you're guided tours action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our opinions I mean bad habits of pots and that is part of it we let out so the rushed to sleep on the alarm clock but the need to get jobs don't deal with the family we think that we should lie in the church in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you'll between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch it means good time to back them loose and dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed to 'cause they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so he'd slam the door and say no more dreams tell sometimes this is very interesting\nA special announcement and the women in Boston I have a new\nLaws\nAnd ...

getting on a plane somewhere and I actually say when I arrive at the airport I don't actually need a news story today because the best stories sometimes up when something goes wrong I really just one of the road trip but but you know at lunchtime I sit down at the airport by have a beer on the straight and I have a deal with I can see\nMe read paste man next to me as you looked like a fellow you'd like to hear a story and I look at the interest he introduces himself he's a former cop he's a former detective from the East Bay area all interesting it looks at me and he says Robert he's ... my name I have to share this with someone I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nAnd I was in a grave yet I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk and I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it's her but I call\nShe's never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head and said he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story the very great story I mean that introduced this whole thing about\nYou know the energy and that connects that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my call them to a certain goal is to a certain place might even be an age and just sit and ... but\nAs I'm telling it it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on the day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and that that these examples proliferate so\n... you know ... it's how it works is that the the the attitude and the energy you are carrying again to have result your attitude travels ahead of you in life shaping wanted waking foot waiting fuel round the next corner\nWhich is a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check or to play you know when you're in a soundtrack check what you're saying to you so Trump the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs\nAnd be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know you need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to not to into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter of reality as a dense of consciousness so\nThat there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there's the phenomena but used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced ... maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize\nWhat is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time ... example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled surprisingly high\nAnd there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hits a gosh are my blood is they're going to throw online\nYou live and pants and after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened I said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen can but the white queen screams\nBefore she ... her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the forward took place on the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating symptoms besides but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was looted you\nWell you know I think so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things\nWe know the thing we know what the bleep we know that we know enough about the sudden medic responses we pick up things from a distance from other people and we feel what they're feeling in our body as well so that's part of the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell acted dreaming is way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you and it could take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also a method of loosened dreaming you call it ... dreaming we ... my favorite way of talking on the loose and dream adventure\nIs to start out loose that didn't stay lose what does that need it means that we use so many drumming in the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay this romance an adventure still in the stream\nLet's go on with the dream let's get back inside the dream and have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff's going on by going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean I Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Morrow someone else\nSo that's an example of so many loose a dream yet another example is the I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try lied state to eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psyche can intuitive and creative naturally\nSo I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the nice\nRelax into that state and make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images of Ryan's unfold and see what he wants to make one of the scenes will come to you the full to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive dreaming that the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we got the how to look to criticize the outlook for signs and symbols in the world around you so this is also a program on a method all attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nWhere did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think the dream and felt the misleading I think that I've been on the dream can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams in them so I ...\nI mean we could pick up things in the night of the home for the floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us that it's truly our own\nCan be worked with the help of healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront these two on the ground you might find the behind something that scaring worrying\nAnd you and your dream is the power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not the ... but a rush to interpret according to narrow understanding what dreams is about to be very misleading\nYou got a

might be doing now it's a pretty interesting title\nBut the part of it that it didn't the previous documentation that Yom dreamed again and again before his death\nBut he was living in a Bush and all his retreats on the lake on Lake Zurich\nWhich was called ball and get out the nearby village is living in another balding gun on the other side of death and those close to him said that he lost all

follow you on\nTo that possible afterlife situation and actually get some insight into where how your mind might be working right now is he works on a great new books are you in the off the life I

great deal not always the publication about his contacts with the defaced he talked in his in his mouth and then he'd read book about extensive conversations\nHe had with the power to the shape your view of reality and he was one of those are always understood but one of the key things about dreaming is is it gives the had the ability to understand what happens to mind consciousness opt to death
