a shock or in the sense that everybody thought that was a you know shown trench I mean she was a strongly high profile um um you went in ... in part because she was a governor of his state to more of an executive function so\nShe certainly extremely opinionated in into the you know the Trump you know kind of foreign policy\nLine to AT T I mean I I think you know it's not surprising to the extent

think if they can can cook Joe or you know\nTwist Dina Paulos arm to take this it will be far better than Margaret now here's the current ambassador to Germany or this girl is God you know she's got

button happens all the time\nI think she wants to kind of move on to other things and pass the baton there was some speculation that you might even run against Trump but you know this is just

natural world after they pass on to the body the person taking them\nDo you use just a disaster gotta be careful Google Plus I don't use it but Google Plus will be no more but it took more than that being the least impactful social media platform on the Web to killing\nMugele has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus from so ... is\nA Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... that I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um it was going to be missed\nWhat it's going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's going on for ages with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise]\nReally in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run Google decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy bonds or post right these are both things that drives people crazy or his\nBook so there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have the ads you gotta have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people\nOnto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's going on but sizes everything with social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\nWell all the right at the top\nOf they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time\n[noise] apparently there is that they really didn't as they found that in a during ... as I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical bought her ability but apparently\nNobody knew about it outside of school and the kinds of information that were that were\nUm theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that while that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why are there things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation and they kind of sat on it\nAnd write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient I won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of\nA rationale for setting into motion the sun setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have\nDiscussed that publicly of the first place um\nAnd uh it would've been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who've been using Google Plus all these years of trying to find other places to go we're experimenting with other things and I'll mention that there the Google commercial version of cocoa puff which operates\nFurther Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month per per head\nUsing a that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially [noise] uh and and we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably not a good idea and the first place that's a time\nAt ... at the end at the time that it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that norm is growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question I hear Snapchat is going broke where do you hear\nA apparently Snapchat having all kinds of all kinds of problems um I guess their stock has\nBeen a walloped yeah that's\nA very well uh their their founder has been sending out there you know kind of messages to the troops to kind of ... try to cheer them up [noise] uh it it it appears that some pretty serious mistakes were made along the way when they when they tried to grow up there that can happen when you're trying to grow rapidly you know who you're\nGonna drive off the ball and you\nAnd you could really a fall flat later on whether or not snapshot that that will be able to pull out of this I I don't know but right now that they're not they're certainly not the uh uh the star of of the moment like they were some time ago\nPoint thanks Lauren

often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think as I Hope people about the evidence but I was referring to people parked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nLet's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about the foreign telepathy pretty cognition tell the casino psycho couldn't he says you you of course we learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nWant something that wouldn't arouse the body what we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect think Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown\nSeconds before the picture show\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they'd show videotapes of various anchor people and ... the one that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired\nA they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter or with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in pre sentiment experiments measuring skin response\nMuseum work no cycle Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRights again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm\nConsciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled or once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is the stability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and one in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes in fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does is ask people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room so they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more ones and zeroes\nAgain what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen what they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd in ... people have that ability or have\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton studies where these machines the random number generators\nAre set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're\nGenerating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is looked at the behavior of the machines around the world around event that we know\nAre produced heightened emotions and nine eleven as one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a concentrate basically in a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike\nAt nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event yeah before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nBurn Gaylor you know the name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did\nFor psycho Comey says she had the ability to bend spoons keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who say doll which trickery its magic but the the if you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and how\nCan it be taught can cycle can ... be taught\n[noise] [noise] well I've heard of a\nBoon bending party which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind in a way to to act matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually\nBending metal for example and early ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is that in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw\nKeller then and there are many people who have kept it that this is real I'm a side note on your a gallery very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I clued in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of the ending within the context of remote viewing mhm bellies and what they say in a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching it closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo yeah there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that studies\nWere around and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to get

I Am part yet from Stony Brook another one we'll scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in our\nArrest come back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in\nCardiac arrest this is severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body\nIs verified as being accurate later I'm One example in particular is from Dr Sam ... in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room it\nWas later found to be the defender later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well we're somebody is literally gone through this near death experience\nThere floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body\nAnd tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experienced and memories are but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school\nHas looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson as one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities in markets in the room\nYou can't see those radio signals what's they're out there is that a little bit ... with this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat is such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary\nA perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and our ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes Shoah a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum and what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality\nSo I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible drama on this topic you've learned a lot haven't you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid at Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes\nI Am a rational a gift and I'm a teary a left however I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and the ... uh where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes\nUh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil I Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be seeing\nYour lab already know space no time\nA dimension but my question to you is specifically\nA I like to shore to question your whole premise by talking about site medications all explained psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers ...\nFact chemical have the brain and therefore I they do affect\nChemical you the consciousness meaning of the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain through these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain is for headaches the going back to cite made it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively\nAnd in the mind that's my first part my second part\nOf the same one question is Alzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious is the mines does thing that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that\nIf the mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the mine is connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and that type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or\nIf someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation what I argue and and some others argue this as well is\nThat correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another\nWe can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's the simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise]\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up a very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with a grain of highly related to consciousness damage the brain you you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view\nIt more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhat ... what do you think mark reincarnation\nWhile I have a chapter on that in my book and I talk about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence\nFor it we we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out\nThere's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's the chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes there if I buy medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nYes and in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from wanting to another

folks that lived in that country that made that animal of pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things Steven just said we're on her way using it\nYet even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's a academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field to physics that has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglements\nAnd the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another\nAnd when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect which suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness\nNow I Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fastest that anything could travel and yet here we had an instantaneous connection between distant particles that there are things in the ... and the fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive\nBut we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\n\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do psychic late this has opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which if we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you again one more time you bought your Web site where people can get your book in into upside down

Boston I'm In my heart radio station [noise]\n\n[noise] well\nThis is that time of year where we talk about those stories and we're going to talk about them now the name of the book by wrong collecting Maureen would more goals chronicles stories from the wrong with the unknown the unexplained the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic tranche medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe has communicated with the D.C shut the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which upset with Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to do it only understand but also control this gift\nOf the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult San says she's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nOh thank you so much for having me look good for to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you yes\nI Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter] tell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know he's very a a wonderful woman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned in the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high priest ... salmon and he'll often\nWhen I was younger I see her walking around town you know threats and her her garb and very regal looking very on you know she's president of ... and ... at\nThe time did people welcome or with open arms should they go oh my God there's er which\nYeah that's a great question you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but\nLet's just say the town and Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town of Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously they tore them right now I have is in it you know go to town on so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ...\nNow you are a fifth generation psychic trance medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family you said disability what year who did it start with\nNo ... and it's interesting because growing up\nMy mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me should get you know my father though he thought the girls in the same um but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit thing and I mean it was normal it did it seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just\nYou know God Bless her she'd say oh he has some holy water\nYou know just that you know she'd come my father she normal um but she didn't really\nWith me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in her and she finally told me that if you don't want Marlene\n... than from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and you're waiting for them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio\nSo\nWould you say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight\nSo I never really knew her um\nBut my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people who I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town on so it it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot of really judge by in my family history who might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed down stories from\nOne to the other the the you could carry through\nYou know the only thing\nThat I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and uh she was\nMaybe maybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looked like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know\nThat was her true self she was very unique that's what she said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say\nI'm about spirits anyway\nNo you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand and one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me to tell the story but he started this story\nAfter on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took to try to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness I'm and basically he started doing a cable um\n[noise] you know he started cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing you know goes that his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus\nOn but it's a team of individual that\nYou know over the years I've learned is you know to me everybody is really\nYou know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get a you go out and you look for things that go bumper the night you know someone else doesn't really want to see why look into that they're quite\nSatisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run and the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain and people were getting a little freaked out and they need help\nSo it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigation some people it's really going there to to just help on\nHow many people are just the off the wall when you go to their house and then you're just using that\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred investigations um I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time but we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command\n[noise] um so I really believe that\nThere are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it [noise] um so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of\nParanormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat have you conclude about what this may be I mean a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think they are\nWell I think\nThere are varying degrees of what they could be right\nSo our experience in my experience over the years has been you know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to get before they pass\n'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house um there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all of these plants just\nDie as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door you know door closed in her apartment\nAnd yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs\nOr you know all these out she'd have something go on in the oven she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in soil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire

to come in in the morning and sometimes they would find books in the middle of a floor and they couldn't understand why it happened so she finished it with us be on one side and then I get up and

book a ghost chronicles is ... is the second book on the series\nA marine and I did an investigation it was a daytime investigations jumped him called me up and asked me to check out his house so I get ... up and we went to his house and the places that massively looked like had been trashed and this guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there and ah\nSo anyways uh they were pretty big do it's a and the the\nKind of got us for a while after we did our thing and one of ... separated me from the other one and the other one talked marine we later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and ah so he won the marine comeback alone but that didn't turn out so if\nThere was any fear was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling

know the the larger the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people more a piece of equipment a small case the lesser amount but you always want to um\nYou know try to bring the proper equipment that you would need for instance if you have reports of a ... being seen you might bring more video equipment or you know like they're ... or ... whatever\nThat you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by audio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies appointing we've gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization that you've come across\nA I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization of a goal visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it a charges that they weren't really well I was ... times in but more while I was just doing normal stuff yeah\nI work with a lot of White House history funds for him and we do you know public goes sense of that type of stuff\nAnd there are two separate occasions or one guy

where it's a square\nBuilding with glass all around you\nAnd say use windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and his wife and daughter in and out of it and there was a group of\nPeople there and I began talking to them doing my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down the law the side of the wall you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself ... she came and then they didn't want her to miss anything so I stopped and waited for ... continually walk all the way to do it\nAnd I waited\nAnd waited and yet\nNobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there\nBut yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk in and yet there was no one there and oddly enough that ... is with the coast got because it's on the coast guard base a coast guard reported seeing women walking on the wall in that same location so\nThat was kind of intriguing I'm ... and perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we did a public or goes on ah\nWhat Iowa lighthouse in Bedford pool meals Maine we were in the White House ah keep his house it was under\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on a picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen they serve a dog will crush the door or the
