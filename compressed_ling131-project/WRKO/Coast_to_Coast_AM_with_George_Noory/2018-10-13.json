{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "And these kinds of things and one of the wall Street Journal printed that article you know the ... the left came down on them and they do with the woman who was teaching at a law school she was actually I tried to get rid of her and they said unfortunately the book came out that we would get rid of her because this is very racist or purchase that we should have pushed or values and\nUm so first of all we got to start by saying hey we do know some things that work\nAnd these are the kinds of values that eat you know and and I you know I was gonna say before before the break that\nThat one of the things that I talk about all the time you know you were saying how do we approach this I said listen I'm I'm a religious person I I mean I I feel like Carl young was correct like all young said whether God exist or not is a legitimate question that man needs the goddess in in controversial fact\nNow I understand I understand that but I'm I live we have limited time and I want to get to the point about uh when you've talked about as around the periphery on an adult I'm a big\nSchool choice person so I you know I'm taking kids out of public schools where they're having the exact same things that you're talking about and I'm under writing them to go to you know I'm not you know I'm not I don't have the kind of welfare I could do this for a thousand kids but I'm taking kids and I'm saying listen I went up I'm going to underwrite them where they're going to go to places where they're going to be\nA a thought that there is a higher higher purposes toy and as I said in my book I said if you want to take it literally you can you can take it metaphorically if you're if you if you're not but when you speak first the kingdom of heaven everything else will take care of itself\nBut let me ask you something because he has now you're you then I commend you for that that's that's noble\nUm it's magnificent the thing that I question and and I would die wants to the program that was about mysteries of the universe and the nightly show and then one of the questions I raised\nIs there a difference between religion and spirituality and of course we had a four hour discussion of that with callers and the bottom line is that religion gives you a dictator dog them a a ritual\nThings that you are supposed to do within that religion and then the other religion gives you something else entirely\nWhen you have a whole slew of Christian religions that all may treat things slightly differently but the question then all legitimate even let me just finish their point the question then is um how do you give a kid\nA person that just a kid but even at a young adult is on the on the line from and give them within themselves the understanding that you're describing to live a life that's going to be giving to other people and help them forget about taking drugs because they want to be\nThey have a purpose a higher purpose to do things for other people that's that's the point of trying to get it when it's not about going to a religious school and learning that the dictator and the dog and love that school of that religion it's about putting something internally within that young person\nTo give them embedded in them blow system that you having that\nThat thing that out of the the thing that keeps it keeps me in on the schools but I recommend that either the kids but I'm saying it's not that they ... selflessness\nIt's learning you know I'm you know Aristotle said we are what we repeatedly do\nExcellent is not a choice it's a habit you have to learn to love you have to eat the more you do it the boy wow you have an if any one day you say what\nYou know I tell people all the time I wasn't always like I Am today but I what I can say honestly today if I get more pleasure and excitement out of seeing you succeed then I get out of the uh myself sixty\nRight I understand that yeah and you have\nTo have a conversion experience to use a a religious term there but you have to have you have to do it enough it's kinda like if I was talking to somebody but sushi today many a kid on a airplane today about sushi I said you gotta try five or six times and eventually you'll start to like sushi I mean if you get put in an environment where you\nWere you when you start to see another person's space flight up because you know in most people if you think about it or like that I mean when I first got my first Beatles albums you know what was the first thing and I got turned on to him the first thing I Want to do is turn somebody else on before I even read this fall out my ripped it off the record player ran down the hallway to my\nFriend's room and I put her on his record player you know want to turn you on like the Beatles say\nThat we have three minutes so let me just ask you the schools that you underwrite these kids to go to and I commend you for that um are you confident that those schools\nAre in coal ... these kids with the notion of higher surface higher purpose helping it like\nAm intimately involved with the lives of the you know you know I'm again I'm only doing\nAnd these for not only doing it for several kids at this point\nRight now is probably hundreds we'd hope it doesn't matter the number is involved\nI actually review I actually go to talk to the teachers I actually go to see what's going on I mean I see the kids\nSee is what I think even at a young age I'm ... and I when I taught at the college level like one of my students happened within ... who came to me to ask me about getting into the media was Wayne Larrivee he's now the voice of the Green Bay Packers\nUm and when I asked them to do is to go to games in Boston I was at the time and to ah they'll go to Red Sox games and patron Patriot's games and do the play by play on a tape record and then we'd come back and we'd critique it\nAnd that's a that's a that's how would that he gave him an immersion in the field and if you take if you look at the same thing with a kid but you're working with or any kid any young person than they do something at a boy's town in Omaha Nebraska or at the salvation army or wherever\nThey have something bigger a bigger purpose than something organized that they can work within that's my point would be\nYou know and that's the one thing that I'm\nA all all religions all a legitimate religious share software is the idea that you're not that you're supposed to you know\nI'm love your neighbor as yourself something that's basically told them all and and if you want to ... I get up front of people all the time and say it is in your own self interest to forget your self interest and the more successfully you forget your self interest the more successful you are going to beep and a damn it I'm dogmatic about that\nThis isn't an uptick discussion here\nIf you try this and you stick to it not only will you find yourself getting extremely successful but you find that you're that you're actually your whole life has changed and you're a happier person and you get more pleasure out of seeing other people succeed the need to and and my thing is you don't have to take my word for it\nBut you do is take my word for long enough to go out there and try it and I only applied in your life and this is what brother John and this is what the market for me when I'm hanging with those bugs it's confrontational might because they're constantly doing something for you\nConstantly looking around for it and I think the with and they don't even try\nYour ... and ...\nWill come on at the time but the one thing I Would say is that that that that's fantastic as a philosophical overview for people the second step and that is is helping them to get into a an actual structured way and as I mentioned could be the salvation army could be um any organization a town\nThat I'm sending these kids to\nAnd then later they use those skills to do things in organized labor for other people uh that that you work in the work that you do for a\nCareer becomes ice or something else is critically important in my life already seconds ago starts with us to to show the example to witness to it to to live that way yourself if you're teaching it and you know and other people see it working for you and they catch and it's and they try for South it's a fantastic approach\nI'm delighted we had the chance to talk of August and I appreciate your time on TALK again I'm not going to order your interview by the way about The Exorcist I Love that\nOh that's yeah that's a that's an incredible interview you'll love it thanks for being with us I appreciate it [noise]\n[noise] hello this is talk of illegal AMD of neutral medical dot com announcing the breakthrough render velvet DR it delivers the protected building blocks of all organs and tissues all on your own stem cells as architects and engineers to regenerate you\nNot to see life plan aging does not occur as such an amazing information been available to help you and me generally\nAnti aging requires is he correct mineral activated and interested or cool and jumped the gene defects important I have to deliver the state or tools through general nation you must remove all damage cells replace unless you're young healthy cells to wind the biological clock to younger you\nOrder your red velvet the ballot neutral medical dot com twenty four seven or\nEight eight eight to one to eighty eight Seventy one that's new medical ... new tier I medical I mean the icy AOL dot com for color or aligned triple eight to one to eighty eight Seventy one\nWe had a big weekend in sports around here maybe\nSox obviously ...

says deals on line for me to find that out\nWell how many do you think Jeffrey believe how many people believed that demons exists if you went out and pulled people\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guess George but important thing to remember is that there is there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings\nOur own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back\nEverybody how did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThat work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative\nEmotional energy drawing them\nPractice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there that generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel about them\nAnd they accumulate is in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative\nSpirits and so they are uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them\nWash windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies\nAnd so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environment\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment or whatever and doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra citizen deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest is Adam ... would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest say Sean priest\nExercises I don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all\nPeople call me who are agnostic\nEverybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion wasn't touching anybody anyway this really is not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere\nYou know how to do it and it it it has to be done you know we we moved into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years ending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know times are already in the homes from time to come into the home they sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it how maybe your professional but have it we're one\nAnd I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy field\nAnd also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion not the only one\nThat are qualified extra assistance just about every religion\nBut they but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that\nPeople call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong in the religion but I remember doing this kind of work and has lived um I keep contact with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are\nThis universe that's had before on on one of my parents as the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you have\nTo know do you go into these actresses what's a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working with Christians which haunt me all the time even

won't mention the name but it's something I was\nAgain three years and years and years you all the invitation I finally oh they talked me into it fine actually they over in one of the rooms you they're beautiful you know and so uh it was actually set up for ... years ago\nAnd then a with real quick and then in and take a look around and everybody everybody found something people who didn't believe in ghost had you know one couple said their hair dryer when flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nUh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cards from people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and there was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but very heavy gold she was called the gold room\nAnd it went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast\nRight in front of me just\nWould not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention I said you know\nThis place is really haunted and the third night I was there\nUm I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning them to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite me\nY'all follow people home negative spirit's just they will get\nTo know that gets you later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and uh oh four feet above me was the miss shaping the spirit just terrible looking now\nI'm used to know spirits can assume any shape they won so I don't react to the ... you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\n... what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song that I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's drain possible to describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil lullaby\nAnd it was right above me and and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick week and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song\nSlowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed at ... kind of went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I wanted to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick I sat up immediately went to the chair\nSat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house I was not working at this time I was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down\nInto the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just sell to lose\nAn extra sisters not safe I don't go into homes and uh in in to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits in somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely on the client I did report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know in\nTimes immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clear I'm going to do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments and they need a clearing and and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away\nAnd they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting I feel better at work I'm Better able I go into business meetings and a little longer coming out feeling drained\nBecause they're not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always know what it's subconscious\nAnd so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them run negative spirit and so\nYou know people call me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's the media but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey really really helped you know\nVery very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last\nAlmost three decades now have not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already five different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what\nIs going on with the client and may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up\nYou know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on the\nBusiness or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirit demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep\nMeaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy and also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school ... elementary and high school that my parents went to its old great beautiful\nBut I mean think of the moon energy dinner elated and so people will be calling uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional\nEnergy regenerated you don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nNot so good at all costs just for you know\nMarshall energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to the J in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time\nThank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times developed turmeric and everything else but

spirits attack people least able to defend themselves\nWhich unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues physical brain problems [noise] a depression anger issues unhappiness\nA overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen\nAnd and we have to watch out for that and and so\nAh ah demonic spirits are experts at reaching across that dividing line and being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that\nThere is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly and they can reach across in damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of an immediate dug but actually been working on them for a long time\nAnd they can cause physical injuries to even happened to me once you know I I woke up one morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time and I was getting up and ready to work or doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back and it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and tried to the hospital and you know have looked at in a you know get some light medication for it\nBecause it the demonic Stewart had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is the you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits study how to do these things\nThe non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm was that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and an essentially that is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side to being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n[noise] who ... on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know to to repent turtle I gotta\nGo to the other side gets off\nDrugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens in teaching people how to protect\nThemselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say no I Am not a spirit psychologist uh it's\nKind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steal your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for the spirits\nOut there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things\nAnd trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields\nI don't have time to do it and they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore the physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's possessed or anything we just have negative energy issues and also getting if there's some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or ... or ... whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual to have this is my main concern not dealing with the negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorgia I Am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm a mom for that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kind of stuff at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past life helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is that wants to teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they do love it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know\nThe real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is Jeffrey ... would you

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream and the voice of illusory but\nAfterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has been consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream sure she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on the mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened Keith thank you for that but we got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nDoing Joan okay were you\nUh I'm Jason ... um I had a um the thing that I could do to believe that I saw before I had a I had done a little ... ... and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know\nUm and I was in a bone in my life where I didn't really know if God was real or if they do all this you know and I started reading the Bible and everything and then I'm\nGoing back to the point when I was down and you know whatever and uh uh as God and I was like whoa you know your real angels on everything Israel you know show me because I Would like to know I Would like to believe I so I\nIt's probably ... ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later what happened\nWhen I started seeing these little things like with people like a Beagle like these little spirit and stuff\nAnd I'm a well I I think this one guy had three of them\nRight when it seemed like everybody in when he had frenzy everything he did he touch with no I mean you have a one my ... and you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's monkey you didn't have none okay now these kids that you know no\nOh it's a glass of water without knocking over something breaking it up and told me that he was going to get an angel [laughter] but he just didn't have the time and I'm leaving it was kind of be just to show me\nThat you know how it works whatever you know and then we'll go I go to church you know\nI tell my uncle buddy told me oh you do you feel the churches planes to know and I'm so we go to church but why would they church I won't eat them and I started the ... will will be angels\nLike in the early on in the church all over the place all the way around it you know he knew\nIt was a state of behind the Greek and I'm In a way around it and I had never seen anything like that you know like we will be I mean it was like oh the ... foot tall like\nHaley offering her resignation I'm not running for trying twenty what are we doing it\nBrett Kavanaugh is confirmed gates what's happening now there is one answer and when he does in the face from Congress people Boston talks about it\nAnd you don't give power do an angry left wing mob white here I don't know what the Democratic Party is more ... but then it's not okay\nWe are a little boy so by that and I am six eighty W.
