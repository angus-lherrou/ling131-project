{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Through the appeal with a universe Davis is never going to court this is just in the university but you know at the end of it all people are paying me between ten and Fifteen thousand dollars and that's a very high legal bills that you don't get that money back and most people can't afford that you know you're paying for it to go to school\nAlready a lot of people have more than one child that's just money that you don't get back and it's not fair you know just the whole thing is not fair because there's no punishment for the woman\nIs the lies or tells you know I mean there's no way to say it if she lived to tell us something that is not true and ... the man is is exonerated there's no discipline for the for the girl and there should be there should be some discipline for the woman is details ally\nWell that's a that's why my next question was do you just answered my next question because\nIf if a woman knows that number one if she brings in a legitimate case forward she's going to go for them and protect the treatment but never to have proven that she's totally wrong and then backs away from the charge of the last minute like this one of her name was when tech or something or the third case in the cabinet case\nWhere she was all these gang rapes um there should be some kind of a prosecutorial discretion\nFormer a scoreless oh allegations are certainly this defamation and even if you're a public figure as we have an aunt was uh the yeah this is ... it was very character he has a a defamation specifically for the street had knowledge of the also the statement or reckless disregard for the truth\nIt has to be one or the other so we can have a civil case but they're also want to be room for a criminal case but the uh the real point here is\nThat even with the boss the secretary of education putting in place these new guidelines regulations shouldn't that be in an ideal world embedded in law where the ... the title nine is amended\nAnd that the Congress Murray specifically put those protections for men and women in place in the law so that it's clear as law rather\nThan just as an executive order type of thing because the next administration to reverse that again\nWell are you saying that they should make the ... guidelines\nUm law is that yes\nYeah well yeah and and that that's one concern I think that a lot of people have is that or just can continue the flip flop back and forth but I I think enough of that and that people are starting to understand what's happening and that people have been affected by this\nWeather by a friend a son who ever\nThat Hitler starting to understand it and once that everyone is educated as to what's really happening on college campuses I don't think we're going to go backwards I think we're going to move toward fairness and in the process because that's what you know that's what our country is about itself out innocent until\nProven guilty you get to be the person who is the key thing you have to prove their case they get to you and there's a standard a bird that they have to meet you know unfortunately with the school it's a very low it's at it's fifty percent to the point ... percent if they believe\nThe the girl ever the guy that the girl when\nBut that's going to change I Believe with that then do the the new standards I think it'll be Seventy percent which is a clear and convincing it's not really a percentage but that's kind of the way to think about it and\nI've I've always thought it was Seventy five but whatever it is it's a they usually use clear and convincing him in cases of a a parental rights with the child or a ... really if you get\nReally a beyond reasonable doubt because it's a felony but you know we're not in a court but you know one thing you just said it is happening and I hadn't thought of it that way but the case all that I mentioned earlier anytime there is the last day there is the case law that comes out of it now that is\nA law and that precedent and has to be followed unless it overturned and it's very difficult to overturn that part of what we follow in our court system and eat out for those people who don't understand that\nThat court we follow other cases once a higher court makes a decision all lower courts are mandated to follow that decision if they're in that same district or area\nSo there are some good case law and then very good decisions coming out of the sixth circuit and hopefully that'll spread to the U.S\nIs there is no doubt that are paying court saying that had a very good feeling it how it will and that there when\nThey get there and yeah no I think they're I think that's right um yeah\nLook everyone's rights should be protected and you never you never know maybe even madam Justice Ginsburg will say yeah this is a good a good idea you know you never know\nYou can actually stuck it out on this and has said that this kid a wasted a fair we cannot take away a profit right man that not I'm not right I mean that's just Ginsburg is very much on the side of her acting day process\nWell I think that was a big influence from Scalia don't you probably can\nReally do understand the process and they they you know they're appointed for life I mean they don't have anything to really crave than anybody and I and I even think that they let the law and you want to have the right decision late\nI think that's how I look at the truth is that I Know what this is a different subject but several times there were nine to nothing you've animals decisions against ... Obama and that included of course a\nA Kagan and Saddam iron prior uh and then Ginsberg on the left they voted against him on certain categories of ... through a three or four times there was a unanimous decisions against what he did\nSo uh yeah they take it and look at ... ... there was thought to be conservative wasn't a Sandra Day O'Connor that didn't live out to be what people thought she would be so you never know and once they get to the position they are going to carry it out as they see fit\nBecause president no longer under the influence over them or we only have a minute left what do you make a Hillary saying that building not abuse it was not an abuse of power against Monica Lewinsky even though she was an intern and he was a president of the United states and that they should not have resigned what what's your thought\nWell [laughter] I just think that that ... that everything at dealing with the title nine card and you know and then at at Seventy\nProfessors tip and it is and that you know if that happened there was not an hour or an insulin then why in the world are we having these cases that I'm fighting or with professors it's ridiculous it's it's absolutely ridiculous\nYeah and I'm a ... a clearly even though she was consensual\nObviously she's a an early twenties at the time or he's the president and um and even if she was open to what he should have known better that's the real point uh well I just don't get it all\nRight that's the only state that I mean you know\nWhat it was just said that and that's really all I have to say about that that was yeah I agree with you and it was actually correct well listen that's a great to have you got to have to have you back\nOr good luck and continuing the great work that you're doing a really protecting justice and I don't say that the academically I say there's a real world a description of what you this if I can bring on the shoulder to talk to you\nSee anything that might have a great evening to Mike Segal here because the U.S off in the world the world will be good to you\nThis is George ... from coast to coast am and History Channel ... we are proud to promote amazing energy nutrition and skin care products from Jeanette ... passionate\nAbout redefining you through revolution free products visit gee see in life dot com for products like luminous from Dr Nathan Newman the luminous anti aging skin Caroline restores youthful by Taliban radiance to your skin reducing the appearance of fine\nLines and wrinkles with stem cell technology there's also instantly ageless which worked within two minutes reducing under I bags fine wines wrinkles in porch noble nominated doctor Vincent Jim ... medical advisor has designed several product's helping the body perform\nBetter through naturally occurring plant compounds Jennifer products up a thirty day money back guarantee they're available was up to twenty five percent preferred\nPrice discount see all of the amazing generic products at ... dot com that G C and life dot com\nDV might pound pale on his way home hope it gets out of there [laughter]\nWhat else is going on gay marriages\nMen on and I've ...

million of getting it\nHowever India has had fifty thousand cases over the last couple of years was cut short rate down to one in ten thousand\nSo what we want to make sure that it's not coming in and

world who's at risk what are the long term effects what's the prevention and most important what's the treatment to this infection\nWell that's a good it's scary though Gary why does it affect just children apparently around it\nMay it may be a because of the the respiratory virus that was out last year called de sixty eight really hit children ... very hard and put a lot of mental hospital and they noticed an association between\nSevere respiratory infection engine children and uh the acute flattered paralysis\nSo it's usually a you have to watch out for is that about a week or so after

the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately\nWhat was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called my gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even hitched it he's the one who probably pitched it to the network ...\nAfter that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time in episode we say ah you know rod would have done this\nOr you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell he never a novel he did write your collections of short stories ... sure but I'm getting the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually the stories that made up the night gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary\nI'm ... but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be removed and the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out\nOr is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for it where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so\nIt's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is they launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how\nYou know how classic these shows are that can be ... re introduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wandering around surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was in a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was he didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for it on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling a so he did get coal credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of\nYou know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I I clarify in the book\nSome of these is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it that he was a\nHeat you know Carol certainly was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift\nShe said that he wanted to believe he had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of\nYou know the crop circles and you know they only visitations and UFO sightings and all kinds of stuff but he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or\nAnything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies\nA rod narrated some very popular ah documentaries about this kind of

... about every two months\nYou know every one of these shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of the experiences at a combat soldier during World War two and which I you know it was all about the the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd the everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes it's hard to say which is my favorite but I think it has to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber\nComing home from Italy crashes in the desert that they can't do that airplane didn't go on that mission for whatever reason which was Robert Cummings Bob comings I'm Sorry ... and up Bob companies just happened to be walking by and seen his newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert\nAnd ah he

psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him to add a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock of seeing an airplane on the newspaper just recently you know and when it when the

Santa Claus in a department store I end the call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all times the guy was all a shrine [laughter]\nBut when he got a break from the department store you went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was two grown man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down and he went in the back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bag just all of a sudden became full of gifts instead of a you know empty cans\nMan he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story you know and the guy who ran a department store\nThey found call well
