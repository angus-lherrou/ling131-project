of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last seven eight years and focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always\nReading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like they were when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it'll say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got

us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big foot Wildman and giants and

when they were kids they had a big foot encounter in the mountains of the fear of\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they've found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar encounter and they said you know if you have Twenty years of a police officer you have years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace you know your kids to raise that\nUs out with this we really we really want to find out and

Boston in my heart radio station [noise]\n\n\nWe'll come back we're talking with David polite us about big wild man and giants the newest book an archive of articles that go way back to sixteen eighty a describing these creatures people whatever you want to call them\nAnd before the break David Was explaining how he and some colleagues had collected a whole bunch of samples dozens and dozens of samples that were submitted to\nMarry a a very precise DNA kind of testing the paper that was written by Dr Melba catch them maybe had some personal um observations that didn't belong in the paper but the\nThe DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\nWell that's the part that I I don't think a lot of people understand it a this wasn't some half ale treatment it was\nIt was the best of the best that DNA was sent to force certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake all of the labs got the same results or was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nBut if you go into their area and you kill one of them they'll kill three of you and then they're going to explain that they have certain abilities that you don't understand\nThat you could think that you're around and maybe a coyote or bird is right near you when in reality it's going to be them and they have this incredible ability to mimic anything that they want\nWith incredible strength in size\nAnd when they said that there another tribe of people\nThis community and the big foot world that\nIs very adamant that they're an ape throws this completely off the wall and when you dig deeper in it most Native American tribes in fact probably Ninety nine percent say it's another type of people were tribe and this article goes right to that point\nAnd nobody was ever written a book before tribal ever brought that out\nAnd when I when I found it I couldn't believe that nobody was talking about it and it it's stunning still that nobody wants to talk about it\nYeah I Wonder what those tribes if they're still around would say about it now\nYears later nine years while I can\nI can tell you that being around tribes in the mid west and in the west like Harvey and I were it's consistent they still say that it's a type of people\nYou know the descriptions of course as you have noted that the term big what started to Nineteen fifty eight so before then people had other words for it and it and then many or most of the early clippings and stories that you've collected they call them wild man of course I guess that would fit I mean\nThey they're humanoid shape they're out in the forest there Harry\nUm they don't know what else to call them\nSo walks like a man walked upright and doesn't walk bent over and their knuckles aren't dragging on the ground like an ape um\nIf I I always tell people I said well if it's an animal then it's probably going to be found and it's probably going to be identified and you could probably go view and study\nAnd wild man that's a different sort of thing it's a different kind of topic very elusive\nA ... I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and studied them year after year so they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the ape gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it's never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever\nBut we have how odd while or giant human bones found and that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles are ... are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old Fred's so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown here all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I chuckled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows huh how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a snake long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter\nThe famous and counter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things were written about what Daniel called I think it was like yeah\nYeah yeah yeah\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it sure seemed possible but again if you went in to the quote unquote credible archive you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what\nMaybe some exporters wrote about that they hurt in which we encountered so but again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an ex or from the Watergate church\nWas coming across country on a horse and he wrote in his explore note that this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked at him I actually spoke to him\nLarge hairy bypass said he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or ... and it came from the archives whether they church butter de saint church and it's in there so to say that these things haven't happened ...\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from\nSeptember Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wild white mass landed in a field releasing a huge error covered being that we're seeing briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive\nUm big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on or about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm a woman for a while I don't think anybody's ever heard of that\nAnd a book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of do the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big topic it was a starter I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and

Boston I'm In my heart radio station [noise]\n\n[noise]\n... you know looking back at your ... your original book Hooper project that it's still all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nThese look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are they looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's a general consensus\nSort of match what other tribes dated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to find a group or an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson ... film I and it's you know if people can argue about all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but then that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up in this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nSo when I did with ah the given one film\nIt and one thing Harvey has the ability yet is let's say somebody goes into a bank Rob the bank has a beard on has a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving larvae have this innate ability to take the beard off the face\nShe can see with the face looks like so you can identify the suspect\nSo apply that to the Patterson gambling film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad it's in tribal Bigfoot and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your ... accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentation to conferences they sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members of people from northern Ukraine ah people from China and I put these pictures up there\nAnd it's it's phenomenal how different humans look\nIf they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just fall was ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah if you were a space aliens you came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ... you know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from a ... it's because we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I ... I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just sign of playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen in a lake playing like kids in the water\nUm it's again the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big boy that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought the big for was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut that's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em cramped up\nSo when you hear these stories I hear these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge Wildman carrying all women and children\nYou know there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the name there and if somebody's writing about it and say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter\nSay oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or\nIt it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman or policemen credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history\nOr so there's something to this they got gotta skew where they said they started looking like him or apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and I don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one\nMaybe some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill one it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and a invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nRussia's deputy foreign minister Sergei ... tells Russia's state news agency test they're breaking the agreement would be a very dangerous step during a rally in Nevada on Saturday Trump said the U.S is going to pull out of the landmark deal because Russia has an honored the agreement\nFormer president Ronald Reagan in Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed a treaty eliminating intermediate range nuclear missiles in Nineteen eighty seven deem you CIO NBC News radio\nThe Trump Administration is reportedly moving ... end legal recognition of transgender individuals\nThe New York times reports that the department of health and Human Services is now mounting an effort to legally defined that person's gender as either male or female as determined by their genitals at birth\nIs implemented the policy would reverse Obama era rules that recognized and protected transgender individuals under federal civil rights law\nRepresentative Peter King told ABC's This week that Saudi Arabia needs to be upfront with the United states about the disappearance and death of Washington Post columnist ...\nWhat happened here was ... or we can go along with the cover story\nTo show he disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul October second\nA powerful hurricane is turning off the coast of Mexico the newly formed hurricane has now become a category ... storm with maximum sustained winds of a hundred and thirty miles per hour\nPresident Trump is blaming Democrats for the migrant caravans headed to the U.S in the first of a series of tweets Trump said the U.S is doing what he can to stop the caravan from crossing the southern border Trump called the caravans a disgrace to the Democratic party and urged immigration laws to be changed immediately\nYou are listening to the latest from NBC News radio\n[noise] the greater Boston food bank distributes millions of pounds of food annually to feed our regions hungry just fifty dollars could provide one hundred and fifty meal [noise] find out how you can help G.

one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis he became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer ... non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nHere from dark\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen ah most ah teenagers are Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was it was the ship that carry the bomb and sunk\nAnd add to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library [laughter]\nImagine that and you know through looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I Hope someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I thought out what I could but thought you know someone will tell this story before I'm old enough to do it\nAnd yeah flash forward graduated from college and then we'll know ones pulled the story and you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to me of the men who survived Indianapolis and\nI mean yeah I was a kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd land for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very tight and project from either way I got involved when\nI had actually been praying I'm I pray that my work and I had been proud\nTo have\nAn opportunity to work on an iconic for over a two story and\nAll of a sudden in two thousand eleven additive flu I get this\nEmail from that young filmmakers mum Sarah glad it\nWell what they didn't say about her journey with an apple with with that I'm ... and ... and a half of the storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay\nAnd she actually did that she wrote a an eight part little theory than if they stick to a major production company and they said hey this is the ... and we found a brother\nThat we only the theory then but\nSo you're going to need right if I have seen writer I don't know how to write so very family and friends she read that and and they contact with me\nAnd I'm no number one that I Am a movie that are in now that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting to fight and I wanted to help rewrite the book [laughter] ...\nThat I had to figure out how to manipulate or in LA helper or\nEventually over the course of several months we finally met and then a ... agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest into twenty four and um and then when we did a project and a half\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people who had who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know like I knew a small part of that um that was definitely part\nOf what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective was to tell the whole story of this shit you know she'd been reduced to\nThinking story or shark story\nAnd no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral Brent commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well you know everyone's gotta know what it incredible shift is less than what she did um besides being sent [noise]\nWell I'll tell you grab ... my father was a at Okinawa and he ... he drove a landing a craft from uh the ships took good troops on the shores so of course you know that the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those conflicts grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the capitalize version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that that you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis and their mentioned ... ... ... ... ... ... and I'm a small part that\nA lot of people don't know is that she with the flagship at the battle of half an hour where your father or the\nWrong and crap and um\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was the case of hitting in the shore of environment and during that time and

Boston in our radio station [noise]\n\n\nSaloon Vincent I interrupted you before the break we were about to tell me about the uh Japanese commander a little bit\nYes a commander ... lieutenant commander ...\nAnd everything we tried to present the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great use the ... um\nWell it was it and then more sports that we've published after the war who first published in Nineteen fifty two and Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from commander had him at a point of view and there was a chapter on his devoted to Indianapolis\nBut because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality alive he was the commander who cared for his men he was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and\nReally against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military um he went around Bain on doors asking\nAnd one of those harrowing stories was where you know there were\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and then we're spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark and ... attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks ... things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um attacks increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so sick they could walk on their back you know from shark the shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them\nThere's one account you have the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking down the stretch they oh there's food I'll just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young and some by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off and thinking he was going to wiggling toes as bait to learn the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realize oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was\nNearly out of his head at this point and put a stock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here\nYou know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship\nAh everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines the um and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but as Sarah mentioned there were only a sixteen rap\nBetween there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so\nWere so any water that was available with only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in in the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were ten men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others who although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration\nItself with perversely causing them to their faculties lose their ability to reason that\nSome of them to come to the idea that they train them so out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one court the water through it into the into his mouth and thinking that that would train of thought that well of course they didn't and then other when you take small heard is that he water\nI'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would begin golfing it like they were hoping it out of the mountain stream\nAnd what happened with that is a condition called hyper ... and\nBoy it that for for\nBlood cell ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their head and um they die very horrible that from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander um who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself something else has to be around either that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh that must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess in immediately that it did sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who winds up testifying at the court marshal later a un American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention uh we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and here with an army pilot he was transporting a general who wanted and you know that the general death in the cockpit with him and it's the late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see that you know kind of explosion coming from below and\nThere's now report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action though he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah I get the same kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it and he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still at two and a half a navy personnel in Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw that should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know this gentleman Richard ... to have passed away but if then carried on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and at the ... and it didn't line up with\nIt but he didn't find out and tell a few days after\nWhen were released about it that he would\nTalk about Lynn Vincent and Sarah Vladeck about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but there were survivors and what came next is a equally amazing we'll be right back\nFind out more about two nights just log on to coast to coast am dot com\nFads revolve\nWe have\nMaybe we get a weekend of debates right here in Massachusetts\nBe easy [laughter] probably too is Ernie Banks used to say one friday one Sunday change him deals blows the cap on or I don't know but I gotta feeling we'll be talking about CNN more than any of us really one to the Senate debate on friday and then again on Sunday and we'll be talking about it and they say a\nHuman baby weekday morning six they've had a little boys still Boston\nW.

Boston I'm In my heart radio station [noise]\n\n\nBeen since I Wonder if you could discuss for me in a broad sort of strokes are the sequence of improbable events that seemingly combined or conspired to make things worse as if things just sort of drop through the cracks or that made their survival you've been more improbable\nWell as Sarah mentioned there with the the um\nDeparture message that didn't go through from ... to the Philippines there was the lieutenant on the Philippines side who had received a message saying that if\nA ... it's a combat and ship arrived there didn't need to be a report made well\nHe wasn't the brightest guy in the world\nAnd a as a matter of fact had received a a fitness report saying as much but he thought well\nIf I don't have to reporter rivals the combatant ships I guess that means I don't have to report and non arrivals either and then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the impending invasion of the Japanese home islands\nSo all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combined to make it says in Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until a PD one venture a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors responded in the water\nThere is a very poignant story you tell in the books are about these pilots do dropped all the supplies and trying to get these uh guys in the water or something you hang onto their they can't do any more they're out of supplies they have to hit back in there was one guy who's swimming way up\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I don't know where he was swimming do or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being so terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left on your plane to help this little loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to any of these men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives like they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take for you know our ship or else the VP the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't say one more man and he's still alive and you know that was a burden they carried till the end of their lives\nYou know it's war time as when the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and there's a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but ah [noise] is it an accident that this story was kept out of the newspapers into BJ day well reporters\nAre reporting on at that at reporting on the incident at the times did not believe it was an accident so the rescue occurred\nBeginning on August second\nUh Nineteen forty five and the war ended on August fourteenth that between the time zones fourteenth fifteenth Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk the newspapers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it\nUntil the jade de until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five I mean Seventy two point headlines\nYou know Japan quit the war is over and then maybe below the fold in a very small article you with us Indianapolis cruiser sunk and reporters that time\nBelieved that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that was\nYou know resulted in the last of almost nine hundred men on the very brink of the end of the war\nSyria talked to me about the captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and then was the court marshal inevitable let him slide given that the war just did or did they have to pursue this\nWill really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is\nA tremendous loss for the navy and you know so many people and it was a very public you know [noise]\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan are over Japan was announced to the world and people are out celebrating the ... in the streets but their families now grieving that their son or their brother uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so\nYou know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who was involved and who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to the sinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one knew they were missing and that they were left out there to die you know\nSomeone needed to be to blame\nAnd a lot of people got blamed right\nThere were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there was a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that\nThese are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented this situation and so really you know at the time these names the you know admiral king and ruin limits and\nThese these men who were essentially the rock stars of that area you know we won the war and\nIn the American public you know holds these men on this high platform and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom\nAnd have them testify in tarnish their name like I don't think that the navy wanted to take that route and essentially you know the captain is responsible for the vessel so the moment that he was brought\nTo court martial there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA little ... to talk about the court martial of our mentioned earlier uh the unusual step of bringing the the Japanese commanders to justify that had never happened before and then I guess the main thrust of the argument against the captain that he failed to the exact the exact thing could have prevented the the Japanese from sinking ship\nThat was one of the two churches um and not only was it unprecedented to bring in commander how she might have to testify but it was unprecedented that a captain with the court martialed at all\nFor having his shit sunk in World War two there were hundreds of vessels fund and captain Charles McVeigh was the only cabinet and he was court martialed\n[noise] excuse me and I'm so glad he did have to charges against him one was and by the way the navy we we found in a records because we went to the national archives we went to the library of Congress Naval War college ah and so forth\nAnd we found these records where\nThe navy was actually casting about to find that charge that they thought would pick\n'em and as Sarah mentioned they were all these leading lights of the Pacific war who were involved in this you know\nThe the commander of the civic forces the commander in Guam and these were men who had really been the architects of this new global the power\nAnd admiral Ernest King who was the fleet admiral our theory is that he didn't want to see all these leading lights dragged into open court and so that's why they were casting about for something that would stick\nWith McVeigh and so what they charged him with was\nFailure to call a band and shit in a timely manner which was quickly disproven because there were a lot of witnesses who [noise]\nUm heard him call abandoned ship and then heard it passed man demand the second ship as you are the second charge rather as you mentioned was failure to think that\n...
