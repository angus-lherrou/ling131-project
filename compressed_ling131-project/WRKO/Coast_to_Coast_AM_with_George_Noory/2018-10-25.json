Obamas and others\nHe used in the in the speech tonight if you heard as he is measured remarks to begin with\nThe public figures have a duty to tone down their rhetoric\nWe saw the opposition Democrats\nAccused him of condoning violence and dividing Americans\nHe went on to say\nIn his speech tonight\nNo one should carelessly compare and political opponents\nTo historical villains\nWhich has done all the time\nHe said we should not mind people in public places or destroyed public property\nThere is one way to settle our disagreements is called peacefully at the ballot box\nThe president said as part of a larger national effort to bridge or divides and bring people together the media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone\nAnd stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false\nFortunately at least in this case\nOne of the reports that came out\nFrom a news wire service\nThe CNN\nIs known for its robust coverage of the Trump Administration and for constantly provoking vi or of the president\nSo at least the knowledge that\nJeff Zucker the president of CNN\nSaid there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media\nIs that words matter those far they've shown no comprehension of that well I'm a ... year people were words matter how about the fact that nobody at CNN\nI have seen or heard reporting by anyone\nAt CNN Wolf Blitzer\nAaron whatever her name is Jake Tapper Chris Cuomo\nAnd certainly go to MSNBC it's the same thing\nWith Morning Joe and his fiance and all the people there wonder is there ever any thing positively acknowledged about this president it doesn't happen\nWhen Eric Holder the attorney general said when the Republicans are down kick them\nNobody's set of warned about that that's pretty violent thing to do when somebody's down on the ground the ... cold or is that what you do\nMaybe you need to be shown how to be kicked holder\nIt is absolutely ludicrous\nNinety One or Ninety three percent somewhere in that range of CNN stories are negative about the president\nSomething like eighty eight percent of the New York times the numbers are way up there for all of those left wing radical media\nLast week for example\nAnd association\nRepresenting the White House correspondents\nCame out and accused the president of cheerleading violence against the media\nAnd at that time the president applauded and a song by a congressman on a reporter\nWell that's not the most advisable thing to do even and find them obviously the president was doing at sarcastically\nI think most people want to get that he wouldn't actually\nPhysical armed or Puerto by a politician\nThen they make the claim that\nEven though he says it ingest\nTo arouse his fan base\nWould take him seriously\nAnd create violence\nSo this thing has brought out\nAnd maybe the maybe in a sense the good thing that's come out from this\nIs that everybody will tone it down I don't agree with Jeff Flake very often the retiring US Senator\nThe point that he made his that he was asked on CNN about\nThe president's rhetoric\nBut he also pointed out that it's on all sides he didn't name Maxine Waters but somebody who says getting their face getting their back pocket\nHarass them rank them go to their homes go to their places of or go to their restaurants where they're out to dinner and then the other night when McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao went out to dinner and they brought home a doggy bag somebody grabbed it drew in the street\nIf that's not violence what is now it's not violence against the person but it's certainly\nAnd just maybe\nThey should have a\nProsecutors in that case had his security arrest take the person to the local police station and filed charges because it's become a because these people think they can do whatever they want to do whenever they want to do it and get away with it and in large measure that measure they do and they can for the simple reason\nThat they are protected on the left\nBy this sick or for the crowd of media on the left side of the aisle\nAnd it just continues and that goes on\nAnd that is frankly\nVery troubling to this country the media may say you should not call us the enemy of the people to the president but then they need to say we're going to do more reasonable coverage of the good things that are happening in this administration which are huge\nAnd that's the problem with these media\nThey don't cover all the great results that are happening\nCivil point

to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know thing he's created an environment so somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that now you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict from our authorities and the intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country\nI'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroke but we have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica is best when we can debate ideas\nVigorously these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing and try to assassinate former presidents and leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever that whoever it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on it what you had on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you want on there that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George this right\nHere it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wake up call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat as your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast\n[laughter] but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you bid on it I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability in this we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others\nHe was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go and his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's in turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or you know if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep their ... their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced and law enforcement\nUh individuals and are individuals in institutions and in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and who ever did this with somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again\nI Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd be somebody on the left that did this\nAnd you got most of the media thing that President Trump still this weight\nShut up wait let the intelligence officials do their job then wants their job is completed and they've determined who'd done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and\nCome together as one country we are the United states of America you know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that just the way empires ours tablets and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did it in in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye ... ...\nWe will talk this week

my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this\nYou want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my son he tape recorder out I went ... interviewed Stanton Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some libel dense with me I think I'm going to be with you an alien fest the end of January up near the big beer and I think\nSo at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo ... tell me tell me what's going on in the field of view ... these days I mean you you were out\nThere way in the beginning telling people about you ... talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out what's the latest based on your work your research [noise] well\nI think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there you said there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal well the latest word\nBegat looks like there's about one point six climates per star I bring galaxy star\nAnd our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion stars all\nThat means one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the darn plays\nAnd you know and that changed as our picture we used to think we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization ... around and\nWe're at the top of the heap well roll over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long\nAnd leave plenty of room and other wars\nFor others and we've come to realize that you know get in here from mayor is not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a farmer's comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that uh you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars in that I Can't be much crepes and back and forth now we realize I Would look we're fusion for example ... you\nCan get ... hours\nWe also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop mushroom club that their world was created and four thousand B. C. that's right can't be too late beings around you know well he was on for a little bit four billion be seen as\nThey are just a little the little\nUh our ... natural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things [laughter]\nThe ultimate you know her full name [laughter] um we're beginning to realize the busy place out there\nAnd there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently and they seem to be all over the place ... as a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization or maybe people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying with the mirror throws a climate that they put an incarcerated\nPeople you know like yeah like a personal ad boy guy's been brought on earth [laughter]\nThere you never know the way they've been treating people ... it's it's you're\nStanding you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of ... kind of the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that well we think there's one point six planets for stars so lead to a huge number of planets and\nYou know they're probably come in here\nUh I I'd have been left that there's only a few thousand points you know if there were a life out there and we see it ... you know they would make contact and land on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think it's more like realizing but at North America has more than a few people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place and wait but makes us less important than we'd like to think we are\nAnd are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOil or or still slapped [laughter]\nAnd and so uh what most of us all learned that\nIt's a more complex place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAs much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age range of climate the stars and things like that and uh hey we're not number oh oh no [laughter] no ... and so what we\nAnd you can tell from another thing or the military budget on a blind and about a trillion dollars this year or so we haven't changed much have we\nKnow that it'll have\nDon't get the goodies of our from their work [noise]\nUh we take for leaving 'cause we're stocking up on and on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature a lot it appears to be close to what it is [laughter] I'm not going to try to explain why or how what are we know enough to say that ah\nIt's awful lot of energy available to them in the universe [laughter] you know I've gone to the sequence of I Know huh how long does it take to get some place how ... the nearest person on almost kind of stuff in the universe\nOn the conversation ...

there\nI totally agree and I didn't know about this matter is Margaret from like super who also is a former police officer he lives in Carmel New York\nAnd he um somehow got connected with officer

officers are over a two nights band that actually solve this creature so it was the original two witnesses that reported hearing just God awful shrieking sounds coming out of the woods\nAnd they reported it to the local police and so the first night there were I Believe five police officers present and then the second night there were two more present\nAnd had these I Witness accounts of this

assassination\nThose people in the car by John Connelly was never in that bar there was never six people in there\nThat strange I'm trying to remember bill a there was John Kennedy and Jackie in the back seat there was a secret service agent in the driver's seat and then other in the past and there was another in the past it was only four I remember right\nWell no I I remember governor calmly and his wife big in that car as well because supposedly governor Connelly with its head off though with one of those bullets well\nNo you're right the governor calmly was in front of him because he ... he had one of the bullets\nMagic bullet\nBut we're was a were was his wife\nTo his left so Conley was in front of Kennedy and his wife was to his left\n... but the car was a front seat back seat right or was there a third seat their third narrow the third\nSeat there and I can't remember if the if the seat was um\n[noise] with Connelly and his wife ...\nWill you will you know now when you are you know you don't buy the con Connelly\nAnd ... the artistic sketches of the shooting where they track the bullet Connelly was sitting in front of the president\nSo he got he but but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was that I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president or the way I liked the front seat I think he was in the front\nAnd so the so governor calmly and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they weren't another so it it would have been another dog sitting there and then they\nDrive early or any other Secret Service agent was on the passenger side so you would have had six people\nAnd that would have been six that strange route and Tom is looking at it and what do you ... to can you turn Tom spike up for just one second Denny to put your speaker ... tell me what you're saying\nWell I just I just pulled up does approved her film\nAnd I'm watching them come over and what is described Kennedy and back with his wife right and uh but when you can you hear me 'cause I'm I'm looking at the film right now I hear you [noise] and uh\nAnd then a congressman front there I don't see a third row of seats I I didn't I don't remember seeing the third row either belt thanks top okay\nYeah that's amazing and and again I'm that's why I always thought that it was your Secret Service agents at the front seat and then a second row with Governor currently and his wife and his wife was to his law president\nAt Jackie were in the back and Jackie was to his left\nIt straight I mean I definitely do the secret service agent was on the front driving because everybody accused him of out turning around shooting the president uh yeah and I don't believe that happened\nBut I you know again I think about this study that as well because William Cooper is one thing that I write you know I thought about it I thought okay well the driver would have had broken left and that if that's the case and also [noise]\nHe's driving so they'd have to take his eyes off the road to turn and then make perfect shot you know with it by hand\nAnd everybody wants

you're the greatest ... personal to her\nWell she's very ... let's say it that way she's very kind\nKnow Geron dome and maybe one of the only people we know who loves to read you board folks as you know I'm opposed to it on and want to use it when Karen feels very secure with a I guess one could say Karen it has to do with who the user right\nGeorge has to do with the user your intentions that has to do with the reason why are you the number one and also\nWhat why people forget it has to do with your own perceptions beliefs and what you think about and how you view yourself within the world I mean if you have a lot of fears that you're going to drop to you but when you're you have common sense about yourself and uses tool for the place of love\nA from a place of light or the place of wanting to explore to discover then the whole the whole atmosphere around this tool changes\nSome people believe that the ... opens up a portal to allow the evil spirits and introduced to come through what's your thoughts on that\n[noise] you sure ... and this goes back to what you believe or your perceptions of the world and Sullivan will believe and that they're earning power that they're just the pond to their world\nAnd when my work really is about beyond the board it really is about teaching people to find their empowerment their core strength then and that is found by remembering\nRecalling who they are the divine beings and that they are an extension of sorts incarnate when you come from a place of that kind of ... and beyond that kind of belief system those kinds of intentions\nThen you get what you desire you get you get a whole different\nWay of communicating in communion with the unseen dimensions I mean the war that I Do with this tool is no different than somebody who channels or works with a K. two meter and paranormal investigations or read stroke cars are using ... to name a few it's really similar principle you have your attention set\nYou use it only as a tool you have ... there's no hidden spirits and view or power inside of these chunk of wood or of cardboard or glass or whatever they're made out of its within yourself the board is strictly a permission to allow yourself to access your own internal abilities to work in Israel\nHave you ever had a bad ...\n[noise] no I haven't had bad the worst I've ever had with somebody cussing at me once and the more and this is many years ago this back in Nineteen\nEighty screw through the board they were costing\nThe board but let me tell you this George I people write to me and asked this question all the time you don't continue to engage if somebody in life if I'm if I'm like standing in line you know maybe get a check out the grocery store and somebody gets really rude\nI'm going to not engage with that person I'm going to move away walk away or not engage 'cause you don't you just make it worse and so the same thing with this tool you don't engage and\nAll I did was say you can't talk to me that way I'm bored he might have board on our dog had\nGoing good and going and that's it and it works that way now works that way because of my own beliefs\nAbout where this energy these efforts are coming from they're coming from me if I Believe everything's negative and I'm fearful of everything that's one of the draw to me I mean there are lower energy is out there and once I realized I had the empowerment with me that I could really\nA strict in myself internally then everything changed from Nineteen eighty six on it's been just wonderful beautiful experiences\nWho's moving the plant ya urine is it the individual ... spirit behind it who's moving\nWell let me answer that from a few different directions one as many people believe is the idiot motor effect which really basically means your mind as controlling the movement and so the subtle movements of your muscles through the power suggestion is making the plants shut move okay that's one possibility\nAnother one is is that it's some kind of animal magnetism or mid ... that's occurring through your body and these are some old thoughts they would go way back to the Eighteen hundreds\nThat's one thought about it to a third one is a is that you were actually connecting with some energy outside of yourself and it's working with you for that plant shut the moving spell out messages\nThat's Beijing worked with an inch and really absolutely\nAmazing and I will say this uh the group of beans I mean working with and I've talked to him before I talked about um before on your show than work with with this group since Nineteen Ninety four I call them the guides they've explained it to me that's what they say\nWhen you come to the plant chat you set your intentions and whether you with a partner or by yourself I prefer to work with a partner I just get better results that way\nOur energy combines together reaches up to a level of vibrations like Tunisia frequency to get the vibration I Want to connect with and they lower there is to reach our frequency so we can connect to the middle somewhere and that energy is what allows messages to flow the plan to move and for for all the communications to happen\nWe're going to take your phone calls at the half worth ... your questions and maybe your review board stories if you want to share them with us a I've never I've never known you the cure and\nTo put somebody down if they don't like to read you board that I appreciate it\nWell I you know that that's the way I mean that's what life is I mean we have one of your earlier guest was talking about the divisiveness\nAnd this tool creates a lot of controversy which can create divisiveness Roche and I'm not for that I'm for having discussion about it I'm from people having different opinions\nThis tool is not for everybody um any of them doing this work is not for everybody whether you use a tool that's kind of floor or a different one so I think it's great to become together have a discussion we all different points of view and not that one's rider one's wrong with that we can exist now now I Will say this George\nIn the group the talking board Historical Society there is a great diversity of a among stuff with all of us believe it doesn't work some of some of his leaves it works because if you didn't motor and a few of us might believe it works because we're actually connected with an energy outside of herself\nBut we can all exist together have love for this board for the history of the board and share that and the public with people and it doesn't matter if we believe on the opposite ends of the spectrum so we weren't at war group that actually shows that you can get along [laughter] have different opinions without condemning
