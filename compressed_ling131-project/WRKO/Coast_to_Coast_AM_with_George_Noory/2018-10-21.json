{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "[noise] yeah I had a plane on the app does well at the at the national they hear anyone um other interests bonds hit with a therapist\nAt about why it's good that more women are running and representation matters so that people say like hey when I grow up I can run for office to that's the thing that went into and I know you guys don't perceive this\nAs being a problem but it's actually well documented cognitive biased common among men that they perceive\nTheir or more when his participation is actually happening showman pictures are crowded scene if it's twenty five to thirty three percent women they think it's fifty fifty no way the fifty they think there's more yeah I don't have the money they make their way and\nThen I've been I've been in plenty of libertarian meetings and I can easily tell you how many women there are those are those that were around her\nCity I was just like for now they've got like teachers that crowd scenes when they when they're not sitting you're able to individually count every individual when it's actually a fifty fifty or even be way more women will\nSay earlier him for the reference I didn't say that there was an equal amount of winnow as there is to men idea where anybody\nSo that\nYeah and also like did they also do another thing where if they record meetings in which women and men participate in equal amounts of time in terms of minutes talking and it's fifty fifty men versus the conversation is being dominated by women\nSo there is a well documented I didn't even by is common among men that a lot to psychological experiments on it were men think that women are participating more and president more than we actually are\nI Love those yeah some of the we need more land\nI'd love to see some of the cross tabs on sort of the demographics of are we talking about conservative Christian men right when they hear a woman's speaking\nOh she is dominating the conversation she needs to just sit down and shut up and may say a good question what's the view of the problem with the problem\nWith most psychology researcher the vast amount of the sample samples are\nYou know call I call it he undergraduate to needed extra credit or quick twenty bucks college boy and he actually being in the methodology sections of low cycle psychology razors where\nDo they get their research subjects they put an ad up on campus so right a lot of what we think is you know ... what you know upper middle class American college students can eat a box\nHow they white college boys are going to go and party you know and spend all their twenty dollars on liquor that\nNight yeah and I'm trying to imagine this we need a bunch of college boys to come in and see a bunch of women and tell us what you think yeah yeah it seems\nInteresting nonetheless them I'm not denying the the result but I I I Do agree\nNow at least partially that young girls do need to see female role models\nYou have a politician is not a role model passion is a holiday and you shouldn't be a role model but a lot of people see it as they do and it's wrong which is why I always correct whenever the media is like these are leaders politicians are leaders no they're not they're scum of the earth\nTo a T almost all of them are dishonest and they are trying to rule over the lives of other people and so you know most people should be embarrassed to be seen with politicians gang called the sermon\nOn line what authors you're running for E N O I won't take the auto ...\nOh I Can't I Can't actually take the office if I actually win so go ahead and call me out to\nOh you know I'm not running around the damn who're rambling\nYeah no I I don't think it's uh I I've done my time I I've I've gone into that were on a on a I'm a select man I've I still do some service type stuff for my town but just run for public office but not not my cup of tea\nLook you can get some there are exceptions right Ron Paul's and exception array Darryl Perry's an exception if you actually have a principled libertarian for like Darrell who's running for office and then they want to get in there and they want to dismantle the state I'm much\nExcited about reading the New York marathon\nOn raising money for the Innocence Project you know people ask me how's your campaign going and I look at them I say I don't do anything I'll you know show up if somebody invites me to come somewhere but I'm not going to go out and actually put any effort into this 'cause I Can't imagine why anyone would spend money on the political process it's\nAnd how they just throw money down the whole way and you just wait\nUntil I get my pack set up and start doing uncoordinated expenses on behalf of candidates I might elect something just to annoy you\nYeah well you know like I said I'm not going to take the office because I Can't swear an oath to the state I'm Sorry swearing an oath means something to me and I I'm not going to swear allegiance to the United states government\nAnd I would have a tough time short swearing allegiance to the state government to I don't know I'm anti state so if they were to elect me the only way I could actually take the office is if they let me swear an oath to liberty that everything I Do would be in favor of liberty\nAnd not the states I how could I possibly swearing of how can any libertarian do what I mean I understand\nPeople have to kind of you know compromise themselves in order to take political office but for me I'm not willing to and I'm not going to like cross my fingers and do it that way\nI look forward to court case then because that would be an interesting precedence for you to that one way or the other\nI don't think you could I don't think you could win that case the state has its oath and likely is on modify of all I mean I don't think that there's going to be and I I think they will allow you to change the word swear to affirm yeah but even that I'm not going to ferment oath of allegiance to the United states it would be distasteful to do it to just the state government but\nEven then it's not a little kids too is that you would\nUphold the ... yeah protected defend the constitution and if you want to abolish one of those documents that and you're not really protecting and defending that document\nAnyone Quakers get elected because I Know a girl and I are at what happened the makers get elected\nOr I don't think they run for office but ah right here you go I I Do solemnly swear this is the tax they're not actually swearing\nOr that I Will be her faith and true allegiance and they said Ericka and the state of New Hampshire another added a United States it wasn't in the original right oath of office or an will support the constitution they're up so help okay God\nAll right yeah I I Am I on wrong you know I did not think it said allegiance\nTo the state it does now you know yeah I only wear that does no okay I guess you're with me then [laughter] she's going to happen to you know\nThe lack of what happened\nIt would be I agree with you I'll take it to court yeah it would be very interesting right it'd be very interesting I I don't know if we can find an attorney who would like take it to court for us but that would be fun I think you have one who is a co host\nWe do have in the courtroom right she doesn't

team is the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and his article\nHoudini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that you know why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychics but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake\nPsychic or talking amongst themselves and I think they wanted to wrap them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right in there and have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that\nBut this time with this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why he passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for\n'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to the sky or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and\nAnd the you know the fake media would be totally surprise you and he'd say I'm\nHarry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys are very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled a psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circle sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that area was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nSo let's see what they're going out with Dave's not

experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nA couple of years after the say on\nHe was in a really bad car accident and he was with his sister ... eyes car accident and his healing processes hated by pain killers and some of this is a morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James Pike yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah yeah yeah and\nI think it and I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide the year before now what's Ford did for this high profile say on with it with all the acreage do the trick is\nThe only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up on us Thomas or I Am not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but\nMaybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voice over I T line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nI'm James Pike this was the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide of your earlier and now Ford is doing a say on a Canadian TV [noise] yes\nAnd and he does a little up front research brings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went to his papers and found his research preparing for this say odds and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water for this case the Houdini case as fun as it is and is exciting as it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredited the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just that it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is\nRe catching\nAnd you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nKnow and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top where we'll be higher closer to God and the spirits anyway\nI think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail\nSo she can say that statement\nYeah and you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kind of make that faith for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and Simon and go back with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream belief\nBy your inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine\nAffirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur forty been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the either letter that she wrote to wind chill it also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't do shit with trick she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you in the chair with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being

[laughter] that's not what they're leaving it all makes the case you were asked to go so\nFar right now in the case of FDR um you know this is [laughter] Seventy almost Seventy five years ago three

really even I mean listen it's all\nRight well truth is often uncomfortable it's a it's it's not about necessarily making people feel good it's it's like a scorpion sometimes things [noise] um but you it needs to say you\nDon't paint a flattering picture of of FDR you mentioned a communism\nAlthough you know let's be honest communism was was kind of the fat back then before people knew I guess the real truth about what was happening in Stalin's Russia and the er the programs and the the the the forced a started nations in the Ukraine and so forth um but um let's let's talk about\nA young FDR talk about someone born with a silver spoon in his mouth\nOr paint me I'm a ... a portrait of the young FDR\n... you know lose a I always say news beneficiary or below experiment well this guy\nWas

loss of Maine and how does this and this and that blobs and them being governor of who you are\nA lot of people don't know what the I was governor of New York that are that forgot they're just not talking about it any more\nOr less a you know he was ... main mainly just cause I Know [laughter] all the rules was on a Roosevelt\nMaybe it'll Roosevelt by Roosevelt which was a little odd or the woman that he could change the amount of grammar and part of your life actually\n[laughter] um no I mean\nThis is the evolution of the gift person\nShould at least his cousin teddy was his was a distant cousin was the second or third cousin\nI think it was the second week of right\nAnd and he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he received his younger cousin and the Democrats\nWell they got along really well I'm actually our father wasn't too thrilled about what\nDoes that it's just not the way but he was raised by a that Roosevelt was done anything differently if he was\nUm Jordan early a bowl on their special in like almost ... years or so\nA lot of things without unsavory ban some self marrying\nThat's going on funding in a\nNumber of rows of you know

fourteen times larger than Greenland and yet on the map\nBoth are almost the same size Greenland is huge on these maps Brazil another example Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska yet Alaska is much larger than Brazil on the map much larger\nThe map also suggested Scandinavian countries they're larger than India\nWhereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian

far as a journalist concerned Germany is a food debtor nation meaning they don't create enough food to feed themselves\nSo we set up blockades are around around Germany so we couldn't we couldn't feed them running a food so you see these emaciated photos of people in concentration camps which is tremendously horrible\nI'm you know they had to make a decision to I feed my soldiers or do I feed my

a series the other side of history I Believe a DVD sir yes\nYes he came to the exact same thing in this book was was in the middle of writing this back then to research and you know just because I Do all my own research and you know he came up with his own research to substantiate the same thing so it wasn't a matter of if it was just\nA matter of one that had happened\nAnd so again or or did he let it happen did eat while in part I suppose he was sort of and they were prodding the Japanese maybe cornering them a little bit but how much more knowledge do you think\nHe had the actual attack\nIt's difficult to tell I Know they had at least a week's notice and you know the aircraft carriers mysteriously went out of Pearl Harbor so they were not it Pearl Harbor when the attack happened\nWhich has a little sister suspicious you know aircraft carriers tend to be a pretty\n... pretty unnecessary commodity in a word like that and every word actually so you know they had to spare them so they left the harbor if I'm wrong\nSorry but I mean I I Can't imagine a situation where are you would be taking aircraft carriers and ordering them away from a place that you're supposed to be protecting so\nIt was pretty good evidence to support that the you know the same you know to support that conclusion that say they definitely had a as a matter of fact the History Channel broke it I think last year I was watching something on the History Channel\nThey even said they had uncovered documents internal documents which I didn't find in the archive suggests that that very thing that the codes were broken and I thought well hey look at that you know I mean I hate I knew I got it right but I didn't know how right I got it so that was ...

Boston in my heart radio station [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd we are back with Stephen ... through who murdered FDR which is part of the who murdered series previously Steve joined us on cos back in August to discuss the ah the murder of Elvis Presley or now we're discussing the murder of Franklin Delano Roosevelt the thirty second president\nUm before we get into the the Second World war I just wanted to mention Mussolini\nAnd um there was a time when and I don't I don't believe you address in the book but actually I was also\nA a an admirer of Mussolini or when he first came to power because Mussolini was kind of build as a um as a real progressive\nUm you know he was ... and he wrote for the communist newspaper muscle and you did in his latest propaganda minister was sort of the um one of the top a communist thinker so you know fascism in its early beginnings they were communists that's just the way it is it's a fact\nUh and and I think they kind of had a I'm a mutual admiration society going back and forth I think um when muscle and he was still writing for this worker party magazine he admired Roosevelt Roosevelt wanted to send a delegation over to Italy to see how they did things so I I just thought that was kind of an interesting chapter by 'em\nWhen they entered the war Roosevelt wanted a\nPact with the Soviet Union to kind of squeezed Germany how did that I did go over with Churchill\nWell when it first started to address your Mussolini thing you're absolutely right with that as a matter of fact Hitler also idolize ... Mussolini at first he was in awe of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing\nBut you know again I'm history books being what they are that tendency over the last um\n[noise] so America gets under the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn 'em coverage of entry and in Birmingham a very interesting stuff\nSo um I was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way I'm anyway are we going into the war and we're really have anything to do was down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close England came to losing her island they were lined up on\nThe other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel and this was what their MO was they used to go and lay down air strikes bomb them into oblivion and then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill\nSo we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits now all of a sudden\nWe get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them I'm of course the two at my previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church shows the one who\nGot the two together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans because they were so similar at the time\nThat style and in America and the the American president FDR were working in unison so it was great for the war it was bad for the world\nBecause Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be from\nSo to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trust that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was\nOf course you have to understand we weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great purge I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been as for him but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure ... I mean there's ...\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their faces a ...\nMillion FDR it seemed a bit from reading your book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with style and I don't know if this was because he admired him or but he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we need it's balanced island in the U.S\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and it's and spelling hit a pack\nWell Hitler violated the act and went after style in which completely blue silence mind and they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march\nAnd then you know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to ... because it held his namesake so now it was leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was\nSuch a delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch horses in midstream and go towards styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and they were just says well I don't care I Want to do it so style and is already beating him or he doesn't need us so Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little\nA little harder to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging ... style is table in which they get this done\nRight so there was a the conference in Casablanca and and then later to Iran I think in\nA was Turan in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have that even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up\nPost war world a instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still it's pretty\nRobots or you know he you know my my standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nUm but I I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nBecause you work here and that wouldn't be fair to listen for your chance so that sounds in dollars on the voice of Boston W arcane go\nFrom Bob in a patient to the northeast corner most guys when you get a little bit older than you struggled to marriage for some germs are words from from farms are driven\nThe first year relationship great it was very frustrating time because you're bombarded with ... and you just never know where to turn ... for my wife saw regardless of northeastern that's\nBeen on the treatment for two months now\n... unbelievably\nCompletely changed more interaction with my wife brings you much closer to\nThirty three years I don't think we've ever been ... airline most garden you ... ... square royal peace or whether they were very offering\nThis is Dale from the northeast men's clinic you really don't have to suffer with ...
