{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Uh you know but I'm very con uh we had twenty thousand employees once a year we had a large business contracts to speak in front of a five hundred all our a top leaders right uh and when I first started doing their start talking to the press about something that\nReally came natural to to me so you just learn to do it and you push yourself and you do it again one step at a time\nAnd uh at some point it's just a science your comfort zone and when you find your comfort zone you are actually performing much better than when you're a\nA bound by your old a fear that name business or when you're when somebody is doing an interview we haven't ever done an interview or you're going to be sure it can be nerve wracking\nAnd ah he catches John Barr from zero to a hundred or you know from never having driven a car to driving at a a you know a ... a five hundred a few miles in Indianapolis or are you just have to go step by step right um\n[noise] so again it goes against that notion of unique to prepare yourself you need to get ... a pretty kind put any effort to and uh and again the passion is going to drive you to ... to sustain that effort to over time\nYou also have to have the focus\nUh one of my problems all my life has been that I have a lot of interest I I enjoyed studying the law I'm enjoying that I've been a professor of communication the in training people in public speaking and various other subjects enjoy doing that loved doing what I'm doing now with this over several decades\nUm and so I think one of the things I've learned now\nAs it may be going back you make one thing the central focus and you become ... at that\nThan everything else becomes part of that then you can branch out from the center of the center of your strength um it reminds me of a some of my colleagues in this business where they get the notoriety through programs that they host and then they'll find a book\nAnd the book becomes the New York times number one bestseller well that happens because of the work they did in the field making themself a household name in order to be on the market the book if they were an unknown person writing that book it would never get off for a space so to speak\nSo is it an important to become excellent that the one thing\nThat you have the the the intent to be successful at have clear objectives and keep striving to those objectives and then once you get there to build out from there [noise]\nIt sure absolutely um and in your case of getting a great example right because ultimately these are moving targets right or if we if we think what we want to do next year we'll say okay this is what I Want to do and I'll plans for it\nBut if you start taking longer time ... you know it says what life is about it's about the long term right then or you don't know exactly what's going to happen is all you can do is to keep on preparing and hopefully\nA year doing it a while they enjoying a the process strike a because otherwise it's just a a ... it just becomes senseless\nCIA [laughter] go\nAhead no one's going to ask the new continue please\nSolo show a select you what you did write you a ... you had any interest when you were mentioning you had an interesting the law and how you started using that we're ... if you're a radio career and or in every every step but they she did every time you put in again that after ... ... a\nTreatment by your passion a major better\nOr a major better commentator in major better speaker I'm and eventually you'd you start learning with time how to tie all of these different aspects of your life together\nAnd you become a more complete tend to video and more successful individual and again and make sure you know\nIn a company people will notice a difference\nYou know as I remember I had the eye surgery and the surgeon\nAnd did it was considered Supreme she was from Boston at mass ion air that this was years ago about subsequently I saw on the news that she'd created a um some kind of a prescription drug that would alleviate a particular problem of vi\nAnd I thought to myself she was already had the recognition as being the best in her field and now she goes out and does this and and it continues to build on that and I think it's that she never became content\nAnd and this is the correct that success is always re thinking no matter how good you are\nContinuing to try to find ways to improve even Ted Williams the great maybe the greatest center of baseball history always said he was thinking about things and then bring working in training himself and the hours and hours that people put into whatever career there in\nIn order to become the best at what they do um that doesn't end ever does it\nTrue that exactly I think once you feel you've arrived to the end a excellent ... is a is to continue to pursue improvement is odd you know a place you go there and you're done\nUm because again the world is moving everything is changing and uh you know what your competitors are also moving so as soon as you sit back and think oh you know now I'm here I'm a\nGoing to the world and so I don't have to do I don't have to challenge myself anymore um that's the beginning of the decline so I absolutely a constant thinking I'm going to the doctor you mentioned uh I'm\nIn my career I was in a in a in systems and then I remembered Kelly a former boss that I had a a you know my mission in cheese to find a way\nThat my job becomes irrelevant a year from now\nAnd they loved that go through sort of like because the whole point of bringing systems is to eliminate the jobs are are humans are are are not as good as machines to do right so I'm\nAn actor in your mind that you were to challenge what you're doing constantly and thinking and a little bit of paranoid paranoia right\nThinking well the next guy coming and uh you know they're going to win you know you you mentioned earlier you know how dishes doing much better now than a few years ago\nFan you switched from my directv to dish so uh it in the country are changing a let you have to always questioning\n... it's a

river so this is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that I'm an we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely\nPossibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses it ... the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart\nBy two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just going to last night and\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost

Boston and only heart radio station\n[noise]\n[noise]\nVery welcome back to cross to grocery done with us we'll get to your calls as well area within that can you predict out five years from now\n[noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know\nThe trouble in the economy starting in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation when they were predictable we spent and when they would stop spent ... yes what we see is the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season it started in two thousand\nWill be over about probably about ... two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back and then we'll start to see\nThem again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way in two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal the difference is George is that it will be concentrated\nAs it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and Southeast Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics and the United states has kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent that we're so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spend much more of their money\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next but between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three\nIs gonna be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only the orange\nOrange is the real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people of the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sector so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to ... dot com and that's going to be ... it'd be the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to the economy\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting and people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and\nUh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world that makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and then when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China\nAnd in in a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob

China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this ... they need us or our trade is three times tilted\nTowards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming in there don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so so I don't know if it's more a trade war but but

things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and then that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging now they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk of two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight nine forward

have questions and I want to get a few links and because I when I started twenty three sixty thinks the path\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent account\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured um except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out\nJapan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there to owner as we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest\nInflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare they're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans then people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going\nThis bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans\nIt's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nTwo thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars you know voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell well he has now I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like a did rapidly and the great depression but to put it on\nAnd on you know permanent quantitative easing just for birds the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout his whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger\nOnly made the rich richer is only benefited corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to a check ... because I wanted them to be forced to spend it rambling them you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or do they get you're right that that's much better way\nThe point is to get every day people some relief and and to have them spend that money to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks next door\nWe're going to Harry in Port Huron hello Harry Good to have you\nWell hello there George an area that question for you mentioned earlier about the bank and you make had gotten just now but uh they taking the money I'm typing and like what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems which forms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally a money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do if bang if governments have ticks procreate money or pork how they're going to do for the more fluent accounts and those going to be in the end the bigger\nMoney center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union than you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or ... or sitting back and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina\nOkay thank you and\nI think yeah I just think that part of one of my question is why I asked a direct and like a ... at one part of my way around by um I Do not act I'm like\nHey wait a second line\nRight yup they put all about timing\nIf all of that one of my gardening among like I'm hearing what I've heard of that she gets answered my question what about the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much\nUm I don't have to worry about that so much as a as a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure so security there's certainly going to take the benefits of a larger accounts and more fluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that so what oh deposits are insured they can't insure everything if you have a major club but the smaller account if you spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're gonna be weightless all of all that and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hid and of course when\nWhen things go bad people gonna hit foreign deposit there's more Iceland went down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again I still say\nHave as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans\nBusiness loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash that they can't they can't\nPledge those reserves and well that's a good thing Carrie thank you were on a time Harry's website is coast to coast

one hundred and twenty seven to ... like eighty to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\nFrom ABC News\n[noise]\nWell let me tell you a bit about Dr many ... she has forty years of experience working in the mental health field a medical degree from the University of Manitoba is a diploma in psychiatry from McGill University now throughout his entire life\nHe has had many close brushes with death as well starting in the home yeah you said a number of paranormal or a novelist experiences visions pre cognitive dreams out of body experiences\nEncounters with message burying the operations is well welcome to the program Dr many mate is on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nAnd are inviting me\nInteresting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be show hell Lee involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences\nThat started it well I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders of normal first came out many people asked me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me that my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential a doctor is bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he's told by his patience and I don't\nSo the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nPlus stories from my readers and from my audiences and from family and friends and from my own extensive reading research into the paranormal\nIn terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had so many close calls with that so many Russians that that um you know\nThere's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience\nBut the um term near death experience you know it's ... ... talk to women moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago I was right now I think he estimated that something like one in thirty Americans is either had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people\nBut there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never were pronounced clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I looked at how my close brushes that staff effected me I see that I have some of the same after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls this death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found give myself a shift from materialism spirituality and then he and an increase need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual the first um couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of brush them off you know\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why did they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous stem cells donor it's called in how Jeanette transplant mhm\nWas more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer of this world like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOr super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you chemotherapy because it's doing too much damage to your body\nYou was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that's why I eventually they gave me the transplant\nHuh [noise] now is the person who gave me the transplant he lives in an anonymous donor but the rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them\nAnd I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy and when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow\nSo he was flown back into the don't you send for Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThen if you still in touch with him did that happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and ... them you know he said the way it came about was um [noise]\nThey were having a donor and drive in one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is itchy swab type that's it\nYeah just a cheeks ought to get the DNA so that's when his name into the donor bank\nAnd then I'm ... years later my name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know ... we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... century in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live ... yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nDr ... the fact that you were dabbling so heavily into the psyche Rome has that help or hurt your ... your practice [noise]\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally\nThey don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see a psychiatrist [noise] however since I had that experience and psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's a psychic experience of a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference I mean sometimes if a person see something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say you're a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel\nHis touched on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost a loved one will have some type of post death contact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm and in fact you know atheist and agnostics have these experiences well as religious people\nYou see that every one is like you and I I tend to believe you can agree with you\nOK but when you said that ... what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or pee cognitive beams and other things he's parked both touches visions hundred voices and so on deathbed visions near death experiences\nSo certain types of sake experiences such as ESP until after the are extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you were thinking about that person then you say oh you must be ... I was just thinking about you right\nVery common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition\nThey're ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them was really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic realm out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nEvery day made possible

psychiatrist de stigmatize as per normal phenomenon many let's talk a little bit about the death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned over this phone so you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice was dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors\nSo she got on the plane and sure enough that's what happened so sometimes people have these experiences have these dreams and they disregard them you know and I've heard of other cases like that too\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that I bring up another subject which is sometimes people receive messages and dreams which aren't the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the ...\nThat's the question right where's this message coming from you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added or we can say it's coming from the spirit\nWorld you know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear\nMhm you know um\nAnd maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\n... there was a movie about a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government to leaders to to assassinate them\nAnd you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and there were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that they mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know while they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone to have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and that and how how did we know\nIt's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\nMhm [noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um it wasn't a pay cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up\nThis is the message I thought I I just saw these where it said this is a world\nOf illusion and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she'd been that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with ... told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he north ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their promotions do maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition and\nThen they do the water should go after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know that said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because\nThey they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregarded things which could be dismissed that superstition is always the fear of being labeled\nSuperstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was the horse racing though yeah one of his friends apparently\nReally understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spent on something else and lost in ... in the movie screaming at you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fair I think people are they don't believe in\nThey don't believe in alpha they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who have been blind since birth will have another body experience during surgery\nAnd then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up ... to tell the doctors and nurses um what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies is one patient with blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the patent on his\nDoctor pie and of course the doctor with founded\nThere was another case or the plantation he left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures and he left his body needed to ... everything that was going on and then when he when he be covered\nAnd they couldn't find where she put it that you\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right\nBack but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I fire you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough\nThere they were they were wow yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component like I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related to the I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's ... I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some people call them paranormal and people call them spiritual or anomalous or mystical their mysterious\nIs relative or it's being used to describe the same event\nSo I think paranormal event can have a spiritual\nComponent yeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\n[noise] do you think science should do a better job investigating these things [noise] [noise] oh definitely\nI think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there was something more out there that we don't have to live a teen nine to five eight and a day to day lives that if anything more than\nWe don't really know about and I think a chick explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many make this we're going to take phone calls your calls your stories about pretty cognitive dreams and so many of the things\nYou've heard us talk about here on the coast to coast stadiums and find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com [noise]\nSo Kanye West making a visit to the White House you can\nReally be the UN ambassador by the time we meet again I don't know I Would suggest that he's probably going to campaign with the president and so we'll have that story slash we're gonna talk to his real daughter it all starts at six am [noise]\nHuman baby weekday morning they've had a little boy so Boston\nSuddenly you are kale\nWhen it comes to the people we love and support a cancer diagnosis should never be able to find them because he was there still the collectors of number one dead mugs uh never hopeful fans of teams and never win and unrelenting jokes there's never get allowed\nBy going bald for just one day in October Nineteen you can show the world that there's so much more to their story and raise money for cancer charities sign up today at ... ... dot org ... ... dot org\nBy heart radio has created a playlist perfect for any mood activity or moments in your life there are thousands of heart radio play list\nOn one perfect for your moments just launched she'll play was perfect for the fall there are bluish for working out throwing a party cooking dinner washing the car taking a vast for such a move for the perfect tonight in these are ... for that\nDownloaded free I heart radio asked all your favorite used to call your favorite stations all free by our radio\n\nWe put your helmet on you work hard to protect your family\nBut some residents are easy to many ... that caused West Nile virus for the cause Iran's cockroaches leave behind bacteria as well as allergens that can trigger as\nBeing more than half a million people to the emergency room every year\nLearn how to protect your family\nHas thrown dot or public service message on the national management association and CDC\nVoice of Boston you walk working about one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA ac to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nAnd then there were twenty the Supreme Court of Washington\n... dot com ... Boston in a heart radio station [noise]\n\n[noise]\nOkay well come back to our final hour with Dr many ... we're talking about his work the borders of normal as a psychiatrist in you do have to decide whether a person is truly experiencing a psychic issue or is a psychotic how do you tell the difference Manny\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone hearing voices on quality that would distinguish psychic psychotic experience and sample someone here though boy I'm\nPsychotic ... nation tends to be very very frightening\nIt's also very frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucination could also be editing side boy\nIt could be the sound of machinery or insect\nThere may be more than one voice\nTo or the voices talking to each other about the person that the voices might be an accusatory or threatening whereas I'm psychic hallucinations tend to be infrequent\nThey may occur only once or twice in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and calming the other thing is with\nPsychosis you can't just look at when symptoms such as hearing the voice you have to look at the whole person because psychosis is the major mental disorder which affects the person's ability to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work or within the family\nIf then if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other symptoms aside\nFrom the hallucinations for example the thought disorder or paranoid id Asian or you know feelings of ...\n... people are talking about them this type of thing so there's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nAnd you make a misdiagnosis ... conceivable\nYes in fact it has happened there is a psychologist that did it an experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had to each one of them go to a different emergency room and had different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patients well they weren't patients they were actors pretending to be ... but they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... they're admitted to the ward they were given medication they didn't take\nMedication and once they got the word the the patients me that they were faking\nSo they were able to fool the doctors but they were unable to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how did they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal aside from the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their appearance their behavior the conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them is completely normal so that's why I say you can make the diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come the doctors couldn't figure that out well unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes well that's true [laughter] but but the patients that I think because well the patients live with it they they know the illness so well they know the symptoms and everything that's right\nAll right let's take some calls him for your duty in the Ozarks in Missouri have Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting and waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot about brain I have been a mistake and that had visions all my life and I have that many many near death experiences where I have like my body\nBut I think one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me is when I went to London as an adult and I saw a picture of the war room where they do all the major planning for their European front\nMhm well that's where I used to go and out of body experience when I was little and there were a whole bunch of us up up above kind of sitting like in the balcony and we were all in spirit\nThat not who we go and they were very upset because I was so young and they didn't think I should be there\n[laughter] what'd you do that as a remote viewing huh\nNo I Would I have a body travel and when I saw the picture of the war room I realize that's where I had been as a child\nAbuse still been able to duplicate that\nWell not lately I usually go where there is a really intense suffering like when the Israeli people and we were hiding under the along with sewage canal yeah what was that the fifty seven more\nNineteen sixty seven\nSixty seven yeah um I I go to places that are are really really bad\nWhy I don't know whether I'm there to help balance\nWhat do you think of as many\nWell I'm curious to know do you have these experiences when you're sleeping or when you're away\nWhen I was little they were when I was sleeping [laughter]\nOh the other ones where I'd been out of body I'm just waking up okay between sleep in and awake but the most interesting experience I think I've ever had is that I always looking searching for meaning because I was very depressed\nBecause I'm In physical form and there is no where on earth\nThe love that you feel when you are in that particular place of knowing what all the companies seem love is and when I was during meditation or we think and and I could see if you know what glitter looks like in a in a like a\nA helmet for a motorcycle helmet yes how different angles well this was alive light and the whole screen of my vision was filled with as glittering new all different colors of orange and yellow and\nI could hear the voice saying this is love and I was to totally engulfed in it and it was just a beautiful experience but I found listening to people talk about near death experiences mine near death experiences aren't when ... I'm Out of my body and I'm seeing what's going on and I\nThe last time it happened I was in surgery\nAnd as I came back into my body I can hear the the anesthesiologist saying we're losing her and I thought\nYou were saying I'm back here yeah all\nRight [laughter] you know that type of stuff and that's the reason I I called the question about what is the difference between schizophrenia and having these types of vision is because I've been up\nAll right that's that's kind of a fine line isn't it many\nWell yes and no like I said with had study where these patients were misdiagnosed because they reported hearing voices but otherwise they were fine\nSo the question is whether the person can carry on with their daily life or whether they're able to function or whether is an Elvis that's interfering with their life so it you can make a diagnosis just on the basis of the fact that person is hearing voices are always having other body experiences that would lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia\nBecause someone with a diagnosis schizophrenia has to have a thought disorder as well they have to have problems with their thinking and with their emotions\nAnd you know with their parents with their behavior it's all encompassing so the types of description the description of the types of experiences you you've had doesn't sound like schizophrenia to me\nWhat about hallucinations compared to actual psychic things which the person they're\nWell\nThere again like police nations can be found in a lot of different medical conditions not just schizophrenia and it can also be lists nations and also be found and people who are mentally and physically healthy\nSo you know I guess ... each person has to be assessed you know in terms of you know what their symptoms are and and you know how how much they're affecting that person's ability to function [noise] but I was just going to say about your caller I was thinking maybe one of the reasons she goes to places when she's out of her body she goes to places of pain in the\nDark and places that are dark maybe he's trying to help maybe in some way she's thinking on a on a spiritual level she can help these people\nYou think she's doing it on purpose\nI think so I think there must be a reason why she's going to those places\nTo go to Joe in Monterey, California hey Joseph go ahead\nA Ninety charge a duck
