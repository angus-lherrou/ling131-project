{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "And they claim that those thirty seats are the ones that are up for grabs there is there any merit to that the analysis\nWell it's wrong I think the numbers are wrong right now my forecast models because of minimum two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans\nHad as high as two hundred and twenty eight feet the Republican but even in the worst case to twenty five that gives them more than the two Eighteen necessary to maintain control the house\nAnd that would make it to twenty five to ten\nSo ... are you\nFairly ... how how old I put this your your print to predict production based on the model then is a two twenty five for the Republicans as a minimal\nRight and see the thing that that causing my numbers to be different I mean I I look at\nPolls mostly for their models underneath them to understand how they're generating their numbers and get some sense of where they're coming from\nAnd really the problem is that due to the way they're modeling currently that's a funny thing than a I feel their underlying model dismiss counting the electorate in a number of special way which by forecast models or\nDon't do in other words I think a more accurate\nAnd and what it is is there believing that certain what we call blue bottle districts are going to stay low\nBut they're actually going to lose some of those districts that they're just in Washington DC if he went back to a bunch of ... and the pollsters they would say oh these are blue blue districts do question and they're just saying they're blue even without polling results because some of the districts aren't poll they don't even bother to pull off\nAnd they're saying it's blue okay well guess what it's going to be read and they're not counting them in their in their a number\nYou know they they assume that that you know they're not counting them as they're kind of a blue automatically and that's a terrible mistake I\nThink have you taken into account the fact of the forty five retirees on the Republican side oh sure\nAbsolutely that ... that that's important too so we have a and and how much\nOf this so it seemed to me with a retirees particularly because if somebody has been an incumbent and people like their own the old story is that everybody wants Congress replaced except for their own congressman or right because you know they're they're good\nUm but it would seemed to me that was forty five retiring that what's happened in the country and the Trump agenda being fulfilled based on the promises of the campaign has got to be a major part\nOf what those people are voting on or am I missing something\nYou know this is the first president uh the first major politician and find a long time that has made such an effort to fulfill his promise that people are not used to this people are surprised by it but they like it\nAnd and that's a good thing and by the way it's really no longer the Republican Party you remember I said that the Republican Party is evolving right some of it's going to break off that's going to continue to happen past the election and that may be and my next book coming out next spring\nA you know how this continues to evolve but this party is more like the Trump party at the moment and it it's certainly a lot more conservative and a lot more populous than it used to be\nSo and and the bottom line then is that\nWe're going to see um maybe maybe you're calling it something different than what the president Republican Party is but isn't it in effect just the transformation of the Republican Party aisle and let me say it this way\nWhere over the last two decades my callers to my programs Gore conservative had been imminently frustrated by the Republicans they said they weren't more so than the Democrats because the Democrats are who they are the Republicans are the ones\nThat are supposed to be in the safety valve and they have not been so is it correct to say that\nIt's not that the Republican Party is changing\nBut his merely transforming from the Freedom Caucus for example being uh the big minority but still the minority and the uh rhinos being the majority now it's gonna be the other way around the rhinos would be the minority and the Freedom Caucus types will be the majority\nThat's true for now but in the longer run\n... a year to three to four years from now I think the party is ...\nAre there because that's what happened in American\nHistory and I think that what's going to happen is that the Republican Party well ultimately split out more liberal component and create a new party that'll take the place of the Democratic party which I don't believe will shut down in a tired\nAnd the Republican Party may keep its name or it may call itself something do make America great again party or call itself but conservative party or make it all fell ... put out a call ... for the party\nThat one and it wouldn't have to change I mean I'm just trying to follow this through it wouldn't have to change its name\nFrom what you're saying branding issue whether it changes its name is\nMore like what do we need and our brand to sell more presidential elections in the future\nAnd the answer would be more than the Jim Jordan types yeah yeah\nLike I say oh All right so then so then really it would be the point I just made that that they would it would reverse uh the the the dominant force over the Republican Party\nOr let me put it this way you got the crowd on the on the left and the Republican Party right at the John McCain's of the world right love us ... the U.S chamber of commerce uh put up about eighty million dollars in off year elections like this one\nUh in order to get ... for Republicans who are moderates to keep the illegal aliens coming in so they get cheap labor for their corporate members are now now that that now that crowd of rhinos\nIs going to be in a under your theory suppressed and the Jim Jordan crowd the Freedom Caucus I'm a is going to be increased or and and then they're going to become the dominant force so they wouldn't need to change the name of the party what you're saying is would be more like the Ronald Reagan Republican Party or the Barry Goldwater Republican Party I could\nSee them because of the if you will the bad reputation of rhinos you know a lot of people are fat with rhinos over the years you know right or they were conservatives they get to watch it and they both like Democrats right and so for purposes of branding I think there's a high probability\nBut I don't have specific numbers on this kind of variable that don't change the name\nOkay you know what what what I described\nI have no way to quantify why they would change the name exactly\nBut I put the ... we're wrapping up here so the kind of content wise um what my point would be well taken that in that oh that is perfectly correct\nOkay that was the content would be so when people wanted for years and the name may or may not change we'll see how that goes for a while you might lose forest will see in one day they'll forget about Tuesday and let let me know and that when I checked the counter strike for to say you are fantastic so we'll have all your input as we as we get the numbers so that'll be\nWhen you want me to be honest to begin with\nRight at the beginning of the show which is

would create another problem all by itself how about the population in terms of ... men and women fifty fifty what they're buying is that a market change\n[noise] yeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now in in in ... no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in law school at Seventy thirty I mean think about\nReally use it that high on that's a flip flip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I I said let's say you want you you want to hassle of women there so you don't do it but what you have to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things\nThere's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions and they're good one I ...\nYeah oh excellent ones absolutely Exxon once and and uh so\nWe're we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because if it's going to be run by women\nUm what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\n[noise] that Generation Z was born in being going right now is is actually a two thousand five to ... thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there [noise] uh but Gen Z is not going to be entirely different\nThan Gen Y that they're going to be this the same cyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially as the parents of Gen Z\nA but it\nIs what we're watching is is is a ... a new crop of kids and and I tell folks and he said listen you know people say well these these you know they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they can't complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are like that I'm hearing about them and I said let's let them grow up\nAs soon as they have to feed themselves they're gonna be fined or just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated this as soon as they had to feed themselves and and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted that\nI don't care listen it is what it is [laughter] well let's listen here here's how it works zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free\nYou're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a um liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo on and all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just there about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah what he told me that makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country\nAnd it's horrible yeah it it troubles me it really does we knew not\nIt's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a name and listen I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president day takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah\nThat's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter\nIt's not that it would be used for tools like that I don't think so\nI Know that when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about and the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know if\nYou talk about the trends in change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't get

child only policies\nThey did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy what now they're letting their populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate for uh how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born babies born as adults\nThey're not buyers that's for sure\nNo so what what you have is is they're missing now and it's a real number five hundred a ...\nYou know people that were born five hundred million\nAnd a half billion so so here's here's how it works in any country I don't care if you're if you're a a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people\nThat make big incomes but have you know a big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax you mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nUh and the the the starting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise] so what's gonna happen\nWell the bullet cook themselves because they're going to have is actually a quarter of a billion elderly that they've got to support that can't support themselves and now\nThat they they have a whole new crop of of the kids that can't support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen and how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah what what whenever a country gets in trouble um with ah their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's frightening as they go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has one and in China's history zero they've never won a war I I don't know what's gonna happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is a they\nDon't have enough people to to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not much take some calls this hour come rolling in here for the guinea let's go to ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi George I hope you're well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I have I called\nBecause I have a phone compact with you um but just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war I'm not up on that so all of those politicians that have look and see I I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman I wanted to see two things Tio first of all I'm he called her a horse face\nShe was trying to jump start her career uh um the\nPorn star because she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that lawyer is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he would he would run and possibly win\nA presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys yet and all they had\nWas temporarily side tracked I'm a booming economy or try to and bring down that's nan but more importantly that man has kids actually a little one still at home and that little one but a young white include and his wife\nAnd we had a president and did something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was aiming for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that was over a decade about so\nI don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you'll pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature the second thing I disagree that is sad is that\nI'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than the things is that and it should be run like a business\nI have started to successful business myself is that men and women don't have time for now and then you get a deal done we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting that have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then that and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy ... the death when ward\nThey'll pull him if he doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him because he said no nonsense that is that anyone that would bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity to get back up yet I'm no wars\nI that I I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in his ... he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what than it is hard and other people know that ... ... it doesn't matter about this policy he knows who he is as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that so I disagree with you on both of those um things\nTurned let's get as good as comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think he did to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country in period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver toilet a fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business they're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works what we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a bit a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to come as young as you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um ah the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nThat will do what ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm not a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but if he let them spoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in the punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know I think what he has done his dignify but at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really

sitting\nOut or you're not going to do it might not you know we I have many you know what I mean he has little tiny mini Cooper right\nI Am a mini Cooper GDP which is a ... and I'm thinking to myself I the first time I pull up next to I'm a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one tactical full paw just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's what the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out a school bus it's over it it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway in there you know the truck is parked there in the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nI mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt it's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please okay one of the things that that a\nA R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million\nUh um men are males or without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million\nWhere are they they're in the military\nYeah and that it's the there there is just a ton and and that that is what happens when you have an imbalance in your population\nSo that's another factor that China is dealing with\nDo you see another major more breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth or is the Americans\nAnd that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South American or we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need their oil we've got water yeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water\nIt it just it I don't know\nI Am one of those always missiles no guinea [laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know that just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening [noise]\nUh and if in fact I said I said what do you see in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north in\nThe south the you know that the south is not having children there for ... heard that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern although not from a country but from some terrorist group than obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nThat that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have\nSouth Korea with you know having one child per couple\nYou cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you can't possible it has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen there with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right at or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina hey Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher against um Hi my question is that a trend going to continue to where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and at West 'cause like Florida is now the third most populous state outbreak in New York state and also point where the Knicks has become the largest city out raking it will do here\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather over Kenny\nThat that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shifts ahead we cover every single state\nIf you are from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California Nevada Arizona and New Mexico uh the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million while or buy real estate in Florida now\nAnd just sit on it yeah it said I\nWas in the the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist or give me a bus and she said one is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to end up going to ask what if it meant when will begin to\nYou know shopping and I told her I said listen it hasn't started\n... ... does is gonna be a huge\n... it's going to be off the charts with the same thing is happening with healthcare elder care and death care\nWhat our Vegas is that a good market\nOff the charts huge can't believe it it it for one or if it's cheap there are plenty of job or a ...\nI go there all the time my brother has a house there uh yeah Vegas is is unbelievable\n...

to Boston and I are radio station\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Richard came to\nABC's Matt Goodman was in federal court in Pittsburgh when accused synagogue massacre shooter Robert Bowers appeared\nHe also served as a Fulbright professor back in two thousand three at the University of Trump's show in northern Norway Bruce founded the veterans' program at ... college and co founded the boots to books transition of course\nNow that's the first college course in the country designed specifically for recently returned veterans\nBruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for sure be my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love the show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you got to tell me why me with the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it ... the paranormal it's been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experiences ... experience a near death experience and just from that point on it just the the things have been happening randomly but quite frequently\nAnd uh I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together\nTo a book and a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or family members but to to students and actually I teach a class now at the college I'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nThere's a lot of people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about their ... normal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences as it's been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nUh it it hasn't been I I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching\n'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most negative thing I can think about there was a\nA a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide [laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\nYou'd only as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the seal the paranormal they and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community of of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist historian\nOr but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean ... who's\nThe chief scientist at ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities\nAnd from what he told me there is only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the ... Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is an eye confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and then you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research and very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly are you supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting or on the Internet uh there are other podcast result they're dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just that ah it's just it as kind of blew me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building that night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's I I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in in their support I think it's gonna it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience so this this initial experience I had at age four\nKind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things ah it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point at which they do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I Would try and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a winter time and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nGot very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanting to take a little map and was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep or you know crying myself to sleep I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd uh it I felt like I it it was an angelic presence and it it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be OK took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think

stumbled into that\nAnd I woke up in a in a sweat and and nervous and scared and\nI I went to breakfast with my uh uh friends are just like a continental breakfast and I told them about this nightmare and then we proceeded to the uh the base\nAnd uh we were on a tour when the sirens went off and they closed off the base and we went back to the education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so\nSo that was my um my pre cognitive or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nA the you know a in a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event and later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had\nA nightmare as some more much more specific than mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there is my daughter had none of those two we didn't know what you're saying yeah we didn't know what it was Bruce but uh she she she had the vision she was in the in the city\nWere ashes falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep um but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was it\nYeah yeah some people had it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people around the world who have who has a verified that this that this happened to them and\nSo there is something to that this this the ... that people had since that an end in a on a massive scale so which is and it's been studied uh I think a dean rating talks about in one of his books I I I Can't remember which one of his books but yeah he does talk about them\nWhat do you think of to let them see\n[noise] I I I think I've had experience with with telepathy with my with my mother and uh she was very psychic and we used to just a regular deck of playing cards when I was a younger uh preach uh\nCamping on the Oregon Coast we'd have wonderful camping trips on the ah Oregon Coast in at night my mom would bring out the deck of cards and we would uh try to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have a car and she'd look at it and send me the you know try to send me with what the card was\nAnd a wet well above chance we would get the\nThe suit right we would get the sometimes the number or the or the ... you know whether it was a king or jak face card a very often we'd get it we get it a right\nTo the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter a blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it no more yeah he did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop\nA and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and I she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from it so it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but I think I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big split experience\n[noise] I I did uh I well I think it was a I'll tell you this was a ... near Oric which is northern California and the redwoods highway there and a driving south and uh my girlfriend was was asleep in the uh uh in the passenger seat and it was dark and we were ...\nYou too you know the big tall trees it's very ... and as I was making I think it was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit all of a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark\nBut it was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat and a ... it was just kind of leaning into the truck is we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd uh the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot and and she she said what what are you talking about big for I said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she\nShe [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep driving and I said well we got to find a hotel there's one here another mile from here and she goes no no you keep going keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later I found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Paterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking about that this isn't right\nThere's been yeah there's been more siting there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand from what the ... the uh reading that I did about it so now if it if it was a hoax or this guy's taken a big chance by stand right on the on the edge of the highway in the dark total dark\nYup uh and then I'd get shot at or anything she got\nRun over crazy you know whatever or you know the alternative which which you know they're so that that was my my one and only a a big but experience\nWhat about the uh thirty four episodes that occurred with you which is the favorite for you\n[noise] well I Wonder you actually like\nYeah I [noise] I'll have to say all the connections with my my my parents with my mother ah when my mother came to me an inhibition after she passed away and\nAnd uh and told me she she doesn't say much when she comes to me but she came to me and said and she was golden you know she was herself but very healthy she you know she died of cancer and she was very healthy looking she was gold and had this golden glove\nAnd uh she came to me and said you know there is a heaven that's what she told me and then that was it that was that was one of the parents so that\nThat's where she was that's always a good thing Bruce stay with us we're going to take a moment\nFor quick

so many different kinds of paranormal stores you had a a lifetime\nOf activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket or\nThe title alone kind of makes you shiver [laughter]\nWell I grew up in a in a I'm\nIn a region American community and we had this this older man who passed away\nAnd he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh we were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me [noise]\nAnd uh as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice\nA very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was so to me and he said ah ah Bruce it's it's it's OK I'm OK there is nothing to be afraid of\nUh uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut uh I didn't actually ask her about it but then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it then then the typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um\nIt it was kind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird when it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I think I Know now but uh often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to to appear at their their funerals just this check everybody out\nSee what the suit was they're very curious I think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kind of paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but ah\nWell then you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's a it's a community education course so it's not like\nFor college transfer credit but it is not good at at the college\nAnd I am a a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular\nI said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and so I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues\nAnd and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California uh younger people and and older people different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it\nBut there are a couple that are a little skeptical ... including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks and the nurse\nSeven weeks in the course into the course um and ah it it it's been a wonderful experience and really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different to you know types of paranormal phenomenon I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories and that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories\nAnd it's a safe and in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a\nNearby a steak house which will be fun a that's a hunted\nAnd I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in a ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you the I I've had two full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the two ... where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria in a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in uh in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California\nAnd uh in both cases it was it was shocking to say the least but uh it uh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying\nI think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my\nImpression that uh and my explanation for what's going on with that\nNow it's different than when I ... A M visited by someone who's passed on and I might see an image of them in my mind but not\nLike out in the in the open kind of thing so I think there there is a difference between an intelligent what they would call an intelligent spirit and a a kind of a residual or experience or or residuals spirit\nPsycho ... says the ability to manipulate mind over matter happened to you\n[noise] I was the uh um the unfortunate victim of well I don't want to say victim but it happened to me I was I was in Germany a lot of these things happened in Germany and West Germany Germany's a very magical place\nUm the ah I'm living in an old uh well in an apartment above a ... house which is like a a a German bar but there's like rooms to rent up above it\nEither for the night or for in our case we were a GIs so we were living there near the base\nAnd a one night I woke up and I I felt like somebody was pulling my legs off to the bed\nIt was it was very frightening I mean I felt like they were actually trying to pull me off the bed so I got up\nAnd there wasn't anybody in the room and uh I I tried I just kind of walked around a little bit I have to go get something you know some water or something\nAnd then all of a sudden I I went back into the bedroom and on the night stand there was everything was vibrating\nLike there was an earthquake but there was nothing else in the room that was moving and it was just the stuff on the night stand there was my wife's ah my wife at the time or her hand mirror a clock and a few other little items that were on the night standard vibrating and some of them fell off\nAnd I put them back on there\nAnd that goes for both sides of the deepest lows not let America and the glorious high [noise]\nHappening all around to talk about it right here the voice of Boston W.
