back to this week in sports history let's start off back in Nineteen twenty three were the New York Yankees when they're first world series feeding\nThe New York giants four games to to to date the Yankees won the world series twenty seven times\nThe next closest team to St Louis cardinals with eleven weaken Nineteen thirty three the Philadelphia Eagles play their first NFL game and lose the New

National Hockey league career scoring record is one thousand eight hundred and fifty points Gretzky retired in Nineteen Ninety nine holding\nRecords for most career goals most career assist and most career point two thousand eight hundred and fifty seven at your high hard radio weekends for its time capsule\nArcane those boys so Boston\nNo share his thoughts with you and uh I understand it's going to happen a more frequently up over the year twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty which I could not encourage it imagine this country imagine some of the fallout and what about uh three weeks three weeks in a day or two if the Democrats take the Senate\nOne consequence of that will be there would not be any federal judge has confirmed\nBy the U.S Senate over the next two years and won't happen and then if Trump is reelected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely\nAnd the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty I mean when I come from any federal judges for the next two years or for the next two years after that\nSo we're looking at possibly a six year timeframe that the Democrats take the Senate when there are no federal judges confirmed by the state Senate under Chuck Schumer thing about that and the impact that would have on your life in my life\nBecause CNN and the Democratic party and NBC ABC and CBS\nListening Leslie stall and sixty minutes few hours to go there and a complete meltdown over the possibility that Trump could be reelected they're doing polling already encouraging Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders to run and I can then and twenty sixteen the only Democrat\nThat Trump could have beaten was Hillary Clinton every other one probably would have beaten the president\nAnd America would not be right now mourning in America revitalization a brand new American economy three point seven percent unemployment rate crack down on the southern border we're new ... new trade deals with Canada and South Korea and Mexico\nThe president just talked about with you and I we wouldn't have any of that stuff going on\nAnd so that's why three weeks in a day for now it is so important especially if you live in uh Ohio if you live in a if you live in Missouri if you live in North Dakota if you live in Florida if you live in Texas there's ... there's a few critical races that will deter\nAnd whether or not the Democratic party will investigate or whether the Republican Party will legislate\nJust think about two to six years ever having no federal judges confirmed anywhere at the Democratic party text US Senate they will shut down completely\nThey will not work with this president digging anything done including criminal justice reform reforming marijuana laws whatever it might be the president is on the precipice\nAnd twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty of doing some great stuff and I do not believe I Do not believe that Democrats are necessarily going to take the house I Do not believe that the polling was so wrong and twenty sixteen it was a joke\nAnd so if the house in the Senate stay in Republican hands good stuff this is just the beginning on the other hand a wise man told me in Washington\nThat the first two years of the Trump presidency will be peaceful compared to the next two years if the Democrats take the house and or the Senate that's what we'd gone through the past two years the fight coal and scream to move this country forward\nWill stop completely and there'll be investigation upon investigation and no legislation it'll be think Trump at all costs saying the ss Trump\nAnd you know and I know and so if you're in one of those contested congressional districts whether it's California Texas Florida Ohio Colorado North Dakota wherever it is go out and vote Republican to keep\nThe house in the hands\nOf ah the successor of Paul Ryan whoever it might be and especially if you're one of those five or six states that have a Senate race that is so competitive\n... like in Nevada or Arizona or North Dakota or Missouri even in Michigan Ohio Florida you've got to go out and vote imagine the world with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer completely in charge of the house and the Senate because at that point zero zero it's not it will get done\nCNN and et cetera is then to destroy Kanye West mode\nBecause the most loyal voters in America are black voters for the Democratic party and when African Americans figure out what the Democratic Party historically has done to them and not for them hopefully the Democratic party ...\nThanks for listening and I think not I think having the president on is always a great joy\nAlso Bill O'Reilly the book is killing the ss and of course diamond and so and I don't know how we equal or exceed this kind of show next Sunday night but the great American built Cunningham\nWill do my best thanks for listening tonight and fleas I'm going to urge you if you're in one of these contested house districts are one

new uh we were talking about the inventory still in the dream still or right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward and in the dream still up a ... most of the forum\nThe pay for that my new published last week is on his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show\nIt's like on my news website over a coast to coast to I'm going to take history there there are a list of papers on the right hand side\nThe current neighbor is the one that is on the town\nNow with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical but the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an allegation which is is that some of the layers\nHave a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah [noise] um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review or a who was it was very well known or ... or drop here who don't we reviewed my paper or he calls the waves um and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by fitness petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course\nAs a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but every once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker corps\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another sudden jump in sickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's ... peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base some of these peaks\nHave rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so you found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and in the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred ten\nUh originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed\nThere was a they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top and the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the the most prominent researcher who was proposed this is Robert ... father John Paul will go out\nAnd the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall a\nA page and it's also in cause me gloom uh his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains this theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and now of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred ten courses\nWe have is there a consistency to the ah repeating of the ticker layers\n[noise] um ...\nDoes it every ten steps is it every twelve is there's some kind of ... you\nI that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but\nUnfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of what you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck by when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this or because you know you were\nYou just you know what mine that I thought that they were just a wide the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian Egyptians designed their parents with something called they called ... which is the pyramid and go\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how they ... a pyramid angle so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step fame and and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd cheer question again there's no regularity even to the thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course no I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with bases inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen that earth decker yeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it's still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors\nWell that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in the state to block interview I I think I said that uh Belmont ... I'm sure a shop too and fat create published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't the arcade and the big tipper it was a star Morocco so it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country\nAnd because of that because that constellation ... grows so important to chip shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big tipper and we try to preserve it ended up in that end up north south uh orientation\nI got to jump in right there the coast to coast and we got to take a break my knew this was ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise] get Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the coast so newsletter sign up to the coast to coast am dot com [noise]\nBanking sums\nMoney on it [laughter]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n...

voyage we're talking about a row number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this but these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing moment you're right I'm I'm I'm listing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a war specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty fifty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses\nThat are associated with these round fractious tend to run a over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation or and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know courses that have a surface area that is around a number of facts of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid what we don't know of any spaces and war but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I think at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that ... ... exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this kind of way yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right but then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example correspond a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth from Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... that ah that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the ...\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the feeling of the queen chamber\nA than the other courses don't don't have round ... twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and there'll be have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nUh and that goes across the feeling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and ten twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of the relieving chambers inside the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be real eighty four\nNo role eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this scandal that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the ... the big boys\nI got it yes yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly we just it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know paint that that into this illustrations just to give a rough guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does my news see any connection between a dynastic Egypt shouldn't use of the lion and the use of the lion and go back ... tabby\nAnd everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things thrown dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shock we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd we constantly land a ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course\nUh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic event the end of the ice age the construction of go back to lead tabby the erosion on those things all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC\nYet which makes you go back leads happy not an accident\nNo within references of course uh with lines too as well extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely that it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak what authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to

there been any\nIntention to reconstruct the original boring a key subplot to do and I know that sounds radical but for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what special these sub remote viewing\nInto an intuition and actually reconstruct the temples repair the temples half that's been discussed\nYes and as such a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the\nMinister of antiquities is trying to partially restored a monument so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern reconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do a section\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched so that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard or it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter or my new alien um\nThey are basically recreating gives a a a ... in in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to uh descend into a virtual world and it will be exactly like the way it looked like the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and I they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid where did you come up with the number six or eight\nLight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know the the simple rules at the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth\nI think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to school out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast Hi\nUm I had a quick question about the\nUh so he'll watch uh I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids in for research and just general public access\nAnd I had heard that after the uh um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned what is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better\nAccess for research in the general public and I'll take my answer off the air\nGreen question Daniel minute what's it like there now with ... you\nRegarding Dr hot so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study of Robert Robert shock and I are on and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages\nOn the one hand it sounds like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that they uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they want research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and stuff and you can do about it other than you just try it and what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... research would be ongoing like it is it because I have watched was ah still the director there\n... I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the on the on the ah the board of directors that reviews the data so he is involved or at least not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he is involved they ask employees at by a if you put\n'em you know I think there's sort of a mixed bag you know there is the public's eye of us who you know I was on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientists the archaeologist who loves what he does\nUm you know it's difficult to kind of saw it all out but I think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research done and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects\nThat uh you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell being you're being safe and political right now and I understand that I knew it and I respect that yeah but there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that's why are they gonna have to open ... are they going to have to back pedal\nYeah so it to the to the listener's question I think I forgot that goes down you I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you you said two thousand eleven so I think that has something had changed uh they're sort of a you know people are even Egypt causes that talked to some of the scholars there the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nA Fayette they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right there I knew I got to take a quick network break this coast to coast am more by new when we come back stay with us\n[noise]\n\nHe\n\nLoves to ease up\nSo we got a big weekend in sports around here maybe\nSachs obviously ...

Thanks This is a great show of all was just trying to ... to ... to one shouldn't go war which is the looming of ... is it\nAny other language or languages you ... or ... or you can get a looming over\nA a fail a which is a believe a ... a lot of the ... uh you know do this for quite some time [noise] [noise] oh sorry about it a low\nOkay so I think oh well let me let me jump in I guess what you're asking my new is uh the origin of the word pharaoh and where did it come from from a which which people\n... to ... to ... to ... to ... the word of the main all of the pro which it ... the push language\nKush language which is of course ... ... to ... years ago yeah ... ... ... as the you know we're talking about a quite of three ... for ... years ago\nIt's been ... older than any other

actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thanks for the phone call a minute the origins of the word Barrow and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't buy some thanks for interpret I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so\nSo he chipped colleges are saying that are in the old kingdom a that term was not use so the term pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the kings of the old king them I think\nThe first ah I'm I and I can't remember if it's middle kingdom or new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appeared and that's all I Know about it offhand\nI said what I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here uh when we were when we're going back to a man as a um and in the first and now I'm going to say the word they referred to as kings\nYeah right right like ... and men is\nUh the first uh kings of Egypt could be some are saying that the the same uh ... may be the same or they could be two different teams they weren't called pharaohs back then\nRight and now there's another uh uh\nUh I have research that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egyptians and the ... that are there now I'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\nYeah um yeah I Can't really comment on it because I don't know enough about it um I I it regarding what the king was called I can tell you that uh by the fifth dynasty the king have five different title\nUm and in the very beginning um you know the kings were called horse came so it was horse in the armor\nAnd hors ... so uh so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after I came you know the designation a net to invent which is basically referring to operate in Egypt\nAnd then came the two lady's name a you know and then came to cartoonish name later um but uh the as you just set yourself so Harold came later I I just looked it up if I was like twelve hundred BC is the first time it was used\nThere you go let's go east of

Boston in our radio station [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am on this beautiful Sunday Now Monday morning here in Southern California my new or the phones have been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to\nIn the ... of him you know a numerically that is not not in writing but in the in the language of mathematics um and it's not complicated math it's actually some of the features that Jimmy and I have talked about and some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid\nYou can find them in the months in the dimensions of the ... of him you know and you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website\nGo check it out and tell me what you think that I think the answer the question is yes I think this is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website and one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino\nAnd do you know says are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTraits meaning\nBut it's just what it says in the winter we don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things that I Do know is referencing near one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological ah with the non linemen\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I I watched this documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain that\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nA has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWe'll let me help you with this idea when we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala Honduras and believes that the tops of these pyramids there's always something there\nWhat about the top of the great pyramid is what do not not the top top but could there be a chamber or something at the at the upper levels\nYet as well I think so I think that could be that they could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a drop off ... vow has provoked pose that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a\nIt would've been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that's here is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory I and others have proposed similar things there's even the here with I think I'm a this was first mentioned by a state Jeannie in a night in the Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins\nThat there was this fear on top of the great pyramid so not up to her media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in ... a a and one is clearly defined edge row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so how big would it be way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid and said Hi I'm how big could that chamber B\nI think a chamber like that would be ... may be no more than five feet something like that five feet by ... Hi I'm saying right you know maybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year scan was from the queen shaver so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nYeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber ... scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that\nUh Rudolph gun to bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face you know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do it you mean by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that\nWas on fire investigated it's up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the north east corner right\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable states you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers they made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any efforts excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know that you have to pay the people to do the experiment I'm guessing multiple a million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money as maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I think if you do any kind of invasive a project or in a project like this is spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the things and hope to things that is a kind of money that will need for a project like that\nThis is coast to coast am I

history and Egypt and are against tonight my new safe side they published a paper that you can read all of his papers\nOver on his website Chiapas pyramids a dot com and the links to that are over ed coast to coast am now minute before we get back to the calls I talk to you before and I mentioned this in my opening\nLittle rant here tonight on coast to coast which is and knees you we seemed to have amnesia\nAnd it's all over the place but\nIt's it's ... it's not represented any more plainly than what happened\nIn Egypt after Cleopatra and we had that uh example of it but it was going on for a year she was the last pharaoh in Egypt before she committed suicide\nThe amnesia had already set in and what we need to and you mentioned as a last week on my other show fade to black which is this that Cleopatra\nIs nearer to us than she is to ancient Egypt there's three thousand years there there's only two thousand years on this side\nOf of Cleopatra and that's an insane amount of time we don't really understand how old the Egypt is until you look at it in those terms right\nRight and then going back to go back to tip the and the time when we think the original stinks was built then you double that entire time period one more time\nAnd more\nWhy is it that we we are so quickly to forget the past\n[noise] well I think because ah I ... as Graham and cook a Robert shock I'm Robert Duvall and other office um you know have proposed that there was a catastrophe on earth and it wiped out or the evidence of\nThis ah these are earlier people and uh the only thing that survive worth about these monuments\nUm and so uh I think that's probably why we've forgotten I I always remember this great movie planet of the apes the original one with Charlton Heston of you know when he lands on the planet that he thinks is another planet but it's actually earth\nAnd then you know at the end of the movie he finds out the hard way that ah that this earth has a major and\nThat you see the statue of liberty bird in the sand and I just had such a profound impact on me that movie um and I think that's sort of maybe that's the story that we're living in in reality\nLet's let's head back to the phones it's been an incredible my here with the with the audience and\nThey they are just as interested in finding the answers to these questions as you are I and let's go wild card is going to Dorothy in Carmichael, California Dorothy Europe next on coast\n... how I'm okay with me and he can ... ... ... that can and cannot\nRespond to both for all that when our credit he had heart in my room ... like ... ... ...\n... ... ... in it that way it is harder hit than\nThat in mind here I'm OK kissing me take it with the like I think when they can then maybe you could recreate mom model if they would like that\nA ... hit hit the kid there you know found and we had kind of thing like ... they had in mind where he now than they can ... get it there you know while\nMaybe had kind of thing how\nAre you talking about the Winchester House here in California\nYeah remember ... built on the facts and they go get confused it wouldn't bother her and you know she she arrived there at the end but she had in mind went nowhere [laughter]\nYeah and the spirits would get lost\nIn there and get them right now I Know that and it it can\nAnd maybe they ... you know they wanted the oil because they do that and they had a rat\nAnd maybe that's a great day when they're younger they're okay you know how well they're not because of the year for a long time and then getting out there and maybe\nDuring the during the I'm In the jumping in and and say\nThat you are on does something my new and I have talked about this the\nThe blocks in their rooms in side of the great pyramid our acoustic lead tuned they resonate add a bowl many frequencies but one of the main ones is a four forty\nWhich resonates through out the great pyramid doesn't it Manu\nClare right and I was so they have a couple of comments about your question Dorothy so first of all Christopher done or when he was talking with Jimmy a few days ago\nUm I think uh if you ask Christopher done if a if his model his theory makes has room for the you know extra space as the pyramid he may say yes\nI'm a ... so I could because it because of these residences and General Electric ... energy focusing and all those things so that's the first part of your ah one ounce or\nThe other answer about me you were talking about the spirits of the kings so I you know sort of the same vein I I think so first of all the Egyptians did make rooms\nFor spirits of the king and for a ... to receive offerings basically so we know that ... had a small room in front of his pyramid where a statue of him was placed and uh it was basically looking out to the little uh you know the cold\nUm and ah have me or do you ask about him you know so him you know uh his must stop I actually had as a room a small room and the statue of him was placed in that room and then it was wild up and what was that for it was for spirit\nTo receive offerings of from you know his family and so I think you are I think you're absolutely right and in fact what you're asking is very much in line with what the Egyptian believed\nThat uh uh you know that ah just the spirits were very much there there were very much present and they just have to be housed inside of either a mommy or statue and then it became alive and uh and it was still interacting with a family members with the friends\nGreat call tonight let's go west to the Rockies to Garret up in Portland, Oregon Garrett welcome to go well\nHey the Matty great to have you on board um thing I have a question about the things yes\nAll right so about a year ago their videos pictures
