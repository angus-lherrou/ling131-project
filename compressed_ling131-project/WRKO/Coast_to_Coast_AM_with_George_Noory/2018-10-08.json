suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology on going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said where of course that place turned out to be here is if the one from\nLas Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada and um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me\nUm it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd then finally you know the the word gets out and the technology advances to such an extent that\nThey acknowledge it finally I mean look how how many decades that the area fifty one was not even acknowledge as being a real military installation and and now it is but even now they are very particular about how they describe it\nAnd so it seems to me that there has been a space for us all ready for a long time\nAnd that space force serve the dual purpose I mean it can make\nA the defense of earth against other earthlings\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending\nPerhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them\nThat are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would've destroyed is already if you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country\nThen why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do what ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just\nIn case you don't you need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving us better to\nBe safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah file I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are being out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um\nThey they ... you know would otherwise destroy is ah if you know if if that was their plan but\nOn you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien a theorist talk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel [noise] um if they they come back and they want to enslave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here\nAnd modified our our genetics in our DNA to in slave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever if their goal is to come back here in ... it might be a better fate for us to commit to global suicide in other words\nAnd again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know callers on us and and work like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan I'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made\nA one of his speeches I Believe it might've been before the un jumped in what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nWhat did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people banding together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to raw as well and um you know the the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep [noise]\nI mean there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call 'em visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some uh beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against and they're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do\nAnd so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps presenting that maybe now we humans are experimenting\nWith some stuff sadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating effect\nUh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you will not get the wisdom but boy the the the earthlings are run with it and so we need to put them back on their play\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah fake it which this Saturday it's October the thirteenth is going to be my final wishing machine

mean that it goes back thousands of years and um I I think Fallon was the original pronunciation and they would talk about this being a period of time with them or if\nThey were you know reaping rewards of service but preparing for the whole month of winter and so they believe that as the world was sort of transitioning\nInto or the cold that time that there was a period where the the veil

George this also happens to be the time of year when\nA here in our part of the world the earth is shifting away from the sun and so uh that means not only does it get colder and darker as we built in to that mysterious back a black void of space\nBut furthermore uh we are not being as a strongly bombarded\nBy the the radiation coming from the sun and therefore subtle things\nThat might otherwise have been sort of drowned out in the noise of the sons radiation could pop a little more so for example let's say a eyes shine a flashlight at towards you outside on a bright sunny day while you're not going to notice that as much as you would if I\nDid it on a dark night right and so what happens in general in there but it's still there it's still there but it's just not as prominent and noticeable so this is\nThe time of year when we shift away from the sun and a lot of these subtle energies electromagnetic electro static and otherwise\nThat are associated with these spirits another paranormal entities are suddenly more distinctive and a play more of a significant role in in our awareness and of course we're we're also ... in Hampton this because we're we're paying more attention and we're looking out for it more\nLet's take some calls here with Josh as we continue chatting I Want to ask you about Robert The hunted all in a moment let's go to Charles first time caller in Asheville North Carolina hey Charles go ahead\nYou're with us no\nHe's not let's give John and Virginia Beach Virginia try John go ahead\nGeorge ... uh I wouldn't tell a story that at the back in the nineties\nYou know I I never believed in ... spirits UFOs eighties and things of that ... however ... Nineteen leaders Middle East\nI had an uncle had passed away and they were having a little little showed his point of the church and I was in that close to him but I just said you know any way I Am I went I was late getting as so I had to sit in the back or treacherous\nAnd services going on and all of a sudden I felt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the pushing the check and I looked up and it was my uncle\nHad just passed away and and he\nTold me he said John ... your car\nAnd I was shocked I didn't know what to do and then again you said John ... your car when I was so scared I had to get out so I got up\nLate and what he was gone but still you know I knew something and so I got her at a friend of mine in the next morning I called my cousin which was the son and it has to wait\nAnd asking it to you and then when you're not clear to me and I get him right back home he shouldn't matter though so he and his go and get my car and the key to pulling that anyway he\nGot in my car when they pull that that ... ... hit by a truck and they they weren't killed but they were extremely you know what I mean they had ... votes and\nBut I never told me like this and that was really like to see anything that it was a dead till two of my close friends and I'm\nOut of the way they're not with the show they have the I\nGuess you know up until now I haven't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the\nCar you know what I didn't want to do that and he told me down and\nWhat you didn't carry on to them no no no that was the\nIdea they ended in my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was a time I ... and ... like a safe stage goes to get all the same thing is for them to have seen him\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks among us right now who are uh you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future are all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like the song by the police\nAnd so when you are spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presidents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see\nThe future to a degree that you cannot or it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle ah they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms that are coming\nThat the aunt can't see but the answer's more sensitive to what's happening on on a lower level\nSo anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who Passover my definitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation\nAnd see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this case drawn and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point live like a king and and and this is very funny because you still ...\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous at Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there\nThey were taking him out and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations on him and it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck started hitting all those people\nThat suddenly word began to spread like okay this dog here\nAnd you know Robert was fighting back\nAnd it's because of that that um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people\nI don't know better you didn't need to take the chance to a day to win a thousand dollars all you've got to do is to listen to win every hour after the news from six AM to nine PM well up here on the great\nW.

I perfectly and he's looking at me and I start mop and they continue mop like okay this is kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering\nIt seems like since I've been working there for about a month like you think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit you really start show theirselves or\nAnd he wasn't supposed to be there was ...\nI I don't think so I talked to the CNA in a couple of the nurses and they told me that they everyone who goes in there\nBy their cell or maybe two or three people they feel like someone's watching them and I was just wondering might huh\nJosh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon because it's full moon I could tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHuh do you know the little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they sent from what we understand no owned have died there but they said we don't know a full history\nOf the ways in hospital where do you think Josh\n... thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to what I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy field being\nMagnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder\nDrier environment and I know that certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet and touched the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between\nEnhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating Loomis life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro steady charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm\nAnd that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible filled around that that creates a physical effect but then the third and final point of course is that this time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store\nYou see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies\nYeah and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the higher likelihood of experiencing something ghostly spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nAnd Josh don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nEspecially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody that becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat ah I every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent in North Carolina then there are in Scotland\nAnd uh we should remember that the very first attempt\nAt an English Settlement was in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Roanoke Island and they all vanished so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mystery the ah last calling me and so I was born in the area that had\nUm an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating Fallon and Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited and I'm sure contributed to the fact that uh I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your uh been again one more time\nOr I go to Joshua pie Warren dot com is no period after the

program\nThank you very much for having me on\nVery backgrounds hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that\nWay at Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up\nYeah thank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't interested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a uh\nA feature story a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born and ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here\nAnd so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and ghost stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or didn't Halloween cut into your birthday when you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday ex financial I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it I get off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nA and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories and a supernatural\nSo I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and and sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple ghost stories with\nYou know tales of synchronous cities and and forty entails so a haunted World War two it turned into be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these goals stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to regular guy\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know most\nOf the stories that I wrote about before a university goes stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music\nThere was there sort of a light hearted aspect of those stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower um and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of\nAtrocities in World War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities so there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know uh all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring a what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research haunted World War two was\nThat um\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think go stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect in the history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding\nThese ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct a you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops in ... during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went to the little big corn\nOh we're custard slashed Dan was and you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg we know is fun to write and sure there are other battlefield that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting visit because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they say that this in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma of war ah causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over\nSo that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some of the arrests that also say that\nYou know the shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plane to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what\nThe skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal uh activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most talented a bowl\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories are especially\nIn it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourists there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications uh seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy beaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker and when\nThe daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers ... they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she saw these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe\nTheir uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff immediately ... a recognized these uniforms is German uniforms and\nLater he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that away from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there\nAnd they matched or what could have been ...\nAnd that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and his name's Tom put do and he told me that uh he investigated the art dance battlefield which is in in Germany\nIt's W.

ghosts of country music more hunted rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest hunted in World War two soldiers spirits ghost planes and strange synchronous cities Pearl Harbor is it haunted or not\nPilots were trained bomber pilots fighter pilots a fighter pilots for a night I'm fighting a squadron were documented some of some of the most startling run ins with these UFOs\nThere's a story of alone be Seventeen crew that watch to UFO track them for miles I I think almost a about an hour\nAnd then of course a lot of people consider what's known as the battle of Los Angeles was a\nGreat story of a ... yeah that's an amazing story and a and usually I think the was the story was the moving Nineteen forty one with John Belushi they made it seem like it was just based on what the war department called war nerves in other words this was\nA shortly after World War two I think er I'm Sorry after the bombing of Pearl Harbor I Believe it was in February of Nineteen forty two [noise]\nAnd aircraft gunners anti aircraft guns started firing in the air there was all kinds of pandemonium a and the war department just said the the people were nervous but I found it very uh an account from a very uh good witness\nWho are actually it was ... a professor at occidental college um later he was just a kid at the time and he said that ah what he witnessed was a huge object\nThat was pretty much just standing at it sitting still in the middle of the ... right above the ocean that these guns were trained right on it and it didn't seem to have any effect and then it drifted it almost sounded like it drifted right over his head so it was\nTo me that was more of a story about something weird happening in the sky let alone a war nerve\nCell in and they shot against the Matthew people could hear ... sounds yeah and reading something\nRight this this person actually said uh some of the shells were landing a few feet away from them and they had a the spotlight trained on it I think there's a a pretty dramatic picture that shows that\nIt is dramatic Matthew swing with us his latest book haunted World War two where do you get the book map you\nYou can get it at Amazon dot com Barnes and noble dot com go to your um a local bookstore and see if they have it in if they don't shake 'em down and try to get it in for me I'd appreciate it\nWhat about haunted ship from World war two\nWell I didn't want to just I didn't want to leave our our sailors\nOut no nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside\nWell yeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so\nThe interesting thing about a ... after World War two if you had these battleships you had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that\nIt was a shame to just got all them or to reduce them to scrap but luckily for us a lot of um\nPeople got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports\nThey brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call them shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing\nWell the shadow creature around the uh the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship base a haunted sites uh there there\nIs a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who wanders around the deck some of the battle ship the USS North Carolina I worked with um\nA a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal and they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there\nUm and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those uh and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book\nSo yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved and have him back here ghosts and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seemed to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy mhm for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\nYeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element\nOf uh you know the not just the ghosts of World War two but uh when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of\nOf country these tragedies just seem to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe they were just so primed um to to\nWhen we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew Swain we're gonna take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of your haunted rock and roll stories those ... those are fantastic too\nI Love them that's one of my favorites\nAnd they just keep coming more and more and more they just never stopped like you know people like Michael Jackson who passed on now when prince and folks like that have they come back you up to a ... as a ghost\n... well there are definitely go stories about Michael Jackson uh there were a few a video anomalies\nWhen a when I Believe his brother I Believe it might have been germane was being interviewed people said they saw Michael Jackson walk behind him there are stories from a neighbor's of a former ... home owned by Michael Jackson who claim to hear music coming out of it at odd times\nWhen there shouldn't be anybody

Boston in a heart radio station [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] and welcome\nBack to coast to coast Matthew swing with us Matthew I'm Adolf Hitler as sick as he was was also interested in the cult did you come across anything that the dealt with that\nYou know I did and I came away with a little bit of a different perspective about Hitler in the cold\nUh you know initially I thought that Hitler was a a cult practitioner throughout his life but what I found through my research and this is pretty controversial and I'm sure there'll people have have different ideas and I'd be glad to entertain those thoughts too\nBut it sounds like Hitler's early\nA philosophy was influenced by a cold groups like the full society in the ... society\nVery prevalent in a pre World War two Germany in that area but what I think happened was that Hitler was of all things are not in a coal theorists but more of an an incredible\nSociopathic nurse assistant I don't think he could think\nThat there was any type of power a worthy of him I think he thought he was the ultimate power and that the state was the ultimate power and so what you see later is that a Hitler begins to purge a lot of those so called groups he starts to go after fortune tellers\nAnd astrologers so I came away with a little bit\nOf a different opinion on the cold in in Nazi Germany uh likewise I was sort of fascinated that the cult played a much bigger role in my opinion a among uh\nThe side of the allied side so there were\nThe wiccan in England who ah\nTried to get together to uh spiritually or go after the Nazi regime or they held um\nMeetings in the ... got together with the express purpose of trying to to stop 'em and Germany from invading England and likewise uh and I really picked us up from a frequent guest on coast to coast Mitch Horwitz yes\nAh the allied a new thought ...\nA movement and those are a lot of the practitioners for that group were very involved into trying to use spiritual techniques a cult techniques to stop Hitler from uh from succeeding so those were\nA different ways that a ... you know when I tried to write a book I'm I'm really I Know a lot of people write books because they know a lot I like to learn a lot\nSo I go into a ah some of these stories with really preconceived notions and then as I delve into it I find\nTwists and turns that that I I Try to bring out uh in in the book\nNow in your stories on haunted rock and roll told me the theme about those\n[noise] well the theme about haunted rock and roll is\nThat I really when I started writing hunter rock and roll and again another I listen to our Gary Patterson on your show many times ah and ah\nYou know I started to investigate and what I thought initially was that rock and roll had this special cult power and maybe people that were into the Cold War attracted to it\nBut after writing of the country book and revisiting rock and roll for more on a rock and roll when it comes a came away with is the thought that music is really just to consciousness raising toll\nAh it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's also a key part of a lot of um historical movements like the civil rights movement\nThere's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness\nOf both the listener and and the musician that I think makes either people more open to things like the supernatural the cold or maybe a you know actually can kind of promote these these types of powers in these types of of of visions\nSo that's really the theme that kind of runs through all of those book in my opinion\nWell that's pretty dramatic stuff and the like we were talking earlier the current rock stars that have faded a haven't shown up yet but they will I think eventually don't you\n... yeah I sometimes this is a matter of what I find is that it's a matter of\nThese stories in these tales in the supernatural usually start out fanned fan musician to musician a person that witnesses\nIt talks to another friend and then for me it usually bubbles up on line and blog posts and then uh newspapers will investigate I'll look into it goes counters will be attracted to the site\nSo it takes a while I'm I'm Still waiting for some good ghost stories about David Bowie for example\nJames Dean of course died young in a car accident and was in his car chopped up into little pieces and they saw all the parts and apparently they were haunted\n[noise] yeah that's a ... the name of his car yeah he um he had a car was a poor spider or wasn't involved in Iraq and then\nA pieces of it because it was really a race car a pieces of it were salvaged and I know there's one story about um a a one race car driver used a piece in his car and a car fell on him and I think crushed him to death\nBelieve it or not there's a parallel to that in the haunted World War two book there was a\nI think it was a beat twenty four the crash landed in the desert of North Africa pieces of it were recovered are that are now in the national I think air force a museum\nA and pieces of that plane were reported to be cursed in that uh I think some of the pieces went went into a\nA a a plane that later crashed I think a couple of planes crashed based on it so so there is a connection\nAll right let's take some calls here for you Matthew let's pick it up by going to Frank in Hollywood, Maryland again a stern and Frank\nYou're back with you when you made any subject in I I I I think you know they had some things at the uh uh and not the Nazi Germany but what about\nA place where people were murdered by by not a I once saw a film where\nThey get a shot at three hundred shot down over a ... they are going to get that they were shot down a credible uh what was found\nAnd I'm Wondering if any any hunting and in a remote places where you're not you're not take my answer off air okay\n... thanks for that that's a that's a great question and I believe I Know exactly which\nWhich footage you're talking about and believe it or not one of the stories that I came across a is I think from that area because I I Believe that might have been taken in Poland Czechoslovakia\nAnd there are stories about some of the victims of the Jewish victims of those atrocities\nUm that still hunt those areas again I I I found out of a difference for those those people\nThat I Would leave them out of the book and and wouldn't try to try to um you know we looked at like I was making any money from that so I I left that out but yeah definitely those stories crop up\nAnd I guarantee you if you were in those areas you would find a lot of go slower a lot of folklore and a lot of stories about those places\nMatched up we go to Charles Elgin, Texas St Charles
