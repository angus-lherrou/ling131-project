I Hope he gets on the court I'm not sure even now but once he gets on the court or if he gets on the court this will seem more\nLike a like a botched joke by the Democrats it's just so outrageous what's going on here they it's it's like the Russia investigation because everybody knows Bush to show\nThe\nThe Russia investigation what was the last time they actually mentioned Russia it's been a long time hasn't it I'm not even sure what the may major allegations talking points et cetera are in the Russian investigation anymore and even though the Brett Kavanaugh\nSo called investigation is only been going on for a month or a couple of months I mean they've already moved away from the initial allegations again where I mean we're not talking seriously anymore about attacks\nOn a on Christine Blasey Ford or any other woman now the allegation is\nHe's a he's a heavier drinkers then he said that he didn't actually\nHe should be brought up on charges of lying under oath to the Senate Judiciary committee because he said he liked the beer\nWhen actually he loves beer and he little eddies and he is not a guy he he he doesn't just get sleepy when he drinks he fought he passes out you'll notice he said he got sleeping when he drank main again\nYou know human being right that's the that's the the effect of alcohol the precedent on a human being\nIt depresses you you get sleepy you fall asleep eventually if you drink enough\nEven Ted Kennedy even Ted Kennedy\nThat's why he needed to do other things other than gray so that he could stay awake to drink more\nWith Ted Kennedy would think about this ongoing attempt to to have prohibition of straws wouldn't require him to have new new ... new twenty dollar bills in his possession at all times anyway\nThis is how outrageous it got though this this weekend the u._s._a. today never great newspaper\nBut it was it was somewhat respectable and it's a day now which is as bad as the New York daily news I mean that there's not even the ... there's never the New York times as bad as it is\nMight occasionally break a story the the Washington Post did good work on the ... a rape case back in the day but what his USA Today ever\nDone in terms of\nAny kind of journalism mean breaking still important news stories it's never done anything\nIt just comes to your when your when you were to marry a hotel or Hyatt hotel on a business trip and you wake up in the morning and you go outside to go down to the continental breakfast and you trip over the paper that has been left for free outside your door that's that's USA Today\nAnd it used to be that they had later scores than the national newspapers\nBut that doesn't but now that you have a cell phone ... what does it matter\nIf they have later scores of the if they have the west coast games in the in the final additions and I don't even think they have they I don't even like they have all all of us have the final a final west coast games or the Monday Night football score\nBut anyway over the weekend they have a they have a sports columnist named Eric Brady that's Eric with a K this is what he wrote\n... I mean the how low\nCan these people go I Want you to think about this before I read this to you\nThe U.S Senate may yet confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court but he should stay off basketball courts for now when kids are around\nThe nation is deeply divided sometimes would feel I feel like we don't agree on anything anymore but credibly accused sex offenders should not coach youth basketball girls or boys without deeper investigation can't we all agree on that\nHow how twisted the has to be to write that in and and how how ... have to do his editors have to be to let that run credibly accused\nThere's there's there's no one supporting any of these stories\n\nThat the Yale expose exposure story the New York times wouldn't touch that story they said they couldn't they they interviewed dozens of people no one no one back that up the gang rape story that was put out by the creepy porn lawyer that's even more preposterous\nThis is Mollie Hemingway and the federal is the article which was illustrated with a picture of Kavanaugh and one of the girls basketball team see coaches has since been dramatically revised\nApparently editors at USA Today belatedly ... calling a human being a pedophile with perhaps precisely zero actual evidence of any sexual propriety was indefensible\nBut this is what this is what they're up against you you know\nRussia said this before and I think he's right but the the sports media\nIs even more detached from reality than the the political press corps\nYou know at least a few not an effort declining percentage of people on in the uh Washington press corps have actually covered the real world you know they've actually been outside the beltway\nBut the sports media it's it's all ... and ah and licks peddling and a sucking up the athletes and ah ended and they they want to be PC they ... they want when do you think LeBron James is impressed with this\nYeah I I don't suffer tells me he's not who who maybe Colin Kaepernick\nBut as we as we non now no I mean what is the ... Smith said he doesn't even think Colin Kaepernick wants to come back the football anymore because you're making too much money as a spokesman for Nike\nWho's who's impressed with this credibly accused he calls Brett Kavanaugh credibly accused sex offender\nWhat do you have to do to get to get Sean\nBy by respectable people and if either credible accusations and what are incredible accusations\nYeah I mean really what [laughter] yeah what is it what is a what would you not believe if they let me put it this way Eric Brady do you believe Juanita Broderick deeply Paula Jones you believe Kathleen Willie you believe any or do you believe\nOr the uh Monaghan woman out in Minnesota who says Keith Ellison attacked her do you believe those are ... there was a teenage prostitutes in Dominican Republic who said they had sex with Sen Menendez you believe any of those people or do you only believe people who accused Republicans\nAnd ... and more importantly people who were nominated by Donald J Trump eight four for five hundred forty to forty two I'm highway car\nGuru of around in his\n[noise] so let's see what they went out with based on they've given us Fifteen thousand dollars to give away every day made possible by who else me of course they don't have money to give me\nAnd it'd be honest with you if you're going to be an honest Democrat and an honest liberal you need to condemn what took place you do not smear and destroying a man's life reputation career and his family on a pack of lies because you wanted to leave the vote because you think you can with the midterm elections\nBut she made the accusation and had to be ... it had to be all bad to be pulled out about ... I guess he didn't do it but that doesn't matter because I Would have voted no against them anyway\nThat's fine that's fine you you have the right to do that but I don't know I was on early well here's the point one of them are\nGoing to vote no because they would have done it anyways\nNo that's fine if you want to vote against him on his judicial philosophy that's fine then he gets an up or down vote but now his name and reputations finished he can never teach again he can't coach college basketball again she may never go back to their be it'd be being even a judge they've destroyed this man\nWell he's going to be a Supreme Court justice oh\nWell we'll see I mean the vote is going to be over the next twenty four forty hours but you have Charlie here's what I find most despicable and I'm speaking now as a father of a young daughter and a man who loves his wife and I've got sisters and sister in law's\nDianne Feinstein had that allegation in late July if she wanted him to be investigated\nIt could've been done discreetly could have been in confidential in any confidentiality confidentially as Christine Ford had asked instead she waited till after the hearing process was over and then her people returning to the media and now that woman has also had her life up ended\nSo if you support victims of sexual abuse how could you even continents what Dianne Feinstein did\nWell you know it's politics and they both play dirty both sides and that set\nBitch Paul if that's your answer it's politics is the way things are done but that's the way things are done\nAnd it's sad but it's true\nIt's true okay well how about we don't do things like this anymore Charlie\nWell maybe in the future will be done like that let's say\nI mean that's why a whole Kevin I'll just
