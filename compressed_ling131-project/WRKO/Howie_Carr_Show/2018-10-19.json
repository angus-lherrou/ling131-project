critical journalists she saw slow moving she's not fight ready just deal is and she's just going to be a talking point machine tonight and make it all about Trump deal needs to show that she's a rod and that she's a radical\nRonnie how would you advise deal to deal with the Trump line of attack that you know a vote for deal is a vote for Trump or vote for deal he's gonna rubber stamp the Trump agenda how do you think deal should deal with that because that's exactly how she's going to attack him\nHe should repeat what Trump said in Montana last night Democrats create mobs Republicans create jobs that's what he should say\nDo you think Ronnie ... and I've advised to this to um the deals people in private I said you know there's nothing wrong with him saying look I'm not on you know

with the overtime scandal retired state police lieutenant David Wilson fifty seven of Charleston as plead pleaded not guilty to charges of allegedly stealing at least Nineteen thousand dollars in bogus overtime payments\nHe entered his play in Suffolk superior court and was released on personal cognizant so that those are state charges but I think he's also facing federal charges he's a he's also um he's he's charged with embezzlement in federal court and he's charged with a stealing in a state court\nA Wilson who retired in March was a shift commander in troop east Boston duty office in

when I wrote a column about this\nThey ah they didn't yank the pension and they we fund them the money they put into the pension system minus anything they'd been collecting so like if these guys have like Wilson has been collecting for a while so Wilson if he's convicted on either of the state or the federal charges will lose his pension\nThey and then they will they will calculate how much he paid into the system overall those crooked years but allegedly crooked years he was on the on the job and they will they will take that money subtract anything he got\nSince he retired and then

I couldn't have done it without Elizabeth Warren\nDid here and I'm worried speech right now and and and also like\nTo think the president of the United states for\nKeeping I I was a supporting actor he he's the one who basically put it\nOver that's why that's why she thought that she could get one of the line [laughter] I don't want to thank our viewpoints [laughter] but anyway\nThere's a couple of more a decent stories that we should read before we wrap\nUp the week here tonight to Rebecca ... is a a Cherokee member of the Cherokee Nation and she's a writer and she's a Cherokee historian and she wrote something for USA Today\nElizabeth Warren's part Cherokee claim as a joke and a racist insult to natives like may\nCherokee Nation the largest tribe in the United states in a public statement said the Warren juice of a DNA test was inappropriate and wrong and said the senator is quote undermining tribal interests with our continued claims of tribal heritage unquote neither Warren nor the Democratic party has responded to the statement\nThis is Rebecca and they go in USA Today as Cherokee genealogists of research and I have repeatedly written about Warren descend from\nA long line of well documented white people I Love that phrase well documented ... people [laughter] was it the blonde hair blue eyes that uh they gave it away well\nAre no longer identifies herself as Native American she's still publicly claims her family is quote unquote part Cherokee there is nothing innocent about a white woman claiming her ancestors experience genocide an ethnic cleansing in an escape all both fact for Cherokee families when they did not\nWhy is this so hard to understand\nAnd then she mentioned that uh you know her her a ridiculous statements that she knew but ah she she was part Cherokee because some relatives had high cheekbones quote like all the Indians do\nLet me think of a Republican said something like that\nThey're saying that debate is also the debate tonight is also an CSPAN so you can see it on C SPAN or on the channel thirty eight\nBut DNA test Warren took only shows and mocked conclusively at that that she may have an ancestor who was indigenous to Mexico Colombia or Peru\nUsing this test to support her claim of Cherokee heritage is not only false based on the science but also perpetuates a common and racist stereotype the Native Americans or a hot homogenous group\nThat's good I'm\nGlad I'm Glad they're calling her out and she deserves to be called out\nHow the other thing is I think she\nElizabeth Warren thought that you were the only person who was offended by that and she was so condescending like every year at the ... the St Patrick's Day breakfast she was on the tally cars not here and make them feel as if you were the only person who cared about that and now with the audience because of her\nBringing it up that a lot of people are offended about it they probably didn't know that much about it and now she's come out and laid on the table and people are thinking\nOh wow this really is a horrible thing can take advantage ads and\nAnd I thought everybody forgotten about it because it when when she first was outed in the twenty twelve election\nThat were there were Cherokee groups that actually came here to Massachusetts they weren't even from around here they came and they demand that they went to her campaign offices and the demand that are asked to speak to her and she refused to see him\nAnd you know she she got away with it and she was getting away with it it's a ...
