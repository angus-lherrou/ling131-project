[noise]\n\nWe marked the one year anniversary of Kelly financial founder bill Kelly's passing recently\nAnd we thought we revisit a chat bill had a couple of years ago which seems to predict these very trying times we are living in today\nBill called his monologue rest [noise] and we bring it to you again on her life like\n\nIf you're an investor right now you might feel I think the one way to some of the people with whom are meeting in one way to sum it up is the rest of the sea if you're if you've ever been on a restless see this is talk when white caps it's not quite smooth sock quaint rolling but it's a little bit rough\nAnd you sort of waiting for to get worse and you're preparing and you're hoping for the best I think that's what that's what today's market my feeling to you especially if everything you have is now at the mercy of people that might not know\nIf they're doing and if you feel that that might be happening and you're wondering is there a safe way is there a better way of there is ladies and gentlemen there's an old picture of a man outside of a church freezing he's right below them\nHe's right below the window was winter night it's snowing in and you can see a beautiful stained glass window in a cathedral and he's huddled there well some people look at that picture and when I ask them what they think it is they say oh it's hopelessness\nAnd I say it's just it's not hopelessness to me it's the fact that all that man has to do is walk around the front walk around to the front of the church\nOpen the door and walk in and start praying first of all he'll be warm second of all there'll be people in there to help him actually to SUV him maybe feed him and third he can be on his way to something much different in his life so\nIn in the ultimate despair there's hope\nAnd I think that is important as an investor that use preserve\nWhat you have for the most part to be able to come back on the other day if you choose to do so\nRemember ladies and gentlemen you don't have to play by their rules you don't have to play by their rules so if you feel like you're in a restless see if it gets much worse you could become sea sick or becoming injured\nHoping for the best interests Lucy because you want to get to your destination but what might be happening is things could be worsening over the horizon and you can't see over the horizon you know what's happening around you so we prepare for the worst\nAnd right now I think we have to be careful about sustaining losses until this market takes shape again and if people are out there saying their goodbyes well I'll tell you what I'll say to them goodbye\nBecause we don't we don't trust anything that's happening right now but anyway it's an underlying feeling that we are ... so we're in a restless sea and we're rather less so being rather lists means\nIt's hard to get direction you have to control the boat by or Z then you have to push and you have to pull and you have to struggle\nSo in order to do that it's going to take\nLot more effort effort to get where you want to go there's a lot more danger than having a ... a vessel and if you have a captain who hasn't done this before it's going to get rough and if you've been out in the ocean and you've navigated the boat than you know it it's tricky\nAnd looks very deceptive so very experienced captains of found themselves last ladies and gentlemen because things can get out of hand fast like airplane pilots can they can experience for her to go they can find themselves actually upside down and very dense clouds and they can't figure out where they are and they try to pull up\nAnd trying to pull up there actually driving the plane right into the ground so that can happen at sea so if you feel like there's a restless see of the markets or a or on a restless see and if you feel that uh people play you\nIf if Reuters has good news about jobs in other words there are less people filing for unemployment what about hiring numbers ladies and gentlemen what about the new jobs\nIf they are less people filing for unemployment if we hire five hundred and fifty thousand people into the census than what's gonna what's that what does that do the job numbers or takes five hundred and fifty thousand people off of the\nUnemployment rolls or out of the unemployed category but we don't consider the fact that many people many many people have given up looking for work one in five people right now in our country is on government assistance that's a lot\nForty plus percent of our people in America pay no taxes so if you're on a bus if you're at a bus stop you sitting with ten people on a bus and on the bench or four of them are not paying taxes and the other six are it's getting close to five pretty soon it'll be fifty fifty when it\nGoes over that we're in deep deep trouble so if you're feeling like the investing world is a restless see right now then how do you how do you react you prepare for the worst you pray for the best and you make sure you stay with us at all possible I Wish\n\nLenient safe money strategy with Joan address will Kelly financial seven [noise] on a tape eight eight hundred maintain a
