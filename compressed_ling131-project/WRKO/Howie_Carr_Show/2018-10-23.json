I don't want people to get the wrong idea but my family were immigrants I had my mother's side of the family came from a sexual Europe my father's side from Eastern Europe Georgia Ashkenazi immigrants\nBut they came here legally these people approaching the border\nThey're not coming here legally I I mean a ... as a military person I Would definitely put in\nThe fear of God in them I put in right on the border I Would probably put in water one division of Marines that maybe three or four a regular army divisions and just in case a bone being a brown there in California wants to pull in Enron\nIf I was a ... if I were President Trump or if I was the president I Would say we're ... we're federalizing the California National Guard and if he tries to stop it you put 'em in jail what ...\nUh I don't disagree with that either by the way thank you very much and again thank you for your service for it I appreciate it a good comments to or we need to be tough Cindy in West rock spray you're on the voice of Boston W. or kale\nI make a couple of fat things all the secretary of state Calvin registers people to vote by the constitution he's supposed to make sure that people are citizens to load and he doesn't he doesn't check anything he adds you check a box\nAnd you check the box\nAnd then you register to vote and that simple and it's a disgrace to make it worth I understand that when you sign up for Medicare pay for health you check a box that you want to register to vote and you know who the signing up for mass out all the illegal immigrants\nAnd all the legal immigrants who don't speak English was somehow that here\nI guess who's paying for it\nYou know what you know take fat and salt the queen of the coin you don't go into the service not the criminals on the bottom and the drive by shootings and the looters muffled God is still on the street corners ban watch to see them it's the cleaning the cough and the state law that went into service and\nGave the life of the limb for our country and if we all remember that and stay strong nation and care about our country when we are really doing that it just started\nI agree with you but I but the point I'm making ... ... there's no question about that and they're fighting for people they shouldn't have to fight for their fighting for us\nBut uh uh the corollary of that is they're fighting for some people who shouldn't even be here or getting benefits and the fence I thank you for ... obviously so obviously you don't trust the state government with a license\nYou're kidding me how can you check back and say we trust you I mean the whole bit registering people to vote that should be voting\nNo I understand and I and you make the point very well thank you I'm just trying to get the point across to the state officials here that you would think that at least one a trust in the system because you want to feel as though the person elected legitimately got elected Steve on a truck coming Steve you're on the voice of Boston W ...\nI'm I Do agree with\nYou I wouldn't trust not anything I mean the Democrats are out of their mind the desperate to win at all on the on the national ...\nAnd I would put the military on the border and we get the funding from Guatemala the huge tent city put everybody in their in their own process one by one and find out who you're not actually need the criminal in just leave him there and the ... ...\n... you know Steve I thank you for that and that's you know I see them one of the reasons I did this last half hour to get the pulse\nOf the audience of the grassroots people you\nAnd what's obvious is that people across this audience\nAnd I think it's a reflection of people in the commonwealth simply do not trust government in these elections that we want the border security I think what you have reflected here about the border and everyone's saying put the military there if necessary\nSimply means that this issue has become a crown of thorns for the Democrats they did this they did this to themselves they stuck with this position\nAnd what they've done is to marginalize the massive number of people across this country and then the commonwealth across the state\nWhich may turn the senatorial election around I sure hope in favor of Jeff seal Mike Segal in for Jeff Cohen are good to have you with us back here and do it
