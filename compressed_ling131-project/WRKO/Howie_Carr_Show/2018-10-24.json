[noise]\nColonel again we thank you for being here and thank you for your service\nAs well uh starting with Ronnie in Boston colonel McGinnis running go right ahead\n[noise] they thanks by you know when I came to release their new ad campaign believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything I called up Jeff and I said you watch this is the new Democrats socialist mantra\nGoing forward and it's really just a sideways variation of Machiavelli is the end justifies the means that's\nWhat's so even something go ahead\nIt's also ... that's the he's the guy that ugly and that crowd that mindset\nThat's the mindset behind whoever sent\nThese packages and the reason that they're doing it and the purpose for doing it is so people will say exactly what this lieutenant colonel just said both sides need to tone it down\nBoth sides need to dial it back and I will reject out till the cows come home there is no conservative equivalent to ... or black lives matter or ... there were no Republicans openly calling for the harassment of Democrats or Republicans or conservatives are Trump supporters are blocking highways or\nPutting masks on and beating up warrants supporters or anything else this is\nThis is a ... this is a Democrat socialist scam and they will never find out who did it and I am very upset to hear this which I think colonel fall into this trap of well both sides you know it's one side that's wreaking havoc in our country one side\nI appreciate the call and the colonel go right ahead and respond\nMale Ronnie is entitled to his opinion uh I don't disagree that yeah it does appear as if one side is is very distorted or however there\nAnd other times other places we see both sides participating you know I don't like what happened with Kavanaugh I don't like what's happening with these types of incidents you know civility is something that takes both sides clearly we have a division\nAnd unfortunately it's not bringing us together at this point\nWhat colonel one thing I'll say I'm In fairness to the one point the caller made Hillary Clinton had the chutzpah the audacity the temerity and the disgraceful position to say there won't be civility she used that word you just used as you know she said they won't be civility until we when the house or Senate or both\nShe's trying to say that you you've you've for say when under any circumstance because winning is all that matters the way you do things that there's no morals or ethics it's all about winning she's you know that represents the ... the side\nThat this fellow was talking about nobody Mitch McConnell's never been on civil\nOlympic Graham has never been on civil I'm Bob Corker has not been on civil a but Harry Reid certainly was when he was Senate majority leader he wouldn't give the Republicans a time of day called Mitt Romney a guy who didn't pay his taxes who's turned out to be both faced lie\nAnd and and Harry Reid said well so what we want didn't we that's the way they think you don't see it on the Republican side with all due respect\nYou know I I agree with you ... it's unfortunate that we are on an awful unfortunate that on the other side as being terribly adult about something that uh is potentially tragic sooner or a I don't want\nA those that disagree with what's going on which I I you know I'm appalled by now to get at the same level of\nA ... and pushing back and say we're going to act just like you that's what leads to civil war we don't need to go in that direction I Would like this\nYou know I'm not able to divine what Hillary Clinton uh meant a clearly I think we can all draw our own inclusions\nSo yeah I understand Ronnie point I'm but I'm not prepared to go out into the public for and declare that you know conservatives and those in the right or should act like the liberals because I just can't\nTolerate what they're doing and I'm afraid of what the consequences might\nThink I think we would all agree with that the only point I Would make us up with the conservatives unless this were done by a conservative we do know that that could have been done by somebody on the left but whoever did it we don't know what will we do know is that to this point we're the Republicans have acted with civility\nThey acted with dignity with a a certainly in the case of the allegation against Kavanaugh\nUm I mean my goodness the chair of the Senate Judiciary committee Senator Grassley acted with the great that he was going to fly out there and meet with her and she didn't even know they were going to do that because her left wing attorney Deborah cats lied to her apparently about that that's how they operate a solo Lenski is their God Korea\nWell understand that I understand that Mike where a country of laws\nRule of law must prevail I don't tolerate or what you know Romney in which you've described however you know I don't think that we need to\nRob a rouse the rights to the point that they're as yeah unconscionable and radical in their behavior all that's going to do is to lead to more uncertainty in the country which is already divided so\nWe can condemn it and we shouldn't condemn it somehow we need to be adult about it and recognized that are there are some rabble rousing less than a gesture out of control um and\nWe need to bring it back into control appealing perhaps if there's any one left on the left that you know is rational when it comes to this sort of behavior and understand the consequences whether it's you know trying to expose\nThe Lewinsky influence within that group of people I don't think it's everybody in the left and I think we'll find out in two weeks in the mid term safe place that you know most Americans see what's happening and they're going to side with\nYou know more rational more adult behavior like you saw and\nSenator Grassley that you saw from the tolerance that you know Kevin all put up with from the left so yes a these are tough times but I I have a lot of confidence the American people are not going to allow this country to be radicalized as someone the less whatever the\nColonel is a pleasure thank you for your service and I appreciate your time\nWell thank you\nAnd have a great day sir thank you very much let me go to Carolyn Bridgewater very quickly currently have one minute go right ahead\nYes like I think that ... and right now the left is

general later on in the show eight for four or five hundred forty to forty two grey sweater you got\nThe pipe bombs go Twitter has been\nA crazy place today I think than Shapiro put it best when he said in these situations it's ideal to wait until we have the information 'cause people on both sides are saying things that they really have no idea and\nThose teachers don't age while he might have another day in Trump's America right or on the other hand like this is a huge conspiracy theory this is a false flag well they were actual bomb according to a lot of the news sources though wasn't really a false flag either way the point is they were sent 'em [noise]\nBut yeah it is a little strange that it's all Democrats and I get the return address to Debbie Wasserman Schultz is offices are where officers are located not saying like he married discussing it you can put your return label anywhere so\nYou know that doesn't really seem to either she's a weird situation I Am on honestly how most surprised that we don't know who would it yet because I thought I was kind of only been a few hours\nI Know but I feel like with these things it takes even less time than that and I we don't have to find the Unabomber yeah I've watched I actually told Steve I watched\nThe Netflix Saylor an average probably knows more about the Unabomber than you do\nThere is an outlet showing the Unabomber it is so good at the eight episodes so interesting had no idea I didn't know anything about it going into it so I really enjoy that\nTook four days to find the Muslim terrorists to bomb the marathon\nI Know but all I'm saying is nowadays is surveillance cameras\nAnd it's also a lot easier because the bombs didn't go off and you think if there's any evidence leading back to whoever built them it'll be an attack\nRight and see like you said it's a it was a Korea right so it's not like they were mailed there was a what Korea Korea Korea um so they know they they should be able to actually be like a peanut trail\nYou might have ... they would have had to sign in at the CNN building\nI live or where in a time period that if you're if it's ever going to be a fast way to figure this out it will be right now because we have so much technology that I Would have thought so I kind of in the trial and I was like I'm In a way I mean a weight I'm going away because I would've obviously put in ...\nI'm Glad I didn't wait any longer still they're still very ensure\nAnd there's not a lot of people talking about the ISIS flag that was on one of the pipe bombs\nYeah used by that I mean I don't I don't know I did that they've kind of reminds me of the Parkland shooting thing where he had like a magnet hat on and an ISIS flag and you know you don't want to jump towards anything because it can sometimes I think they just purposely do stuff like that to confuse people\nBut anyway the other news um\nSo everyone's come out and said that it's bad pen from they've all condemned it um but of course there are still being blamed that if their rhetoric that it's leading to the um in other news of rhetoric Megan Kelly didn't\nEric Holder said something a couple of days ago but kicking people when they were down\nYeah and Hillary Clinton said about a week ago that we couldn't be civil with each other until\nThey get the majority back so we're we can act like adults until we're back in control until then we'll just have trial was tempered that from what we're two years old\n[noise] right I I just I just keep thinking of the secret service um that must be crazy job especially in a day like today\nOr any of the mail carrier says John's case of father released a statement\nRight I think that you Steve I'm like yeah it's scary for people like Hillary Clinton and Obama who know that these were getting delivered to them but if I was a mailman I Will be in shock all day I was just carrying\nA device that could've exploded\nWell I mean if I'm the courier and some guy shows up and he's like I needed to deliver to CNN and I see John Brennan's name on it from Debbie Wasserman Schultz I'm like nah nah nah nah nobody else yeah we should\nJohn Brennan the does he work for CNN or\nMSNBC contributor yeah so they they remain was spelled wrong in Florida was spelled wrong Florida was spelled where it was is spelled Ford's\nYou know [noise] I hate to point the fingers but I think most deplorable know how to spell Florida Brennan to I'm going to say but Florida especially\nI mean there was no denying when you watch the people on CNN outside you know delivering the news from their cell phones on the sidewalk there was a real sense of joy that this I I hate to say they were excited babies I think you for you is the word you're looking for\nA you know oddly you know when I received real death threats from real killers I didn't feel euphoria yeah I I didn't feel like total panic but I felt like\n... lightly alarmed yeah I was a yeah I Would slightly alarm was concerning yeah I was a jumping up and down with joy like the CNN anchors were\nYeah we want to say and that obviously we did this is a horrible thing if this is really don't know what what will and if they're not real bombs it's horrible yeah and then there are not getting their right and I mean it just it seemed to me like they were so excited to shift\nThe story from anything else to we are the victims now the Trump cause the print the enemy of the people now we're getting bomb threat but it's kind of a jump the\nCost was you know he he was so so mellow\nDramatic yesterday talking about

hedged behavior or the left us are doing this on their own to show the Republicans are is unhinged as they are or worse\nQuestion that answers itself that's it I don't know that it answers itself six oh three but it's a very good question\nWe've got a statement from Jeff Zucker presidents of CNN quote there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter that's far they've shown no comprehension of that\n[noise]\nThat was ...\nThat was really stupid thing\nA little premature don't you think\nEvery time this happened what no matter what happens to\nPoliticians and people in power she'd come out and say\nThere are crazy people in the world that has nothing to do with than it has nothing to do with that\nAnd now when this happened we wouldn't have to do that every single time but each argument negate the south because there's so much what about eight minutes I Will remember the softball field remember that guaranteed most of them are liberal people doing it to Republican but still it's when it happened people just acknowledge that sometimes people\nSome people it's not about what ... what is really happening\nRight but ... happen no I'm saying is no matter what happens if someone takes it to the level of violence you go from political too crazy town so we can all just acknowledging some people in that that's all I'm saying great Disney my\nCousin on the line Muller spokesman let's let's see

weren't folks that are in the country who are going to take care of themselves who want to obey the laws and enter\nLegally this is a very serious issue and it should be very clear everybody certainly is to the folks up in a second district me northern central western down these mean streets clear to them that this is not keeping our family safe by allowing something like this to happen\nWe need this majority in Congress to make sure we are serious about dealing with these issues\nAnd how how does your does your opponent stand on the issue of illegal immigration\nLet's put it this way how he believes that it's fine\nUh to uh to not allow local law enforcement to report someone who is here illegally to the immigration police meaning he supports sanctuary cities that's always voted to me\nUh that doesn't make any sense to me um but you know what I'm Serious about legal immigration and border security for all kinds of reasons including keeping opioids poison out of our country uh she gives me heroin rabbits a substitute for opioids\nOf pills and also to make sure you know who's in the country they've got to do this illegally is a very serious issue the stakes are very high in this election\nAnd your uh your your opponent though is uh is is saying that the you know he he wants to make it all about the uh about the health care doesn't me\nYeah and you know this doesn't make any sense to me how he is is to a push everybody into a one hundred percent government run bureaucracy it'll cost thirty two trillion dollars double everybody's taxes\nAre in ruined Medicare uh you know and and if you have insurance through your employer it's cancelled how it's cancelled and you're pushed into a one hundred percent government run program where you have no choice good

for all its I mean it's totally fraudulent how come you can't call 'em out on this\nWell we have been doing that and that that we've focused on that in the debates Holly in in our adds a but remember polo city and Maxine Waters and all these other folks are pouring millions and millions of dollars are appear\nTo hide you know his socialist you know radical policies are and uh we're we're pushing back against that ah it's a close race\nWe're going to win this thing but we've got to get everybody out to the polls so we don't have a a radical like this representing the second district to make\nIt looks like a Sean ... pretty good shape I mean you should be able to I Would think you should be able to hang on you're not going to get a a you know what we turn out like you do you do in a presidential election it seems like it'd be easier for you to get re elected this year than ah in twenty six feet\n[laughter] well there's so much money that's come into your hobby that's the problem or in what gold has of course trying to do is hide behind the ... money and in full enough people appear to uh uh to when we don't think that's going to happen I'm committed a that that's not going to happen we're meeting with\nHundreds of people on the ground every day and we get a heck of a lot of support I and I think when it comes to Sean moody who's running for governor another business professional I'm a business professional I spent thirty five years creating jobs in my opponent has absolutely zero experience creating jobs\nAnd I'm On top of that he has a horrible record\nUh when it comes to uh the second amendment\nOr where I've repeatedly or stood up for a Second Amendment rights and Jared Golden it's not\nThat should be enough to win right there and the second district of Maine shouldn't it I mean everybody's everybody's got a gun right\nAh yeah it's a very big deal up here and I'm the only candidate who is repeatedly stood up for a Second Amendment rights in your goals and has a duty rating an F rating which you know the in Iran and the gun owners in Maine but I'll tell you another thing that's really important is our economy is doing better all the time we are at\nTwo point seven percent unemployment in the state of Maine we have a more jobs and we have folks are able to fill those jobs we've got\nTo continue to go forward and continue to improve our economy not go back in the ditch and in an example on the ballot how you won't believe this uh on the first question on the on on the ballot first referendum question is do you want to add three point eight\nPercentage points to are already high state income tax\nUh and uh that would put her uh almost at eleven percent double what the Massachusetts' highest rate is and Jared Golden is the only visible political figure appear that supports it including among the folks running for governor he would put us in the hole in the heck would come up to me\nAnd start a small business or move up here if you got to pay eleven percent\nAlmost eleven percent a personal income tax rate or a small business it's a crazy have you seen in my life but that's the difference\n... eleven percent income tax rate eleven percent right now it's\n... well right now at seven point one five you add three point eight to it it's ten point nine five percent that's what golden support\nWell to be clear her it was it that that taxes only apply to millionaires and billionaires like basically people making more than a hundred and twenty thousand\nDollars [laughter] yeah right that that's the ultimate Trojan Horse so we we dodged the bullet down here in Massachusetts on that they wanted to put the millionaires tax and we all know it's going to be like on people making forty fifty thousand bucks a year that pushed to throw it will be the same thing in Maine it's ridiculous ... by about\n... well they go and what happens if you're running a small business Holly and you know when you're at that level and my gosh\nAnd all of a sudden you've got to pay that raiders there to reinvest in your your company okay we got some really good stuff that's happening up here this morning I was up at old Tom just north of Bangor they've got a meal just shut down for three years they're reopening the male with a huge new investment\nThe same folks that bought the paper mill over in ... it's gonna be a hundred new jobs highly over an old town\nGreat paying jobs with benefits engineering jobs as well blue collar jobs the economy has got to continue to go forward that's why I've worked so hard to lower rates\nLess red tape in fair trade deals in my opponent has zero experience in that area and wants to Jack up taxes and throw everybody into a one hundred percent run government bureaucracy when it comes to health care\nSo if you if you want higher taxes crappy health insurance and no guns\nVote for golden that's correct that's your at someone like that [laughter] if you want someone who spent a lifetime\nCreating jobs growing the economy you weren't lower taxes\nLess red tape a more opportunities a stand up for your Second Amendment rights are and you want to drive down the cost of health insurance without everyone be pushed into a government bureaucracy insult to ... ... exactly right\nAll right Bruce thanks for being with us we appreciate it and good luck will talk to you again I'm
