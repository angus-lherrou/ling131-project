listening based on how we show about making Kelly\nI said the day she signed\nThe NBC contract that she would be in her demise by doing that she did not fit she's not of the warm fuzzy nurturing type at that time of the morning when the ladies are watching and wanted to hey here's some\nI'm a discussion about the things that are feminine in a sense or that women talk about\nAnd uh her hardcore style wasn't going to work so I'm not the least bit surprised about a possible demise of making Kelly Frank Newt and you're on the voice of Boston W. or kale hello\n[noise] by my co wire grades which are very like you are\nA number one\nWhy don't we as a a is a group of people just boycott the advertisers they find themselves necessary to be on CNN and all of these other states should be MSNB change just you know just boycott any goods and services that are advertised on TV and\nAnd well it's in there that after\nThe left wing does that or to people on Fox yeah enjoyed was to Sean Hannity and failed um the ... they they start these campaigns and um I listen I I'm I'm not one who's going to support or not support a boycott but I think that's up to the\nDecision of the people you raise the question of what people respond as they see fit I presume I recognize that and I thank you it's a it's a suggestion that the the power of the purse is huge so his point is well taken in that regard let's go to Ken in Maine next Ken you're on the voice of ...\nThey might just take a look all sure\nYou about Jeff Sessions you the total disappointment but that's why I call so I Want to recall about the type of thing and this is my view I think George sauce is behind the whole thing and let me explain why I think that way\nThis guy is a multi multi billionaire is on like global theater and you're not going to tell me that he didn't know who put something in his mailbox I think he knows exactly ... what where\nI think he's behind the whole thing and just the recent thing with an arrow getting something I'm like seriously if he just trying to be relevant now or something I just think the whole thing is a Soros thing okay if I'm dying\nAssociate the call it that it's possible this is all kinds of speculation uh I think what we need to do is what the\nFBI do its job and uh as suddenly pal told us former prosecutor or it should be pretty quick that they find the answers they're already there's a belief at least or an indication that these things were mailed from Florida so we'll see how that plays out in the I think getting to the truth is going to be very important\nIn terms of getting this done before\nElection day so that\nPeople who have ah still vote on election they will have that information unfortunately we've turned to this mail voting\nAnd it's become the rule of the day and you know what happens then is that what if before the election\nA few days before something happens\nAbout a candidate a and I'm not naming anyone let's say John Doe or Jane Doe winds up being accused with very credible serious charges of a pedophile behavior sexual abuse of a child and you're already voted for the person\nAnd it comes out to a few days before\nSo I that's why voting early seems to me is I'm not the best policy was intended for people in the military people out of the country people who might be hospitalized that's who it was intended for originally Victor back in may and again victory around the voice the ball yeah or kale\nI've got all the time and they were a number one Eric Holder's comment at the kicker you're offended by that we will send it when President Trump said let's let you go punched that guy out illegal ... well you offended by that like\nUm we're talking about the look the president already takes all the hits for things that he says there are no no and my my dad's not like you know why I'm not going to answer it I'll tell you why am I going to get a cat you know like I Can't answer it\nI don't know I Want you to answer why the media won't won't disgrace Eric Holder for saying that they disgraced Trump every single day he gets pounded on that every single day when he does\nYou know what he does my says it every single day and I'm not a real ... though there what about coal one instead of one\nOr whatever you want to run by a federal ... let's go now to ... come on I ... have a good\nDay I Can't even believe that\nTrump gets pounds at all the time about the things that he says the point is Eric Holder as former attorney general chief law enforcement officer of the country saying the picking when they're down\nIn the eye as so Steve court tested well maybe it's a metaphor well you know what somebody out there is going to say okay I'll pick them when they're down put his put his foot on their throat and maybe wind up choking to death\nSome wacko could do that you don't even say that in jest if you're the former attorney general and no you shouldn't say it if you're president either\nBut Trump gets pounded for that all the time there's nothing new about is getting pounded for that Maria and Boston Hi you're on the voice of Boston W.

CNN\nHillary Clinton has no plans to claim any personal responsibility for the ... massacre [noise]\nWell what about you do you do you have any plans to claim responsibility for the ... hoax bombing [laughter] CNN Obama\nHas no plans to claim any personal responsibility for the uh for the IRS crimes committed against the Tea Party how 'bout that\nCNN\nBill Clinton has no plans to claim any personal responsibility for the perjury and obstruction of justice he committed during the ... civil suit which resulted in him being this barred and having to pay an eight hundred and fifty thousand dollar settlement give me a break\nIt really loving the attention on CNN I've never seen anything like it they were still outside really late at night you're kidding they stayed outside yeah I think so I mean it was dark out the video I saw when it was done lemon wedge taking over from Chris ... and I think there I'm pretty late\nTaken it to the streets you don't know me but how your brother I was born here you had this living that\nChris Cuomo gave done linen and math to kiss on the cheek and it was so bizarre big lemon took it the wrong way you can you do and I don't know who wants it and then he went in for like another hog after the kids it was just he was like I Love you brother and give them a real ... and I think even done my mom was like\nWho who was who was in more danger the attackers Chris Cuomo who got who who was there when the suspicious package that turned out to be a fake ... arrive or his brother Andrew Cuomo who had the flash drive delivered to his office which he said was a ball\nYou know let us be can be really tricky sometimes they don't fit right and how they thought of the computers and times are hard to figure out why explode I'm going to be blowed no no I'm just having us be strictly here I'm going to enter Cuomo's in more danger but it would take a tight race really actually they\nBoth seem to be suffering what I read about it was caught some symptoms of what they used to call in World War two combat the now they call it the the as the I guess\nAndrew Cuomo was on with Chris Cuomo and he was referring to it as the first bombing at George storage is how I Would say to myself you know I'm a journalist you know I don't have in Anchorage\nShows but do you call something that was in a bombing the first bombing like aliens came down on earth and watch that CNN segment they would've assumed that George Soros his house had actually been bombed it\nIt's like if you find a gun and someone's car and then start calling it a shooting right a fake\nGun or a toy gun if you find a toy gun someone's car\nJay from Chelsea says that wasn't the scoop on CNN there was a shovel yes it was was a couple of shovels ... actually\nIt really is amazing though how they're all I mean\nEvery day cutting up sound for the show um there there are a lot of hypocritical moments from the left but today especially like I I put them on the ... are the ones that stuck out to me the most I mean Hillary Clinton it wasn't like she said the ten years ago\nWeeks ago that was last week was\nI think it was more than ... whatever ... look to somebody over you know and we can ... very recently there was this month to month definitely said we cannot be civil with Republicans until we get what we want\nAnd then this guy this New York times guys on with Chris Matthews and they're talking about how nowadays Trump has made it so you can't disagree with someone without saying they're evil\nIt was only a few months ago not even that they were that Cory Booker was calling judge Kavanaugh evil just because he didn't want him to be the Supreme Court it's like\nThey do they not think we're going to remember and then April Ryan said you know because of President Trump there's collateral damage it was days ago that Nancy Pelosi said that so be it if there's collateral damage for people who disagree with that they are everything they are accusing Donald Trump and the deplorable\nI was a way it's been for two years grace\nI Know what's your name was really a a what's the word\nThis was the chemical\n... or the nadir distillation ...\nCombination today was a combination of hypocrisy sunny\nNine seven eight shows so somebody sent fake bomb to fake news is that a metaphor or what\nThey say you know\nIf the story at the bombs if you're going to run with a bomb story do you mention it then it kind of the big headline that they ended up being harmless ... they seem to be leaving that out a lot I I've only saw that on a few sites most of them concern of conservative leaning believe it or not that the bombs were in fact not going to explode\nWait a second race so you but you're not a journalist as you said the journalists on CNN or calling the guy should these serial bomber\nBomber\nHe says yes ... there hasn't been one bomb but it's growing up but he's a serial bomber\nAt some point it was when you have this many suspicious packages in the mail and the none of them have gone off since you start to assume that that maybe that was part of the plan\nRight\nHe's not the most sophisticated bomber obviously he's less sophisticated than the ... brothers by ... orders of magnitude and tweet on that too speaking of glamorizing um you know the violent rhetoric what about when the Rolling Stone put what's his face hair toss O'Hare like he was a rock star and the cover\nMy dad things at the final active Trump strange meant this bombing thing I get to really showing if if it is what I suspect it is it's really showing that they're losing it completely um I Want to get to the story of local started selling on national\nCurt Schilling angry over a few weeks men behind Red Sox not to obviously ... is a friend

really nice guy\nHe he he if people disagree with him politically but\nThese are the same people are telling telling us we all need to band together and just because they disagree with courage politics they're not going to let him be a part of something that he eats it doesn't matter like he set himself he's a part of it whether they like it or not they can't read history as much as they try he is a part of it but just from\nThe fact that we know hand he is genuinely a great person and this is wrong\nRight and the bloody sockets it's I'm I'm hard pressed to think of a greater a moment more historic moment in in Boston Red Sox is to write it's probably it's right up I mean it's you know which right up there with a ...

Ted Williams getting a home run at this lasted that might teach sixty\nBut the you know that was that that really mean to me but it costs me after the Boston bombing yeah\nWell I think I think it was bigger than that I think it was bigger than that\nAnd now moving on to another story that I just I just discuss it how he during their break\nI think you like to see this girl was in trouble apparently she's an American TV host and she sparked anger when she put up a Twitter picture of herself with a wild go that she had just hunted down in Scotland and she puts it this past year she's\nShe related to Megan Kelly talk about a stupid thing to\nDo they do is dead at the door now in front of her and she happened\nTo the dentist and Minnesota who shot exactly I have no ...\nBut you're just asking for trouble by putting a pig live with yourself like even the automated like put pictures on Facebook of them with the white tailed buck that they've just shot it's like okay I mean you're happy you're bragging it's an accomplishment but still it would be saying with the picture beautiful\nWild go here in Scotland such a fun and they live on the edge of the clips of the island and know how to hide well I\nDon't well enough I guess\nEven where she says I made a perfect two hundred yards shot and dropped him good thing too because he could have ran off the cliff into the water\nThat would have killed him\nWhy did she sat and it was a legal mind but\nLosing our mind people don't like to see daddy and\nThe people in the Reagan people they've got nothing better to do their time and to try and ruin your life for posting a picture of a legal hunt\nRight so unless you want and maybe this is like her way of getting publicity you know every ... by wow is there is she really genuinely thrilled to be posting that that did get on speaking I'm Megan Kelly Kelly's lawyer once Ronan Farrow on hand to meet with NBC exact\nThe ones who fired or you mean you know what she's talking about yeah I mean\nThere is a certain irony there isn't there a lot of called out the NBC executives for being a serial predators and now she's been fired again she did some um but\nWhat is this is just gonna become like routine practice you just like I'm In my pocket Ronan was made just to make sure that you got virus to treat me right now [laughter] yeah it is weird and didn't do any\nGood for the guy who got the molested allegedly by senator Spartacus that a heated ...

clarifying but no connection has been made between the ... the bomb so they had bad this is a a as a as a clarification\nOr attraction or a correction whatever you want to call it this story has been updated to clarify but there have been no allegations of any connection between the language used in the email and the series of bomb threats\nAnd suspicious packages [laughter]\nI get a caller to

from the Russian Secret Service but they they're worse\nBut my brother's some Muslims in uh Boston the we're planning to a plan to have a terrorist attack in twenty Thirteen and they didn't bother to follow up\nThe ... brothers before they bombed the Boston Marathon\nThis is the same Federal Bureau of investigation that they received the call from a guy named Gary ... saying that I'm going to kill somebody if you don't come pick me up and nobody bothered to pick him up and he went on to kill three people that we get this is the same FBI that got a call from the end\nOf the Parkland school
