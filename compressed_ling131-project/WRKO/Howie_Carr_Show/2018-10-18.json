the ticket\nRight right I don't I don't see a big difference myself I I don't I don't really think that uh you know I don't as I look back and I don't think\nThey're I don't think Martha Coakley would have been much different from Charlie Baker I I Can't I'm I'm drawing a blank as to what would be different maybe the makeup of BS Jaycee would have been a little different than they would've allowed the graduated income tax to go through\nI think the difference would be instead of having a mass governor who's disappointed in Donald Trump you have a mass governor was outraged by Donald Trump\nSame difference which is ...\nWords are cheap talk is cheap and very cheap or when you're when you're talking about the chief executive officer of the differences\nMarcia Coakley wouldn't have said I'm blanking the ticket in November of twenty sixteen and then gone to the inauguration the gladiators which is what Charlie Baker dead so they would have been less ... and I'm not saying\nThat that's

mean he was the richest guy in West Virginia there was a Democrat and he was a conservative I mean and he made it official finally in just switched it became a Republican because it's easier to get

you you don't you know if they if they have like three hundred votes coming out of a precinct\nYou can't just steal had votes because there's going to be a discrepancy in the ballots so what you do is you take the take the ballots are of the ... that have voted for the ... the opponent and you write in your and you and your blank you're black in just a fair guy yeah so so there's two votes there\nAnd so they so then they got you still got the three hundred ballots but just a ton of ten or twenty of them are gone there or that race has gone\nSo that's a uh that's there\nThere are a lot

just riding along on his bike and the dogs just like ...\nI just I just I Love when I say something a pit bulls and then the immediate response from people that like I have a pit bull and he wouldn't hurt a flight to all about the way you raised on the okay whatever but I'm just saying there's a little bit of a trend here if you notice it's\nNot ... that are usually hauling people to death just saying\nUm okay so I Want to move on to a very interesting story Kanye West show his support for Trump in a in a very interesting way okay so tiny recently took a trip to Uganda\nAnd he tends to exclusively where his own design because like he's very much known for his sneakers and he works at the DEA than he does easy so he usually only where's that but he was actually spotted\nAfter his trip at the apple store in Chicago and he was wearing a pair of sneakers Under Armour the sneakers quickly sold out once ... was wearing\nThe reason is interesting is because the president of Under Armour is a huge ...\nKevin playing he's a CEO he happened to be a long\nTime to get into trouble like everybody who's becomes a publicly affiliated with Donald Trump I just don't understand how you could be the CEO of a big business and not love Trump\nAnd so yeah it just seems like tiny is not stopping with the Trump train also I wanted to read email shows okay now I just think it's so obvious I don't know why the New York post you can Hassan says an article but because Harvard in the news so much I had to read it email shows Harvard favored applicants with ties to big donors\nYeah we're going to have we're going to have somebody ought to discuss this up the next hour this whole buses but isn't that like every college ever\nYeah but they're ... but see Harvard is saying everything's on the level and and so this this proves it's not on the level got it oh and this is so they're obviously lying about something that can be easily proven as alive because that's Harvard\nRight how he did some news I think you'll enjoy I enjoy this news by the way the Harvard those remember Lena Dunham\nI I'm not going to enjoy now you will be I had a well any let our Web site where she was sending

us here this afternoon every weekday afternoon\nThis week in in Boston a very important along the way the trial has been done\nAnd there there's a group that's representing a Asian students is is suing Harvard University for discriminating against the Asian students in the admissions process and it's in federal court in Boston\nAnd it's the trials expected the last several weeks it says it's a a jury wave trial it'd be a judge will be deciding in probably go to before the Supreme Court very quickly\nBut it's a it's a it's extremely interesting case and uh one of the people who's written written extensively on it is a Stuart Taylor junior he's the author or one of the coauthors of mismatch how affirmative action hurt students it's intended to help and why universities won't admit it\nAnd you wrote he's got the uh the cover story in the Weekly Standard this week Harvard on trial and it's about the whole whole case\nAnd we just wanted to throw away the case I Will try to keep an eye on it as a as it goes through the courts it's some of the testimony is kind of dry but it's a it's something that affects every body a store Taylor thanks for being with us here on the highway\nCar show thanks for having me nice to be with you\nWhile he I think I think the take away so far and then a lot of this has been a as come out in the uh the filings over the course of the the discovery process is that if if it was just based on a academic test scores\nThe Asian American percentage of the\n... of the freshman class at Harvard would be forty three percent and the African American percentage of the freshman class would be less than one percent is that correct\nThat's correct that was in my article about a week ago and it came out of ... after the first time at the trial yesterday I think yeah\nAnd I and so how how does hard right away\nOne of the second one of the surprises is that it was sitting there in a public document in the court has since\nJune fifteenth and not one newspaper the United states or magazine that I'm aware of saw fit to publish those numbers until uh until they were you know talk about it the trial [laughter]\nYeah well I mean so if you're ... years where the numbers\nI said well that's what that's what I led with well why don't you I mean why don't you give me some more newsworthy numbers but people probably have to have a scene there oh nobody\nNobody here is New York times or the Washington Post and I was about those numbers yet or watch any of the major TV networks but I'm Glad that people on your radio show no\nYeah it's so how does how does Harvard get away with this uh you know I I don't I don't understand it the ... and and who's this guy William ... she has an Irish name but he's a he doesn't seem to be a friend of a Irish people\nFor Asians are white people who is this guy\n[laughter] well ... is a is an up from a from working class guy but I Hope he's absorbed at Harvard a motif but yeah the way they get away with it is that nobody is one is that nobody should them about it until now but to you know like all\nAll universities colleges they're pretty complicated admissions process nobody except maybe Cal Tech admits solely on the basis of grades they consider\nA you know extra curricular activities they consider athletic a talent\nThey consider a lot of um alumni connections and various other things are but what a what Harvard does that's front and center this trial is they also read people on\nSo called personal qualities personality characters at a night games like this person that center and they rank the Asian Americans at the bottom of the heat on those qualities\nEven though they're on alumni energy use and interviewers thought the Asian Americans were fine and so this trial is going to focus a lot on whether Harvard has been deliberately using racial stereotypes are just flat out racial discrimination\nTo limit the number of Asian and Asians who get admitted to of course a lot of them get admitted that the claim has that uh that a lot don't get admitted who are better qualified than some other whites blacks and Hispanics\nRight well I mean it hasn't harbored a publicly acknowledged that ah the the Jewish quotas that they had a hundred years ago were a totally wrong and a and racist and discriminatory\nSort of interesting you should ask during depositions in this case drew fast than the president of Harvard University with us she acknowledged that\nHe said oh I don't really know much about the call that's NATO or so they usually has ... she's a story yeah [laughter] right I didn't really know that [laughter] but\nYeah no it's very clear that are discriminating in history just clear and it was interesting that ah that you know when it came up she didn't just sharing fitzsimmons I think it was similar yeah they just say yeah that was terrible that was a long time ago we don't do that or are they said gee you know we don't know about that\nUh which um I mean at the end of my article I\nSay clause in quotes by a ... the president of Harvard and the current president at Yale salad the both of them said in essence we don't discriminate against

really cuts to the to the whole heart of the uh the the affirmative action a scam which is what it is and and Elizabeth Warren is the is the poster child for the whole thing\nAnd ... and this is how clueless she is you know she uh she uh I I Know I this is not a surprise I guess but she has no loyalty to to the institution but that you know propelled her into this position of national prominence even more than the University of Pennsylvania\nUh you know she ... with a with an affirmative action graft\nAnd she she announces she's trying to continue the grass on the very day but the but the university is is suffering this a great embarrassment or they wouldn't be suffering this great embarrassment if the if the mainstream media we're covering the case you know and these guys are so\nIn other people too I've I've told you they're suing the University of North Carolina uh my alma mater as well and uh you know there are other cases before the Supreme Court the ... the University of Texas which was weren't also used to teach at University of\nMichigan but this is the big one this is the big one 'cause it's Harvard and I ...\nHarvard loses I just hope they lose so much I just this

called crimes that people are going to commit bigger crimes and and you know if you if you let them get away with a property crime they're going to commit a crime against a person and a California has totally forgotten all the lessons of the Giuliani here in New York\nYeah I'll eat like maybe like the guy in New York got lashed but they're also the Democrats or decriminalize drugs which increases crime also okay\nYeah no I I look at look at a here in Massachusetts I mean you have judges who are refusing to was imprisoned\nHeroin dealers because they're illegal aliens because they would

I'm ... even more credit Joe for for\nCausing vis a vis a\nSelf immolation apparently I was involved in it she didn't want me being a me outing her\nSo she decided to out herself I mean that's pathetic excuse but that's that's what she's reduced to now she says she's just our\nOur of our cars that you ...\nAnd and the funny thing is you know and I think maybe the president had a little bit to do with it I don't wanna take all your\nEye to eye I must share the credit yes with someone else outdoors\nBut then again I don't know who is that by using many people on on on the Democratic side but who sends out twenty six tweets\nDirected at the president in a very short period of time and one after the other she seemed unhinged I think the guy who could be Trump or the girl that could be Trump is the type of person that doesn't take the bait\nFrom him and tries to out Trump Trump because whenever we've seen that happen whether it be Marco Rubio during the primaries or Jeb Bush would they get taken out of their element and their personality and they try to out Trump Trump it blows up spectacularly so\nWhether it's her or Korea hair or Cory Booker\nKamala Harris that's not the type of person who could really challenge shut the twenty twenty it'll be somebody who is just more measured and centrists and just kind of dismissed as ... any personal far from Trump like yeah I'm just going to concentrate on the issues that matter the American people and she has shown already\nThat she is not ready for twenty twenty if that's the way she's going to act on Twitter which was like a lunatic\nRank right John Cherokee Nation sent out that the excoriated press release about about six o'clock Seventy two hours ago and and less than an hour later she went on this whether a rage\nAnd and your rights she seemed demented in my my favorite of the twenty six or twenty twenty six points that she sent out in Seventy four minutes was\nHe's a bully any scares very easy and I'm thinking to myself talking about so he scares very easy this is your twentieth tweet in in in an hour you're the one who's coming across as a as as\nPetrified mortified here you know she's she gave away the game\nAnd and in our media is that such a great job political maybe I Want to narrow it down to that I still think local\nNews always New York I think they do an excellent job but that's another conversation for another time but the fact that when this first came out and you see all the headlines strong evidence proof that she is Native American they jumped to the narrative they want it before they really looked at what the study was including the Boston Globe by the way which as you know had to make\nNot one but two corrections on simple that\nSuch a big story like this you think they checked that part out a little bit better\nBut no it's a matter of being first instead of accurate and everybody followed suit to say see Elizabeth Warren has been to ... and then launched Cherokee Nation came out that was the big big turning point then suddenly now you don't hear much about the story anymore let's put it this way how it'll play little games with the show and the other foot\nDonald Trump lives about his heritage says he's a Native American so he can get into the University of Pennsylvania do you think that story would have gone away the way this one has abide by Thursday if you said that on Monday no the apocalypse there'll be upon us and ... and the end and basically that the planet would just shrink into a big ball of lava that what it would be the end\nSo yeah that's the funny part about this right to be mockery ... ridicule instead it's been kind of muted for the most part except from conservative media and that's why there is a good counter balance with our media now which Twenty years ago we did not have\nYeah I I I said my column the next day I sent a memo to the Boston Globe fake news is tough bake math is\nTougher it really is and it's just uh\nI really I really have enjoyed the whole story but listen there there's other news breaking that you wanted to talk about like this I Elle magazine ah when we tell us about what's going on with them\nElle magazine Halley puts out a tweet saying that Kim car dash in and Kanye West been married for a couple of years I Believe they have two children together or they are getting a divorce right and you see this and it's not like it's from the onion and it's not like it's from a a typical type of\nPublication where he is he a question that the L Magazine but you think I guess is the nine right I mean it's basically a fashion magazine and then they probably want to have a story like that and then sure enough you click on it\nAnd it's a register to vote page in other words the headline fake news you could go to a page\nAnd vote and it's just so funny that they pick the two people that do celebrities that have actually shown they support the president\nAnd that that's that's the couple that's divorced thanks again our media so completely ... has no stop awareness when they do this stuff\nHow much it hurts the profession and every day you could come up with at least one example and the ... the editor at large at CNN we found that he says oh this is brilliant oh really\nOh really it's really had to put out fake headlines that you're actually doors thing this I I don't even know what to say anymore out as a media reporter I Can't even be shocked because it happened so often a nun by the whole thing I mean I'm sure you weren't there was a radio host\nSince that's what that's what Mussolini used to say you know he was a tabloid editor before he got into politics and and you know his his owners would ... that turn on a dime they go from being right wing left wing\nAnd he said as long as it's entertaining nobody cares you know as long as you're right if entertaining headlines it doesn't really matter in I mean we've come full circle a hundred years later and that's the that's the attitude and they're gone back to when you do Mussolini days\nIt seems that way I wasn't around for that unfortunately I Believe you call that sophomore\nYear but may I [laughter] anyway just having some fun\nBut yeah look you look at the last couple of weeks and you look at the way the Kavanaugh hearing recovered and just how horribly that whole thing was presented and the boomerang effect it's had on Democrats in terms of Republican voters they had some snow going through the roof ... terms and suddenly you're saying it's a real momentum behind the ...\nAnd then you see Elizabeth Warren and and this stunt which at least for two or three days again galvanize the ... to say we got to get out to the polls\nSo I think October has gotten very bad for Democrats I'm not saying they don't take back the house but I think I would've said it was Ninety percent that even three weeks ago I think it's a toss up not quite frankly and they'll probably gain seats in the set of what I thought that that was even in jeopardy\nYeah you you know and another thing we just we we just had a guy on talking about the uh the the harbored a race discrimination suit which is a big I'm very very big case\nAnd Elizabeth Warren dropped her quote unquote bombshell about which is another just another affirmative action scam\nThe same day that this case began in in us federal district court shooting so she doesn't care she she doesn't care about anyone else about her you know her institution they gave her her ... she just drags them in to this or to the dumpster fire the chiefs created for herself\nYou know it's it's really it really is amazing the way the the news cycle works now nobody cares about anything else but themselves and and\nHere's the thing it's not like Republicans are are mocking Elizabeth Warren and saying what are you doing I mean Jim Messina who was President Obama's campaign manager in two thousand twelve even says\nDemocrats can focus what what what was she thinking base but I don't have it in front of me yeah paraphrasing\nIt what what are you doing this is the stupidest thing now three weeks before the midterms you had to put this out and no one cares about your twenty twenty Rodney in January when you're when you're thinking about doing it now I get everybody\nIt's not just not being self aware selfish\nOn her part and it's a shame that the Boston Globe just can't say and I'd be screwed this up and not one writer there no one op ed can go out just challenging or on this I it's sad rarely I mean wouldn't you rather be a contrarian than than just be part of an echo chamber disagrees with everything and everybody in our media is so afraid now of not giving comfort food to what they think their audiences want to hear\nInstead of what they should here and there are cowards basically that that's a shame\nTo fund with the with these people are never going to realize is it's fun being a reporter it's fun you know going on digging up news and and knowing you gotta buy yourself and it's a scoop and you you know it makes you look really like a cool guy\nAs opposed to just being another another person in the uh the aim in chorus is Pat Buchanan used to call it on whatever side you're on you know\nYeah I had I had a lot of respect for an unfair I did with that Harvey Weinstein thing the way he went about it and went to another case when NBC said about what's clearly did\nAnd then during the justice capital thing I got to tell you you know when he came out with that second accuser and there was almost no verification around it in fact there was no verification around that that was a story about how Kavanaugh exposed himself during his dorm party ... you know five\nYears ago but then they couldn't find one person to corroborate it uh that that was very unfair alike and it seemed very politically motivated I'm like he's a boy I really thought there was hope we are and how even showed me that that he\nHe I I Know and I think he's confirmed that he said well we wanted to show that maybe there was a pattern maybe there's a pattern\nCome on now hey you know where I Am trying to get a girl pregnant
