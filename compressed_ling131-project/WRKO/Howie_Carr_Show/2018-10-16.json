your next with highway car go ahead Chuck\nYeah hey I'll tell you a war and I don't know where she got from she couldn't even qualify for aid for students as an American and yet because she's not even an age yet alone accord like half a Cherokee and she brings a disgrace to the Cherokee Nation\nI Try and do you know she does she's about a Cherokee though she brings in disgrace for white people you know who she thought that too [laughter] she she's such a fraud\nAnd and I mean who told her that this was a good idea you know you you know Elizabeth ... you know once you once you have this past you know from the from you know from some lab that you're not even going to name and it says you could be one one thousand twenty four\nPercent Peruvian of an Indian movie yet this is going to put a everything to rest senator and on the oddly it didn't work out\nWhat do you think the moment was yesterday when she's slowly realized that this backfired on her but do you think aids had to come in and bring her the news\nI think probably when they said you know you know Elizabeth a southerner warned that you know the globe said it was won five\nHundred and twelve that it's actually one one thousand and twenty four and then I Wonder if she if she knows enough about math to say well if it's twice as much on the bottom and then it's really not one thirty second it's one sixty four\nSo you think this so all my people who told me this do you think it's really going to impress people but I claimed to be a minority because I was because I claimed to be one sixty fourth Indian and oh by the way it's not really Indian it's Peruvian or Mexican\nBut that ... you get sweets like this from the Associated Press President Trump lashes out at Senator Warren over DNA test result she released indicating she as Native American heritage and he says her claims are a scam an ally despite her\nProof or proof or ...\nYeah again this is why no one believes the mainstream media outlets it's ridiculous All right we're going to come back we're gonna come back\nOkay [laughter] higher than the fact that I don't understand what\nLight the fact is she is one one thousand twenty four\nIn the ... hurting the expert she chose to look into this for her that's what he came up with so what what is the lights ally that one one thousand twenty fourth isn't full blooded Indian ... I don't understand what the argument is here yeah\nWhen I was hired expert this is like you know Christine Blasey Ford taking her own polygraph and then releasing the result she hired this guy what's the lie\nRight well she she's talking about the lives about like Donald Trump but she's uh what else is she saying you know he cheats that's another thing he everybody's cheating I mean she's the cheater here right she treated us she cheated on her way up the uh the academic a totem pole\n[laughter] I mean I think I think the whole ... of your longtime mascot being fully exposed to the world is going\nTo lose your mind she has been completely exposed how are you interested in playing of the evidence here and there are\nNo idea I get in hand and I said my column we believe in my column today was a list with\nWorn this bill a fake Indian I understand that I'm just saying I'm just talking about how the mainstream media is trying to portray it you know and by the way here's one we this is the first week in the in the series we all know why real Donald Trump makes creepy physical threats about me right\nI mean I think we would know about these creepy physical threats of you know\nDo [laughter] that's one good thing you can always\nUm facts check their crazed claims about about Trump I'm with the question what do we know about this if it were true [laughter]\nHow about this one how about this when I answer that you missed the ... or ... Academy Award winning presentation this is the second point bottom line my heritage played no role in my hiring ever the Boston Globe reviewed all the evidence\nWell if that's the case the Chinese auto going about it\nUm in their lawsuit against Harvard\nI'm eternally black students and absolutely Native Americans should because Harvard isn't doing affirmative action and writes if it didn't play a role\nYeah you know that's that's another irony here and again it has it gotten much play that the she released this this ah fabricated a DNA test\nOn the same day that the trial against her her former employer began in federal court here in Boston you know it's it's rather ironic isn't it I mean she she's ... she's running a scam\nAnd at Harvard has been running a scam for all these years I mean hard Harvard you know Harvard this a century ago Harvard was discriminating against Jews for the same reason to discriminate against Asians because they were doing too well\nYou know and they didn't want to win and so nothing has really changed their has it\nBut the weird thing about this is I mean normally the massive double standards you get on the left it will be um no it's okay for a governor of a state to um have state employees bring a low level employee to his hotel room dropped his pants and take his it that's not sexual harassment at all and then\nWhen one Brett Kavanaugh was\nA drunken freshman in college he dropped his pants um and I have a recovered memory but Thirty years later the one is is taking 'em no up ... percent for Clinton thing that's that's that's nothing but recovered memory of cabin are dropping his pants as a drunk and ...\nThat's a rape that's right that's ... usually there you know they're they're they're ten years separating these things are at least a few years the strange thing about affirmative action flash Pocahontas is\nSimultaneously these organizations like the New York times with Jason Blair um Harvard with Elizabeth Warren\nThey brag and bragging brag about affirmative action we have lots of affirmative action just apply and look at all the diversity and we're going to pick people on the basis of diversity will discriminate against white people don't worry um and then when they won one when we find out that one person in order to take advantage of affirmative action\nUm for Native Americans what are you talking about I mean it's it's one of the sentence to the next as opposed to to\nCompletely separate separate and innocence is here at Harvard bragged about Elizabeth Warren being a Native American diversity diversity\nAnd how much he says it was never that this never helped me get a job however\nShe was from shows an instructor\nAt the University of Texas law school which isn't a bad law school from what I understand but she was an instructor\nAnd ... and I only heard right or University of Pennsylvania so she suddenly decides in the mid eighties to list herself as a minority and appears in this these minority guide books which are basically used as hiring guides to why you know do away with your diversity problem if you're the dean of the law school\nAnd all of us right she's she's working at first at the University of Pennsylvania and then at the at Harvard University law school and she and she wants us to believe that it had\nAnd the ... because she's been cleared by the Boston Globe which right\nIt's just like shape than they are they at times bragged and back and brag about their affirmative action program to bring in black reporters and then up that turns out Jason Blair is making everything up and what\nYou're talking about well if they're doing this then they're not doing affirmative action I don't think [laughter] they act like they can give preference is on the basis of race\nAnd and no one else is allowed to notice that that's what they're doing their bragging about\nIt and then she's she's got different stories where she said I I put down but I was a Native American because I Want it to get invited to the lunches of the\nNation from Grover [laughter] that was the\nOne one thousand than twenty and one one thousand twenty fourth on ... and then out shadows recipe\nAnd now she says I'm ...

I'm currently in all the numbers that are are lining up\nAt the first day our order of business would be to make sure you can get a handle on the president's tax return can't they actually made a priority I think the number one I'm veil that she may in our dataset contemplate in St myself is that for every candidate running for the president say\nTwenty ... Twenty years of income tax return that's where we shouldn't be again that's the first\nPriority when they get into in in it to the control of the house by the way I'm not sure they're going to take over the house I mean then again that's just the that that's all left media spent a few weeks ago where they were going to get the Senate and the house now it's now it's down to the house\nAnd uh you know we talked about the civility you know they're sending a they're they're they're sending these letters with white powder in them too was Senator Susan Collins house they're uh they're chasing Ted Cruz out of restaurants or Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nA Lindsey Graham would like to talk about the uh the the the resistance and how their civility that they share a when a when they deal with uh when they run into Republicans cuts sex\nJudge Kavanaugh represent the best in our legal community was treated like garbage despicable and I hope they pay a price has been on you know people have no seriously yes Batman\nNice huh\n... but of course they don't care about that supposedly supposedly spit it a Democrat that would be that you think there'll be a big story a real real big story\nIt for four or five hundred forty to forty two\nSo here David gregory you know with his the a bust out a former anchor of uh meet the press fired for crappy ratings his wife is a is a big lawyer a defense lawyer D.C she represented all of a\nHillary's age during the espionage investigation two years ago she she got a ball cleared because she's a deep state member\nSo what David gregory now works at the at the Clinton news network and uh so listen to who he's comparing the president to win a relation in a really regards to this a murder of the Saudi in a you stumble cut night\nHe's also a such a loose talk or I mean he just says what pops into it\nMine not thinking that is the president United States you don't want to play this notion that there were rows killers like he's you know O. J. Simpson talking about tracking down the real ... real colors and not murder trial I mean if\nThat far it's just absurd and then later in the day he was much more measured when people talk to him and said no this is where we are and so the problem is that people are listening to the president around the world and I think for a president\nWho has said disingenuous lay in my judgment when he talks about the\nJournalists pay me enemy of the people this is actually a time when an American leader has to stand up and say this is a journalist working for the Washington Post in America with a great\n... so so he's saying that the president is speaking carelessly if he's comparing the president the OJ Simpson when when the OJ Simpson said he was looking for the murderers he was the murder so ... is he saying that actually\nI've been pretty good with people that are\nSo so it was David gregory suggesting that actually the Saudi journalist or worked for the Washington Post was actually murdered by a Donald Trump that he somehow snuck over to Istanbul and killed him I you know talk about careless a careless a conversation or rhetoric\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two how you want to hear the ah this is a a cinema out in Arizona comparing Arizona too well Lindsey low head cut eleven\nAnd then when Anthony and they're not in a good way and we're not going to get rid of my sanity low here in the same man [laughter]\n\nHow did she ever get elected to Congress did they not know that that these cuts were out there the Republican ... research seems to be in overdrive this year they're doing a good job you know sometimes a past one party\nSeems to have an edge on the other one this year the Republican seems to be big enough more start on the ... maybe they're just more start to be done since the resistance but yeah for four or five hundred forty to forty two um our\nOur [noise] his\nName is Jeff deal and he's running for US Senate his goals the same as yours defeat Elizabeth Warren Jeffs realty a proven track record of saving hardworking families here in Massachusetts money like defeating the two billion dollar gas tax I met Jeff deal is the only candidate\nDemocrat or Republican to fight against sanctuary city she supports building new law\nAnd proudly stand with our ice ages as they defend the border and the rule of law Jeff deal is the only candidate indoors by Massachusetts law enforcement\nElizabeth Warren on the other hand holds our law enforcement racist and seems more concerned with running for president instead of getting anything done for us if we're going to defeat Elizabeth Warren leading real on Tuesday November ...

Tuesday a total of Nineteen fatalities have been confirmed in Florida one child was found dead near lake seminal Georgia three people were found dead from falling trees that fell on their vehicles at least six people were confirmed dead in Virginia mostly as a result of flash flood waters\nThing I think still out there is the fact that she took those two positions at University of Pennsylvania and Harvard claiming Native American heritage when she\nBack then didn't even try to prove any ancestry and and never really felt the need to do that or apologize for it and ultimately you know again uses a system that she says it rigged against people that you read that for self so she can get these high paying jobs that other a minority Irish should have been qualified for it\nWe we ah had the grace a performance masterpiece theater reading the tweets a chi issue for six fifty nine until eight fourteen last night there were twenty six of them altogether so she was sent a tweet approximately every three minutes\nAnd they were they were a very a very emotional very almost to the point of the arrangement\nAnd I I think ah I I think this really backfired on our didn't it didn't she think this was going to put the issue to rest and it ... it's a it's started a dumpster fire or her\n[noise] well I mean she's always had the Boston Globe they're trying to provide cover for the you know weight that she got those jobs and then ... ancestry claims I'm obviously she decided to go out on her own and and put that video out there and again a very quickly we come to find out that I guess most north Americans have I guess more\nNative American potential uh heritage than she does based on on those results which is pretty pretty wild but again a hurt her time in office as a senator for Massachusetts has been marked by doing very little\nThe state mostly spending time campaigning around the country and I think her attempt to put this information out on Monday was to try to have it for a Washington Post article that come out the day before that explaining just how extensive she's been working to run for president in twenty twenty I mean she spent\nHalf a million dollars on a donations to campaign around the country for Democrats you as you know going out there to Ohio gone to other states campaigning for democratic candidates for the last a year plus a she was in Georgia and uh just last week for governors Kennedy and she was in\nPennsylvania and Colorado or strike a Pennsylvania and ah Oklahoma actually her home state um\nAbout a week or two before uh when I was up and launched with the gas um mine explosion victims so but she's made it very clear she's running for the White House and twenty twenty and I think this was an attempt to try to\nDivert away from the fact that uh that's out there and uh you know I think people in Massachusetts are aware of that they know she has no intention of being a senator they just want to be our senator and I'm looking forward to the debate on friday and making sure that we really highlight the what's going on\nHave you taken a DNA test\n[laughter] no I have an alley I ah I don't feel the need to and I mean not that I wouldn't not that it wouldn't be proud of of any heritage it a determines but I don't feel the need to try to apply for any\nUh special consideration for anything I own a small business\nKind of fun though you know that's that's the only point I was making you know it gives you something to look forward to for a couple of weeks waiting for like Lindsey Graham was saying you know you get you know you're wondering what it's going to be and how it's going to turn out and\nYou know I I think for most people would probably turns out the way they thought it was there was it was going to but that's that's all he so you know what she's gonna do Jeff she's just gonna she she's going to basically ignore you\nI mean she's gonna she's she is going to disappear into Donald Trump just like with the tweets last night there was nothing about you and the tweets a it was all about Donald Trump\nLet's say what are you going to and what are you going to do what you just talks about Donald Trump\nWell and I'm looking forward to talking about that because first of all everything he promised on the campaign trail he's delivered I mean our economy right now in Massachusetts people haven't noticed is on fire we've got three point five percent unemployment leading the country right now unemployment in the country that three point eight percent the lowest it's been in fifty years\nWe've got more people working in our state more people making more money to wage increases have gone up about three percent on laws and that's given a new tax revenue to beacon hell is almost one point two billion dollars so uh the economy's doing well internationally look at North Korea a year ago they were threatening our allies now they're\nThinking about doing it in Olympics with South Korea I mean that's how\nDifferent are things are there and I'd say the trade deals have been incredibly effective a European Union renegotiated there is with us followed quickly by Canada and Mexico and I think China is feeling the pain right now and I think a look our stock market rallied again today showing that the all the effort to\nUh make trade more equitable or internationally is working so everything's working out of favor and if if a\nA Senator Warren wants to bring up what's going on with the president I she's bringing up a successful track record in my opinion\nDo you think she will do you think she used the uh\nThe the so called Native American heritage do was to get into those those are two and your positions with the ivy league law schools\nWell I Know that she lists yourself in what's a national directory out of college law school so um and when she lets yourself for that that\nBasically becomes kind of a hiring book for college at University of Pennsylvania in fact they listed her as a white originally and she requested to have a change to Native Americans so um then she got the Harvard job\nAnd after she got the ... D listed from that\nA national directory as Native American so it seems like there was a clear intent on her part to utilize that that claim to benefit herself with her career although she completely denies that and look I I think it she's gonna have to answer for that but she uh I think she tried with that video I don't think it worked\nHer stories keep changing you know she said originally she uh you know the list of herself as minority of Harvard because you wanted to get invited to lunches and now she talks about her ... her matriarch whenever they are and her family dying and she wants to she wanted to preserve their legacy I don't know how that has\nYou know suddenly changing your ethnic group how does that preserved the legacy of The Elders in your family I mean\nNone of this stuff makes any sense you know and but it's it's it's like sir Walter Scott said you know a a what a tangled Web we we went first we practice to deceive and now she's now she's hot\nAnd by the way I mean the secretary of state for the Cherokee Nation and said that first of all DNA tests are are frowned upon as they used for determining whether or not you have Native American heritage to begin with a you have to be active in the in the culture you have to uh you know I think have some family members that you can identify specifically as Native American um and so if\n... what she's been claiming for so long is clearly a appropriation cultural appropriation to benefit herself um but you know again Democrats in this country seem to be able to say whatever they want with no penalty I mean a senator Rosen a a Blumenthal I mean in a\nDown in a matter of Connecticut saying that he was of of Vietnam veteran I guess there's no repercussions when you lie about your background\nMenendez of New Jersey you know the look of that ad that's running against him about the you know the Obama Justice department said he was a he was a patronizing a underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic\nAnd he says he says no it's not a you know it I mean the the Dems now are spending three million to what to save his seat where are you getting any money from the from the root of the national a Senate committee Jeff\nWell at this point you know I think they're still taking a wait and see how there were three weeks away but uh yeah I think that um you know what we've been doing is basically focused on our ground game here in Massachusetts and that's the same ground game to help us when\nInto doesn't fourteen a ballot question that nobody thought we were going to when we were outspent by millions of dollars the greatness as it seems like Elizabeth Warren is really overlooking his race I mean if you drive around the state and look at the lawn signs you know we pretty much out number her\nQuite a bit and I think that shows that we've been we've been talking to people and she seems to be really more focused on making that presidential run and you know if the other thing too is the comments she's made most recently whether it was a that the criminal justice system is racist from front to back that journey a you know the endorsement of\nA Boston police union that um there's never a rose to Republican for you a U.S Senate before and uh you know it's\nIt's ... ... who we ran into in a in a ah Winchester the other day yeah they I mean you've got some police endorsements\nWest or police or you know yeah I definitely am he it's it's something that\nYou know normally would go without saying when you make a comment like that is if you're a little bit worn that police will do that but I think they also know my track record has been a to support law enforcement and the state and they also know that if I get into the Senate that I might give\nMassachusetts and and the citizen six years of actually focusing on that she she already wants to take the next two years off and make a run for the White House I mean it\nCouldn't be any clear I think for people out there that that this raises about someone who cares about Massachusetts versus someone who really cares more about running for the White House\nSo where where do people go if they want to get involved in your campaign to read more about your word donate money or whatever well where should they go\nThey should go to a deal for Senate dot com T.
