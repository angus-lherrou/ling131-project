their fight a U.S see or to tonight so does suck a lot of the air out of the oxygen for this poor guy but before the Conor McGregor Kelly fight and a brawl afterwards\nThere was the I mean he's a beast this guy who you don't want to get in the ring with him he's Derek Lewis he's a brilliant fighter\nAnd he took on a Russian say heavyweight fight and the Russian is one of the most popular Russian MA fighters in mind that ARSA\nAnd of course Vladimir ... loves this Russian fighter so potent is watching us the two two nine from Moscow wherever and one of his nachos or in the crumbling or wherever\nAnd so listen to Derek Lewis who was behind for much of the fight\nAnd then delivered a stunning knockout blow of the Russian\nAnd the last minute of the fight Lewis like rocky just kept coming and coming and coming and then I guess the Russian being Ivan draw goal he took him out with one devastating shocked that knocked them out\nWell listen to Derek Lewis say I got a call from President Trump just before the fight robot caught written\nIn the winter the first of all congratulations on\nNow that was the wrong cut the other like\nAmidst all the bleeps what he said was that Trump called them before the fight and Trump said list said who loves this Russian fighter you're about to fight tonight okay and the mainstream media\nKeep saying I'm just you know this pool of of of

dark cell and welcome\nThank you I Jeffrey calling again I cocky about a mile\nOr as low ... how are you\nI'm doing great you were talking about um is a A R that Republicans energized that was it because the cabinet now yes\nI think we're in a guy anyway because of how great a job Trump is doing I really don't think I don't I mean I think they would have come out regardless because they don't want this to stop all are good I think when it guys anyway\nAnd but what do you think now in the aftermath of the calf Kavanaugh's confirmation fight dark dark cell are you ... even more energized than before\nWhy couldn't have been more energized I'm energized anyway I\nI don't trust any Democrat and I feel like you should vote out any Democrat that you can find the vote out is should do it\nAnd so I was already and it died in any way I think it's terrible how they did how they did um Kavanaugh but I'm not shocked because as I talk to you before previously if it's not this it'll be something else is\nAlways something trying in the long run they're trying to get rid of Trump whatever they're doing it it's all to make him look bad and for they're just so they're just such haters\nThey can't get over the great job he's doing they there's nothing they can do to make it took you know to be as good\nAs Trump is making it be that they just they just lost their mind\nAre so I have to ask you this do you think you're calling from Detroit ... basically a ... from the heartland they're calling for middle America do you think people in middle America when they see how unjustly treated Kavanaugh was\nHow one fairly accused how he was smeared ... marched a libel the way that he was just absolutely destroyed on a pack of lives do you think the country's going to say you know what we're just not going to give the Democrats power do you think disgusted the heartland\nYes yes yes I Do yes I Do\nAnd do you think it's kind of so you think that's going to show up in November you think a lot more people are going to come out and vote for for the Republicans as a protest to the way Kevin always treated\n\nWell as I just told you I think they were coming out anyway and I\nGuess he got a few more because of it but I think people love Trump they're not gonna let the Democrats back in they got it too good right now there people are voting that has never voted before and you know pay no attention to Democrats they're just\nA lot of noise [laughter] just a lot of noise that's all they\nAre and you know it's really a shame because I I guess so mad when I see people like Cory Booker um even people like Maxine Waters and those types you know\nWell I guess Maxine didn't have nothing to do with this one but they see how the black man was treated years ago and then they like they like are are are being just like\nThey were trading years ago they're treating Kavanaugh like\nThat really aren't darn not given him a chance to defend himself he's guilty already that this\nState that is just disgusting and they ought to be ashamed of themselves and they'll read what they saw in the long run because God doesn't like ugly and they'll they'll rate that they're about to lose their mind now they don't\nLast another fight and they can move in November I don't know what they're going to do then I'll know\nDarn well what they did when they lose the November you are one of my favorite color is you really are going to play it really God Bless you are so\nTo have a great day to four years so by by you are so sweet really ...

G discussed secretly recording the president President in Rosenstein Metra day on air force one while ... police choose convention in Florida who\nBut sometimes I think to myself as I'm reading history I'd say you know this is really an interesting moment but I Wish I could I could have been out or I Wish I could see the ah I Wish I could have you had a live camera there to\nBe or what happened so\nI was thinking about that on Saturday afternoon watching the bow to the Senate but like you know we knew what was going how it was going down fifty to forty but still I Want to watch\nIt now I heard the freaky star the ... the hideous\nHorrible\nYeah like by the females who would've said the these these insane people it was like it was like for love or run and see that side of the street\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] it was it was amazing and then I thought to myself how how much\nDifferent is this the the Salem witch\nTrials they're they're ... they're talking about they're calling him a rapist he's not as much\nOf a rapist there's those twenty women and I guess the next year the manner too but the ... the women they executed in Salem and sixteen Ninety two or which is\nI mean just because somebody says your rapists just because somebody says your uh which doesn't make you a which are rapists and by the way nobody ever said Brett Kavanaugh was a rapist\nWell sweat Nick that before she pulled back\nBut it you know nobody credibly accused him of doing anything other than I don't well I don't even want to get into it it's just ridiculous so this this\nWas what this is what the Democrats have been reduced to an end by the way and the other thing I and again I don't I'm not going to I'm not going to criticize the a ... a box or anybody else for going with the demonstrators outside\nBut it was not like that was the that was not the march on Washington\nThat was not even a roe v Wade ... march or that was not even the women's march after Trump was a ... ... ... ... when they pulled back and then a wide shot\nSo we're about two hundred people there and I ... that's the number I've read in the uh in in the paper since then the reports two hundred people if ... Grayson I had that many quote unquote demonstrators in West Springfield on uh\nOn friday it ... the dealership you know two hundred people is not a lot when you when you figure was a national thing I mean it was a good turnout at West Springfield but it wasn't such a good turnout after it's been wall to wall coverage for ah for all these uh weeks\nAnd the other thing is to they are in in large measure paid\nProtesters there's ... there's a great column in the wall Street Journal about it today by a by this woman I think I think her name as a Ashraf Nomani I think she's the one who was run out of Georgetown by that not a\nFemale counter intelligence protester who says the cheese a who's who says that you want it to cash straight the Republican senators castrated them\n...\nYou know they burned the which is at stake I think cast ration is right up there were burning somebody at the stake isn't it that's what these people are reduced to and here's another thing too\n\nWhenever an institution goes against them\nThey you know they don't just pick themselves up and say this what we got to do the red Sox lost the other night right so let's say you know what we've got to do better tonight in Yankee Stadium we had to make sure that David pricing start that last game if there is the last game\nYou know ... they're trying to make the corrections to win with the less now they don't want to make any corrections whenever they lose the first thing is to abolish whatever institution they weren't the fate of that you remembered two years ago\nLess than two years ago they were talking\nAbout the Democrats lock on the electoral college remember that how many stories did you read about that but a million right there was one everywhere and although all left media\nThen what happened he lost the election what was the next step abolish the electoral college abolish the electoral college so now they have lost\nControl for the first time probably sixty Seventy years they have lost a liberal or or a ... liberal slash wishy majority on the Supreme Court\nWhat is the solution pack the courts act the court's\nFDR tried that eighty years ago and he was stopped in his tracks by conservative Democrats in large measure and Republicans but there aren't any more conservative Democrats so now this isn't this has got to be one of the things is like open borders are abolish ice\nI mean it's up to me to think about it even two or three months to three days ago\nActually nobody would've ever ... or or rationally said let's let's packed the Supreme Court let's expand the Supreme Court so we can take it over but that's the that's the liberals new cure here's another the here's another thing they they're talking about\nAll of these Republican judges a lot of them were appointed\nBy president who lost the vote\nOf course not that the Democrats had a majority of votes themselves but they lost the popular vote but that's not the way the president was elected\nSo all these so whenever whenever I've talked about electing judges or ah or other people all of us have talked about electing judges so we can do away with the ... the feelings you know Timothy feeling would be defeated for reelection if he ran in Massachusetts the superior court judges let all these criminals go and try to\n[noise] they always say you Cadillac judges\nSo now though the now the New York times the Washington Post are both complaining that the majority of judges have been appointed by Republican presidents\nAnd at the end up most of the end that most of the votes for cabinet came from states with fewer people than the states the senators were voting against them like California New York\nSo it because they lost this latest\nConfirmation they want a number one pack the Supreme Court expand the number of justices in other words I'm using the old thirties FDR terminology packed the Supreme Court and they and they're saying they're complaining about how Supreme Court justices are selected\nThis is just these people are out of control\nAnd Trump was right to call 'em out the other night as arsonist and and saying that you don't give you don't give our son is a book a matches you turn over a control of the government to these people they are it's pretty clear they want to make sure that nobody ever ever has a chance\nTo ... to win another election to put them out of business or to try to put them out of business\nAnd the the they this is why this is this is such a I mean it's not overstating it to say this is such an important mid term election looks like the Republicans are okay in the Senate but again you know that you know the cliche has been overused the last few few days moving the goalpost\nYou know they say okay we've lost the seven right remember the last week that we're going to win the Senate now they okay we're going to lose the Senate\nBut we're going to really have a blue wave of the house\nI explain that one to me are the
