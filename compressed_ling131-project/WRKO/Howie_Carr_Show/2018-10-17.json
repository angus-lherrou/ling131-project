Democrats forgive me almost everything okay it's a horrible deal but even worse than that\nEven if you gave them\nAmnesty to every illegal alien in the country twenty million twenty two million thirty million they're still not gonna give you the wall don't even take my word for it listen now to Nancy Pelosi listen to this hot tip thorough call\nSo below sea now says she's expecting to become the house speaker in the wake of the November midterm elections\nAnd so she's asked well Lindsey Graham is floating this idea of a trade deal you guys back fall she'll give amnesty to the dreamers quote here's what she responded quote\nIt how it happens to be like a man who'd issue for the president building a wall and I'm not interested in that\n\nIn fact she said that uh of Trump's or a border wall she said he's never going to get the wall\n\nSo as far as she's concerned no matter what Trump offers he's not getting that ball\n\nSo you can offer I don't know welfare to every illegal free health care to every illegal anesthesia every illegal or the right to the path to citizenship for every illegal you're not getting that wall why because the Democrats do not want to secure our border\nNumber one number two\nThe wall is the centerpiece of Trump's agenda\nIt would be the crown jewel of his presidency and the Democrats will never ever give him that victory\nAnd so now we're faced again with an invasion that's what this is this is an invasion they're coming and they're telling us the comic there's no Walter protect us\nAgain it relies on the border patrol and our pathetic immigration laws now if I'm the president of the United states it's very simple if youre not illegitimate refugee and they're not then you get deported right away no questions asked\nBecause if we can't defend our own borders if we can't defend our own sovereignty than my friends were no longer a nation\nWe're no longer a nation and if this caravan has the right to come in\nThen all of Latin America has the right to come in in fact I'll be honest with you not that I'm advocating please don't get me wrong I don't like imperialism\nI'm against imperialism but we would almost be better off and mixing Honduras

you\n... it and make it that have a point I mean if you paid or a you know if ... if you want to have sex with her\nYou know I I Know she's aged a lot in the last ten years but you know I Would just uh I I wouldn't call their horse pace myself ah as for LeBron being stupid man I don't know but I I don't think that's a big deal one way or the other he says he he has a high opinion of himself but\nI mean he's not stupid in the sense that say\nMaxine Waters but he's he you know he's he well\nHe's not going on the uh he's he's he's not going on the men's or a board of directors anytime soon anyway aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two this is again though you know so here's the thing if if Trump would come out and said you know I Can't believe that the that the Saudis or\nYou know killed killed this guy who you know you ... who ... who has lived at the Saudi who lived in the United who has lived in the United states and you know we're going to cut off all our relations and ah and and the blockade the uh the Persian Gulf\nAnd et cetera et cetera then they would say well he's trying to cause World War three\nAnd gas gas would spike the eight dollars a gallon and it would

pounce on it they're going to seize upon what every does so now now [laughter]\nNow he's taking a a measured approach a measured approach and saying you know let's let's just see a you know how this plays out and see who has see how far up the chain this goes with the Saudi Government and he is\nCow and his cousins live with the Saudis\nAnd you know the thing is\nThe same president who vowed before the king of Saudi Arabia or am I getting hip confused with an earlier president of the United states I don't believe I don't believe he is ever bowed to ah to the\nTo the king or the crown prince of Saudi Arabia is this a ridiculous aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two seven seven force as some of these clouds seemed to be ready to go to war over this yeah\n[laughter] well there are also acting like if President Trump has a mean tweets about uh the crown prince suddenly the journalist comes back to life or something\nRight you know a ...\nYou you want to go back and read up on the war of Jenkins here you know that's that's that back in I think it was the Eighteenth century or England was spoiling to go to war with with a Spain because Spain would had had become a very weak feeble country\nAnd uh in England just wanted to rip off all the ... out in the uh down in the Caribbean so they were looking for an excuse\nSo some some idiots in Spain grabbed the British sailors named Jenkins and chopped off a busy year and that was the pre tax for going to war\nBut we don't we don't have a pre tax ... what's in it for us to go to war with ah with Saudi Arabia or cause shoe isn't even in America\nAgain I keep coming back to this you think you'd\nThink they kidnapped out him Audi Murphy or something you know some Congressional Medal of honor winner and and it is it's got used to be in the Muslim Brotherhood I I'm Sorry he's dead I'm Sorry you know he he lived here you had a green card but\nThis isn't the end of the world is it it it didn't edit by the way it didn't happen here it's not like his civil rights were violated like I don't like harder pages war or George Papadopoulos is or Donald Trump's by the deep state\nYou know we you know the FBI they

the way of all I'm oh businesses I guess you know they call this a capitalism a creative destruction you know everything has to be destroyed and make way for new things a Sears was the original Amazon\nSears was the original Kmart Sears a Sears that a lot of creative destruction itself with its catalogue\nAnd then uh after ... after a up ending the whole the whole American a retail sales world\nThey started putting up their own brick and mortar stores about uh about a century ago and uh they they again\nRevolutionized the retail industry and uh it's it's kinda sad to see him go down and you know the the the guy that the the guy that run them into the ground as someone named Eddie Lambert he said he's an interesting character\nAnd I I Know a lot of people are portraying them as this really evil person but he's he's got his he's he uh\nHe he was a um he was he went to Yale with uh the guy who's now the treasury secretary new could would they were they were classmates and he he was in a very a\nVery um a successful hedge fund operator quite a prodigy ... almost the child prodigy may may billions with a for David Gasland fish family there that they're the CBS family know half of the New York giants made a lot of money with those guys and I'm\nDavid ... said that he made more ah with ah with Lambert that he ever did in the music business\nAnd so we bought Kmart back Fifteen Years ago and everybody said you're crazy for by k-mart it was a bankruptcy bought it for like eight hundred million bucks\nAnd then he turned around and sold all the leases off to Home Depot and Sears for nine hundred million so he was already in the in the black and then he then he had the you know the the stores that were left were successful so we decided to do the same thing with Sears and of course it hasn't worked out\nBut you know I mean she tried and you know and again I Know that Sears or really crappy and we want to hear from people just how crappy the Sears was the last time you went there or if you're still like go into Sears or you know I think a lot of people\nAnd I remember I remember people who spent their entire lives working its ears you know you go when you start when you were a a you know a teenager in high school and ah you know you go to college for a little while maybe and then drop out or get married and a lot of people spent their entire working lives at Sears\nAnd you know one thing again Lambert you know everybody says well he let the stores go to hell and uh you know we didn't do any maintenance work the escalators didn't work the or the stores were dark dingy like a warehouse et cetera et cetera but that's all true\nBut you know what he also did some other uh as some other good things he he apparently I'm reading today I've been reading all these stories because he got to kind of fascinated by the whole a decline and fall\nAspect of this he he also put four point five billion dollars into the plan they have Seventy thousand workers and a hundred thousand pensioners\nAnd you know unlike some of the big auto makers you know when they when they were cutting back and going into bankruptcy a ten years ago or so the big three ... a couple of 'em anyway\nThey uh ... you know where were they Sears has never walked away from its pension obligations they've always they've they've always come through there are a hundred there are a hundred thousand more people\nThat are in danger of losing their pensions from Sears than there are in danger of losing their jobs from Sears going out of business\nSo I I don't know I mean I I haven't been to Syria for a long time a grace was talking about it during the winter and one of the last breaks and she said she said at one time I went to see the last time I went to Sears I went to get some vacuum cleaner bags\nAnd I couldn't find anybody to help me out the escalators were broken and then I couldn't find the vacuum cleaner bags so she went home and order them online and she's never been back\nAnd I think that story could be repeated like twenty million pot [laughter] you know I mean that's that's that's where they're ah they're they're a customer base wet you know they they were dissatisfied and you know the other thing about it is but the the ... the middle ground\nOf ah of the American economy they the consumer side of the economy is kind of gone somebody pointed this out yesterday I thought it was a good point you know it's like the uh you know red lobster restaurants are struggling right you know the high end restaurants the flemings steak house a capital

demise says to a seven Bangor Mall those still remember them in the tiny place in the downtown prior to Seventy six Seventy eight around there was a kid the ... catalog was incredible yeah a lot of people remember the catalogs\nOr here's one in Nineteen Seventy slept outside the data mall is Massachusetts a Sears for Bruins playoff tickets they had to ticket master inside yeah there were people are being interviewed and some of these stories saying they remember that in the old days\nI guess in the in the sixties probably that they ... that people would come to work there and there would be people lined up at seven o'clock in the morning to get in that's how big it was you know that's I mean that's how important it was\nA here six one seven I was an HR manager and one of the Sears enough Philadelphia area they began carrying the worst cheap clothes they they never had raped close I don't think they I think they got kind of ... by all the little especially shops in the mall when they started coming in the seventies\nBut anyway back to this guy they put so much pressure on staff to produce and get customers to sign up for their loyalty cards Sears reduced after the bare minimum I Know they lost the tunnel ... service for appliances was horrible\nThey lost the lands in which had much better quality you know that was the last time I was at Sears actually I bought a a I think I bought a drier I Need a new dryer\nAnd it and that was the thing you always went to Sears to get a washing machine or a drier and always used to be you could just make an appointment for them to deliver it and then it's solid and that they'll always be there and like a two hour three hour window and I remember it took like two or three\nTrips and I I'm I'm killing time in the afternoon or the mail room manager is waiting for them to show up\nAnd it just and then you that happens once that said you don't you don't do it any more\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two power Taylor

come I and I think that would end of a funny although I call a local guy came right out and it's the whole problem you know but\nI Know they they made a lot of money off those warranties and people people stop realize that the war at these didn't mean anything anymore we actually got a call when I first mentioned this when the on Monday Night when they want it to do a they filed for chapter eleven\nA woman to call from Vermont and the last hour of the show and said I just bought a three year war at the how's that going to work out and they said I think I got some bad news for you on that ... that you bought\nSo somebody said that this is a ... this is kind of a sad story but it's kind of sums it up to\nSays that his mother used to send them every Christmas he would she would send them for the Christmas present a Sears gift card and finally had to say ma\nMa come on I\nI Love the gift cards but serious come on and it's just the you know that's\nJust the that's the way it goes uh
