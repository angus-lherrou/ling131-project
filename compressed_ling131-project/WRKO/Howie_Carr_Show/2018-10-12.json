on store\nUm before I get to CNN and John Lennon who I Am completely disgusted when I was just talking to how we about during the break I Want to read the story it just stumbled across from the a P which you know the a P is they used to be\nConsidered pretty down and metal key word rush said it's state controlled media yeah so now they're ... they're just his last is any anyone else so you know if they're writing this that things are looking pretty bad for the blue wave\nThis with the title can we talk Trump's riding high and he's got a lot to say\nSo basically the entire article which I suggest everyone read and just talking about how Trump is doing these rallies every night he hasn't had a bad story and a couple and what he considers he hasn't had a bad story in a week I mean there had been ... about him but nothing that really is bothering him\nAnd he's getting all amped up from these rallies he's taking questions he's letting people in air force one he's taking so many questions that it says\nThis is a quote it said any other questions Trump asked to stand silent the reporters can't come up with questions down they complain so much that you know he's not having enough\nProbably young fallback questions like are you still getting two scoops of ice cream every night what happened to the bus the Martin Luther King\nOr one of his guys that I think he's having a lot of fun right now he's had a couple of successes recently and now he's just really riding this high and it seems like it's working and the more\n... women by the you know what the more he\nThe question he take like that that was one of the most amazing things as a couple of weeks ago when he was just taking question after question and then Jim Acosta was like do you mind Sarah I'm when I'm done if you'll take a question from a female colleague of mine and he just looked at him and go\nWhat what is he talking about like he'll take questions from anybody any station like he didn't care now because\nYou know with Jim Acosta is race he was saying\nOh he is a day and capital the yeah he's a showboat to either to show horse like there's nothing really to his questions you just as there he's there for Jim Costa he's not there to act right get anything done\nAnd I I Want to note or people or CNN when Jim does this does his routine in the White House press briefing today say good jobs yet it was great thanks for taking the stand\nI Know it's so bizarre and I just think that um it it it is true what they said that it it knew a lot of\nDanger you know he could he could he could be cut now is any moment for the weekly like him he really is and physical dangerous if brief could blow 'em over\nThey say about when I'm Sean Spicer white the press secretary they they would say oh my God you've got to get him out of their ... best messenger\nAnd I do think Sarah Huckabee Sanders on a daily basis doesn't amazing job but that is really the truth is that when he gets out there and answer those questions he just had the way if he can respond to things so quickly and he throws these people back in their heels and so I don't know about the blue wave by if things keep going the way they're going fingers crossed it is looking pretty good for public and\nIs why is Trump giving interviews\nSixty minutes though what's that'll\nWord of embarrassed part of him that ... that enjoys you know the liberal media right yeah I mean he talks with the New York times quite a bit as much as he calls it the failing New York times and says it's fake news\nSaid he's talking there was we fall who's you know the Republican on the as as it were on on sixty minutes but still I mean what's the I just don't get the the upside of that\nNow but I Want to talk about is CNN I did something today for the first time that I've never done before I issued a complaint to CNN 'cause actually\nFiled a complaint through like what their ...\nTheir feedback page I looked it up I said CNN feedback and they said hey like here's the feedback live below the ... and so he did\nA profile grace vehicle place it's actually not only is funding the trash can and if you're out washing up yes\nBut I just wanted them to know that I Am disgusted absolutely disgusted with John Lennon I watch tennis entire morning had to look at all um clips of him from last night\nJust so condescending rolling his eyes to anyone who disagrees with them than ... mother would be rolling integrate just so rude and\nI mean I'm Still not over the whole token negro thing that with a couple of days ago and so I just had to write it I said this is disgusting on you guys she making issued an apology and isn't helping anyone he's just a man expressing his opinion and using his mental illness at some sort of stigma to get him to say what you want it's not right\nI think of con you had a flood on CNN he'd get better ratings but Don Lemon\nOh my God I think if I had one and I think we had one and only one\nGovernor would get better ratings nobody none of nobody on that channel has any reading\nAnd you know when he dies okay so I decided this morning there's a lot of anger and pundits and stuff so I Can't stand how you know you go through stages sometimes they'll come in and I'll say like ... is the worst\nJohn Lennon may be the worst ever\nBecause this is what he does when someone disagrees then it's just it just

talk about a brand new product available for landlords it's called Z deposit dot net J what is the deposit\nVery we created a security deposit product to really help the problem a lot of landlords are facing with security deposit which is you know one it's time consuming to open these small and oh security part I'm ... now\nAnd you have to go into the branch got signed paperwork and there are small dollars and they turn\nAnd it's certainly the complaints in Massachusetts really tough for landlords and security deposit account you have to give till ten in certain forms when they open up the account and you have to pay interest annually and you can do all this now through Z deposit all that you can do Thursday deposit it literally takes about forty seconds to open up an account\nWe handled the automatic forms that are generated with the account number department condition statement all that sent the tenant\nAnd the interest is sent to the tenant automatically every year\nThis sounds like something is going to be very valuable to large landlords that might have two hundred tenants and small landlords it might only have five ten\nYeah absolutely with the large landlords it's just a lot of hassle to manage this so we make that very efficient for the small landlords a lot of them are afraid of not getting the complaints done correctly so that some of them some of them don't

awareness sweep the story out it's from the we've already tweeted out if you want to follow me ... at how we car show we we try to sweep you stories out\nUh it's from the San Francisco chronicle the the the daily out there a federal judge has ordered San Francisco police to return a homeless man's\nCar that they towed in impounded because thousands of dollars in unpaid parking tickets but the owner couldn't afford to pay\nHow 'bout how 'bout that let me let me out of that law as a city either but the owners said he couldn't afford to pay he owns a car and he's homeless but he says he couldn't afford to pay the tickets\nPolice side of the state law that allows them to toe vehicles with more than five overdue parking tickets but us district judge Jeffrey White of OLC once said Wednesday that unless officers have a judicial warrant no low known known legal precedent\nQuote can justify the seizure and retention of a vehicle if its owners cannot afford to pay the parking tickets\nOr did you see what kind of car yes what kind of cars he got the Mercedes is it really\nThe two thousand and says yeah Sean killed fifty to was in a nearby shelter in March when officers told the two thousand three Mercedes\nA Mercedes so he had the same kind of cars the mayor Fall River\n[laughter] that's nice\nI think you're probably sell that foreign downside it's you know go go to something maybe less luxurious\nHe had more than this guy's name is Shawn Cape Cod K.

five hundred forty to forty two\nBy the way a tool shop and says I'm not sure if you've heard the news but the New York\nTimes just wrote a story about Maine Republican candidate for governor Sean moody and an alleged sex discrimination case in two thousand six yeah that's that's more jive apparently he you know the guy who ran a he runs a big auto parts company and it's we have a lot of female employees so this woman's left\nOr to have a kid and then she came back and she wasn't doing very well so she lost her job for for whatever reason so she sued and you know rather than go through you know spend tens of thousands of dollars in legal bills a lot of times uh employers just subtle up\nAnd you sign a a a a a confidentiality agreement so it's not it's not a quiz felt like he was grabbing her or anything she he claims that she she didn't do a job after she had the kid\nAnd so she said I Want a you know I Want some money so we gave her some money to go away and she signed the confidentiality agreement but guess what\nSean ... the Republican candidate for governor has had a poll\nThat's the weirdest thing that this didn't come out in any of his previous campaigns yeah strange time and yeah the U.S happened that this happened\nTwelve years ago this happened twelve years ago in both sleuths\nAt the New York times has somehow were able to\nOn earth these ah these nuggets of information and by the way she opens herself and so he can't Sean ... can't comment because he too was bound by the the confidentiality agreement and being a Republican he has to observe the the the contract\nBecause he's required to under the law\nBut he is a ... a you know he has integrity to yeah he's a guy who won the ... what's his name on something he follows it\n[laughter] this is just this is complete jive let's uh you know let's go after the the real uh the the real events that happened like ah like the Senate candidate in Arizona\nSaying that everybody in her home state is crazy and that the Arizona is the meth lab of democracy\nAid for four or five hundred the forty to forty to Jim your next with our guard go ahead Jim\nHey it's actually can I Do an alley good thank

I have two questions I Know there's something in the founding fathers writing that talks about not being Slater influenced by entertainers and I think the philosophical principle could expand on that and maybe no ...\nNo I don't doubt for Bill you're with that I heard\nThat somewhere I second but it is that what exactly is the five or like what is going on with this whole thing I understand what happened with Kavanaugh logo and the\nIce is the ... it's ... it refers to the foreign intelligence surveillance court\nAnd these courts were set up in the uh the the Nineteen seventies and they they they weren't used all that often I think until after uh nine eleven\nBut what you do is you have the government goes in it's a secret court and the the the the judges on their federal judges in their pointed by the uh the chief justice of the U.S Supreme Court in this case Roberts\nAnd ah so they hear the these are secret there it's a secret court and they go in and image you're only supposed to use the court if you if you you can't if if you'd be giving away a ... impact counter intelligence or\nState secrets national security uh questions would be raised if you went into an open court\nLike a U.S district court and so the these are these are it's a secret it's a secret court and so the thing is in a secret court obviously a guy like Carter Page who get surveilled\nHeating he doesn't get a get notification that there are about the surveillance so you have to you have to have\nHonesty\nBy the prosecutors by the federal government because otherwise it could be ... the process could be totally abused at what happened\nHere to him is that a is that the or the FBI the corrupt FBI the corrupt Justice Department the corrupt Obama administration was taking a it was taking campaign smear material for Hillary Clinton and going to the cord and telling the court\nBut that they that this was real intelligence rather than just a made up nonsense paid for by Hillary Clinton and the and again because it was a secret court there was no pushback\nFrom any defense witnesses are defense attorneys\nAnd that that's where the that's that's how this terrible abuses occurred\nHoly crap so why are people in jail on I Know that sounds silly but like what what is the process like live give us the millennials to all of this thing can you give us ...\nYeah ... where people have been caught in lies and\nYet we don't know well I mean they ... they well they ... we know they've been caught in lies on this Carter Page that's what that's just what Joe the ... the former U.S attorney was saying but Carter Page they they they went into in October of two thousand sixteen using these Clinton\nCampaign documents totally concocted fabricated and pretended that they were raw intelligence they
