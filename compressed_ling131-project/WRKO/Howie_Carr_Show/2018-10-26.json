report\nYou can pick up every morning and it gives you a great information have all of the migration of it it's pretty obvious there are a lot of young men in that group pretty obvious that there are people there who are looking to do harm to the United states they burned an American flag with a swastika on it they put they put on it\nUh this is not somebody we want in this country how serious the problem is the possibility of jihadism terrorists from the middle east coming in from that group\nWell I don't know if you remember back in February of two thousand and sixteen uh Fifteen the Islamic state worn Europe that they would be sending\nA jihad army via a migration\nThe half a million they set to kick off and they did exactly just that\nThey sent a jihad army in with the quote unquote people uh of course millions emigrated to Europe and I ... in a ... the Muslim migration and but you see is now Europe descending into chaos\nI mean if you look at me if you look at Paris\nAt the music call attacks the attack in Belgium at the airport the Berlin Christmas market and the London attacks on my daily now\nI'm a the large majority had been by jihadi she came up through the migration now we know because the Guatemalan government has told us that they have arrested over a hundred Islamic state\nI'm a member a fight or is it in that country and we know that the Islamic state because of the brave and I'm a courageous\nActions that President Trump have really been vanquished but where do they go when we went in and we started to clear them out and mind you this was a group the Islamic state with a group that did not exist\nBefore President Obama did not exist but the vacuum ... you know evil loves a vacuum\nAnd um he created the opportunity for this kind of a rising the jihad army and show we see now in the pictures are remarkably shame if you see these pictures of of this ... these masses of\nWhat is it now seven thousand people looks just like the migration into Europe the or\nWhether it was Slovenia Slovakia\nAnd Hungary Austria border uh there's no way of knowing and so first of all I'm Sorry just because you've got to march on I bought it doesn't mean you automatically get and we do without a terrorist threat okay there's a thing called sovereignty that thing called you know law and order and I understand that the the left has a contempt for that\nBecause um they need\nThey love cast and of course these people would be their voter there's no question about it as a you know it's interesting but here in New York if you become a citizen the immigration office you go they immediately sign you up at a Democrat\nImmediately as a matter of a friend of mine was becoming a citizen that's how I Know this and she kept insisting know that I'm not a Democrat it was a whole thing don't ask it's completely corrupt but these um these potential voters for them it's how they it's clearly how the Democrats have gotten their head\nOr even in in past elections the illegal vote a letting the homeless vote remember that they will registering\nUm homeless on park benches um uh the the rational productive human being is seen in a contemptible light\nBut uh I'm Glad that President a President Trump has vowed to um palate I'm Glad he sent down hundred said us troops\nTo the border I you know the joke\nA you know ... the left has made of\nThe constitution a national sovereignty or the difference between right and wrong it's like anyone who advocate for what's right is a you know it target on Saturday Night live the mockery listen I Know\nI Know how they destroyed good people I Know how they destroy your name your reputation building he didn't make a living\nThis is what they do and everybody for very long time I know because I've been engaged in this war and it's a war in the in the nation battle space since September eleventh\nThought that if they stay quiet\nIf they stay quiet they'd be OK which is very reminiscent of ... the lead\nA terrorist the leading the terrorists and the nine eleven attacks he told the people on the flight that we're approaching the world Trade Center he said stay quiet and you'll be okay\nStay quiet and you'll be All right and they're telling us that same thing today and let me tell you something they did stay quiet and they were not All right and I'm telling you if you stay quiet you will not be All right every time you get any situation\nAny kind of that you don't know how you best to handle the the self what would the left do\nThat how you should handle it what what I'm suggesting that you'd be violent because we are not violent we believe in in in open debate which is why they want to crush free speech they want to crush free speech because their ideas are not open to challenge and to scrutiny you\nSee and the reason why they love the ... the ... under the ... you cannot criticizes\nIslam you cannot it's punishable by death which is why I had been the target\nOf multiple assassination attempts because I Am critical\nOf parts of the Islamic doctrine but there was a beheading plot or the guy was on his part of this plot a in Boston he was on his way to New York to be had me and I he was intercepted by Bush and police and he was killed 'em and they were number prosecutions in that case of course\nMy free speech event in Texas they opened fire three gee how these open fire on our free speech and this is happening in America and of course the media doesn't cover this as a matter of fact immediate blame me because you know you cannot insult the slum\nThey love this speech laws because once you can criticize it then you can criticize and once you can't criticize that then you can't criticize this other thing and what happens is well free speech is the foundation of any free society\n... if not tiring can wreak havoc on a post and that's what you are\nWitnessing and shutting down to free speech to me this is the line in the sand I can battle anybody anywhere anytime they don't like him where I Want my colleagues and I won spoke freely on college campuses that's over ... never we never speak\nThat's that that will listen family uh you've laid it out as well as it can be that's a a a magnificent description of where we are\nAnd that's the reality and they don't want free speech upsets decades that the left does not want free speech they would stop at any place they can you mentioned that neutrality\nAs one example when it's just the way it is we're gonna keep following your work we appreciate it a state of the battle stay

I've never seen this this is how good the economy is in the United states and especially in places like Massachusetts New Hampshire\nThere was a pizza restaurant in Portsmouth downtown Portsmouth it's called nine hundred degrees there's actually there's several of these restaurants there's one in Manchester there's one that happening in this one porch but the owner of nine hundred degrees pizzeria Steve is just to them she's closing the restaurant you know why\nNone of employees yeah\nShe can't get enough employees she said she needs between thirty six and forty two employees to make deliveries and you know to do everything but the rest of runners required and she can't get any more than ... people because there's just such a shortage of labor and she sent me the work seven days a week and she's going crazy so she just close the place she ... she\nTo change it to four hundred and fifty degrees [laughter] I don't know she she said that it's so bad in Portsmouth for workers\nThe owners of other restaurants are just coming in to the shot what she went her restaurant is open and trying to recruit people it's like it's like press gangs in in the old days in Britain grabbing sailing wrapping guys off the street hitting him over the head and you wake up and you're on a ship your you've you've joined the British navy and then you get a higher\nBouncers to protect your existing employees and find a spot another restaurant tour coming in to poach your talent [laughter] hey that guy works with a pizza shop across the street yet I'm outta here\nYou know I I don't understand how the Democrats even I I don't think they're going to have a blue wave but how did they even think they were going to have a blue wave I mean this is if you're an employee eat this is great news isn't it\nThat that they're they're coming into your restaurants to try to\nShanghai you to go to work for their restaurants I mean that's simply wages have to start going up right\nThey do they do this this is ...

I'm Sorry I I didn't know it was quite that bad but she said she said the Republican should be cut they want us to cut the the uh the the Affordable Care act so called\nAnd so that they should be cut in return so there it is that's I mean that's her idea of a poisonous rhetoric and she wants to abolish ice\nAlthough she lied at the most recent debate and said she didn't want to abolish ice even though it's it's that's on tape it's understandable\nAnd she said she just wanted to reform ice and then she said she sat down in New Orleans at the net roots not roots conference\nBut uh the the justice system was racist front to back so Jeff deal called they're out on and said why are you calling the police racist and she said I never called the police racist what she did say\nThat the justice system was a racist front to back and uh I Would have to say that the police I don't I don't know if they're on the front or the back but there definitely are on one side of the other of the justice system\nSo she's she walks back her poisonous rhetoric\nBut let's see if a credit tone will walk back his eye I rather doubt it\nRather doubt it a four four or five hundred forty to forty two I'm highway car\n... new incoming bullet ... known him for dinner or a car\nAre you looking for a pre own car well before you go to the dealership where you'll be pounce on by pushy sales people give the guys who try\nBill ... in my job is to make finding the perfect used car as easy as possible and that means I Do follow the tough language for you once I figure out what you want out of a car I go find I've been in this business for a long time and I know what to look out for\nWill bring you Carlos say no we'll meet or exceed your expectations so give me a call at eight hundred three hundred forty six hundred debt is eight hundred three hundred\nForty six hundred have you noticed your parents are becoming hard of hearing and keeps saying what did you say are you experiencing hearing loss hearing help express can help with FDA registered hearing aids\nGo to a hearing help dot com and used promote code how are you to get FDA registered hearing aids for Seventy five dollars down and fifty dollars a month start missing out on conversations and started hearing the get\nGo to hearing help dot com and used promote code how we get FDA registered hearing aids for Seventy five dollars down and fifty dollars a month\nTo twenty eight team deli arcane you'll be in the radio on his friday November Nine presented polo safety leaders in safety technology joined W.
