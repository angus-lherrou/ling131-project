I'm just saying there's a lot of weird weird leap going on ... from signing\nA [laughter] a bit of trouble back your well I think the the thing that was crazy to me was all of the never Trump or is in the in the moon bats trying to find some like proximity reason why she left like oh you didn't like the way he talked about Brett Kavanaugh last night didn't like the ... or she didn't like the confirmation hearings or\nShe disagrees with the trade policy or there's something that she disagrees with\nWhen according to reports they've been talking about this for months now and it's just now becoming down right\nI I Know it's a ... yeah this is I mean again they're they're just fantasizing\nI mean it is a little odd though then it comes before midterms what'd you typically expect something like this to be announced after midterms livelihood unless there's some other you know act in the play\nI Want it's like a it's like Rosenstein wasn't fired yesterday you know because the midterms are coming up and they don't want any distractions uh uh\nYou know although you know they're all these rumors going around that there's big announcements coming down with the president is supposed to have an announcement tonight right some kind of big announcement\nI Hope it's a I Hope you are talking about releasing the uh the unwritten pact that are five ... applications and everything else I mean I Know I'm obsessed with this thing but yeah so at some of the VIPs are here to\nThere they're hoping for that as well I just I Want to get this stuff out I I'm just I'm just still appalled by this whole thing and and you know a lot of people are so there's one that's another ... conspiracy theory that's going around is that the is the Trump\nTook Rosenstein or or excuse me his new name as redacted Stein\nThat took a deputy attorney general rod redacted Stein down to Orlando with him so that he could like you know just have him in one place on air force one and just tell them look you know I I could blow all you guys up all I have\nTo do is sign one quarter ... uh you know releasing all these forms and you're all I don't know if you're going to prison but you're all going to be totally humiliated totally disgraced even even in the uh it in the ... media they'll they they have to be shocked by these multiple violations of every bodies civil rights\nAnd so I'm going to just uh I Am going to keep you guys at the arms length and I got this hanging over your head and I'm not going to do anything right now now I have a ... here here's my conspiracy theory\nOh boy he took him on the air force one because as he was concerned after the election the Trump Tower was bugged or not but but surveilled because in fact it was\nI think how about this he he brought Rosenstein on the air force one because he knew air force one wasn't bug\nOr surveilled skiff yeah yeah and also it also was rows and rows were back then Stein was he ousted was he was he frisked before he went on I mean again\nI mean Trump does want to bring stop and frisk back to Chicago so why not bring it back to air force one\nI think he needed war there I think he needed more with dealing with were back then Stein than you do a you know in the loop you know I mean he ... he's on the record we have the fact that he said he claims that was a joke but he's never denied that he that he said to some of the other a corrupt or hacks\nAnd the FBI and the de OJ that he would be willing to wear a wire against the president of the United states\nIsn't that isn't that something this guy is\nThe deputy attorney general and you still have to keep him around after I mean this is we really are in uncharted waters here as far as the United states of America goes I mean right now\nYou know were riding the tiger and it's it's it's worked out for us but this is dangerous you know when you when you have slime like redacted Stein and everybody in the mainstream media and every elder dams on the Senate Judiciary committee\nThis is a really really something to meanwhile is a is a six one seven points out a CNN has read another story on the presidential uh Jetta Talia today they so they are back to Stormy Daniels does this mean that the Michael ... is going to be rehabilitated\nOr they this desperate that they have to bring by Michael ... you know they've spent the last forty eight hours blaming him for the fact that they weren't able to succeed in uh in burning Brett Kavanaugh at the stake\nTo be fair I think Michael I could get better ratings and Don Lemon [laughter] that's not saying\nMuch she I mean none of them I I mean they're all they're all terrible though there are terrible as someone says give Elizabeth Warren the ambassador shift to the un I who who wouldn't want to I mean I guess I guess some people have made something of it that wasn't Daniel Patrick Moynihan the ambassador to the un I mean he made something out of and he got elected to the Senate it is technically\nA cabinet level position yeah the key word is technically you know it's [noise] I just uh I I mean if they do ... ag secretary but it's in there yeah\nI I don't know a a five oh wait I Want Trump to kick Pence off the ticket run Haley has to be paying twenty twenty\nNow you never get ... ... to get kicked off the ticket as BP you've you've got to be some not like Henry

fingered put it into Web I mean he's he saw which way the wind was boy that didn't do any good like I said he's lost another four or five points since but I just don't think\nOkay if you're if you're kind of an nobody see Lester it does make sense to come out politically and say you know I support Trump because then you do get a big fan base like Scott what's his name Scott bail\nYes like no one really knew him 'cause he was on TV so long ago I'm Joni and talk to you whatever I don't know I was not even I was not even close to being born thank God um but anyway so he comes out and endorsed as
