have to ride to the rescue which leads me to point number two please God I'm begging you let her run again\nBecause if you thought she took a beating in two thousand sixteen with everything that she

the wasps word that they are going to lay across the uh uh south ocean boulevard from mar a Lago\n... this is this is so preposterous and the fact is\nThe vice chairman of the Democratic National

Keith\nEllison is a good how about Louis ... probably the second leading after Keith Ellison leading anti Semite and the country who refers to Jews just recently as termites\nBy the way which president of the United states has a picture of himself beaming with Louis barricaded who calls juice termites would that be Donald J Trump or would that be Barry ...\n... Iraq Hussein Obama\nYou know the answer to that question they ... they had a picture taken together ... Khan and Obama and uh it was sad on it was a spike for ten years\nBy the photographer who took it because he knew how it would be a scene it would be seen in the correct way but the Obama was in bed with a vicious anti Semite I'm not a hack\nYeah\nSo this this is ... ... just the worst kind of a BS and and and you know who's the one who's been ... who's been calling out for violence against the political opponents hasn't been the Republican Party has been the Democratic party here's why here's just one thing today\nThis is just I mean that's just one little little indication of how how things go and how they how it's portrayed in the national media\nOr the local media in this case Daytona Beach Florida vote Lucia county Republican Party headquarters vandalized by gunfire and va Lucia\nVandalized by gunfire Steve skill lease the or the Republican majority whip who was shot and the hip by the uh by the rabbit Democrat last year I guess I guess his hip was vandalized by gunfire\nAbraham Lincoln vandalized by gunfire by a Democrat [laughter]\nI I mean where where does where do these people get off accusing Trump of having something to do with this after after they are the ones who are who are promoting this kind of violence and again they it it wouldn't be one thing if if they just said this is terrible what happened but then then after ... viewing out all this nonstop hatred\nFor the last two years then something happens and it's funny but the Trump supporter and they accuse Trump of having something to do with it\nAnd I said in my column yesterday and I and this is not a this is not a something I'm particularly proud of but the first thing I thought of when I when I heard that this happened in Pittsburgh was I Hope this guy isn't the Trump guy and I'm sure I'm sure a lot of you felt the same way and I'm sure a lot of people on the side felt the same way\nWell guess what he wasn't a Trump guy he didn't say like Bernie obviously or even like Hillary but he didn't like Trump\nEight four for five hundred forty to forty two and by the way who's ... who's a dark who's telling us we read so good somebody named Rick Wilson I don't know who that guy Rubio consulting over you never tower of Rubio okay\nYou get those rocks off going on MSNBC and making fun of Trump voters and the liberals to slap it up\nOh great okay so he says so he's he's a male Jennifer Rubin is what you're selling\nAnything he did the never Trump circuit you know he puts out a book to collect money from other labs\nYeah aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two who blew off be be at the White House for a couple of hours while he went up there yeah there's another one yeah called him chicken bleep yeah\nAnd I ... I think he wouldn't let him in the front door either at one point that the front door was reserved for a really vicious anti Semite\nLike Al Sharpton who hung guy who hung out with Al Sharpton by the way I wanted Al Sharpton\nCalled Joes diamond merchants from crown heights right yeah I think the I think that's what he did not going to have other things\nAnd other great friend of Louis Farrakhan yeah and we also have pictures of Eric Holder and Maxine Waters with ... yeah I mean like mainstream Democrat Party at this point\nHe is I mean there's no so is it so it was Keith Ellison Keith Ellison is the is the vice chair he's got to go down in flames are next next week in in Minnesota is running for attorney general but\nHe he uh he he was going to win and until the domestic abuse allegations came out against them\nMultiple domestic ... ... ... ... ... many more of domestic abuse allegations against them corroborated than against well I don't know Brett Kavanaugh just to pick a name and around the damn from da says is Trump to blame but the Dodgers lost the world series absolutely absolutely\nAnd the other whether any other big you were there any other big games yesterday that the that that were decided in the final moments where if you're if you're rooting for some other one of the football teams that lost yesterday at Trump's fault that your ... your team lost and you lost some money and the team to or or your team won but they didn't beat the spread and you'll awesome though\nHow about it and and they're not are they complaining that Trump Trump didn't handle it well yeah\nBecause he went to the event\nHe went to the rally that had already been plant now now we were told what we told after nine eleven we couldn't cancel any other any of the baseball games we couldn't stop going to the malls because if we did the terrorists would wet right but now Trump says Trump basically said the same thing\nAnd uh so so they're they're they're very angry at him but now how did how did it by the way how did how did Obama handled it when the\nMuslim terrorists shot up Fort Hood and killed I Believe Thirteen people that day I mean that's that's different that's just local crime that was when they you know when he called they called it a workplace violence\nThe ... I suppose the price opposed Donald Trump it call this ... this worship place violence what what do you think would have been the reaction but but the Obama called the workplace violence he refused to meet with one of the wounded soldiers who wanted to tell\nThem how ... they were being treated because they weren't trading uh the uh the Pentagon it at Obama's direction wasn't treating the Muslim terror attack as a as combat violence they were treating it as just as like\nA you know like you fell off a a a a a back call they're going to ditch at the back of the base ... and\n... and there's no pushback there's there's you know there's nothing said about the way Obama handle that by the way he was yelling that guy that guy or his name was ... a ma leak Hassan who was chanting allahu Akbar as he was shooting\nUnarmed Americans including a pregnant woman by the way who beg for unborn child but he shot her anyway 'cause she was a Christian\nAnd\nObama ticket Obama takes no no grief whatsoever about that and I hadn't thought about this for a long time but it's just the the the screaming double standards here six oh three I didn't win the big mega millions jackpot totally Trump's fault yeah that's right\nI mean you can see that it's a pretty easy flow chart did something good happens okay it's not Trump's fault it's probably Obama's fault if something bad happened Trump's fall\nRight river obey someone just points out Obama was criticizing the cops after Ferguson, Missouri and then five cops got shot by the radical black and are you in\nDallas was that was that Obama's fault nobody said it was Obama's fault\nMe they certainly ah he he certainly poison the rhetoric though did me by blaming the police officers were buying into the hands up don't shoot BS that was being pedaled at the time\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two about playing golf when James Foley was beheaded people are coming up with all these ... you know these are all great the great moments in the uh in the Obama regime that he was never really held to account for\nAlso like I guess I hate how the media I think that they're like the judges on American Idol and they're somehow uniquely qualified to judge our president response to something like that like like B. B. who else has been a president with something on that on their hands like this who is who is the media to judge how president response to this well\nWe all know how they got a response and whenever he does a he he uh it's\nRaw it doesn't matter whether it's foreign policy or a federal interest rates or a judicial nominations or in the case of these uh these these domestic ah terror attacks aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two it's Trump's fault it to the red Sox five games instead of four\nThey should go to a point yeah the Dodgers lost Trump's fault the red Sox won Trump's ... whatever you want to say whether it's always Trump's fault aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two I'm highway car\nWill be back after this [noise]\nThis half hour to buy a new book Massachusetts NATO electrician\nFor ...

seven innings and we're going really well and they pulled him and everything kind of went downhill rather ...\nWas ... he was he was criticized for that as well of\nCourse yeah but it was actually pretty cool 'cause retaliates for males and so it just small world you know melting guy becomes pitcher for the Dodgers and then before you know he's getting treated about by the president of the

London or\nJust a couple of teams every year yeah so this year with the games I think\nYou're they used to be one now that I think there's\nTwo yeah I think you're right there's two I'm so for Jacksonville Jaguars players airy church DJ Hayden Ronnie Harris and end Jared wealth and where detained early Saturday after an incident in line didn't wear the team\nThey ... they ... they get to them for the uh the lead their race they ran up a sixty five\nThousand dollar tab at a strip club [laughter] it's one of those in front of your stories of\nThe year but we need to see the receipt we need to know how is this broken down was mostly drinks are mostly strippers what they said\nDefinitely mostly drinks I think\nThey said that they started out with like these four hundred and fifty dollar bottles of champagne which they thought was ... they were being caught but I'm I then I was doing the math but I thought I don't think they have a hundred and thirty bottled\nUp past what I'm saying it's going to be mostly strippers right and what if you can kind of justified because they're trying to get to take care of their mental health you know relax a little bit\nIf ... if you are spending money on stripper it that's usually stuff you have on hand you don't usually like charred get like oh I Want to give that to pretend dollars charge it to my dental how would you do music videos\nWhen they make it rain um actually no funny story my parents were actually in London to visit my sister who studying abroad and hanging out with the jaguars no but they say they thought eagles

and then they just assume that for the rest of the night you want more bottles and you just really wanted a taste of the highlights life and you didn't want\nLike a forty five dollars worth of parking water you have to let people know if you're giving them a little piece of champagne and then they keep drinking at you have to say by the way you're officially off our cat you're on your own so I'm kind of team jaguar on this one\nAnd my writing\nI still think the most of it was spent on strippers even at even at four hundred and fifty dollars a bottle there's no way you get up to sixty five\nI've been there and then they got the ... the bill and they tried to run out the door I mean I just I Would love to you know see what the conversation was you know I mean there was we thought

I. heart radio now\nSo boy so Boston New York about one hundred point seven till UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise]\nThe news ... news\nBoston mayor Marty Walsh who's calling the chance at all time great team in defeating the Dodgers to win the title last\nNight's plays a role models and we want to celebrate them in Boston style a championship duck boat parade will take place on Wednesday signing eleven o'clock on Boylston Street by Fenway Park\nThis isn't the daily mail from the u._k. oh that's great but it's also the judicial watchers said the same thing they had a a they had somebody embedded in there there's all kinds of a gang bangers in there I mean you you know the the the good news is some of 'em are only coming over here to go on welfare the bad news is some of them are coming over here\nTo be gang bangers and the part of joined MS Thirteen\nPart of me thinks it's a mistake for conservatives to focus on the possible you know ISIS terrorists are MS Thirteen because even if there it doesn't really matter whether there is or isn't terrorist in the group it's still bad they shouldn't be allowed to come into the country and it just kind of makes our arguments stronger I think but then they focus on well you can't prove that you can't prove that\nWell where are these diseases coming from by the way they we have all these new these are new old diseases the word ... from the U.S a half century arrests\nInjury I'd go there now and making a miraculous comeback now that now that we have all these illegal aliens from the third world coming into the country you have these these weird a\nMutant polio type a maladies are are spreading again not to mention all the other a horrible things like a tuberculosis a\nWhooping cough the theory or even leprosy is coming back\nAnd the odd thing is that the same liberals who are welcoming these people across the border are also refusing to vaccinate their children\nYeah I I Know it's a a Victor Davis Hanson has a\nGood call about this we're going to have I Am colds or on a later on today and and ... had again I I uh I finished up the it's on Kennedy Babylon to pretty much and I have a I have a quote in there I did a chapter on the Ted Kennedy and an immigration and the immigration reform act of Nineteen sixty five and all the other a terrible law\nReforms that he was involved in that have that have led to this ah\nThis ah for these hordes of a of of uh illegal aliens swarming into the country and uh you know the the ... the one quote that really stands out I looked it up again was Milton Friedman he says you cannot have open borders when you have a welfare society\nAnd that's what we're proving right now because what you have is a people who don't want to work or coming in to the country and it's just it it's it's a recipe for catastrophe\nAnd the and and that's what we're getting\nThey did a poll in the union leader today somebody sent it to me the Manchester union leader as they said do you do you what do you want the the the caravan to come into the U.S eighty five percent said no I Know it's a self selecting a sample the union leader isn't this conservative papers that used to be New Hampshire isn't this conservative state but it's still eighty five percent\nNobody who's a taxpayer I don't think wants this these people to come into the country I mean there there could be immigration system has to be set up\nFor the benefit of the people who are already here in the country not for the benefit of everybody wants to come in this is like you better watch your micro aggression from this is like you know having a resort somewhere and allowing people to come to the resort and stay forever for free I mean what what is the difference\nVictor Davis Hanson\nDo the migrants ever pause and wonder whether their own past and present at present attitude to the law in the abstract man some small part explain why their own countries in the concrete are often prone to lawlessness in other words why would a host country welcome in aliens who break the law and order to\nEnter it because their own home is lawless\n\nIt is Orwellian to leave a nation because of its lawlessness and then first whether another country illegally and second to continue to reside in prevention up the loss\n[laughter]\nMost most of the migrants claim they have no intention of diverting their odyssey to another country only America\nWill do often Central American government's the Mexican elite wouldn't be illegal aliens in their sympathizers than the American progressive identity politics movements obsess on the supposed xenophobia racism but nativism and in hospitality of the United states\nSo what exactly is America that moniker defied why would anyone wish the editor such an ill the rope country so different from the customs and traditions of Central America\nWould not Mexico be much better place for a refuge or a refuge for the caravan people given multiple offender these of ethnicity language culture and history\nYeah I mean\nWhy did they want to come here and and and again they they keep then now they're marching with the flags of but two of the U.S a little countries from Central America in front of them\nSo if they if they if these countries are so terrible and there are oppressing them why are they why are they carrying their flags I I'm just I'm perplexed by this\nEight for four or five hundred forty to forty two you know why can't we have people coming into\nThis country who are actually gonna contribute something to the country other than infectious diseases and the ...\nYou know\nI mean I Know I Know not all of them are going to be a burden but most of them are I mean that's what the statistics show\nEven if they work they're not going to be able to make enough money there they would they are going to need the English as a second language for their kids that they ... they have no health insurance when they get arrested when they get arrested they'll need translators they'll need psychologists\nYou know what is that what is the upside to me as an American or to you as an American taxpayers what is the upside to to Americans of any race\nWell it's pretty clear that Democrats aren't even asking that question all they care about is making I mean they really believe that the welfare state should apply to the entire hemisphere\nWhile they just they they don't I I don't think they they they just believe that they want to get them into the country so they can make them dependent on handouts so they'll vote for Democrats they they don't seem to understand you know when the when the costs are the vandals crossed into the Roman empire you know if you if you opened up the grain of race\nTo the to the ... the city invading barbarian hordes that didn't mean that they were going to\nYou know\nExcept senator ... as their leader was there with a slit his throat and then they were going to put up their king is the boss I mean it's not going to it's not going to end well for the Democrats if they think that importing this new underclass is going to keep them in power 'cause it's a map\nWill see you've already lost the left because for them history started in twenty sixteen\nYeah I understand that I understand that I\nI Know they thought history and that when when Clinton was reelected I write a column in the wall Street Journal history is over\nOkay\nYou just keep telling yourself that it's over\nA four four or five hundred forty to forty two what should what should be done about this caravan I I they gotta stop they've got to stop these people ate for four or five hundred forty to forty two\nAh nine seven eight since the black community is why is it up to the Democrats they need another large group to exploit that's I I mean I think that as a I think this whole like illegal immigration thing is is a reason why the or the or\nThe large segments of the black population are drifting away from the Democrats not to mention large segments of the Hispanic community I mean is it\nThat this is about if you have a job if you have a stake in the society you don't want to bring in a millions upon millions of people who you're going to have to support and your kids are going to have to support and your grandchildren are going to have to support it doesn't make sense from any

wants to do but when it comes to actually doing it uh that's where everything seems to fall apart uh this is by the way\nWhy we wanted a wall and maybe maybe President Trump didn't understand why that became\nThe chant of his campaign I mean as far as I pointed out before talked about a lot of things when he came down that escalator\nUm and then he'd go out to these thirty thousand person focus groups of Trump supporters they're the ones who created the slogan of his campaign build the wall they're the ones but the build the wall hashtags were chanting it at every single rally\nAnd continue to do so to this day Trump may not have understood what was so important about that\nThat rally cry about the theme of his campaign but we understood we don't want to have to keep going through these caravans every three months but the rest of our lives Trump isn't going to be president forever we need a permanent barrier on our southern border\nYeah I I agree and I and you know I I think yeah but

I mean a minor office in the larger scheme of things for Hampton county register if these was held by a guy named ash for many many decades and he died and a ... a state\nRep Cheryl Coakley Rivera decided to get into the race against or a Republican woman who worked in the office for a number of years\nAnd so she got all these signatures in these ... and the signatures are are just apparently totally fraudulent there but a bunch of people have stepped forward and said that they are\nBut they didn't sign these petitions and some of them the signatures or a written out in block letters it's just it's it's ridiculous so Anthony ... is the Republican candidate for a for secretary of state and the secretary of state is that ... is the election cheaper lectures officer of the commonwealth\nAnd he's supposed to make the decision on whether or not these signatures are okay and and uh a ... a\nA an angel ... who's the Republican candidate she missed the opportunity to to complain she's filed a complaint now so but the deadline has passed but a Anthony and more I went out there today to what to do was hold a press conference about this yesterday what's the what's the problem here with all these uh Cheryl Coakley Rivera signatures\nYou're there that\nWe got we got a bad connection we're gonna have to get him back in a second tier eight for four or five hundred forty to forty two\nOr Galvin a bill Galvin the uh the secretary of state currently who's running for reelection his spokesman said that window closed months and months ago we're now counting ballots the candidate\nIf the candidates alleging violations of elections law we're not in the horsemen agency and we will refer the matter to the correct one such as the district attorney's office or the attorney general\nOkay we've got about a year after that you're what's the problem with these signatures thanks for being with us\nThank you how are you know it's I I got a chance to see a number of them and they are in my opinion they're blatantly ah just copy straight down a page you know numerous A People's names are ...\nYour name is different but the signatures are the same now the secretary of state's office told the clerk's office you know we don't want you to you don't need to be Colombo\nAre investigating these but it I mentioned today inspector clue so could tell that these things are just a straight a list of ... ... ... it's really shameless and it's a disservice to a ...\nAnd ... but it's too but it's too late now to was to to do anything\nWell that seems to be the problem I mean I don't know if it's too late for the statute of limitations they it's a crime to uh to falsify names on these documents to a year in prison than a thousand dollars for each instance so I don't know about this statute in terms of criminal\nActivity but in terms of filing a complaint it's too late but let me say highly\nThat's the problem I mean you submit thousands of signatures for view on may thirtieth and you only have to kill a third or fourth to to file a complaint you didn't leave much time for her to um to get to the surface you know get them from the secretary's office to review them it's really an unfair situation for a Republican candidate\nYeah I mean I mean apparently a you know I was looking at the story in the uh Springfield Republican into it and uh the the Republican ... came ... keep found a lot of people\nWhose names were on the uh the were signed in and they didn't uh they they didn't sign it I mean it's it's you know it's ridiculous and number one and the other thing too is a lot of these you've seen them and now I haven't seen the actual ... petitions [noise]\nA lot of these are are a written out in the block\nHand printed letter is not is not a real lot cursive signature right\nAway and there is all it appears to all be the same pen have bother changing and the vaccine I shouldn't say handwriting it's basically printed names um and there doesn't seem to be a lot of concern about fraud from from the secretary of state's office or from the clerk's office just seems like\nA you know it's in comedy was incumbent upon the Republican candidate to figure this out ourselves I don't know how she wants to do that\nYeah [laughter] it it's a ... it's not that tough you okay I I've been involved in like state wide a signature gathering campaigns we have to get a you know Seventy thousand\nFrom all across the state and then you have to go back then the legislature voted down and you have to go out and get ten thousand more I mean I Know they're only in one county but all you got to get is a thousand signatures ... it can't be that tough\nTo get a thousand signatures now in Hampton county\n... well no I mean it it's it's not that ... that it will she get it ethically I mean these are from what I understand that could be could be hundreds of them better um ... and\nThere's nothing that she can do about it there's nothing being done about it and I think that uh our state secretary of state in the towel clerk or I don't know if it's hurtful ... they were told don't investigate these too closely so I don't know what they were to do um it's really unfair for the Republican candidate it's shameful\nYeah the reason I the reason I'm interested in this case Anthony's I mean I I've I've run into a ... out on the ah out on the on the west coast as Elizabeth Warren would call it of math [laughter] but you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "city": "Boston", "day": "29"}
