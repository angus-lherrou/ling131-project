know I don't I just want to say kill you attack or on the issues not personally right ... ... is a question with the DNA test and the issues that she stands for would destroy this country those are the things you go after you don't have to go after her personally that she was a bad person\nThat but she has bad policy and here's why\nBut I Would also bring up when she represented travel is ensuring a large corporation that she rails against the corporations and as a result she worked in how when that case but that I'm aware as best does you know victims were denied their money's\nAll of that would be fodder for the campaign absolutely she's not she appears to be is what you're saying\nShould stop at the people just took that corporations I mean\nI always have money and if the opposing candidate doesn't bring all of that up in a forceful way who's going to bring it up the dog is not going to bring it up the Boston Globe that but I I was on with our Riley the other day\nOn his show and he made the point to me that the globe did a puff piece about her\nAnd the DNA thing it was strictly a ... it had been a Republican skewered that person\nWell protected her\nI also bring up the fact that she does it stay with the people at all we're here uh she could have helped the shipping industry she didn't do anything for the fishermen here there's so many things you can head or are and\nAnd you need to do it frankly um but I appreciate the call and I thank you I think I think we're all in consensus Jeff deal should the United states senator but he needs to be more forceful in attacking her on her issues and the position she holds on the issues let's go to William and fair haven William you're on the voice of Boston W. or kale hello\nHey how are you Mike I don't know if I got good news for the bad news but I got home at about quarter one and there was a little mini traffic jam it to my apartment complex talk a lot and I couldn't figure out why until I see them all on into the fire department in voting\nAnd a whole lot of people at lunchtime went in there and then since then it's been ... with like um their children you know or their grandchildren\nAnd a quite a quite a show in and yeah I don't know what that tells us anything or not it does is it working people to show our ... guy he was also a sandwich you want any voting mountains eaten sandwich so I don't know if that's good or bad but people are voting\nWell I Know that I you know what the more people who vote for better\nOr ... that's why I asked earlier in this program about whether people are energized to vote for Republicans because of what's going on what happened with Kavanaugh what happened with the border of what's happening with uh the Democrats and they are despicable treatment of capital and doing anything to win\nAnd intimidating trying to intimidate the United states by saying nothing about the intrusion of thousands of mostly men trying to get across the border\nIt's got an energized Republicans in the state every single one and independence should be fed up with Elizabeth Warren a thank you for calling leave let's go to Patrick in debt I'm Patrick you're on the voice of Boston W ...\nOr ... or good afternoon thanks for taking my call a yeah I watched both debates I'm the first one before that was horrible um she filibustered\nI'm I kind of respect lost respect for the moderator or the second one I think Jeff was um you know ... has been shot so they could um they're kind of the first the take away I take away from the first to debate is that Elizabeth Warren got as ugly as she can get\n'em you know and her streaming of vitriol and a deal was a standing back in um landing shots but also acting poised professional I think he came off probably has more senatorial than a well Lisa good senatorial quote unquote um then then Warren did\nUm I think you know I I agree a mistake\nWith the media the way things are on it is an uphill battle absolutely and he needs to come out and you know the country and hard and I think he I think he's kind of settings itself out to do after the third debate to think about the first two debates we're kind of you know\nYes they work together to schedule them but they probably schedule around her travel schedule which is\nProbably okay she's in Oklahoma now she is in Ohio's and whatever um but the first two are like a ... a a friday and a Sunday\nThose are kind of like almost always the next one is on a Tuesday\nThere won't be anything it'll be probably one of the national a debate you know events going on I Would hope and I think it during that debate I think that there's going to be landing them hard and he can do it on a fair number of issues\nUm you know the the Indian stuff I don't think that's a huge winter except for the fact that when she did it and why she did it\nYou know and that was his point and may nowadays is that\nNow it's it's it's passe but I Would have used it in the prior debate thank you for calling and I appreciate it they make some great points again having to be more forceful maybe he will be in the next one Washington in Mount Vernon Washington you're on the voice of Boston W ... hello there\nI think all at one o'clock I Love the Maghreb talking about voting and people think I'm pitching integration laws that do whatever they are really the president\nHas the power right now no thought any and all\nBecause of the time limit leading by\n... by the military\nYeah but the ... that's not something that solves the problem long term\nYou know we don't know how to let me let me look we'll have a minute left\nSo you raised a good point so let me answer you\nGlad to Congress legislators are the ones that get a border on DACA\nWas frankly unconstitutional when Obama admitted it he said but I'm doing it because of the Congress should do something that you gave two years to those younger people are as a waiver to be in this country freely yet any tickets Congress would do something by then well they haven't done it\nWell but what I'm trying to tell you that the president the only way he's going to force Congress is when the hype it down to down to the board I stop all illegal immigration\nAnd the way you stop that way I look at a news service men on the ... the Democrats will never cave in on that one that's okay man it's about doing the right thing is when I was the right thing and and they haven't done the right thing to this point don't you get it they want the votes\nThe bottom line all around them what I'm Talking with the president will should be doing it doesn't matter if they do is follow the constitution what'd you have to\nDo is elect Republicans who will vote to change the laws on immigration that's what you have to do it that it's not going to the president should do that but that's not going to change Chuck Schumer is vote\nAnd they'll use the filibuster unless they get sixty votes in the Republican side to stop the filibuster altogether Mike Segal for Jeff Gordon thanks for listening seeing them are all because of yourself in the world and the world will be good for you\nThis report is powered by Kelly financial

this crap and pretend oh my hands are tied I Need Congress I mean I admit I Can't understand why Republicans in Congress [noise] um\nAre so incredibly stupid I Can't believe they can even remember to go to the bathroom and feed themselves I'm really really popular issue that you know your opponents will take\nThe unpopular side on building the wall they should be making the Democrats vote on Wall funding uh every week since since the Republicans have been in the majority let them take that back to the voters nope nope I decided to old doesn't work on\nPeople getting a little tired of that argument\nI think Democrats are pretty fortunate once again that they have the media and they're back pocket because a a real a free press would be asking the Democrats well isn't this a you know are reaping the world when now I mean this is what you've always wanted to hear it is coming right your way and time for the midterms\nBut they're not going to do that morass are you getting a pass on this pretty much\nKnow the president is very bad but the principal advantage the Democratic party has is the Republican Party why on earth would you not have your opponent\nOut on something you know this is massively wildly popular I'm an utterly implausible reality TV star was just elected president of the United states on the slogan build the wall we know the voters really really want this and we know\nThe Democrats are going to vote against it should we keep bringing up bills to make them vote against it and I don't know what Bush tax cuts and move the embassy um no they're just they're just beyond redemption we thought watching the campaign that Trump was something different but wow\nIt's been two years ah haven't even broken ground on a wall e's ... rip painted some fences um so yeah you\nKnow I mean I say our van I mean there are millions than we do he ... he\nHe says he's going to do I don't think he's got to be choice now I Am you know I mean these he he let this thing you're right he wanted to get away from him but now he's got\nTo do something I mean the ... and again if he if he does something is going to be like the Cuban missile crisis I think you know when the JFK or\nYou know why the five expectations in the ... the Democrats the better because I mean this is ... I mean this is a more serious matter ... when you think about it than the missile crisis I mean that was over rated emergency when you look back on it but\nThis was totally hoodwinked it's worth mentioning or or historically minded but I mean this is not everything they wanted out of that we got enough\nRight but this is really a clear and present danger to the United states of America I mean there's no\nDoubt for Twenty years and um I won't pointed out\nIf you stop this particular caravan and the only reason we seem to think he might do so is that we have an election ten days away but we can't count on an election being ten days away for every day of our lives for the next forty years an election major mid term election will not always be ten days away that's\nWhy we wanted a wall um Trump will not always be president\nThat's why we wanted a wall or it's just it's an rage and if you stop this care if it caravan 'em and get better but\nUm it is going to lead to the question oh so you can stop a caravan why didn't you stop the last six caravans\nIf you're concerned about the new tax laws you will or state making some Social Security decisions or any concerns you may have planning for or living in retirement I Want to personally can invite you to one of Kelly financial informative dinner event on October twenty fifth\nAt the Tuscan kitchen in Burlington, Massachusetts\nAnd then again on the first of November at the new to me it was in brain tree right by the home office both of these are Thursday's called eight eight eight eight hundred one eight eight one and meet\nKelly financials family of experts in all fields of financial planning that Thursday October twenty fifth the Tuscan kitchen in Burlington, Massachusetts and then again on the first of November at the new ... in brain tree Kelly financial services eight eight eight eight hundred one\nAttention that if you add on romantic date but that special someone don't let this happen to you let me explain you got loud buyer flowers that candlelight dinner maybe even a bottle of wine and after dinner and you go back to your place things heat up and when that intimate moment is about to happen you're not able to perform\nThe evening becomes a disaster you were in barest and you feel like you let her down don't be that guy\nMillions of men struggled to perform and most never find a solution until now you need to try knocks the trail the powerful meal and hasn't bill\nThat will jump start your performance in the bedroom it's like ... on steroids so called now and find out how to get a free bottle there's nothing to lose and next time you can skip the fancy dinner and be confident in order to go\nHome right now and get your free supply ... eight hundred for a zero for nine one that's eight hundred for he does the euro for nine one it's like the little blue pill on steroids improve your life and get bigger with your free supply all eight hundred for a zero for nine one that's one eight hundred for a zero for nine months and bring morning\nWould come and be be I'm not sure\nWe think of his Vegas Vegas you're right here with me weekday morning six to ten [noise]\nBurlington that this has cut OSHA owner Manchester New Hampshire Daniel\nMassachusetts\n[noise] we can\nOrder our new park Kennedy Babylon a century of scale um depravity volume two what how we car show dot com ... click on store you can pre order right now there'll be out next month and uh you can get it if you'll get an autographed copy if you order today\nAnd in the meantime work clearing out our warehouse of some of our older titles rifleman rat mad about organized crime in Boston part of a box\nAnd what really happened about the ... the sixteenth campaign of paperback almost Seventy dollars worth of books you can get them right now for fourteen Ninety five and they're all autographed grape Christmas presents great fall reading border now and how we car show dot com click store Steve your next with highway cargo had stayed\n\nThere they've drawn your next with highway car go ahead John\nYou tell me a a listen I'm not sure what it is coming up from the so ... what are you still new workforce\nWorkforce for her for us coming up right you know why not just United States but it was the last time you see no Brady was called L\n... it's the it's the new while workforce for M.

grunt mob is winding its way through Mexico headed for the U.S border and the president Donald Trump has said he's going to stop them today he uh I guess I don't know if people said this in March before he got on the plane the Houston\nOr he tweeted out he ... he challenged the uh the media to take the cameras inside the caravan and see if they can find some gang bangers some MS Thirteen members for some middle Easterners because again we know we know a lot of MS Thirteen gang bangers got in through the last a surge\nOf unaccompanied children the Texas a public safety department has a has documented is\nThat we know that a lot of um mid eastern for potential terrorists have been arrested recently in Guatemala was in the major newspaper down there the president of the country announced it\nSo joining us now on the line is uh just go on from the center for Immigration Studies a and we just wanted to ask her just what the what should the president do next how can how can we stop this a mob this this mob particularly before the midterms in ... and all these future mobs from a breaking into the country\nAnd invading it and trying to fundamentally transform it is a rock Obama cheered them on what you do\nWell there are a number of things he could do he been leaning on these other governments to enforce their own immigration laws that should help but you know we can't wait for other countries to on yeah save us from caravan so we have to take steps in cases like this one of the option if he had just simply\nClose the border it's an extreme\nOption diet you know if I Am a mob of four thousand people is hell bent on\nTesting our sovereignty that's what we're gonna have to do and it can be done and then you know sure it hurts business for some people but it hurts our communities and the rest of the country where these people are struggling not to stop so that's one option the other thing is is it in and started that would be simply\nTelling these people know you don't get to apply for asylum here because you re route ... thousand per thousand miles throughout the country that has offered us island do you have no basis for making that claim here\nOn the other thing is that we simply I you know just put a\nReally a house hold the line with the help of military an additional border patrol agents her mother\nHow 'bout how 'bout I been suggested this all day I read it on power line blog dot com why don't the under the U.S constitution the president has the power in the case of a rebellion or an invasion to was suspend habeas corpus I due process I mean ... and just declare basically a state of national emergency\nBecause of an invasion I mean this is an invasion is it not well\nIt it sure feels like one when you have people waving the Honduran flag and crippling the barricades are you know between Guatemala and Mexico\nAnd looting ... looting grocery stores on their\nWay north I mean these are not people who were going to claiming to contribute anything to the U.S economy obviously they're criminals\nRight well many of them are and certainly entering illegally would be a crime and the president does have the authority under the Constitution's Claire that any aliens that he feels a would be a threat to the United states\nFrom anywhere can be barred entry just like with the travel ban it's the same um statutory basis as the travel ban\nAnd which of course has now been held up in court approved by the Supreme Court\nThough that's a and authority he has and that would be the basis for simply shutting down the places where these people will try to enter a and the president also has the authority in crisis two deputy by state and local law enforcement agencies and I have a feeling that Texas at least would be quite happy to\nUm help with its resources because they've been doing it for years now already at their own expense\nGot into a big ...\nBig Texas has been moving the national guard though I heard the lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick on another show earlier today saying that they were moving troops into position but I I mean I don't think that they have the same powers that are that are the regular army or the border patrol what have you know\nThat's right only the border patrol can make immigration arrests but we don't you don't actually want to make any arrests\nBut we want to keep them out and through Hungary we don't we don't want them to do something about suspending habeas corpus I mean that way you can keep the these these gang of immigration advocates lawyers\nYou know from a ... you know ... you're the one to address ... says the or the process is an old the appeals process isn't over until the alien wins and it's so true I mean we gotta keep 'em on the line we gotta keep 'em on the other side of the border\nYou know to prevent them from getting inside because once they're inside I mean they're going to be our responsibility for the next I God only knows how many generations will be paying for everything\nFor the rest of their lives in ours no question about it once once people get and it's game over I'm just and the problem is is this is what happened with the caravan in the spring is that most of them got in\nAnd I'm surprised it took so long for another one to form um so that's why we need really from and forceful measures now and we can explain it to the New York times
