McLean was warmer FBI agent lawyer is an attempt to influence the testimony of a congressional witness that is a felony and it is very interesting to me the FBI you can\nTurn the text messages and other things over to the White House\nIt is now incumbent\nUpon Don McGahn after\nThe after he's confirmed after is judge Kavanaugh is confirmed to refer the entire matter to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation including Mrs Ramirez myth sweat Nick\nAnd McLean the former FBI lawyer who try to influence the testimony this is this is remarkable these people are absolutely raised and what they did\nWas all part of a carry over from the attempt to frame Donald Trump right it is another part of this incredible conspiracy\nInvolving former and current Justice Department people to take down this president this is truly remarkable these people have got to be held accountable criminally\nWhy as you were ... laying it out you know you don't want this reminds me of a go at going way back you know wouldn't lefty Bacall derby had a murder incorporated was rounded up\nHe's like calling out hits on the witnesses against them from from the jail yes this is what they were ... there's an investigation already going on about how they try to fix the twenty sixteen election and the same crowd is trying to ... the guy who said couldn't keep out of the White House his pick for the Supreme Court\nIt's amazing the number three ... ...\n... ... ... remember the motivating force behind all of this when they set out to exonerate Hillary Clinton they thought she was going to win and all of this stuff was set in motion including the later activity after the election to frame the president\nAll of that was set in motion thinking that no one would ever find out and that they would be able to successfully framed the president and have Indian teach that is now over\nAnd as a result of that this was a follow up thing that somebody decided on the fact that David Law than the former de OJ guy who worked on the Hillary Clinton\nEspionage parts of that case was involved in this is a telling telling piece of information and all of those people are going to get subpoenas if the ... if if Rod Rosenstein and Jeff Sessions can't figure out what to do about this I I can assure you\nThat this this this president is going to be feared\nWhile they're going to be gone and the third at thirty one days if they can't figure it out but let me let me give you a little background on this guy David last month because it's still not that much out so far [laughter]\nDavid ... was in the ... the OJ department of justice national security division deputy assistant attorney general in charge of counter intelligence cyber security counter espionage and export controls\nHe was a he was a part of the small group who interviewed Hillary Clinton in July of twenty sixteen right before Khomeini came out during the email address the gay should she\nAbruptly resigned from his de OJ position on a Wednesday February seventh of this year without notice citing quote unquote personal reasons\nPersonal reasons now he's now we have reached surfaces as the attorney\nFor the FBI the former FBI agent who may have draft to actually drafted the letter that Christine Blasey Ford said to the congresswoman from Palo Alto and and Senator Feinstein and then attempted to pressure her best friend\nTo change your story about not remembering the party it's pretty amazing\nPets it's stunning and in fact I think what what Susan Collins did today on the floor of the Senate set this up beautifully for an investigation because she'd legitimize the attack\nOn the Democrats in a way that no other senator could have the way she described they're outrageous conduct their duplicitous conduct has set up a perfect situation for the Justice Department to begin an investigation into Ramirez sweat\nAnd McLean the former ... agent who was a doctor for best friend this is an amazing set of circumstances the grades and that of the manner in which these people try to do to judge Kavanaugh\nExactly what they were trying to do the president of the United states can you imagine the kind of balloons does it takes to do that the Eiffel were absolutely certain that they were going to succeed\nI I Would be a you know what if I if I were under the gun on a you know even you know even though they were ... the FBI the D. OJ ... large elements of those organizations are trying to slow walk the investigation\nThe fact that this was all coming out in the press what we had done what we are our outfit had tried to do in two thousand sixteen [laughter]\nBasically uh you know committing perjury obstructing justice or lying to the Pfizer courts are violating people's civil rights I ...
