shorts Halloween so I Want to we wanted to go a little more Whitey stuff that I Will do other stuff obviously as well and uh but I but I Do want to read that there are more Whitey a stories to to share with you today and\nI'm going to tell you a Halloween story from from Whitey Bolger was this was probably about\nI don't know how close the thirty year maybe more than Thirty years ago now was in the Nineteen eighties\nThey were burying bodies at a at at this house I think it was on the east third straight\nAnd I was ... it was owned by one of the brothers of a gang member and they the the brother didn't know that they were burying the bodies in the house but they but they were in the basement and so\nHe decided to sell the house so this is when the Whitey and Steve you were making like a million bucks when a Jo Marie would bring in a load of marijuana boatload of marijuana at the Boston Harbor\nSo\nThey are so this guy decides to sell the house and instead of instead of the spring and for like probably a hundred thousand two hundred thousand maybe I don't pops three hundred thousand to buy the house even though they got even though their role in cash they say no we're not going to spend the money we don't need that house\nSo they they said we're going to dig up the bodies and move the bodies Allen Street for the the parking lot it's not a parking lot anymore but it used to be a parking lot across the street from my Florian hall\nAnd so they told a Kevin Weeks and pat needed they got they got the bodies and you know what you know how Bones Are you know after a while you know change when you think of chicken bones or something you know you've got all these little bones that come apart to say I hate to say I hate to be so\nWant but it's it's the same with human bones you got all these little balls they fall apart up a little bones in your ear to I don't know where they're just all over the place but anyway they so they they make a week's and are in need they got these bodies and they're having to sift through the\nDirt what can through looking for the little bones to make sure they get all the bones before they moved the bodies so they they they got all the ... they dig up to three bodies and they put them in bags and then they tell me to get lost 'cause they don't trust me they think you either that they don't want 'em knowing where the bodies are\nSo white he's already got big hole that they're going to bury a man down on ... street in Dorchester and so he goes they go down there\nAnd it's dark and it's Halloween and so they give they give Kevin Weeks AKA Kevin squeaks AKA two weeks at a machine gun and they say you ... your stand here and guard that make sure nothing happens while we're ah we're\nRe entering these bones of our victims\nAnd so this guy pulls up in a car you know the you know Halloween everybody's going to parties right to drink and everything it's night time so this guy pulls up and he's just got to take a leak so he he gets out of the car and they all fall to the ground and you know Whitey and Steve you were in the hall and or weeks\nIs up closer to the street and the guy comes it gets out of his car relieves himself and it gets back in the car and drives away Whitey jumps up after the guys gone and runs to weeks wraps the gun starts yelling at\nWhy didn't you show them we had plenty of blame it not

yet she doesn't seem to know anything that's going on around her ... have you noticed that\n[noise] I honestly I I couldn't believe she said she didn't know that story had been out for over a day usually can't pay I think is supposed to be on top of the things that looked at the Washington Post story about two weeks\nThat said she got a extensive staff it's working on a presidential and the fact that they would overlook that seems to be\nPretty uh unbelievable and so either they didn't tell her that they were fundraising and she honestly didn't know\nThat her campaign was acting illegally or she did know and she clearly didn't want to talk about it and does it look into it we haven't heard today if she's looked into it but uh it seems that it's a serious charge I mean first of all just to get back to this what people may not know is that she put out an email\nAsking for funds to be center while she decided on what she was going to do as far as voting for or against justice cabin on his confirmation hearing it illegal to solicit funds\nWhen you know in association with a vote that's basically pay to play it in its worst and here she was asking for money and

know how it's funny you say that we didn't get into stocks but I wanted to mention it during one of the debates just couldn't couldn't work it in there that uh the day after Donald Trump was elected she upped her holdings in the\nStock market by a hundred thousand of what I thought that was pretty honest kind of bullish on Donald Trump the guy she age when she puts more money into the stock market a but do we actually even\nIn my ... year she didn't believe her own favorite newspaper the Boston Globe which said the markets were going to crash of Donald Trump was elected price or at least she was smart enough to disregard the financial advice of the Boston Globe\n... I was diagnosed with you I was glad that you brought up Linda SARS or and I think a lot of people still forgotten this woman they only see her occasionally she appears at these rallies and\nTalks about the you know we've got to a overcome Islamophobia and all this but why don't you tell people this this woman that appears at these rallies with a Elizabeth Warren what she's all about\nReligious or store is somebody who um you know comes from the middle east is I'm\nA believer a firm believer in ... which as I think many people know really subjugate swimming in a way that I don't think even Elizabeth Warren would say is right but for some reason she ... marches arm in arm with her at rallies or especially the one at the cabinet or in a anti Kevin ...\nBut a liquor store is probably one of the most noted anti Semite\nIn the United states she's anti American and here's Elizabeth Warren a\nHappily sharing a microphone with her against Kavanaugh was just a few weeks ago um and she won't even acknowledge that she herself is aligned yourself with somebody who does not have American interests at heart and so I think you know with Elizabeth Warren it's so hypocritical she talks about\nUm the evils of the president and anybody associated with him and meanwhile she has courted with people that you know I don't think we normally we would want to associate themselves with and and at the same time and it was a discussion of civility is out there as well and you know Senator Warren has talked about you know having\nScience a scientist or whatever doctors cut open you know a Republican body she's talked about how Republicans want blood from the American people and they're trying to fix health care so you know getting a senator wind up what she does does what she says who she associates with very questionable but she doesn't want to balance that these debates\n... let's go back to shore real law for a moment doesn't it make a homosexuality a capital crime um you could be executed in countries that have ... gauging the homosexual activity\nI Believe I Believe that you can also of your ... for shoplifting to how does how does she says the among the a drop in your hand off for shoplifting or a part of a surreal law\nWell look she through due process and presumption of innocence out the window with Brett Kavanaugh so I suppose civil rights for her optional I mean I I I guess it must be the new philosophy for the Democrat or progressive wing of the Democratic party\nYou know did did you see how she will you obviously saw it I mean I can can you believe how she she couldn't even answer the question you know you think she would be able to like a Bill Clinton tap dance around there when she gets called out on this uh this report of an ethics violation\nBut she just does the ... she can't she she can't even put together a coherent\nSentence let's listen a let's listen to the cuts you got it there they've let's listen to ...\nOkay I Want the cut of uh her uh her talking about\nThe um uh about uh the uh ...\nYeah the ... cut cut cut\nCut and one of the thing that really we found out recently I think it's pretty unconscionable and the fact that Senator Warren\nWas fundraising illegally using the vote on Kavanaugh the confirmation vote to try to raise money for her campaign that just came out\nYou know that's something that you cannot be dealing first of all when we're having a national discussion about the Supreme Court is trying to find ways off it but you did and it turns out it's illegal\nSteps can I say no go ahead please\nYeah question here I I hear Mr tales a statement about how wrong it was the way that Dr foreign was treated but I don't remember Mr Dale speaking up when Donald Trump made fun of her [laughter]\nI don't remember Mr deal speaking out pointing Republican support actually ... nomination I I may have just missed it but I I don't\nRemember I you know that's because they're in a while and I don't look for every opportunity to try to grandstand now anyone call you responding to the mayor some herbal some real making a pretty negative statement this last week but the fact of the matter is\nThat was such an intense moment in our country's history as far as trying to deal\nWith presumption of innocence the cornerstone of our legal system and you were willing to throw it right out the window because you were part of the Senate Democrats who are trying to score political points by using poor Dr forward testimony as a way to drag down man without any corroborating evidence ...\nYou know I don't think I quite understand the answer\nSo she did but then what happens is the uh I guess it's a ... ad Harding says what about those these ... these charges against you and then she starts doing the ... I like the way she calls to the ... through the nomination\nThey they had a vote on it it's a vote that's called for by the constitution the constitution doesn't say the Senate show ram ride through the press ... I mean this is ridiculous it's you're right we all rhetoric ...\nYeah it was seven FBI or you know investigations into the nominee meanwhile you know healthcare Affordable Care act was ran right a truly nobody even reading the bill before they uh they passed it it's a lot I mean you know really hurt\nHer perspective of history and what happens on and on Capitol Hill is pretty selective when it comes to what Democrats and Republicans do I think a lot of people got you know judge justice Kevin ... over the weeks at the hearings that's a lot of bologna but of course she was trying to divert away from the fact that she you know potentially has a broken the law\nYou know I I think we uh we see from these debates why would she set up our wrote the legislation setting up the consumer finance protection board the senators didn't want her to take it over they got to know or a little better and uh they didn't want anything to do with her and I now I think the ... Massachusetts are learning the same thing\nYeah how it is that they were on that real quick isn't the first debate I brought up the fact that you know she's so anti lobbyist I mean if you listen to her rant about lobbyists you'd think that you know they're they're\nRadioactive the fact of the matter is she met with forty seven lobbyist when they were setting up the consumer financial Protection Bureau and she ended up hiring one of them to run the thing so I mean here's this person said one thing going another natural is both went to a tea\nYes a and All right Jeff we'll be speaking to you before the election thank you for a ... thanks for us going on or speaking with us here on the highway car show yet that's represents\nF deal aid for four or five hundred forty to forty two um how are\nYou going to go if you don't know they will link for dinner\nOr a car is half hours brought you buy a new book from a Massachusetts native electrician from Walter ... addict blowing up Irish Catholic at Nineteen seventies blue collar Boston electrician now an Amazon dot com also available at\nRead the electrician thought\nLet's be honest here last is not one of life's more enjoyable experience it's it makes you self conscious erodes your confidence in causes you to wait ... years of your life trying to hide camouflage and generally obsess over the condition in short it pretty much socks\nUntil you called these defined O'Hare respiration and they completely turned your wife around with a high GPA procedure whether you were looking to fill in your hairline a reverse years of your last doctor Chris sinus and his team at least the final hair respiration will create a result\nThere will be a transformative experience the result of my I G the procedure was quite remarkable I now have for Ficre here\nSo I could even where it a bit longer with the peace the final difference\nBalding hair loss are now optional no matter where you are in New England\nPresident Trump in the house ways and Means Committee says they promised the effort for the new tax rate will begin in earnest next year when the new Congress begins provided a GOP keeps the house they say it's part of a plan to allow Americans to keep more of their hard earned money let's check traffic now Dave Guard\nA lot of volume on the pike west about between often writing an after one twenty eight they're also some company as well on star would drive in and out of ... ... you got to stop and go on the expressway southbound between the O'Neill Tunnel and the brain ... split and this report is sponsored\nBy a rocket mortgage by Quicken Loans rocket mortgage is simple so you can understand the details I make sure you are getting the right mortgage apply simply understand fully\nMortgage confidently and go to rocket mortgage dot com today license and all fifty states equal housing lender and MLS number thirty thirty\nAnd unsettled and the next few days my jealous now with the devil ... forecasts\nFor tonight varying amounts of clouds below temperatures around fifty two tomorrow a cloudy day some light rain from time to time high temperatures near fifty eight and friday wet again rain in the morning scattered thunderstorms during the afternoon blustery with a high temperature sixty sixty five degrees it's\nFifty three degrees in Boston I'm ... years\nQuestions three ... three games in Boston bulldozed\n... men who think their women\nBeing able to go into public bathrooms restroom showers\nI say hell no a lizard bits Warren says you oppose it it's hate who's right who's wrong we'll discuss it tomorrow on the corner reports lunar a fourth weekdays knew the free on the voice of authentic Italy you are ...\nIs your financial advisor having trouble answering questions on how the new tax us will affect you\nGood news the partners of the financial are hosting an educational dinner event on Thursday November first from six to nine PM at straight prime and will burn join them for a complementary three course dinner 'cause they educate you and the new tax law changes now they might impact your financial situation coal eight hundred to two seven Seventy seven Seventy seven now to register\nDoes your financial planning attacks minimization strategy it should your old investment strategy cost you more in taxes under the new laws\nIt's time to find out so join S.
