all in agreement that someone was going to record the president however what happened was Trump a ... once\nIt became apparent that sessions wanted\nCombing remove a and that it was necessary that it be done and the president wanted totally removed as you know Rosenstein wrote a memorandum right recommending that told me be removed the president fired called me right now\nHere's what happened as a result of that firing McCain and others\nWho were discussing taping the president in order to remove him from office got furious because they were not informed that combing was going to be fired\nAnd

of size that information raw intelligence that are too on masks people so\nAnd that's when that's where they live in the ... move the transition team out of Trump Tower down to the golf club or New Jersey\nThe very next day after he met with Rogers he moved it now here's here's something else this is really fascinating the committee has also been told that missed\nThis is great stuff Ash Carter remember Ash Carter is that he is the secretarial\nMen's wider nobody ride he was from it I see I Believe yes\nAsh Ash Carter and and James Clapper went to the president when they found out that

but I still have all these guys are\nAll man this is this gets better Brock Obama is no dummy he said it ain't gonna happen we're not firing Rogers he's gonna retire soon if we fire him now the whole

is part of the day is they did what is the head\nThey did what they know let's say you're never going to do with the five of the court does but here's what they did Rosemary Collyer wrote that very famous opinion on October the twenty six\nExcuse me April twenty six two thousand seventeenth remember this is after the election the president's been inaugurated right Rogers has gone to see the

Sessions is not going to be able\nTo cover this up what happens if the Democrats regain control of the house though\nWell that's where the president's replacement of sessions and Rosenstein becomes absolutely central\nHowever I think Chuck Grassley a and and now I'm Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham is Doug in\nI think he will take over the investigation from the house in the in the Senate Judiciary committee and God help the people in the Justice Department if if if Lindsey Graham takes over this investigation which he will if the if the if the Republicans lose the house everything will be

because his case gets bigger is better every week\nHow long does Rosenstein last after the election\nI wouldn't think it'd be too long I think the president's trolling them I mean he's just playing with him he's keeping them around until after mother's done because he knows\nThat that Rosenstein controls smaller and will control the report that Mueller issues such as it is I mean you can't write a report to the public he doesn't have the legal authority to do it he can send Rosenstein a memo is finding and Congress has not entitled to that record because it's all grand jury is Dario\n... how
