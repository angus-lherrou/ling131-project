it's official a chief sprinting ... liar wall so now says she's all in for twenty twenty\nSo she's taking you the voters for granted will this blow up interface or the moon bats gonna love her even more Ross in Boston Europe first thanks for holding and welcome\nFirst of all there is no question she's taken for granted and she knows that they are the majority of voters in Massachusetts a steps for the Democratic party unless they put up a horrible candidate\nThey always when now basically the thing that I like about this in the man that she does get reelected for what guarantees Trump's reelection the Democratic party the nomination so this horrible woman\nBut nope set out the whatsoever and surely does not add face there'd be running for president so she stopped concern\nBesides whatever the motive of Massachusetts do\nA rush thank you very much for that call look if they want to run the chief judge of Donald Trump I Will take that a hundred times out of a hundred times there's no way Trump loses so first of\nShe's going to have a ... campaign in a fight on our hands against Jeff deal my understanding is they've got the TV ads caught and they're going to start airing them so don't count your chickens\nIt was before they've hatched chief you've got an election to worry about but let's talk twenty twenty for two seconds you put a lizard with Warren that kind of a radical left wing nuts up against President Trump with her for being a phoney and being a phoney senator\nIn the heartland they will laugh in her face Fran in Burlington Europe next go ahead friend\nHi Jeff ... you for taking my call my pleasure\nUnfortunately Warren is our center so I'm hoping that deal or to states her I'll tell you though a lot of women a lotta my friends on\nOur for our supporting watering for whatever reason you know the elitist that think well she represents them 'cause she dressed as well and she slim and all of that but I think if the issues come out\nThat would crucify her the other thing I wanted to talk about that I really want to talk about is recovered memory now that therapists lives in California where one of my daughters actually live and\nAnd very close to the beach that she mentioned is very close to where my daughter is in any of that recovered memory is not actual memory that's when the therapist leads to a patient\nAnd sometimes they even put them under hypnosis [noise] so I mean she did pass the on that test that lie detector test but they also use that in this whole recovered memory practice it's almost like witchcraft and I know when you say that word it sounds like\nI'm an alarmist but I'm actually not because it's all like you know you go into hip hypnosis\nAnd the therapist lead you in a way they use the lie detector test is that's how they sort of training that the person um you know it's like um Skinner reward\nAnd denial so when they say something correct then of course they're rewarded but it's definitely lead it's not actual you know and I don't understand I tried so happy you're talking to me\nBecause I've tried to contact somebody to find out why are they not looking into this whole recovered memory\nAnd the fact that she has no details is because it never come out so well I disagree that they're saying oh she's traumatize she may have been traumatized some staying at some point but who knows whether it was this\nYou know some kind of the sexual encounter\nUm with somebody else or what but recovered memory is no actual memory it's led it's developed um\nAnd I live in the friend or not I I think you're onto something I really do that and thank you for the call look I think there were two questions to ask that no one's asked why will she not release the notes from her therapist\nShe will not handed over to the committee as far as I understand she doesn't want to hand it over to the FBI so what are you hiding\nAnd furthermore now it's come out about that polygraph test number they kept going on with your boss the polygraph test and then we find out it was either the day of the day after or grandmother died and it was done at the uh BWI the Baltimore Washington international airport at the actual airport well guess what\nMember I told you how the therapist is now said she alleged that the attempted assault took place in the maid Nineteen eighties not the early Nineteen eighties\nSo it didn't occur when she was Fifteen but she said to a therapist when she was Eighteen or Nineteen\nWell in the polygraph test she wasn't able to pass it when she said early Nineteen eighties sold they scratched out early Nineteen eighties and said in the Nineteen eighties any time\nDid you ever suffer from an attempted sexual assault or whatever that's when she said yes\nSo I Want to see the therapists notes\nBecause she's why ink she's obviously lying\nAnd furthermore she didn't just log in her statement or in our interview she lied under oath to the committee\nThis woman needs to go to jail her lawyers need to be disbarred and they need to go to jail Dianne Feinstein frankly who set this whole thing up and leave the story she needs to go to jail in other words this entire coordinated smear campaign needs to be exposed\nAnd that's why what I've done now for the last three hours\nI've laid out all of the holes all of the lies all of the inconsistencies all of the contradictions everything that the mainstream media doesn't want to call her because it's one big con job Cavanaugh is a hundred percent innocent\nThey have made the whole thing off\nOkay my friends I

Massachusetts Army National guard feared by the Massachusetts broadcasters\nAssociation at this station\nWell I finally did it I opened a four O. one K. want why just wait for the inherited we

council\nVoice of Boston New York about one other point seven to UCLA HP to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] ...\nGood afternoon ... news the expansion will allow investigators to interview anyone who may need to answer questions on her one condition\nBut sometimes we all don't get it on the first try and been named Richard but that's good because it gets in the fact that he's a stolen valor senator claimed to have been in Vietnam but never was\nBut it it's got a I mean as long as his first name is Richard we might as well make it a literate right Ben main deck I daresay the next time\nBut the the president mentions a senator Blumenthal he will he will added his remarks and make the ... and every reporter and the press corps will go wise he's calling him denying that without all about\nHe is that is that is that racist [laughter]\nYeah you know and and again I think I think Trump should also point out too and and you know he ... he just keeps saying you know they they finally had to admit it fun day it was so bad this lying and ... and it was so\nWidespread he did it everywhere he went in Connecticut talking about coming back from Vietnam and being spat upon\nBut finally he was called out by the New York times the New York bleeping times\nThat's that's how bad does it have to be for the New York times to call somebody out anyway\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two for one three says it's time for the FBI to reopen the Hillary investigation yeah that'll be the day remember Trump's Trump's that I decided to move on and wasn't good for the country may maybe he should reconsider that as well\nBut anyway this this is really outrageous what's going on now with a Brett Kavanaugh I mean it you know once he's on the court\nIf he gets on the court I ... I Hope he gets on the court I'm not sure even now but once he gets on the court or if he gets on the court this will seem more\nLike a like a botched joke by the Democrats it's just so outrageous what's going on here they it's it's like the Russia investigation everybody knows I busted joke\n[laughter] the\nThe Russia investigation one was the last time they actually mentioned Russia it's been a long time hasn't it I'm not even sure what the may major allegations talking points et cetera are in the Russian investigation anymore and even though the Brett Kavanaugh\nSo called investigation is only been going on for a month or a couple of months I mean they've already moved away from the initial allegations again where I mean we're not talking seriously anymore\nAbout attacks on a on\nChristine Blasey Ford or any other woman now the allegation is\nHe's a he's a heavier drinkers then he said that he didn't actually\nHe shouldn't be brought up on charges of lying under oath to the Senate Judiciary committee because he said he liked the beer\nWhen actually he loves beer and eat a little eddies and he's not the way he he's he doesn't just get sleepy when he drinks he fought he passes out you'll notice he said he got sleeping when he drank mean again\nYou know human being right that's the that's the the fact of alcohol a depressant on a human being\nIt depresses yield you get sleepy you fall asleep eventually if you drink enough\nEven Ted Kennedy\nEven Ted Kennedy\nThat's why he needed to do other things other than gray so that he could stay awake to drink\nMore with Ted Kennedy would think about this ongoing attempt to to have prohibition of straws wouldn't require him to have new new ... new twenty dollar bills in his possession at all times anyway\nThis is how outrageous it got though this this weekend the u._s._a. today never great newspaper\nBut it was it was somewhat respectable and it's a day now it's just as bad as the New York daily news I mean that there's not even the ... there's never the New York times as bad as it is might occasionally break a story\nThe the Washington Post did good work on the ... a rape case back in the day but what his USA Today ever done\nIn terms of\nAny kind of journalism I mean breaking stole it important news stories it's never done anything\nIt just comes to your when you're when you're at a merry odd hotel or Hyatt hotel on a business trip and you wake up in the morning and you go outside to go down to the continental breakfast and you trip over the paper that has been left for free outside your door that's that's USA Today\nAnd it used to be that they had later scores than the national newspapers but that doesn't but now that you have a cell phone\n... what does it matter if they have later scores of the if they have the west coast games in the in the final additions and I don't even think they have the I don't even like they have all of us have the final a final west coast games or the Monday Night football score\nBut anyway over the weekend they have a they have a sports columnist named Eric Brady that's Eric with a K this is what he wrote\nYeah I mean ... how\nLow can these people go I Want you to think about this before I read this to you\nThe U.S Senate may yet confirmed Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court but he should stay off basketball courts for now when kids are around\nThe nation is deeply divided sometimes would feel I feel like we don't agree on anything anymore but credibly accused sex offenders should not coach youth basketball girls or boys without deeper investigation can't we all agree on that\nHow how twisted you have to be the right that and and and how\nHow the brave do his editors have to be to let that run credibly accused\n\nThere's there's there's no one supporting any of these stories\n\nBut the Yale expose exposure story the New York times wouldn't touch that story they said they couldn't they they interviewed dozens of people no one no one back that up the gang rape story that was put out by the creepy more and more yeah that's even more preposterous\n\nThis is Mollie Hemingway and the federal is the article which was illustrated with a picture of Kavanaugh and one of the girls basketball team see coaches has since been dramatically revised\nApparently editors at USA Today belatedly realized that calling a human being a pedophile with perhaps precisely zero actual evidence of any sexual propriety was indefensible\nBut this is what this is what they're up against you you know\nRussia's said this before and I think he's right but the the sports media\nIs even more detached from reality than the the political press corps\nYou know at at least a few not an effort declining percentage of people on in the uh Washington press corps have actually covered the real world you know they've actually been outside the beltway\nBut the sports media it's it's all jocks ... and ah and licks peddling and a sucking up the athletes and ah ended and they they want to be PC they ... they want to want do you think LeBron James is impressed with this\nYeah I I don't something tells me he's not\nWho who maybe Colin Kaepernick\nBut as we as we non now no I mean what is this the ... Smith said he doesn't even think Colin Kaepernick wants to come back to football anymore 'cause you making too much money as a spokesman for Nike\nWho's who's impressed with this credibly accused he calls Brett Kavanaugh credibly accused sex offender\nWhat do you have to do to get to get Sean\nBy by respectable people and if either credible accusations and what are incredible accusations\nYeah ... I mean really what [laughter]\nYeah what is it what is a what would you not believe if they let me put it this way Eric Brady do you believe Juanita Broderick\nDo you believe Paula Jones you believe Kathleen Willie you believe any or do you believe or the or a Monaghan woman out in Minnesota who says Keith Ellison attacked her do you believe those are ... there was a teenage prostitutes in the ...\nThe Senate majority leader down the FBI's cabinet on destination will be enough for Democrats get afternoon ... news Mitch McConnell spoke on the Senate floor in the past our predicting democratic criticism of the reviews sexual misconduct allegations against the Supreme Court nominee\nUnless I'm careful and Mr President you can practically hear the south of the Democrats moving the goalpost\nMcConnell also said the confirmation process is moving forward stretch traffic now with Dave Guard and\nVery slow on the expressway south from the O'Neill tunneled out past south Baghdad delayed after Columbia road and slow again for granted to brain three Ninety three nor there's heavy from this come up to Roosevelt circle you stop and go again from one twenty five past river road ... bridge south down his top end of the tunnel there\nAnd started driving you spent almost back to ... that they're supported sponsored by rocket mortgage by Quicken Loans rocket mortgages simple she can understand the details and make sure you're getting the right mortgage apply simply understand fully mortgage confidently go to rocket mortgage dot com today licensed it all fifty states equal housing lender and in my last number thirty thirty\nAnd rain is on the way my youngest now with the devil ...\nTonight light rain likely at times are low temperature around fifty seven tomorrow a few scattered showers in the mornings will develop into a steadier led rain in the afternoon highs near sixty one then Wednesday clouds this dark then graduate clearing ice between sixty five and seven to eight\nFifty degrees in Boston I'm In ... news\n... news radio pins are protesters three Republican Senator Jeff flake during his appearance at Forbes\nThirty under thirty summit in Boston for the second time in less than two years General Electric has a change in the corner office board member at Harvard Business school lecture H.

well\nOh okay and then I was wondering what the business was hit with a business what\nNo I I don't know what the ... well no I agree that I heard\nWas that they were renting the unit out\nSo it was like a they made it into a mother in law was yeah it was only they didn't you you know you need you need to have a license to turn a permit from the city to turn it into a new place\nThe theory that I heard was that in that area it was very there are a lot of people who are renting out because I Know its Palo Alto exactly you know real estate's through the roof right and so they they put in the second door when they built in the other apartment there's a ... numerous people who have listed as their address\nAnd then at some point in two thousand twelve they put like a fence or a wall up because the they were doing inspections they had like a poll also had an ally so flag places that looked like they might be a illegally renting\nI Gotcha okay yeah I don't know what the story is

harassment there could be other things as well but we think though at least a large percentage of it was for sexual harassment right go ahead\nWell he he wrote me back he didn't actually give me any names which would I wouldn't really want it but in his letter to me he not only admitted that fun exists but then I guess sham and I'm congressman just sat does have a bill\nIn Congress right now trying to get it removed and she also said that the victims of this abuse victims so if you're a woman it got sexually harassed they're required to go to therapy for thirty days before that can even file against the guy\nRight right and you only have I have a certain level you only have a certain number of months to was to actually\nFile and then and they don't call it a complaint you you actually call it a request for therapy\nAnd then that's when they decide to give you the money so so you could never go back and say uh you know I Want a lawsuit I it's just I got some money because I was in therapy\nIn Congress by the way they can ... the Republican who he I didn't know a vial that legislation with congressman Santas but congressman dissent this is the Republican from Florida
