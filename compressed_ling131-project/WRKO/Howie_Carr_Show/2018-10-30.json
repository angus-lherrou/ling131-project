killed by Bulger's gang and Nineteen eighty two and\nThat Rosenstein said if you went Barris the deep state by releasing the a ... a warrant applications in showing the we committed crimes and abusive to get this war and then uh that than the uh the special counsel Robert Mueller is going to claim but that's obstruction even though\nThere is not the investigation that he's conducting is investigation of crimes that didn't exist they would still claim he was obstructing the investigation of nothing is it\nCould this possibly be true Joe\nThat is exactly what happened I can tell you on authority for members of Congress that I've spoken with that that is\nPrecisely what happened I Want you to go back and remember this is this just relating back to what happened in New York after the election\nRemember when president elect Trump was briefed by the intelligence community ah right after he was elected and then they all agree that they would all leave the room and James Comey would give him a special briefing and that's the way home they told him about the salacious details in the ... right about the hotel in Moscow\nThat was a decision made by all the heads of the intelligence community that Komen was going to go in there and basically shake down the president and extort him into shutting up what Rod Rosenstein did the other day is exactly the same thing he started the president of the United states is backing down\nFrom de classification by telling him in essence if you take if you order this the classification now I can guarantee you\nAt the end and this is the way Rosenstein would do it because he's such a sleaze ball\nMr President I wouldn't recommend this but I Know that Mr Mahler is going to say that by de classifying you obstructed his investigation and he will include that in some report about what you should be impeached for that is precisely what happened I was told that by\nA member of the committee that her testimony or not about this specific thing what about other things but this is what I've been told by people who are familiar with the back off on the on the decision to\nDeclassify the documents for they don't but I don't know I'd special ... what\nReally bothers me about this is how can you obstruct an investigation of a crime but didn't occur\nWhat you can't you can't and and and in fact what's going on here is\nThe president has been given advice on by people around him look don't push the envelope there's this thing is over\nDon't cause the stink these things will be declassified later or it's not going to have any impact on the election don't get yourself and unnecessary trouble here just just wait wait Mr President and the hunting by giving this the Mike Michael Horowitz the inspector general and say he can they classify these things\nWhile he's invest the guys they investigating the abuses of the Pfizer warrant this is this is an amazing scenario that you were watching and if it weren't for everything else going on in the world\nThe horrible things that happen in Pittsburgh and the the nutty non bomber and the elections this would be gigantic but lucky Rod Rosenstein and lucky Bob Mueller the best things that's happened recently is some people are\nTrying to do do bad things to mother I don't think any of it is true but mother's trying to make himself look like a victim for\n... but but I mean this is outrageous to try to shake down a president of the United states especially for what he didn't do\nIt it it worked remember it worked they shut down once before and if it hadn't been for Admiral Mike Rogers who went and visited him in the tower on November Seventeen and said by the way all that stuff you were told by Khomeini and all those people it's all the result of illegal activity\nThe FBI and some contractors remember remember this is really important on November the seventeenth Mike Rogers the head of an essay went to visit the president without the knowledge of anybody in the administration including the president of the United states for Iraq Obama and told him that his campaign had been spied upon\nEat and told him by the way that there was an agent inside the campaign at that very moment\nThat it was someone who was in the offices who was in fact an informant for the FBI we now know who that person was by the way\nThey want and it's been discovered ... uh I\nHave to be very careful here because even though it's not a crime to do with this person was doing if they were asked to do so by the FBI it is so significantly embarrassing\nThat uh before I can from it I can tell you this it's someone that everybody listening would know\nThat he would not be unknown to the American people\nIs he is he in in any kind of leader and you know for me for all the special counsel is\nAre oh let me just tell you I don't think he's in criminal legal jeopardy because he was acting under authority of the FBI and combing but here's but here's his jeopardy it's the Carter page lawsuit that can make him a very poor man\nYou know I Begin to see as I as I see this thing on on unraveling before my very eyes and everybody else does I Begin to see more about what you're saying about the Carter page lawsuit appears to be a a\n... a a a more likely way that we are going to get to the bottom of this than than certainly the inspector general's report who's I mean he's he's ... he's moving lower than cold molasses jumped agenda as well\nYeah well he's purposely trying to avoid doing anything before the election I mean and and I have you know I I you know I think Michael are which is a nice guy and all that and I'm sure he's not a partisan but when he decided\nThat he could not conclude that a ... at that prosecution decisions were influenced by the bias of the FBI agents that none of the uh the OJ lawyers were influenced by that I said that's bull BS excuse me I almost did a bad thing\nThat's total BS that was a punt on his part to protect people so I I'm not sure that Michael Horowitz is as independent as he might look in the sense that I think you know he he may have stayed too long at the fair or inside\nThe parents think Joe ... Joe do you think that the Donald Trump crush Rosen steam or not\nOf course not oh God no this is all of this is all it is this is all an act the president is is trolling Rosenstein he's trolling him he's trying to make it look is using Rosenstein because he wants he wants to get the lowest thing over with I have no idea when the ... thing is going to end but it's it's fairly obvious\nThat this whole exercise by Mueller has been an absolute joke\nIt's a ... you know within and I know I I don't mean that I like the spirit the theorists but it it looks like it's less of an investigation and more of an attempt to cover up I mean this gives them a ... to hold over the president's head to prevent him from getting the bottom of this\nWell no the ... and the reason all of your instincts are correct tally is just look at it Rod Rosenstein signed the last extension of the Pfizer weren't on Carter Page he signed the memo recommending that combing the fire\nHe appoints Muller the day after Mueller is interview to the FBI Director and he doesn't get it I mean when you go back and you look at the history of how all this started it is not a conspiratorial crazy idea the truth is\nThat is if I'm a former United States attorney I look at that I look at these facts in a in a crescendo of criminology\nAnd there's only one conclusion this was an effort to the post the president of the United states\nTo overthrow his presidency and the fact that a guy like Rod Rosenstein six they're temporarily protected\nIt's like something out of bringing Shakespeare it's unbelievable the guy the guy in the sub he's a legal sub any any any France's any steps around and there's that moron\nSessions over there who can't do anything right he can't get a ... sentence out of his mouth without stumbling like Mr ... I mean it is unbelievable what's going on here your instincts are all one hundred percent correct this was a cabal\nThis was a criminal conspiracy Rosenstein in the middle of it and I you know what it makes me want to pull my hair I feel like picking up the phone and say\nDonald for God's sakes give me a hammer let me get get get into it right\nI I learned a lot from Whitey Bolger and Stevie for me Joe diGenova but all they want to do was take over Boston in Massachusetts they didn't want to take over the whole United States of America yeah yeah\nAnd pronounced dead at a federal prison in West Virginia he had just been moved there from a prison in Florida and transfer facility in Oklahoma City the globe reports that sources say an inmate with mafia connections is under investigation for Bulger's debt let's check traffic now with Dave\nGuard stop and go on Ninety three north bound from the ... come up through Medford again slower from one twenty five up to a crash before one thirty the pike westbound slow from Austin brightened pass noon corner and again from sixteen to west and the report is sponsored by Bob Evans refrigerated side\nMake mealtime easy and delicious with Bob Evans side dishes like mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese they're made with real milk butter cheese and potatoes and are ready in the microwave and six minutes try Bob Evans sides from your grocery store it will be love at first by staying\nMild but the showers return Mike Ellis now with the devil ... forecast\nFor tonight will enjoy a generally clears guy across the area of low temperatures near thirty six mostly sunny skies for tomorrow or Wednesday high fifty eight breezy and milder and it's a Thursday rather cloudy some occasional showers mainly in the afternoon eyes Thursday near fifty nine it's\nForty seven degrees in Boston I'm ... years\nDeal versus focus haunt is the final around\nNoon needs Boston's bulldoze\nIt was the third and final debate between the chief and Jeff deal who won who lost and the deal do enough to close the gap and windy elections Kona reports weekdays new to three on the voice of authentic at all you are ...\nHey it's the corner man we're very fortunate to be living in the home of the free because of the brave as we have in the past W.

R. K. oh boy so often\nLove them Matthews brothers [noise]\nPaid for for five hundred forty to forty two is as you know a President Trump has said in a couple of interviews over the last twenty four hours\nThat he plans to sign an executive order ending birthright citizenship that's when the two was to aliens illegal or legal come into the country and they drop a baby\nThe baby becomes an anchor baby and ah you'd say he makes the entire family are eligible for welfare it's what it boils down to\nIt's a real ski um you have a vacations or are planned by various groups from a China from turkey from India\nThey come over the women are eight months pregnant they give birth and uh they they have a a citizen Koreans there was well all kinds of different nationalities and it's it's just a major major scam\nSo joining us on the line to talk about the\nBirthright citizenship is Jessica Vaughan from the citizens ... says Center for Immigration Studies Jessica thanks for being with us here on the highway car show good to talk with you\nSo is there going to be a problem here uh you know I think Paul Ryan the outgoing house speaker is claiming but he doesn't think that President Trump has the right to uh do away with birthright citizenship on an executive order what the what are your thoughts on that\nOh Paul Ryan the constitutional scholar [laughter] it's just a point\nThere has been basically a bar still discussion among you know immigration wrong for\nPractically the whole twenty five or so years that I've been involved in this issue you know Ken anything be done about does the constitution really the fourteenth amendment really require us to offer citizenship to children of illegal aliens because there's this trade there that nobody really understand the meaning that says\n... ... it's birthright citizenship you alien\nSubject to the jurisdiction\nOf the United states and everybody to page what this really means and how it could be changed if possible no one knows what the president is doing is he's going to\nJump start real action on this to get clarification and we can find out if it can be done or not and many people believe that\nThe constant the fourteenth amendment has been misinterpreted require us to issue birth certificates passports to not only illegal aliens but\nChildren of first tourists\nAnd anyone born on our soil and I think it's a great idea to get this going create a case of course you know if he writes an executive order on that there's going to be an immediate lawsuit right and then it'll go before the court and they can decide\nYou're just like there was a ... law suit on the ... of these so called the Muslim ban which were really wasn't a Muslim ban but the you know ultimately I didn't take all that long for the Supreme Court to uphold to uphold his right to to issue that travel ban right\nThat didn't exactly right and and so now instead you know we can all get off our bar stool and make legal arguments instead of just you know arguing about it this is a real problem a lot more than three hundred thousand babies born to at least\nAliens in our country every year and there are tens of thousands of birth tourism\nCitizenship created all the time they go back to their countries they you know they they're kids may or may not ever come to live in the United states they may join ISIS\nThey may uh you know come here for school and then they have kids who maybe have no ties to the United states plus as you mentioned in the ticket\nTo qualifying for welfare benefits in the United states if you're illegal alien parents you have a kid here all of a sudden the kid get Medicaid you get public housing money get access to food stamps\nAnd all kinds of you know I I remember program\nYeah I remember reading about this uh you know thirty thirty five years ago they were saying that you know a ... women are teenagers we get pregnant in Mexico and then they would somehow get across the border into Texas when there were eight or eight and a half months pregnant give birth to a kid and then they'd never have to work together day in their lives that that'd be all set up with this\nAnd I thought it was just the you know a handful of people doing this for like you say it's it's not a handful it's hundreds of thousands a year\nOr doing this tell us about the birth tore some you know again a lot of people don't don't read the newspapers as carefully as they used to they may not know about this uh this amazing scammed but it's going on with ah people flying into the country to give birth\nYes at the big thing with a Chinese with Russians Turks Lebanese Koreans are they there are businesses set up\nTo ... where women have to come here for a couple of months have a baby they ... they stay long enough for the state department to process their babies passport application\nAnd then they go home with a U.S citizen child and that child can come back anytime and go to school here or you know live here and sponsor the parents for ... for a green card and ultimately citizenship later in life\nNot all of them do you come back what many people don't realize is if if they never come back that birth tourism baby get to pass on US citizenship to their kids\nAnd then we're responsible for the citizens overseas I had a friend who was a consular officer in Lebanon and said you would not believe all

Whitey Bulger's partners to admit that he was involved in\nUpwards of fifty to sixty murders fifty to sixty so\nCorrect this is a ... it's pretty amazing ... and why the\nWay it is amazing why now you know let's end with this is exactly how white it bothers should have gone out it is it said that a lot of money now we don't have to keep them alive on life support and some federal prison yeah\nWhat they did this is what he always feared was that he would be uh he he would be a discovered is a rat and uh and he would be whacked out by his uh his gang land associates and uh you know what's better late than never in my opinion\nOn whether you on that one I ... I mean this is a guy who deserved exactly what he got the only thing that would have been better it is it they gouge out his eyes and his kids can get justice for Deborah hot the and I'm Steve ...\nAnd ... and a and Billy Johnson and but the tumor gone of goals that he killed who by the way it happened to be brothers in law of of uh his girlfriend Catherine Greg how weird is that you know uh and\nThen Orion Halloran who is just some milk but wanted to get out of some trouble and uh they ... you know the corrupt can alert gave him up and then Mike Donahue died and the results I mean that's the body the body the body and these people right away to get his eyes gouged out I think as a gesture award\nAnd people like a Bucky beret I mean Bucky ... beaten to death is just a burglar they just want to steal some money from him and his sons end up killing themselves\nYou know I mean the the the the death toll every ... goes down beyond the people they actually killed two generations of of people's lives destroyed devastated by you know losing they're losing their relatives male and female alike and and this guy and and that's about all the why\nWhy why he goes to the federal letter that still haunt me I didn't get entered into evidence but about how the the sorrow knew that guy like Frank within a whack him and I wrote a letter to his cat\nYeah and it was about every time I mean that guy turned into he he talked about how we became you know it was very problematic and it's like you said the collateral damage is I'm well I'm doing right now and\nThen the sorrow and one of the sorrow sons was was killed the on one twenty eight right after a ... right after they found the body or right before they found the body\nWhen they were looking for it really is just it's just horrible what he did and and the drugs and in all the young women that he raped and the and probably young boys to I mean he was just that he was a monster a monster it was a\n... he really was a monster and the fact that he was protected all that time it's almost wink wink nod nod at least if I didn't go on protecting the Savage ... you know evil in ... right right\nYou know they know if they look the other way does anyone really care if they're going to be questions raised\nI I I I ...

have here\nAnd this is a New Yorker magazine and it's called twelve young people on why they probably won't vote and it's just about one of the funniest things that I've read all day and\nUh I have say a number of these people are from Massachusetts but that should not be a surprise that some of these confused young people who don't know whether or not they're going to vote this year for Massachusetts but so they they in their own words are described to this a New Yorker journalist or I guess there's a couple of them why they're not voting and I just wanted to read a little bit of these and again this is a\nA young people speaking with the New Yorker magazine about why they're probably not going to vote and you know if we'd had more time to repair disgrace this would have been excellent masterpiece theater how we might have to have you read a couple of these uh after the break\nOut but this is Samantha age twenty two from old bridge New Jersey she was voted\nIn twenty sixteen [noise] going into the election I was so proud to be in this country at this moment so proud to be voting for Hillary Clinton I had my Clinton sweat shirt on all day I was on Twitter telling people that if they didn't go vote they were dead to me like the whole thing my face and the whole system was crushed pretty quickly\nBut there's still a lot of powerful people especially in the Democratic party that are centrists and that's just a little frustrating when it comes time to stand up to this president and the policies he's trying to pass like the Kavanaugh saying I get that they're the minority and then it was an uphill battle but I just feel like there wasn't any big enough fight put up to that\nSo uh is Samantha age twenty two of old bridge in New Jersey She feels like there are too many centrists and the Democrat Party really where all of a centrist in the Democratic party because I\nHaven't found them and they didn't put up a tough enough fight against Kavanaugh\nI mean they had Michael I cook up gang rape allegations they they were they were submitting into the Senate record an allegation from Julie sweat neck\nThat he he was running train frequently but my ten occasions that's not fighting hard enough Samantha what else should they have done should they have like physically physically ill Brett Kavanaugh 'cause that's just about the next step that's ... that's the next step but they could have taken to prevent them from being on the Supreme Court\nAh and then she goes on full disclosure I have a ballot sitting at home and twenty sixteen I voted absentee and I just marked off send me a a mail in ballot for every election I don't really get that argument that it's really hard like it's not that hard\nShe's still a lot of uh uncertain whether or not she's going to vote or the next one is\nA wreath age twenty three from Hudson, Ohio has never voted twenty three years old has never voted\nI'm not sure whether race is a guy name or a girl named uh he says he says she says I never felt certain enough to vote but I'm a political science student and the talk of voting is really big in my circle of friends and twenty sixteen I almost did of course\nI'm not a big fan of Trump but I didn't know if Trump was going to be a flash in the pan or I just didn't know what to do I didn't want to help something that might end up being wrong\nSo it's a very good portrait of a millennial voters just completely wracked with indecision and again this is the reason why I say this is the feel good story of the day is because these people probably aren't voting and you know I'm of a mind that the fewer people we have voting the better off we all are especially these idiots like what MTV comes out and does this rock the vote campaign\nLike I don't I don't want the lowest common denominator voting like just like\nTen or Fifteen Percent of the country was voting I feel like it would be a lot better off but I Know that that would be like an elitist attitude but you know I don't care it's true\nOr so this again is ... I was particularly interested in voting and twenty sixteen because Donald Trump is so stupid it drove me up a wall he knew way less about government that I Do\nThis is the this is the twenty three year old ... student who's never voted before says he he knows a lot more about government than the current president United States he goes on\nI have ADHD it makes it hard for me to do certain tasks or the payoff is far off in the future abstract I don't find it intrinsically motivational\nThe amount of work logically isn't that much soda form mail it go to a specific place on a specific day but those kinds of tasks can be hard for me to do if I'm not enthusiastic about it that's kind of a problem with social attitudes around you know it's your civic duty to vote\nI once told a co worker I didn't vote and she said that's really irresponsible in this judgmental voice you can't build policy around telling people irresponsible you need to make people enthusiastic and engaged\nI mean you can tell he has ADHD definitely not lied about that you just jumped around in his explanation judgmental co workers are going to make them vote\nAnd he goes on the motivation is about the actual value my vote has it's more like a theoretical signaling value if that's the case I Would rather signal that Democrats should have more progressive candidates rather than assuming that everyone in the left will automatically vote for the candidates they run\nSo it was a racist sending a message to the Democrat Party that they need to be more progressive by a not voting for Democrats good it let me let me know that turns out raise\nRight this is another good one this is Megan aged twenty nine from San Francisco a last voted in two thousand fourteen [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Howie Carr Show", "city": "Boston", "day": "30"}
