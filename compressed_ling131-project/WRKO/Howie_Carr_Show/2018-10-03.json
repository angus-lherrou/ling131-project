R. K. O. okay lines are blazing placed one seven three six six sixty eight sixty eight\nDrawn Europe next thank you for holding John and welcome\nHi Jeff Hi\nHi my name's John Hugo on the Republican nominee for the Massachusetts fifth congressional district I'm running against Elizabeth Elizabeth Warren's twin moon bad cop a bag of sister Catherine clock welcome absolutely refuses to debate me\nWell they're ... could go I mean that's all they are but John what's uh what what what's on your mind my friend\nWell I'll tell you it's kind of sad what's going on here in Massachusetts eighty two percent of electrical and unopposed which is ridiculous you know I'm by myself I Am just a working class candidate and a huge Trump fan I I still on a woman sent out with my Trump signed\nIt ... I just think the guy is is knocking at the clock you know I Am concerned like you are with is Twenty one trillion dollars in debt it as a time bomb and you know every one of us taxpayers we all are one hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on that\nSo I wanted to tell you a quick story about was with Warren since you're on the subject I was in a restaurant with a lady friend and she was ignoring us issues and the next table with the only ones there and the person at the table with her was talking to her about\nWhat's at at least the national debt and she very cavalierly was saying\nWell we don't really have to worry about that we always print more money\nAnd that just speaks to her mentality Jeff\nDid she really say that she sure did and I was raised\nMore money to hell with it like just want money no big deal\nJust like a hundred years we're on the gold standard and a dollar\nGetting change it always bought the same thing I'm sure you know this and then when we got off the gold standard the dollar's worth less every single yeah you know you know the stories your grandfather water pizza for a quarter when you know when I was a kid movies cost a dollar fifty and it's never gotten up the dollars always gone down 'cause it's kind of a scam\nOh it is and John thank you very much for that call well look that's what I mean that's what they do in Argentina\nBut that's what they do in third world banana republic you just after a while you were mass so much government that they just keep printing money and printing money and printing money and then you're purchasing power what you make the money that you earn what you make becomes worthless\nNow if you're rich it's not a problem like Elizabeth Warren but if you're a middle working class person\nTo keep printing more money you're just impoverishing your own citizens but you see she doesn't care and she's such a cheap skate she's such a money rubber that now she's even like after donations for her clothes deductions for her clothes forgive me even that she's got a duct\nSo she's by fifty thousand dollars worth of clothes what the hell she buying for fifty thousand bucks but anyway so apparently it's handbags it's four hundred dollar shoes it's expensive pantsuit send dresses not that she wears it but what you bring these huge hoarding it and what she wants\nThe toss it then she wants to claim a few thousand bucks for herself into ... but she's asking all of us to pay more taxes I mean if you want to see an example of what a hypocrite this woman is a complete fraud it's just as it does is actually the exhibit hey\nLet's go to Ross in Boston Europe Mexico ahead Russ [noise]\nFirst of all of a political war and there's no question she's a fraught she's a phony you know she plays for eight and yet she still every chance she gets\nNow as far as John ... is a great guy I'll tell you I Know very well\nWe're following up on those cats like clocked asked to go as far as the U.S concern there is no question that when you don't believe in the perception of innocence\nIt just nothing but a fraud and the ACLU asked to go and they operate like not that no better than nothing now the other reason why Jeff that call it all before the break and get your crap and that should we as name\nThem realize how ignorant it the American classes begin controlled by the American allowed for the last fifty years I'm Seventy one years old Vietnam veteran I was outraged a year's I couldn't even watch the news because I knew it was so distorted from the truth\nAnd I'm seeing the same thing today says Donald Trump announced becoming president all are getting as fraudulent distorted notes and he does not understand\nThat talk radio it's Radio Free usa\nI feel like I'm part of the French underground every time that I call a talk radio station compared to the propaganda that goes out over the airwaves and these other other forms of media and it's disgusting and all that gentleman that was the first I'll ignorant that he was to make a joke but state and I'm like you did\nA rush thank you very much for the call I appreciate it my friend a gym in New ... Europe Mexico and Jim\nYeah now a bear with me on this is very critical import now this relates to the doctor Cristina a forest testimony about or that she never helped anybody with a polygraph test yes\nAnd she went into that and then the the earlier today her a ex boyfriend said that he witnessed terrorists uh prepare her bed Benjamin ... not ... bear with me here\nHis statement says prepare for a potential polygraph exam okay now if you if you look at the statement that I'm Monica McQueen released to try to conflict with that later in the day you're familiar with that right yes okay\nShe says that ah that I have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken at any time now\n... there's no indication that you actually did take a polygraph test and in those days I don't think they required a lot of the employees FBI to take the polygraph test and they didn't require everybody to do it\nAnd what her statement says she received no help in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken\nSo she could have gotten the assistance because it was a potential\nFrom a doctor for it but never actually took the test and that means her statement technically that she released today and writing is not perjury because he's technically saying\nI didn't get any help in connection with any test I actually took\nWell she didn't take the test so she's making a true statement that question should be asked did you ever get any assistance or did you ever get any advice in connection with polygraph exams because she may not have taken it and that makes her statement technically true and that's why she worded it that way because she could awarded\nThat Christine Blasey Ford never provided never healthy or gay be any advice about taking polygraph exams that she connected it\nTo a test she has taken and somebody has to ask her well have you taken the test\nO M ... you're you're completely right you're completely right but honestly you're kind of like twisting ... one is very simple she has an ex boyfriend who is testifying under the penalty of perjury that he witnessed her coach somebody on how to beat a polygraph I Hope it I'm making\nA point Jeff I'm making the point that and looking at her statement\nNo no no I understand that no I understand that I guess the key point\nNo no I understand it's a key point but the gym here it is whether her friend took a test or not Christine Ford lied to the committee was pointing out who are standing in front of jury Christine Ford needs to go to James and I think that that to me is the rubber the issue\nSo all they got to do now\nIs asked Christine forty again she's going to have to admit that she was lying that's perjury and then get the therapists notes you get that each game set and match okay my friends the FBI investigation is essentially over\nThey're going to release a report will talk about it tomorrow I got to do by by\nThe boys powered by Kelly financial services eight eighty eight hundred Eighteen eighty one gets a peace of mind it deserves Kelly financial services\nSo boy so Boston you walk working one hundred point seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise]\nNot bad but he bought it for about ten or twelve million\nBack in the eighties so\nShe uh she's just going on and becoming more and more embittered about what what happened to her twenty sixteen and I would just remind her again of the famous lines from a William Shakespeare is Julius Caesar\nSometimes the fault the Hillary as I'm paraphrasing now is not in the stars but at ourselves that we're underlings you're on the one made or not go to Michigan no one made or not go to Wisconsin\nAnd uh in ... somehow it's the fault of all these evil deplorable ... now she's you know she's basically calling them the same thing but not using the word or the I word or the BBC better Klinger words\nEight four for five hundred forty to forty to that as a uh\nCan I buy the Matthews brothers a\nCover that you're wearing your stores seven they want I don't think so no these are these were specially made because the camera is uh the the kid the the microphone is on my website so normally the logo would be on the left side so they decided to put the logo on the right side so this is\nThis is a special um a special kind of short only and uh and and cover a sweatshirt whenever you want to call it only grace and I own these kinds of sweat shirts\nThat was a good intro but the but the chief that by the way I you know I I I guess the first thing we want to get into it was it was President Trump being unfair last night in Mississippi when he went through\nEverything but ah that that\nChristine Blasey Ford couldn't remember\n'cause you know I think that you're unfair if you if you're making stuff up\nAnd you know your your slurring of victim and you know you're accusing her of\nA a not a ... of not being truthful\nHowever in this case he was just taking tax and and it was just ... it was everything he said every one of her answers was ... but he gave that those are the answers that she gave so\nYou know you may he may have been using her own words to hang over with\nBut the fact is that was her testimony he repeated her testimony how could he have done any better and better if he had just ah read from the actual transcript of the hearing that's all it was\n...\nAnd by the way the uh the the woman prosecutor in Arizona I'm so happy now that I that I I resisted the urge to what go after her on Thursday cause I honestly I didn't think she was doing that bad a job I mean it was a it was a lousy format for her only being able to operate in those five minute\nLittle bites but you could see what she was trying to do if you you know if you've ever spend much time in a courtroom if you've ever\nCovered or if you've ever been a lawyer her defendant or a reporter in any or an observer of a\nTrial you knew what she was trying to do she was trying to lay it all out and it turns out that it looks like she did a pretty damn good job based on what we are now finding out that that ah Christine Blasey Ford's\nBoy friend says that the ... that she helped\nCoach won for\nBest friends forever bf apps in ah in how to take a polygraph test before she went to work for the FBI\nAnd the the woman who was a a now retired from the FBI she uh she she abruptly retired when Trump was elected president and twenty sixteen and now she's a consultant in Washington meeting she's in the deep state\nShe she denies that she ever got any coaching but it seems it seems odd but in a sworn statement the ex boyfriend would be this\nDefinitive in his statement that that she helped\nHer friend prepare for the polygraph test before she went to work for the Justice Department or the FBI\nAnd he was under oath when he made that statement he also said he never heard her talking about uh about any any uh claustrophobia she lived in a very small apartment there was nothing about any sexual assault she had no fear of flying they used to fly around on propellers a propeller driven planes\nYeah when they were in Hawaii together so I mean he just\nTotally totally uh if ... all of her sworn testimony\nAnd it's it it doesn't doesn't seem that the that the\nDemocrats are ah are are that are that eager to uh to keep\nWe're litigating or re investigating the these are these allegations against Kavanaugh Dianne Feinstein today the senator from California the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee said that uh that the the FBI report should be sealed\nOutweigh the ... I thought we were trying to get to the bottom of this whole thing and and now the Democrats want to seal the report\n\nEight for four or five hundred forty to forty two Kathy says he was totally unfair how he stated the truth the left can handle the truth\nYeah I Know yeah\nWe have heard Trump's mocking voice that was not yet he just said facts that liberals didn't like that so that it's a yeah I I agree I mean ... what was the what exactly was the problem Biddy Biddy misquoted anything she said that he did he did he misquoted any of the questions from uh from from the Arizona\nProsecutor ... ... any of Christine Blasey Ford's answers\nAny he didn't do it in that the that sing song a valley girl a tech a voice that she that she used like the uh the the the actress put on the the Internet and then had to delete because uh she was getting so much heat from my everybody in Hollywood there was nothing like that\nEight for four or five hundred forty to forty two\nI really wanted an FBI\nAgent to interview Ford for a couple of hours says nine seven eight I'm sure a good agent could have a broken her yeah find me a good FBI agent though in Washington you know those although they the the problem is you got all these uh these these licks battles and bomb ... swabs in the Washington office they're all Peter's strikes\nAnd Andrew McCabe tapes\nYou know they're very good at the shuffling papers in sharpening pencils but I don't think they're ah they're not exactly street cops you know you need you need a street cop eight for four or five hundred forty to forty to someone says it's not a question of trumping unfair it's a question of him being stupid why antagonize the fence sitters\n[laughter] what Jeff Flake you think Jeff you think Jeff Flake is is\nGoing to be susceptible to the ... of a of of Donald J Trump you think that he would he will appreciate a a a a sober presidential\nDemeanor saying oh I accept her you know I accept her her testimony at face value even though\nEven though there is no real testimony there are no real facts I mean I I you know you might as well go for the uh might as well go for it I I think at this point I think they know how they're going to vote I I Wonder if Corker I Hope worker knows what he's talking about Corker said it's um that they have the votes now and everything's fine\nAnd and if I were a mansion and if I were Heitkamp especially ah the the senators from West Virginia and North Dakota\nThe Democrats I Would have to say um you know I I'm\nI'm voting for a cabin up because the polls are so running so high in his favor across the country but even more so when the red states that Trump Carrie did you notice that the Joe Donnelly when uh when it when it looked like a the chips were down for Kevin Hall last week he announced he said no vote\nNow he's moved back into the undecided call\nAnother profile in courage a Democrat or you know running neck and neck in a in a in a Trump red state and so this is it this is all about politics now and\nI don't I don't I don't have a problem I thought I thought Trump he was Trump Trump was being Trump let Trump\nThe Trump is Corey Lewandowski says eight for four or five hundred forty to forty two we'll be back with your calls in just a moment I'm highway car\nDon't talks about how well the fact that his\nName is Jeff deal and he's running for US Senate\nHis goals the same as yours Elizabeth Taylor\nRealty a proven track record of saving hardworking families here in Massachusetts money like defeating the two billion dollar gas tax I meant Jeff deal is the only candidate Democrat or Republican to fight against sanctuary city actually supports building new law and\nProudly stand with our ice ages as they defend the border and the rule of law Jeff deal is the only candidate indoors ...

... production of West Side Story falling complaints that too many white students landed lead roles\nWhat you would think that at least half the roles had to be white students because one of the gangs was white rice was Anglo\nYeah but break it my teen at a junior musical theater who is of Puerto Rican descent tried out for her dream role of Maria like she said it got all screwed up when he was given to a white female\nIs it possible that the white female had better singing voice or whatever that's racist even asked for or better figure dare I say it\nInstead cast it's under study and the other three separate trade Latino characters were given to non Latino students\nThis is why these these kind of place they're always controversial I I remember one school did hairspray and they didn't

... by the Jamaican slave\nTo a black or a school [noise]\nShe did not like she told her that they're being racist [noise]\nAnd so they looked around that way so [noise]\nThey were being racist that the college when they gave a Hispanic Puerto Rican road way to an Anglo but there will be at your school they were being racist when they gave a black robe to a black person I mean we should\nBe only black person in the play [noise] need probably a that's a little sketchy so then they looked around the room and they had to pick\nAnother ... and who did they fall upon a great currently a west Asian yeah and for me it was just wondering is media of a role didn't have as many lines I had to put on a Jamaican accent which is everyone knows can easily turn into an Irish accent if not play properly how are you of a Jamaican accent\nYa'll Bob what do you what I mean red stripe gun jak\nOK okay he would definitely not cast in any way\nThat is not okay I don't know a lot of plays call for

since last week's testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Ford White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said today that the federal judges story holds\nAnd uh so [laughter]\nSo the the uh the capital of vote is is a purely nearing\nAnd uh the the FBI is supposedly finishing up the the reports ah the the investigative report such as it is I mean I again\nHow much of it how much of a supplemental report can you have on the allegations against Kavanaugh when there is no corroborating evidence and in the case of ah Christine Blasey Ford she doesn't know the most basic of details\nAnd again the or the the uh the the uh\nThe Beijing jackals of the uh of the media and the Democratic party I I keep repeating myself I may just be the deep state but just call it the deep state the big jackals up the deep state meaning both the Democratic party and the mainstream media it's the same thing again as I to repeat myself\nThey are uh they they are they are now saying that the the Donald Trump should that that Donald Trump and uh\nAnd this the Senate Republicans should not release the FBI report\nI thought they wanted a transparency here wasn't it that their word last week we need transparency we need a complete investigation now now apparently the FBI investigation such as it is is near completion and Dianne Feinstein doesn't want it released\nGo figure go figure\nAnd now it turns out that uh the the the Senate the chairman of the judiciary a Chuck Grassley is ah is asking for more are documents from uh from Christine Blasey Ford\nHe wants to know uh what what the story is what the polygraph test that she said she didn't know anything about polygraph test our ex boyfriend is a sad or under pains in penalties of perjury but she a coach one\nOf her ah very best friends in life a woman named Monica McLean and how to do well on a polygraph test he's also a Chuck Grassley asking for her a therapy records\nYou know she says but she she first the reveal the uh the details of this a traumatic assault that she suffered at the hands of somebody\nTo watch to her therapist and uh she she uh she released the notes apparently from the therapist she got 'em from the therapist and gave him to the Washington Post so now Chuck Grassley wants to study them or as investigators do from the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd Christine Blasey Ford's attorneys who ... at least one of whom is in the employer by George Soros on a on at least one gig that she has Debra cats there were ... she's refusing to turn over the the therapist notes\nSo\nSo Grassley I don't think he wants to subpoena them I don't even know the I guess he has the power to subpoena them but I don't I don't think he wants to subpoena them but I you know ... she says there too\nPersonal to turn over well wait a second they weren't too personal to turn over to a newspaper but now that you've had accused the guy of uh trying to rape you basically you don't want to turn them over to uh to the body that's investigating him\nHow does that work I don't I don't quite get it for four or five hundred forty to forty two\nAnd she doesn't want to talk about the polygraphs because she said under oath she knows uh have you this is what the lawyer\nLet me read the transcript there this was the lawyer from Arizona believe that the Republicans brought in the female attorney had to have you ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test never lawyer have you ever had discussions with anyone beside your attorneys on how to take a\nPolygraph Ford never\nAnd her her ex boyfriend says that's not the case so\nHer lawyers just send a letter to a Senator Grassley that says that they're uh they're willing to turn over the documents the FBI about the polygraph and about her therapy notes uh but the FBI has an ...\n... what about Grassley\n... went to see what does he chopped liver that the Senate Judiciary committee the FBI isn't going to vote on a on Brett Kavanaugh's a confirmation the members of the Senate Judiciary committee and the rest of the Senate are\nThey don't have ... they they don't have it yeah\nEight for four or five hundred forty to forty two\nThis is a a ... and and Seventy one says how are these lunatics allowed in the buildings near the senators that's a very good question to you heard the herd Mitch McConnell saying earlier today said that we're not going to be a intimidated by these a screaming or ... you\nKnow just that totally range the women are in many of them probably in the employee of a Soros or people like him and none of them have none of them seem to have jobs or should I say this is their job\nIs uh is is just the engaging in the left wing mosques flash mobs or whatever you want to call up\nAnd uh it ... and and meanwhile the uh the the uh the press wing of the Democratic party just continues to run with these uh unsubstantiated the allegations just throwing everything up against the wall and seeing what sticks and so far nothing has that\nAnd the stock and the the more they throw up there and it doesn't stick the the more hysterical they become just like the women in the uh in the hallways ah you know freaking at these US Senators\nAid for four five hundred forty to forty two\nSo [laughter]\nIt's it's

concerned as well and on top of that I Would say any female should be concerned because uh you know what always happens when in the end these kinds of situations is\nThe original oppressor group they eventually the oppressors get tired of oppressing them and they move on to another group which will be females nobody's safe in this kind of an environment this is this is these are this is mob\nA

I like to read that I Am really a reluctant to read very much of a ... but I've been reluctant to tweet it out of court or to put a link you know\nIt's it's just so so graphic and so horrible but I can read the uh the the uh the get the page one here I Am a transgender woman being\nTold by spa\nOwner that I Am a man and therefore she will not provide same services to me because I Am a man\nAnd not a woman but yet he says later on in the complaint her she says or whatever as says that ah that he still has male genitalia but he says he's a woman\nSo he should be so the the the female or workers at the spa should provide him with a Brazilian just like they would for a woman\nThat's right but that that is how this law works out is that the definition of gender identity in Massachusetts law as extremely broad and fake and it doesn't require surgery as in this case it has no surgery doesn't require hormones that doctors a diagnosis it doesn't even require consistency\nSo he could walk into the place the next day and say yeah I actually am a man a today I'm all requires is they sincerely held gender identity\nThat's it so it's ripe for abuse and that's one of our real concerns about what this law\nYeah I told her this is this ... this is from a complaint I told her my body has started to change considerably\nColon my skin is softer a hormonal hair hairs do not grow back as fast and the hairs themselves have become softer and fine and my breasts are just starting to develop in my hips and Boston are changing too\nYeah so I think the males on is on estrogen but he's still again as intact male genitalia which the women at the spa do not want to have to interact with\nBut here you have a man a biological anatomical chromosomal man uh using this law to try and force women to touch just in a town actually is I think you've seen probably later on they complain\nHis demands are that he gets to select the ah the one of his choice to do this procedure to him if the owner herself won't do it\nAnd he said he says here Stacey that's the owner has damned Mason she has taken my dignity\nFrom ... and has left me on whole right I I she's left me on hold so what what's going to happen now now what is the one of the possible penalties against the uh ... if they're found guilty of a disorder many wrong against this a transgender\nI mean if if this if there were repeated violations like this let's say a he was turned away three times for three or four men were turned away it could be up to fifty thousand dollars or a year in jail for these are pretty extreme penalties\nYear in jail\nIs there because this is this is both on existing civil rights laws so they added to gender identity along with you know race sex religion and things like that so they're they're very stringent penalties and the same would be true if I as a father if I'm waiting at the local Y. for my ... year old daughter to come out of the\nLocker room 'cause she's changing over after swim lessons and I see a guy start to go into the women's locker room and I say excuse me starting needed away from it to my daughter comes out I Would be in violation than just the same way and could face those kind of penalties were speaking and like most people don't know\nWe're speaking the Andrew back with from the Massachusetts family Institute which is a pushing this vote no one question three which would repeal this law ... so ... well before this law was passed two years ago would would would this guy had been able to ah to complain a and get the attention of the attorney general\nNo he wouldn't I mean this is that this fall as a public accommodation and you you did have people filing successfully claims for gender identity discrimination or under sex discrimination that was included under our state human rights commission masters Michigan discrimination they have that same ... vomiting restoration did that\nGender identity and put under sex discrimination bought under Massachusetts law it is not a lawful sex discrimination to treat men and women differently in certain circumstances like bathrooms locker and showers and I would assume\nBrazilian waxes so you would not be able to do this but the vast majority of ... of um examples that you hear from the other side from the U.S on three campaign\nHave already been covered under Massachusetts law for years\nAnd what's interesting about this case is that the attorney who helped this man filed a claim\nIs the co chair of the yes on tree campaign Mason done so they know exactly what this law does and they wanted to do that they want to use this law to force women to touch men's genitals because in their mind that man is on identifies as is a woman because of his identity\nSo why people want to learn more about the question three ... and your organization where should they go\nSure of it a website called keep em a safe dot ORG keep em a safe dot org and we've got all kinds of examples their people say that there haven't been any problems with this law there's all kinds of examples on the website of men abusing access to women's private space is to take advantage of those women were trying to stop\nIs this the most egregious example of what's going on under the law\n[noise] it it's definitely the it's one that I didn't even anticipate and work on this issue for years now and I did not see this coming which means who knows what else is coming if this law repealed\nAll right so the vote is uh the voters November sex this it's the statewide vote and I I I see that that they're claiming that they're way ahead the yes people are\nWay ahead but do you think that's true\nNo I mean if you look at the question for that it it just asked people if they want to remove antidiscrimination laws\nAll I see okay hope\nSo but when you asked actually tell people what the law does that involves men gaining access to women you know private space is a those numbers change very quickly\nAll righty a Andrew back with a mask family Institute a thank you for being with us and thanks for explaining this and like I said usually I'd say we are going to post something but I
