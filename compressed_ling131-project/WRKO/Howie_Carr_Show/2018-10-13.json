you know the uh the the uh read may the re casting of of NAFTA as a as a better trade deals for the U.S or the or the the record high\nEmployment rates a number of Americans employed the record the

the the bronze the lead lining in the silver cloud\nAnd so now today you've seen this Nikki Haley the former governor of South Carolina as as a she was the UN ambassador was doing a great job she decided to resigned today so there is so they're they're they're working overtime trying to come up with a with\nWith lead linings for this what can we started with my conspiracy theory what's that my conspiracy\nTheory is that he fires Jeff Sessions is a G appoints Lindsey Graham is the new attorney general uh than the governor of South Carolina McMaster appoints Nikki Haley to be a senator where she waits in kind of like the underdog league until it's time for her to run the Senate in twenty twenty four\nOr ... sorry for president maybe maybe she's a vice president for my pets\nYeah but I see I don't think Lindsey Graham wants to be in the cabinet oh I don't either he said as much yeah so I I think I said why were thrown out crazy conspiracy theories that's mine right well the ... the craziest one I heard was that she was going to run against\nTrump in twenty twenty ... wait a second she's ... she's got to cut up to big anti Trump voted the Republican primaries with Jeff Flake who is probably not going to run now ... and John ... is that why is that the thing yes grace\nI think she's going to be VP in twenty twenty four four tiny last\nFor Kanye West see this is not to see this is a whole nother theory is that you know Kanye West is going to have lunch at the White House on Thursday so that that this ... this theory I mean this is now we're just into like\nYou know I thought that marijuana shops where no but I thought it was going to be another couple of weeks before they started selling it out on the ... out on the street\nCorner a base has it been burned and went back here at all I'm Talking about the Kanye West theory which is he's the Trump is invited Kanye West of the White House to offer him be ambassadors shipped to the U.S\nNow they I mean you know what I I don't know about you personally if if I was offered the ambassador ship to the un I'd say this is a gag\nWriter threats [laughter] I mean who the hell wants to be the ambassador to the United nations\nMan ... feedback you mean I'm not saying that I'm ... I'm just saying there's a lot of weird weird leap going on by the way many ... from signing\nA bit of trouble back your well I think the the thing that was crazy to me was all of the never Trump or is in the in the moon bats trying to find some like proximity reason why she left like oh you didn't like the way he talked about Brett Kavanaugh last night didn't like the earth she didn't like the confirmation hearings or\nShe disagrees with the trade policy or there's something that she disagrees with\nWhen according to reports they've been talking about this for months now and it's just now become announced\nRight I I Know it's a ... yeah this is I mean again they're they're just fantasizing I mean it is a little odd though then it comes before midterms which you typically expect something like ... like this to be announced after midterms language unless there's some other you know act in the play\nWhat it's like a it's like Rosenstein wasn't fired yesterday you know because the midterms are coming up and they don't want any distractions uh uh\nYou know although you know they're all these rumors going around that there's big announcements coming down with the president is supposed to have an announcement tonight right some kind of big announcement\nI Hope it's a I Hope he's talking about releasing the uh the unwritten pact that are Feisal applications and everything else I mean I Know I'm obsessed with this thing but\nI saw some of the VIPs are here to there they're hoping for that as well I just I Want to get this stuff out I I'm just I'm just still appalled by this whole thing and and you know a lot of people are so there's one that's another conspiracy theory that's going around\nIs that uh is the Trump\nTook Rosenstein or or excuse me his new name as redacted Stein\nThat took a deputy attorney general rod redacted Stein down through Orlando with him so that he could like you know just have him in one place on air force one\nAnd just tell them look you know I I could blow all you guys are you at all I have to do is ...\nAnd according now to Turkish officials as well as U.S intelligence it appears that they were waiting for her she who is a former one time Saudi Government insider close to the Saudi royal family now it's become a prominent dissident\nAnd they waited for him to come in he came in he has not gone out he has suddenly disappear he walked in they've no there's no footage of him walking out and it now appears that he was tortured\nThen executed in fact be headed in which then the Saudi execution ers took a picture of him being tortured and his actual severed head to the person who had hired them to do it\nAnd then afterwards chopped up his body dismembered it stuffed in several suitcases\nAnd then dry the suitcases into a black man with a black dark windows were they eventually disposed of body somewhere in Turkey the assassins took the planes and left straight back to Saudi Arabia\nAll of this leads to potentially the crown prince of Saudi Arabia he is a fact of levy godfather of the Saudi mafia state prince been sell them on\nThis is why Congress is demanding that if there is definitive proof that she was executed and dismembered\nThat they want crippling sanctions imposed on Saudi Arabia they even want President Trump to end is our is arms deal cut that off completely or just a a a terminated and ended and several us Saudi relations once and for all my friends let me be honest with you\nWhat the media is not telling you\nIs that she was part of the Muslim Brotherhood\n'cause she was in his lamb is\nBecause she didn't want freedom and democracy because she wanted the Muslim Brotherhood to seize power in Saudi Arabia like they had done in Egypt this was in internal squabbles among the Saudis widest is America's business I don't know\nGet more of Jeff weekdays new to three with the tuna reportedly you are tail boys so Boston ...\nIndividual results may vary the website for details\nI'm buying a huge flat screen TV so I can finally see it without my glasses why can't\nActually I'm doing my glasses and contact her pain I'd love to finally get rid of these but who can afford lasik you can\nBecause the least efficient instituted operate dramatically low prices as low as to twenty four I Would absolutely free consultation\nTalked to three five zero three five zero ballistic vision the two has already perform over a million procedures they use the bath FDA approved lasik technology that helps the majority of patients achieved twenty twenty vision for a fraction of what others charged better vision better value to ... to to\nMake this year you finally get lasik for his lowest to twenty four I\nText Dr ... three five zero three five zero you'll see for free if lasik is right for you that's S.
