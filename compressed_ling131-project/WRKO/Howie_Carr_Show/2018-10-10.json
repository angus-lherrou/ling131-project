even though there were\nOnly a handful of them and they they appeared more ominous on TV I think that they did a person because you get when you took the when they took the wide shot back from the Supreme Court like when the vice president was leaving\nThe the capital or wherever he was I mean there were only a couple of hundred of them but still it it was bad and the fact that the these people are paid protesters too that there that there are\nFabulously wealthy people\nThe source of the American by the way or what what what what country is he a citizen of George Soros I was gonna say fabulously wealthy Americans but I'm not sure sources in America spiers in America and that\nI think he has a citizenship in Hungary America and uh the u._k.\nOh three countries and thought I thought to was the max he's a citizen of the world that way OK okay he's a citizen of the world that's good to know but so they're paying these people to disrupt\nCivic institutions that are centuries old institutions that have served the people in this country very well and and and now you have people who ostensibly are law abiding\nCitizens you have the you have this guy Eric Holder I meet again he's a a corrupt\nA banana republic official or he was the attorney general under a Obama he was a ... he he helped arrange pardons when Bill Clinton was leaving office in disgrace\nFor some of the sleazy is people on the planet he was held in contempt of Congress you know obviously it's a very ... shady dodgy character but I mean he's still he's talking about running for president\nI mean he's on the he's on the dodgy lawyers wing the Democrat Party he'll be running against Michael ... and that that crowd I guess 'cause we're going to be like twenty thirty of them running so you got hold their\nIs talking about how you need to use violence against protesters and again I can remember this guy ran a total legal Wallace administration he refused to prosecute Black Panthers he said he's not going to go after people like him\nHe uh he's he he was held in contempt of Congress you know for lying about fast and furious\nThe uh the the gun running operation so I mean he's just he's a complete the ... he's a complete moral ethical cipher\nBut it's still pretty amazing I mean considering but\nLet me ask you this John Mitchell\nRichard Nixon's attorney general his former law partner in New York he went to prison for Watergate crimes do you think John Mitchell whatever say what I'm where the cut we're about the play of Eric Holder cut twelve\nIs time for us as Democrats [noise] to be as tough as they are dedicated as they are to be committed as they are [noise] Michelle always this is all over you know my wife like really high voice voice ... [laughter]\n... says you know when they go low [laughter]\nThey go low we can't\n\nWas his new Democratic Party has about\nRemember when Trump during the rally is just to say go get them out of here you know these demonstrators got I'm outta here get them out of here and everybody say he's inciting mob violence\nWhat the hell was that I mean again granted\nHe's with a bunch of people who have trust funds and legacies and these people have a you know they they they they got nothing but ... and their lunches stomped on ... that's the kind of people that go to those events with Eric Holder but\nStill I mean he's in his inciting violence kicking people well\nWhat happened to me if I if I was on your mind you know rent right now we're on a national network what if I said you know what there's a demonstration down a down in front of the state house let's go now to check everybody kicked the people who are demonstrating I'd be in big trouble I'm just glad\nThe new Democrat Party has just as many guns as the old Democratic Party which is not exactly [laughter]\nYeah I I mean it's I I don't I don't quite get that either crutch like there's always talking about that I mean they do they really want to be talking about picking up the gun when they they don't have any guns I mean I'm not and again I'm not saying I Want anybody pick 'em up guns\nSo you've got the let's let's go to Mazie Hirono I mean\nYou know\nThere was really a race to the bottom not just in rhetoric but also when Ike you in the Democratic party Mazie Hirono\nIs about three cheeseburger short of a Happy Meal pack you know I'd be she's just listen to this okay play a cut number\n... president and Republicans what they are saying is that democratic protesters quote an angry mob and wouldn't want to ask you about it is you know it is one thing to protest at the Supreme Court to do it at the Capitol that's been done for for generations and find places that have that entree\nIt's another thing to run senators out of restaurants go to their homes is that going too far\nI have had a ... that there are a lot of people who are very very much ah I'm motivated about what's going on because what might happen\nWith having a ton of everybody's any [laughter] out of ... that have let them in public I found myself ... after that the ... why\nWhy they had a vast lifeline identify we don't want to hear from you too if we have to hear from you what is that ... hearing of that going on now like restaurants Patti well this is what happens hail and they\nBecause they have like ... and all that and as I say coming forth in our country that's on the tail end of the vices that in our country that has this kind of a activists that occurred than people make their own decision that\nShe said they're motivated was that guy Hodgkinson motivated when he uh ... when he fired the rent policy fired two hundred rounds of ammunition this is a this is a motivated Democrats trying to kill Republicans\nAnd then was the was the guy who assaulted Rand Paul a few months later in the in in Newport, Kentucky was he motivated\nThinking about this Rand Paul is the is the United states senator he's a he's a practicing physician not ophthalmologist his father\nWas a ... was a congressman a candidate for president and this guy last year got shot at and he got almost beaten to death\nI mean if a guy like Rand Paul is not safe and and read what was he doing was he involved in some kind of ah you know shady activities he was he was in a baseball practice was raking leaves any was attacked\nIt had this ... this they say the N ... all Mazie Hirono can say is that they are our people are motivated this is what happens this is activism she says yeah yeah this is a this\nIs the face of democracy yeah

Wednesday\n\nAnd the hate mail is ... and I have tons of voicemail and actually I only have to look through one of your columns because you're contain a look at wind gardener enough heat down to get me the segment you want to give it a little brief ...\nWe have a a a marvelous thing one of the great great things that was passed in the last Twenty years by our Democrat legislature they got tired of people complaining about how people don't pay their fair share of taxes so finally they just throw up their hands Lisa okay you want to pay your fair share we're going to give you an option\nIs only two states in the union that give you the option on the on the tax return for the state to pay a higher rate\nOf Arkansas and Massachusetts so literally dozens of people they have the millions of taxpayers in the commonwealth of Massachusetts take advantage of this one of whom it doesn't happen to be Elizabeth Warren\nWho makes millions of dollars that hurt she she she was making four hundred thousand is a professor at Harvard then she got elected to the Senate and all of a sudden she's making over a million a million and a half dollars a year\nBut she never checked the box grace until this year and what what's what's going on with Elizabeth Warren this year the way that you might check the box and and decided to pay a higher rate instead of five percent I point eight five percent white what do you think the difference was this year\nShe's trying to break that glass ceiling that Hillary bombed their head off of and then fell back down\nThat's a good guess Christ but the reality is she's running for reelection this year a challenge to run for president so she figures she'd better do the PC thing\nThat's what grades meant glass ceiling running for president\nHillary ran for president he used to hate now should be porn and right now [laughter] okay anyway back to um oh I just want to say about that how we don't do my own taxes because if I did my taxes ... pay check that box by accident and they ended up paying like\nHalf a mile do your attack if then if you check guy somebody check that box ... grace you would have a lawsuit on their heads I mean they will be tripled damages 'cause that's like\nLet's say you make I don't know what you make but you it's one percent of your income is gone because of would be gone because of that\nBut like for her when she checked that one percent of our income yeah\nIt's an extra one percent oh an ex so like over the last ten years we figured it out by not checking the box she had saved fifty thousand dollars that was fifty thousand dollars that could have gone to illegal aliens kept building and blow transgender bathrooms and and the ... the crumbling infrastructure\nCrumbling infrastructure I've just hung up on the fact that children ... currently has her own accountant do or taxes he's my parents' accountant that's what I was gonna say I knew that you you do that\nI mean it's the one thing that I think it's good that I'm not doing my own taxes like I don't think my parents are like your own grace I think they're kind of happy that someone else has that under control anyway back to hate now\nSo how he wrote that piece and I read some comments and throughout these common Steve feel free to play the messages in the order that there and because we have tons of hate and intimate it's really\nDark winter to anybody did anybody suggests that that I have my facts wrong in the ...\nAnd people were more suggesting that you are overlooking Donald Trump tax issues\nAnd only picking on all of the\nThan Donald Trump ever called for a\nA marginal income tax rate of he refuses say how ... they they've asked what's your what do you want you you talked about these problems that the Republicans get back to people what do you want us to the top tax rate\nFifty percent sixty percent Seventy percent and she never answers Donald Trump that's the difference\n[noise] yeah I get what you're saying you know what I mean it's like oh Donald a lot of hypocrites saying oh well you didn't say after and help us clean up\nAnd then I'm like oh well I didn't I didn't offered to you I never wanted to and then one person arranged for the place to be cleaned up and didn't stay after that's like a weird now do you but you know what I mean what does he he's also not called for people to release their tax returns yeah yeah okay anyway so here's a the ...\nAnd they also didn't take fifty I'm pretty sure he didn't take fifty thousand dollars and write offs for USC lows which we that was the last week's column on our tax\nA Trump supporter complaining about something he found in a candidate tax return and then in all caps\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha\nThat's a funny thing I've ever read I mean literally

wow\nI I don't believe he is he's\nContested any of the main points that I raised in the call\nOr is it any and so is Donald Trump\nYou Donald Trump they they put you on the same pedestal that same idiot pedestal you guys are right next to each other that you should be on\nThe job you Republicans self\nI Will say so grainy I'll give them contacts that granny was really riding high um during the

when they did in ... county in day because I happen to be an Italian American and I'm Sorry [laughter]\nI bet it that I I I did that on the fly yes I invented in ... we'll call it indigenous people's day but see you know since I don't think it's right that Christopher Columbus has been demoted so that's why it's ruin Italian in there to\nGet you out of this hour we know this is very ... that it happened that he was also contract Brett Kavanaugh\nOn the day uh Columbus Day right that does the government and the Americans something I\nCan I just mention quickly to say yes that so called that China and what they do in those um communist and their their press being it's so awful and these kids today I just wanted to\nSay that bring it out to the ... kickback south but I grew up with values and be careful what you wish because this is called resist and we still don't know what they're talking about that in China Tiananmen Square and when those students thought that democracy because they were right\nModeling after ...\nI actually have a closed down by the communist regime into so it I mean I only guy heading in that direction to what I think one other thing that that\nIt they have a book and then I uh we we I don't like saying I Am and why why he had an Asian student raised by the Chinese authorities without any advance notice he can't go in there he did it work\nYeah they were not the you know the the the I was talking earlier about the great leap forward I mean the Tiananmen Square was terrible I was in the late Nineteen eighties but I mean this was back in the sixties with a mouse a tone and uh in in the great leap forward when they tried to\nCollect devise pretty much all of rural China they there were there were I mean there are various estimates nobody knows exactly but they're you know fifty sixty Seventy eighty eighty million people killed\nAnd you know you want to talk about a terrible uh another terrible policy of the Chinese Communist government or how about the one child policy for all for all those years they were trying to get a a a a a handle on the population increases so they they said you could only have one child\nSo you could you could imagine what that led to in terms of abortions and a female children being killed because of families want it to have a male offspring to continue the lie just they they I mean there's just\nThere's so many horrible things have happened under communism and now you now you see these millennials a you know a huge percentage is like a third of the millennial age group\nThinks socialism is okay but it's it's the way to go it's it's not it's not I mean it's you know even if it's even if it's just some kind of European socialist admitted it always leads to a economic malaise and the loss of individual freedoms and\nA Maggie Thatcher the former prime minister of Great Britain I mean ... a lot of people will know exactly what I'm about to say which is the problem here quote the problem with socialism is eventually you run out of other people's money\nAnd that's exactly right and and you know Bernie Sanders doesn't even understand that his his state Vermont try to Institute a single payer health care they couldn't do it\nBecause there were they'd already even before it started they'd run out of other people's money same with California and other left wing state they couldn't they couldn't put a single payer healthcare plan but you know hey he wants to think big he wants to think creatively thanks for the call Mrs X or Pete your next with highway cargo had paid\nYeah hey you know you're talking about the taxes for trucks all to get back on that\nSecond they say Trump lost a billion dollars in revenue since she's been president but you know ... and there's a big difference in how people approached the government and what they think like or you know\nRemember when a Rachel Maddow supposedly got his tax returns and he took a billion dollars in tax write off and then it turned out he had mentioned the fact that he that he lost a billion ... billion dollars it was in the intro to one of his books from the Nineteen nineties there was no secret\nThere yet he's not charging within his rhymes yeah go ahead\nAnd in France right now you know they got his rise Scottish people losing like fifty a hundred dollars and a government paycheck but they just took in a million refugees from a you know Syria that don't want to work to why can't work at all the husbands don't let them it's just like well lucky that we got you know it's from Central America goes life's\nWork man our people are just they don't do nothing [laughter] I I Know I I Know\nIt's a ... the the Europeans have have big problems is as big as our problems are the Europeans have greater problems for the call he said you're an axe with highway car go ahead Ted\n... high you know the ... the mainstream media is working overtime that either you know racist statements by Maxine Waters Hillary\nCory Booker you know that these calls for civil unrest and violence a fact going to work the camera doesn't lie we see the images of the mobs in the streets there were ... people people in wheelchairs and\nYou know how we the first call to the street if Trump took office people don't realize came from former attorney general Lynch if she if you go back and look at that tape of her she actually has ordered people to take to the streets and we told them\nYou know Ted out today another thing people forgot to is that I said what what does\nRussia do after the election [noise] one of
