everything I've heard the Vegas that's my buddy reached out in the middle is never done so\nThank you thank you I appreciate it\nWe're welcome I'm so mine kind of hearts on um [noise]\nWith suppression on social media it's I think it's something that's really isn't being looked at a as something that's directly affecting\nAre the voices of conservatives in just a trips in this nation right now ah I ... it's a it's a lot larger scale you just finished your segment talking about a the professor on Twitter we let's put it on Twitter but is fine by her university\nAh it's\nI I posted I Know I got I have personal accounts where I posted thing I'm most recently a a very innocent respectful host regarding um\nThis forward a all at the post was a picture of her smiling and within the post that said uh the face you make when you're under oath\nAnd you lie because you're protected by the deep state and you're you know you have a book deal in there and Andy suckers that going to ah

was what band\nNow only been taken away for harassment and bullying on Facebook and credit hit by a count\nMy account was locked out where I could see everything but I could not interact with another human being with three days\nFor absolutely nothing I I couldn't hear it I couldn't I couldn't reach out to anybody it was done and I couldn't even though like another picture I couldn't respond the messages on my first book out I couldn't do anything for three days\nAnd I I mean that this is this is where I'm Sorry Jeff but one more thing that's what I Want to get in and just go ahead\nI'm this is where I kind of becomes free speech under attack is directly affecting cars\nOf Americans out ... interacts on social media\nThat their their voice it on social media this the only way you can communicate majority of Americans and that's how Trump one was from social media\nAnd you know they're doing is they're they're almost like trying to hit the import button and getting rid of what helps ... when they put them into office and what they're doing right now is hiding the government or the deep state it's hiding behind\nThese private sector big tech to suppress truth and conservatives\nBingo and ... and it's it's a ... worst\nPeople don't want to talk about it but it's all those go look I'm just one little guy and and I can't even get my voice out\nSo I mean it it's it's something something needs to be done they my opinion is I think it'd be declares utility and the need to be forced to uphold the first amendment and the rest of the bill of rights and the constitution\nAnd usually it's up there\nI couldn't agree with you more and just so that you know so you were ... were suspended for three days right on Facebook correctional\nCataracts what they did to you Facebook was the equivalent of what ... did to that a football coach\nAbsolutely that's why I called in touch with and that's that's what it that's what it is basically they suspend\nYou they threaten you they intimidate chewed they bully you and they basically tell you wink wink you do it again you're out\nYou're out absolutely\nSo you better toe the line and that's that's what they said\nTo me Jeff the message that they got from them was that the first offense is three days the next seven days and then they throw their friends or could\nBe permanently banned there you go now it's like you know they don't tell me why\nThey don't say anything they just say the fall of ... and it can be said is pretty much completely undermine the constitution though right I mean as an American I have my my American rights but both right and they take it away from me\nWell that's the point and that's what they want a DJ thank you for that call look that's what I've been trying to say now for I don't know how many years and I'm happy now that people are starting to finally wake up to what I've been saying the left is in a war\nA political ideological cultural social roar they want controls\nThat's why they dominate the schools that's why they dominate the university's that's why they dominate academia Hollywood popular culture television much of the media it's all about control and DJ you touched on it\nTrumps key weapon was social media in two thousand sixteen now they're saying no no no no never again never again are we going to lose control over that message and over that medium\nSo that's what's going on now\nThat's why they want to control Facebook they want to control Twitter they want to control Instagram they want they want to control social media\nBecause the only way you see they feared the\nTruth the truth exposes them the truth is dangerous to them honestly I'm dangerous to them you are dangerous to them that's why we have to be stopped\nAnd you said it we're in we're Americans until we learn to say we're Americans we have the right\nTo freedom of speech and if you don't like it blank off until we learn to say that the left a salt is going to continue vet Kavanaugh hearing the Kavanaugh assassination is about the future of America\nThey want him to go down because they want America to go down [noise] and that's why I Hope to God that President Trump stands by judge Kavanaugh and judge Kavanaugh becomes justice Kavanaugh okay my friend's\nBrittany where did the three hours go where do they go All right my friends I'm going to write a column on Kavanaugh I'll Try to have it posted by about seven o'clock tonight please check me out on W. R. K.

I never considered throwing ice rising to the level of a bar fight you know I mean\nIt's it's a rabbit I mean even by the New York times piss poor standards of all the news that it's really not fit the print it this this this is kind of a reach isn't it [laughter] someone wants to know was a shaved ice way\nJust about had Kavanaugh confirmed then he threw some ice and ruin everything and so anyway listen to the ... one of the one of the bylines on this piece is a woman named Emily basil on B. A. Z. E. L. O. way out in\nThe last time we were talking about Emily ... who was when she said that she wished that there would be a national a natural disaster because it would be advantageous for the Democrats\nReally okay well she also said that she she also uh lives in New haven I guess and she pointed out that she that she thought that he should not be confirmed so this is how this this is how a a unbiased a reporter she is\nA here it is with respect to ease the fifth vote for hard right turn on voting rights\nThat that means he's against voter fraud that's that that's that's what that means a hard right turn that means enforcing the laws that if you are not\nRegistered to vote and you're not a citizen and in many states if you're a felon you're not allowed to vote that's a hard right turn on voting rights and so much more that will huh\nFrom the Democratic process and prevent a more equal society this is what she said and now she's reporting\nOn this guy but she thinks ... that she faces a despicable human being so the New York times issues a note of this\nEmily bass a lawn is a writer for the New York times magazine who occasionally writes op eds for the opinion section who she is not newsroom reporter her role in the story was to help colleagues in the newsroom gather public documents New Haven where Emily is based\nIn retrospect editors should have used a newsroom reporter for that assignment is Jason Blair still around ...\n[laughter] to be clear the story is straightforward fact based and uh you know in other words it's not like most of our stories this story as fact based and you can trust us all\nThe news that fit the print is there any other example the New York times reporting out a story whereas the individual wasn't charged which just interviewed by police yeah\nAnd we fully stand behind it where did this story run by this is on the front page is this the I'll bet it was on the front page who who knows I mean who reads that it's\nBeen so long since I've seen an actual print copies of [laughter] I Know me too\nMe too I don't even know if they still put it on there that it's worth what page it runs on but anyway I bet it is on the front page of the New York times that's a but so the ... he ... he is he was ... he wasn't charged the guy the guy said he ... he may have thrown an ice cube Adam\nAlright uh okay so this this ... this uh this bombshell\nWas originally reported by the wine and cheese professor at NC State a guy named letting ... he's the one that he wrote something for the NFL\nOr the News Observer in Raleigh I think over the weekend he said the altercation happened after you'd be forty concert on September twenty fifth when he and a group of people went to ... so that's the name of the bar\nAnd were drinking pints why did they say ... does that make it seem worse than they were drinking cans of Bud Light or long neck a Miller's might be an Irish joke I don't know at one point they were sitting\nNear a man who they thought resembled alley Campbell the lead singer of you'd be forty we're trying to figure out if it's him he said when the man noticed Mr London getting Mr Kavanaugh and the other is looking at him he objected and told them to stop\nIt adding an expletive Mr letting than set\nIs this what barring browser liking the ivy league [laughter] [laughter]\nSo [laughter] ... so then so then that's when some something happen I don't know what happened it's but it's this this this seems serious this I I mean are you kidding is this is this a joke\nI at least in this incident the FBI has a crime scene to investigate\nYeah and and by the way it's it was such a big deal they took the guy to the hospital and again no one's a ... no one that you know it doesn't really who I guess was the probably the star of the Yale team that year 'cause he went on went on to play for years and years in the NBA I he wasn't charged with anything and he's the one who actually through the\nGlass and I'm trying to think of any time I can ever remember anyone being hurt by a throne ice cube\nCertainly not what maybe if it hits you in the rye but it but he did this this wasn't the case it hit him in the ear or he got hit in the year by the glass I don't know where Kavanaugh's a toss hit him if indeed there was a toss\nAid for four [laughter]\nDon't ice me bro do the ice me\nThis is such a this is such a bombshell the Dems are really going to want to abolish ice now alley\nYeah and I know they've got to do something about ice abolish ice is anyone has a has Cory Booker a Spartacus called for an abolition of ice how about a seven day waiting period for ice at bars\nWe should we should have that you know what not and how many more ... how many that ball will be accosted by the guy who the guy who allegedly with the va hospital or I went to the hospital according to the New Haven police report\nHere they they they are reached him I guess I Want to\nAre crack

that they only have one Congress but so the congressman also like the senator represents the Empire State and he's running ahead of her and she's she's pretty much on the she's pretty much gonna have to vote against Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd are they the a percentage of people in North Dakota want Kavanaugh confirmed is even a greater than in West Virginia\nMeanwhile Mitch McConnell's was

Ford\nBroadcast news networks last night a continued to hammer away at the sexual assault allegations using the seventh FBI inquiry into Kavanaugh's passed this latest news hook however\nThey devoted only a miniscule portion of the cabinet coverage to the memo that was released a by sex crimes prosecutor Rachel metro\nAnd of course again that was if it was a pretty thorough or\nA deep bond king of many of her rock claims\nWe've actually got a new allegation and ... what's that there was a party at a frat after Kavanaugh had graduated that included sex acts with a stripper yes and there's no evidence that Kavanaugh was there or that he was a participant but senator Coons has decided before the allegations to Grassley anyways\nOkay so Grassley basically just send them back a letter that said you basically can they may\nYeah so this is this is like the one in uh in Rhode Island where he he and a judge or were charged with rape being a woman on a boat in Newport Harbor and ah and Sheldon Whitehouse went running with that to uh to to Lindsey Graham\nValley with Chuck Grassley rights we've reached a new level of absurdity with this allegation there's no evidence that judge Kavanaugh was anywhere near the party or had anything to do with it at all in fact the only person we can be sure attended the party was the accuser himself\n[laughter] if there's another one to here I Can't even I I Can't even find them all now\nBut ... now there's another story here this is by I think by NBC text messages suggest capital I wanted to refute accusers claim before it became public this is a Ramirez claim you know where she says there gaps in her uh her her\nMemory because she was drinking so heavily and she she had to spend six days talking to her lawyers in a ... and ... before she could decide the Capitol I may have exposed himself to her\nAnd she also was texting friends asking that I ever tell you about this and uh so so now now that now it somehow bad that Kavanaugh want it to refute the accusers claims before they became public\nSolve this I mean this is what the this is what they're up against this what the he's up against here and but I I don't think

neck in Nineteen Ninety three in Washington DC barred and your Wisconsin circle let it was a going away party for a TV anchor I left the party to go to a bar to buy a soda I haven't drunk alcohol since my Eighteenth birthday\nAs I sat alone at the end of the bar Julie approached me she was alone quite beautiful well dressed no drinking hand consequently my initial thought was she might might be a high in hooker call girl because of the time I wait three hundred and fifty pounds so why would someone like her what ...\nWhat what someone like her with someone like me I'd never been hit on with a bar on a bar before so he starts um\nHe ... he uh he start seeing her\nI felt she only had interest in my three hundred and fifty pounds self because I was on television and well known\nAnd she he says he resisted having sex with her uh he was having marital difficulties during a conversation about our sexual preferences things got derailed when Julie told me she liked to have sex with more than one guy at a time\nIn fact sometimes with several at one time she wanted to know that would be okay and our relationship\nI asked her if this was just a fantasy of her she responded that you get first tried sex with multiple guys well in high school and still liked it from time to time she brought it up because you wanted to know if I Would be interested in that\nSo he's he sees what's going on here and he says uh I was that he has a new wife and I guess he's lost a lot of weight and all this I was deeply troubled and felt the moral dilemma do I reach out and tell the truth of what I Know and risk family relationships to remain silent\nUm I Know I also know what it's like to be accused of something significant that I didn't do and not be believe because of this and the turtle consideration\nMeaning I guess the afterlife the pressure on be built throughout the afternoon I had to explain my my wife and three years what happened twenty five years ago before we met in long before we married\nSo then he decides to go to was a pastor and talk to him about it as I watched part of the afternoon confirmation hearing the next day and some Mrs Kavanaugh looking so sad I felt

calls a day for four or five hundred forty to forty two so this is a Grassley is writing to Coons talking about how ridiculous this letter that he said it was from this uh this guy who created the TV show in which people strip while dancing to their favorite music\nThis allegation says Senator Grassley has all the makings of a tabloid headlines but there's just one problem the accuser freely admits that having no evidence whatsoever that judge Kavanaugh even attended this party\nRather than provide even circumstantial evidence of judge Kavanaugh's attendance the advisor provide some investigative advice\nHe proposes that someone search judge Kavanaugh's calendars the very same calendar is that your colleagues have dismissed and derided with regard to Dr Ford's allegations to determine whether he attended a fraternity party at some point in Nineteen eighty seven or Nineteen eighty eight and that's at\nAll he alleges that he wants to witness a salacious party at a house owned by judge Kavanaugh's undergraduate fraternity he then separately advises us to obtain and search judge Kavanaugh's calendars did the term determine if he attended\nWraps up Senator Grassley in his letter to senator cones we've reached a new level\nOf absurdity with this allegation there was no evidence the judge Kavanaugh was anywhere near this party or had anything to do with it at all in fact the only person we can be sure attended the party was the accuser himself\nThe loan connection between judge Kavanaugh and the events described by the accuser is that as an undergraduate judge Kaplan I was a member of the fraternity that hosted the party\nThe purpose of this allegation is playing to smear judge Kavanaugh's name again by associating him with the party's host this guilt by association tactic is the basis form of political attack and deserves unqualified condemnation\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two\nAre on our local news last night or the NC State
