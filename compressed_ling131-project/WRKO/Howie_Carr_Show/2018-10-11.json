Warren G Harding knock somebody up in a in one of one of the broom closets back in the twenties I think he did\nWarn them out the Malian harting or whatever his name was the president was elected in Nineteen twenty but it was all worse than it is it's the worst thing that ever happened today they ... they weren't angry there we would have thought that that\nDonald Trump had said that uh had said there was no Russian collusion and it's edited fired Robert ...\nOh her for being a cheap Democrats part isn't it [laughter] it was hilarious I mean how can you look away from that it was so funny and and you know and and Trump\nYou know who obviously loves to be the spotlight the center of attention if you if you look at the rallies and he turns it over to the Republican candidates but he's ... he's always chomping at the bit to get back up in front of the microphone when he's at these big rallies these doing practically every night now\nThis time he's just sitting there waiting Kanye carry the whole thing 'cause because he's in showbiz you know when somebody's when somebody's knocking them dead you don't want to go with that letter you know it's ... it's your show so if someone else is doing it that's great\nThe CNN consensus appears to be that Tania is suffering from a mental health episode and that President Trump is exploiting him so he's fat [laughter]\nWhat he's suffering from a mental health episode I was going\nYou know you don't want to go there were there were so many great lines in there he was saying he was saying uh at one point that you know said said I Try to love everybody but you know Hillary with that that slogan of hers and twenty sixteen I'm with her you said I'm a guy\nHe said the you know there weren't a lot of guys in my household but have you know they're not a lot of guys around me now he said he kinda I don't know that kind of bothered me I thought to myself\nYou know I had a problem with I'm with her myself I didn't like that slogan and you know what I think most guys didn't like that slogan but he articulated it better than I did not he put it into words I've never put it into words myself even just in pot let alone\nPublicly voicing yet vocalizing it and and how about the fact to that he was talking about the second amendment we have that we have that cut though here it yeah ... five ... five hours\nOn the legal legal way out the right to bear off\n\n... where's the insanity there he's called joking\nAside I thought that was really bad um [noise] I think he had their man has clearly not okay at a president who's willing to point that\n\nWhere did she get her medical degree is she a practicing psychiatrist can I get some opioids from Dr whatever her name is\nAnd the cup as the cop who are who are all these people these people would be offended if somebody said you know what I think a\nCory Booker has got a problem admitting to groping and making how people are like T bone I I think he's got a mental he's kind of

Nineteen fifty eight anymore you mean by The Mentalist crushed to leave it to beaver is not coming down for breakfast ... are out of a ... one of\nThe most hypocritical aspects of this is that yesterday was world mental health awareness day down here where everyone was talking about how you know if someone tells you they have a mental health problem you don't mind make it a stigma and that's actually kind of us is open about that he struggled with\nDepression or whatever whatever problems he had and now their weapon I think to use their word\nThey're using it against him that he can't he can't go out and be part of the public debate or have an opinion or talk to the president because he struggled so instead they're using it to mock him it's like no wonder no one wants to come out and said that they have depression or anxiety you guys you're going to ridicule them with it if they have a different opinion and you\nRace do you think the uh the the moon bats are pouncing or they seizing upon\nThis evening on tiny past meant a mental health problems and it's really I I Swear I Will like write him a letter and they don't stop do not let them bully you because he's making a

Connecticut and you're listening to the ... show [noise]\nBecause I appreciate his political stance that doesn't mean I have to like his alleged abuse I'm not going to go that far you know\nMy little brother is giving me a hard time because now I'm so I've always liked to some of his sons and I love this on gold digger um but I always like his more popular song not like the deep tracked into my little brother's name on any was like oh you're you're bandwagon fan you only like and now you don't even like his music and I said I'm not\nPretending that I like his music that much I like him because of his politics now I like that being brave\nHe's going against the grain\nWhat happened to a Republican who called the Kanye West the token negro [noise]\nUh I I think you I I think I think that the bigger thing was that it was black people who say that it I don't even think of a white Democrat could get away with that but the\nTibet they could do that we don't ... you don't like Sheldon Whitehouse good\nIf he wants to test it out he can try but I Would steer clear of it if I were hem 'em but speaking of that ... yesterday which we should actually play again Steve I'll give you a second I Know it's not ... but the guy who was on that panel he was a white guy and he looks so disgusted with the comments that those two black people were making about Kanye West\nAnd act like John Lennon so hysterical laughing that oh look at his face like any space like oh look at the white guy's face you can't believe we're talking like that when really the white guy and and he was the same guy who is in all the mob ... calling in a modern I'll have to figure out his name during the\nBreak on women take a drink under extreme social pressure\nYes I'd probably calmed killed on but let's play I'm used to\nGet a couple of drinks before the panel discussion where they were calling kono folk and ...\nNo just I I don't I don't want to excuse his behavior yesterday with alcohol he's I just think he's a bad person and and he's extremely condescending unless it's LeBron James and then if you say anything bad about in your race as well let's play that clip again to remind people at how awful this was yesterday\nIt was his what happens when he grows don't read 'em and and we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with my take pictures [laughter]\nLook at it God's [laughter]\nThan black folks are about to pray Kanye West and the racial draft okay they've had it with habits and he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that the the model spokes person have hit the token negro of that of the Trump Administration\n[noise] yeah so they get older that guy is failing when CNN can find a a black person who could speak for thirty million other black people you know it's already white people that can speak for all the white people in the\nCountry and you know I've never really thought like wouldn't want a white person screws up I've never thought like men we're going to trade them away to another race [laughter] which were white people kit disowned their own\nEverything everything Kanye West the saying is confirmed by his critics\nYeah I I really think that is the biggest point they may have had a little bit of a chance of getting him back had they not completely insulted him and and and insulted his intelligence and his mental state it's who you know\nLike if I had an opinion and you guys just ridiculed me for it I'd be like well what's wrong with you people are feeling for being there there are so scared they're so incredibly scared of a different opinion of someone shaking up the norm and they're proving it because every time he opens his mouth\nThey're only way to counteract it to say oh it's so sad he's really disturbed which by the way it's an interesting tactic and I'm going to take it up next time when I debate someone about politics the second I disagree with them rather than bringing up any points I'm just I'm just going to go oh you must have\nMeant I told them I Try to learn from watching Democrats just like last week with a Elizabeth Warren when she got busted by us for you know writing off the fifty thousand dollars worth of used clothes and then it's right there on a tax returns and she says oh\nI wasn't in here right right so I mean ... whatever whatever they do they ... they they've got an excuse and you're supposed to buy it\nRight my favorite part though of the term caught you meeting was one of the reporters at something like or are you going to get a picture with Trump and some kind of hesitated and was like I don't want to put you in that position like right photo up\nAnd ... he said something like I'm standing in that position I'm coming over there right now I Want to give you a hug I Love this man everyone in the room\nWas like one and then as he's leaving he's hugging the reporter he talking like Jonathan Karl all these guys and it's true one of his things that he says and I'm not saying he constantly sounds like perfectly you know\nHe points to always come across perfectly which neither do mine but one of the things he always says his lead with love and I think that actually is very powerful because they want to hate him and every time they hate on him\nHe doesn't get him angry he come back and says things like I understand where you're coming from I get that\nBut when you have your you have your rights to freedom of speech just like I Do right so why are you trying to take away mine because I'm trying to take away your\nIt's very very disarming for people if it's a it's like the old expression you get more bees with honey if you're nicer to people it's harder for them to ridicule you and that's why I think it's so easy for me Raul and Allie ... Shi who you guys heard in the opening because they don't know ... and they're not going to say that to a state and\nYou don't know I I understand why Trump was given him the option of having his pictures taken with them because sometimes especially in these days of social media pictures can come back to haunt you as Steven I proved today with the governor of Massachusetts of the uh now with David a mayor boy mayor of Fall River\nAnd its affiliates are investors in hard times holding court but are not associated with this offer media and its affiliates in that responsible\nFor the information contained his message the information include the pie tend to better dot com or the information filed with the securities and Exchange Commission\nVoices in key finding plenty out Frank Sinatra that time forty different on this ...\nHuge joy voices why get your tickets now legal diamond to another\nRoom some romantic play chili\nNoon is Joey voices he does have all that on on rod Stewart how\nOur brains when we\nGo to Joey voices that does Lobos in North reading on Saturday Night October twenty dispersed show so now and less than a week so what are your tickets today tables up to\nEight are available and they include a buffet dinner eight six six eight seven four or five eleven sixty seven to order your taking the Saturday Night October twenty\nI Do smoke ... in North reading eight six six eight seven four or five eleven sixty seven or eight six six eight seven four or five eleven sixty seven\nWeekday mornings with can print that's all my life and ...

I was looking for my iPhone I was going to hold up by a how how you could become a film maker did pretend this is my phone here I I make a lot of young though that's a book that I Know but I'm pretending gets a phone it's not even the sides of the phone this is my film is called up your coat a tablet this is my phone\nIs my phone okay one young filmmaker who was in the crowd\nUndercover\nUndercover wow he was in other words it was kinda like stepping helper trying to uh get George stuff at the George Papadopoulos drug I Wonder if he was on the CIA payroll one young filmmaker who was in the crowd undercover came over to the pen and told me he was too afraid to approach people for interviews\n\nHe's not going to be much of a film maker is zero report or if he's afraid to talk\nTo people who uh who who aren't a fellow pajama boys and trust fund there's like ...\nTurns out he was scared he was scared he was scared\nOf all these deplorable some of them were wearing make America great again hats are bad\nTurns out he was scared and just ended up furtive lead taking photos of people and pretending he was just there for the rally and I'm guessing that they didn't ... that no one really no one thought he was really there for the rally 'cause he was probably whistling to go through the tulips\nRandom ... yeah [laughter] dead giveaway there's no doubt for manned buttons no not not a single wide\n[laughter] not a single one of those restrictions left him too fearful to seek views seen it I think that since I was even make sense\nThe fact that there were ten thousand people plus they're on a rainy Tuesday night left me with the impression that the looming blue wave we still face Syria will still face serious red opposition and surely that's a real story Republicans want to be told\n\nThat's a hell of a piece he so ... so they're the English reporter the only people he talked to the only person he talked to apparently was the young filmmaker who was too frightened\nTo talk to any better players in the audience and even though that all the reporters if I'd been there if Sean Hannity been there\n... they would have been we would have been in the same pet that's that's where they put the press and by the way Hillary Clinton has has a has much had ... many more restrictions on the press than the than Donald Trump ever has\nMajor Garrett the CBS a correspondent you're you're you may remember what he worked for one of the cable news networks now he works for CBS you might as well beyond the witness protection program but he was interviewed the other day and he said you know we have a lot more access to Donald J Trump than we ever had to Iraq Obama or George W.

John\nFake it afternoon alley or back from back on the economy just to think sure a truck Trump's instinct on this side I've been doing this for a long time I've been in the business for Thirty years now Trump's instincts on\nThis call you at the fed is correct for this reason even though rates are relatively low the amount of debt system isn't wasn't absolve in two thousand eight it was just moved around the government took a lot on it and the second point is you know same thing the feds run by a budget academics Powell is a good guy\nBut I don't think the feds missed all three of the last financial crisis and since the debt has has gone up a lot globally\nSwelled changes that race can have huge impacts on the economy in the stock market and so I think Trump's instinct on this is dead right\n... so you're saying it's a ah it's it's a set up or they just best play in their hand\nI don't think it's a set there there there are a couple of members the fat I I'm trying to think there's a woman on there as blonde hair that used to work for Hillary she's a real moon bat and she she was giving money even though she wasn't allowed the Steve ... probably look it up wisely or something other now I think\nI think they don't really they rely on these academic models to model the economy\nAnd they got it wrong and two thousand with the Internet bubble they got it wrong in two thousand eight they were paid at least warned about the mortgage crisis year after year after\nYear yeah I mean the ... and they're going to get out senator ... new to warn them about that and the Democrats said it was racist to try to walk crack down on the uh\nOn the uh the the high risk loans that were being made to to homeowners and uh yeah I mean that was that seems like that was a totally preventable crash in two thousand they wasn't it\nIt it was they were born like I mean Iran mortgage money for years and we saw in two thousand three what was going on you know and I was a city at the time we uh we learned our management to it\nBut when you're given free money out of this with the Democrats are good at nobody wants to hear the consequences of the free money\nSo yeah that was preventable But Trump's instinct I'm telling you what he's dead right on this call them out because people say to me well rates for like three percent there were five or six percent during the you know you know six or seven before the crash then\nIt's not the rate it's the total ... debt in the system so even though rates are lower the interest ... it's just math ... turbines math and so uh I'm not saying there's going to be an immediate crash but the academics that run the fat and they're all academics\nThey really don't get it and uh and so I think Trump is Trump's instinct on that she doesn't just come up with this for a political ploy you know I think that right on this and I tell you that\nKnow this is one of the things that Democrats are are still really a angry about the fact that the Obama just cratered the economy's so bad and there was eight years of malaise and then as soon as Trump got in uh the economy started coming back\nAnd and you know remember the a rubber the fake headlines of a big headline it was a front fake front page of the globe\nTrump or they they said they this nightmare scenario of Trump was elected in one of the big a big parts of their big news front page that they put out in the spring of twenty six team was a Trump elected markets crash and so of course the markets\nAnd been at an all time high and it really bugs up and that's why you see that's one of the things they are uh one of their recurring themes but the but it's that that somehow this is Obama's economy\nThe fact that you know the unemployment rates are at historic lows among the most the demographic groups\nThe fact that the there are more people working today in the United states than at any time in history of the country\nAnd it just really really bugs of and that's why they keep saying it's Obama set this in motion and he's not getting the credit he deserves\nSo is now so if if Obama last week they were complaining that Obama wasn't getting the credit for that he deserved that so I guess this means that\nThings couldn't have changed that much in a week so he must be responsible for the fact that the Dow Jones industrial average has lost fourteen hundred points almost in the last two days right\nRight no that's right oh okay okay I got it\nNow if if something good happens it's Obama's fault if something bad happens uh it's it's to Obama's credit I should say something bad happens it must be a Trump's fault so this is this is the Trump crash\nI can see I can see that the postings on the newspaper or a Facebook message boards now I I think the correct terminology is Trump's slump\nTrump's are you happy now Trump skins takes out your guy 'cause she's got your ... on the orange man\n[noise] cetera et cetera et cetera [noise] somehow we saw [noise]
