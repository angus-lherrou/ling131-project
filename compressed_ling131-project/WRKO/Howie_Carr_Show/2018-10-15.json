Native American it it it could be Hispanic so her name was ... she can change your name from Elizabeth\nWarren to Elizabethan till Warren like the a bust out the Texas Senate candidate whose pretending she's pretending to be an Indian and he's pretending to be Hispanic\nSo my question is if you are one sixty fourth Asian is that enough for Harvard to discriminate against you\nRight I well but anyway listen so here it is so so then about like an hour after they post the story they say a correction\nUm the range isn't from one thirty second to five hundred won five hundred and twelve that's from one thirty second to one one thousand and twenty four\nAnd so again I'm not a I'm I'm not very good at math\nBut I said to myself well if the if the upper range is faults that does at the bottom range have to be false to I mean it's not like basic\nMath\nBut the you know so we used to I we started to refer to it as one sixty fourth and a Breitbart News started referring to it as one sixty fourth but the globe kept running with it because they want to allow all the moon bats they put their Facebook page postings up saying that it's one third that she's she's got evidence\nSuch as it is claiming that she's one thirty second\nBut it was false so finally about a half hour ago they posted a second correction\nSaying but at at most she is one sixty fourth India or Native American or non white and of course here's the thing the average white America\nAnd the average American or European descent has more Native American blood than she apparently does but she is claiming to be in India and she is claiming that she has a right to uh to have gotten and affirmative action position first at the University of Pennsylvania and then at Harvard University law school\nAnd of course we have ... or cook what\nOne fifty five Elizabeth Warren she's a member of she's a Cherokee according to this was before Cherokee and her uh her her she's got several recipes that here they are all lifted from various places my favorite is called omelets with crab meat which lifted from uh New York times spreads cookbook\n\nAll right uh [laughter]\nYou know this is this is just such a such a crock ... and it's so classic of\nThe Democrat Party and the mainstream media the print fake nose and then correct the fake those after the uh after\nThe lives have gone around the world and are are already posted and so tonight I guarantee you if you go to the the usual left wing cable news cast they will still be repeating ally which is already a been retracted\nBy the uh additional fake news outlet to report it the Boston Globe that she's one thirty second India but you know what it doesn't even matter if she's one thirty second Indian that's not good enough the claim to be an Indian\nWhether it's a bureau of Indian affairs standards whether it's the a tribal role\nShe she claims she's part Cherokee part Delaware that's not good enough she's not in India\nIf they if they were printing truthful headlines in the in the op left media the headline would say\nWhite woman's DNA tests prove she's white woman or a DNA test confirm Elizabeth Warren fate is a fake ending 'cause that's what she is she's a fake Indian\nDidn't achieve some attacks there says didn't the Cherokee Nation state that done our ancestry and could not find any connection yes of course yeah she's a she's a fried she's a fraud\nAnd now they're saying that the oh she's she's proven that she's in ... she is she's proven she's proven she's not in India and and we don't even know where this DNA test was non\nShe gave it to some uh Stanford University professor who is a a I guess he's a biochemist these not even a geneticist these of I think a biophysicist\nAnd ... he they let him do the analysis the quote unquote analysis of the DNA and he's and he has given her this uh this this bill of health although it's not a bill of health is just proving she's not in India\nAnd yet they're going to yet this is going to be this'll be today's big ally from the all left media Elizabeth Warren prove she's in India\nNo she's not by the way back in the back and Jim Crow south they used to have this thing called the one drop rule if you were if you had one drop of black blood didn't matter if you were like one sixteenth one thirty one sixty fourth black you were considered black so now lives with

great grandmother\nAnd it's odd that she would be an Indian because she was married to a guy named William Crawford who was a member of the Tennessee militia\nThat rounded up Cherokees from their family homes the southeastern United States and hurting them in the government ... what was then called Ross is landing\nWhich is now Chattanooga, Tennessee that was what a trail of tears started in a deep thirty seven\nSo he was he so he was one of the white man who racially cleanse the uh the the southeast United States and then he married an Indian is that makes sense this is from a Breitbart by the way they also did they also did some research\nAbout some of her other ancestors in the in the old Indian Territory Oklahoma and uh I think her great grandfather was a a was he was he was a sharp shooting you might say and according to a newspaper account from Nineteen hundred or Nineteen oh one I ...\nA drunken Choctaw Indian beat his son severely and uh the grandfather came upon the beating going on and tries tries to stop the Indian and the Indian jumped on a horse and was riding away and so a was with Warren's\nPop Paul Paul I don't know if I don't know great great grandfather whatever\nPulled out his God or his rifle I get I was a rifle and he got and the Indian down was ... who the fleeing drunken Choctaw and they the story said the the Indian was in the hospital a local hospital in critical condition after he got shot by Elizabeth Warren so these are these are the these [laughter]\nThese are her her and says I'm not saying but yeah you know that uh the shooting was unjustified almost killed yet the the other the kid but\nStill I mean now she's telling us She's a ... she was a victim of this terrible racism\nIn a ... and her her parents were a victim of a terrible racism and I again we've we've been over this a million times but it's always knew their their new people that are listening and and watching\nNow ... ... one of her stories is that the is that her parents had to a low in the Nineteen thirties and Depression era era Oklahoma\nBecause there was a such a endemic racism against Native Americans it and ah her her uh her paternal ancestors didn't want a their son\nOr father marrying and indeed\nAnd that that they had to is low to uh to to ah you know to have true love like Romeo and Juliet\nAnd somebody went back in twenty twelve and check out the clip the newspapers the old weekly newspapers in this town where they live in rural Oklahoma and what really happened was that it was everybody was dirt poor gospel you know but at the uh the Joe ... ...\nIt's a rapid cetera everybody was broke\nThey had no money for a a honeymoon or anything like that so they just jumped in their car the to love birds and they drove to the nearest town went into the biggest Protestant Church that wouldn't church\nAnd uh it got married and then they drove back to their own home town and had the reception that night now does that sound to you\nLike in a low but no of course not there was no elope but\nIt's just more more jive just like her her stories about growing up on the jacket or ragged depending on which adjective she wants to

museum\nPeewee peewee treated at Donald Trump hurting making fun of Elizabeth Warren today\nAt the the Boston Globe's never going to report what the Cherokee Nation says they're going to they're going to cover this up for me there are they you know they've been covering this stuff up again remember\nBack in two thousand twelve the uh New England historical genealogical society was asked to take a look at her her background and see if they could discover any\nNative Americans in our family tree\nAnd this is like the the premier a genie a logical rope and the whole country\nThey they totally drew a blank and they announced it they they didn't try to cover it up or anything like that and uh the Harold my newspaper and uh all the other media outlets ran but the New England a story on genealogical site couldn't find anything\nAnd the globe just kept running for weeks that the the New England or historical genealogical size said there was I mean they just made it up\nThey just made it a they don't care\nThat this ... this is how they operate eight four for five hundred forty to forty two that is the toll free number of the highway car show if you if you want to join us now and the weirdest\nThing how we are just just looking at the home page of the Boston Globe and they haven't updated their story to include the statement from the Cherokee Nation funny funny thing\nThey're still reeling from the series of corrections they've had the issue on their fuzzy math you know\nAnd again they they just they they they put out the fake statistics that she was really wants that she might be one thirty second India and then the she was no less than one five hundred and twelve Indian\nAnd that was that was bogus ... that was bogus first they correct that half of it and then they had to correct the whole thing the whole state but the cheese actually at most one sixty fourth and be an at most leader own\nStatistics or her own DNA quote unquote pass from some lab that we don't even know where it is and their fudging the numbers anyway\nSo I mean it's it's totally meaningless and then they come up bad they the numbers are meaningless to begin with and they and they ... they fudge him and that don't change it and tell a after every moon bad in the country has said well she proof she was in India\nNo no she didn't prove she was an Indian not at all to add your next with highway car go ahead Ted\nYeah I mean this is somewhat related to the Elizabeth Warren matter of the Harvard\nCase relating to the discrimination against Asians yes a ... practice I Associated Press just\nCame out with an article about well more than a half an hour ago and the title says Harvard all one race can only help never harm applicants\nChances now that the greatest mind that there are right and all of it but I mean correct me if I'm wrong but if you're if you're helping someone based on race you have to be hurting somebody else right\nWell if there's if there's to say two thousand slots in each class that is a finite number right Ted so for every person you if every person you accept that ... that is at least one person in probably ten at Harvard or five that aren't going to get in right\nThe math as far as I'm concerned yeah no it's it's ridiculous thanks for the call I\nAte for four or five hundred forty to forty two oh five oh wait says can you explain why this doesn't prove she's Indian how we\nYeah\nUnder tribal laws under the bureau of Indian affairs under the Cherokee nation's own statement this proves she's not in India\nAnd if you look at the fine print of the DNA report in their own words they use the Peruvian Colombian Mexican DNA so if anything it proves that her ancestor six generations ago was Peruvian Colombian or Mexican yeah\nShe she claimed that that that she was a victim or her mother was a victim of discrimination and that she had a high cheekbones\nBecause she was an idiot how could how can you have ... how can you have Indian ah physical characteristics which she claimed she did if you're only one one thousand India\nIs everything she said about her heritage is a lie and that includes the an end to the end if you if you if you don't want to accept that then uh you know you're you're in for another a rude surprise at the polls if not in twenty eight teams certainly uh twenty twenty\nRob your next with highway car go ahead Rob\nHi
