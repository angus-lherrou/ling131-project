I think it will be six\nIt's all because they're because wherever there are large margins Amazon come in and disrupted them and there's no industry that is better margins than the mattress industry yeah well they're willing to lose money\nAmazon yeah they've shown that uh they become more disciplined about that in recent years which is one of the reasons why the stock is doing well but uh this is a new\nMattress from out of business and then raise the prices Russia that that's that's how they do but the mattress\nCompanies are are making so much money you can go to small towns that have very little in terms of commerce and they have a beautiful mattress store and part of that is because I was listening on freakonomics broadcast that said you could just like two or three ... week really and make pretty good money because there's so much profit in it good business to be in the U.S [noise]\nApplications decline at Harvard Wharton and other elite business schools as the degree and we're talking about an MBA loses its appeal to young people us business schools received a hundred and forty thousand applications that may sound like a lot but it's down seven percent\nAnd there's definitely a lot more competition so if you wanted to go to the good news is if you if you wanted to go to a really good school and you got decent grades\nAnd your way to pay for it yup got pretty good chance of getting in\nYou do have a good chance of getting in a day but the the the kids must feel that doesn't have the value right I think there is that feeling that ah that the MBA has lost them with value else the job market's good now right the job market was it was terrible\nBut the if you're a bright young person with you know say three to five years of business experience\nYeah why why go back to grad school you're you're already making good money I you know I think that's the reason I think that even though the ironically because the economy's doing so well\nYou can get a really good job without an MBA right and and the NBA your applications are hurt on two ways\nIn bad times people don't go there because no one's hiring people the MBA [laughter] and and good times you don't need them be I Do remember back in two thousand nine people who graduate and they'd say on the job market's just terrible I was going to go back and I'll go to grad school\nFor two years and hopefully the economy will turn around by eleven or twelve or through you know it was a period of time there were a lot of people are going back to law school in grad school because you know you're going to make any money anyway yeah so uh it's it's a challenging situation we've talked about every situation is different\nFor a lot of people in the NBA can you really can raise the ceiling of what they can earn\nBy a lot for a lot of other people it's not necessarily a good day on the market so far ... up five points the doubts of a hundred and twenty nine points excuse me yes in ... five points the NASDAQ is twelve\nAnd the price of crude oil we didn't get to talk about it today but I I got to tell you frankly I'm very nervous but ...

down on a pledge to vote on the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh later this week while he continues to criticize Democrat um across maybe try to\nMove the goalposts every five minutes but their goal as not moved an\nOpening the Senate today McConnell again accused Democrats of continuing a strategy of obstruction and delayed delayed delay but minority leader Chuck Schumer rejected the criticism\nThat she felt claustrophobic she felt traumatized she felt anxious she felt all broken on the inside because they were she wanted a second front door because she needed an exit door because that's how much the trauma affected her thirty some years later so the door was not put up\nThey were debating the door the husband did not understand according to her why do you need a door\nIt's going to make the house look aesthetically ugly we'd only a second front door let's talk it out with a therapist and see what your desiring and wanting a second front door\nVessel by what if you\nLook at it now that's even beyond the therapists notes if you are\nLook at when the door itself was installed it was installed a full year at a minimum before two thousand and twelve in fact there are records that now state it may have been installed as early as two thousand and eight\n\nAnd not only was it installed years before she said we were debating we were discussing it he didn't understand why I wanted to second door to be built but more than that they were running a business out of their home one door was residential the other door was commercial\nSo that means at the heart of her story is another massive lie\nIt is an ally upon lies upon lies upon lies [noise] never mind that the three witnesses that cheap places at the scene of the alleged sexual assault and this is to me maybe the most fundamental of all points\n\nDon't just don't corroborate or substantiate what she says\nThey actually directly repudiate and refused to her allegations this is not as Rachel Mitchell put it this is not a he said she said it's much in her words weaker than that because mark judge denies it in fact he says it never happens she's making it up\nPatrick Smith PJ as she calls him denies it says I don't know what she's talking about this never happened even her lifelong friend her best friend at the time said it never happened if couldn't have happened how do you know Leland because I never met or saw Brett Kavanaugh ever\nAnd she alleges that I was at that party that I ran into him as he came into the house and I ran into him as he came down to check the stairs allegedly after is attempting to assault or so her own three witnesses directly refute and repudiate what she's saying\nNever mind now all the other allies that are being uncovered\nSo what we have here are not just unsubstantiated claims she's a liar\nShe's a complete liar who is now being caught in all of her lies all over false allegations all of her inconsistencies now as for Deborah Ramirez the other two are even easier\nDeborah Ramirez claims that he exposed this private parts to her at a party at Yale when they were both freshman\nEvery person she says that was in that room says it never happened her allegations have been directly refuted in fact there's even one more that the mainstream media won't tell you now some of her former yell\nClassmates are saying I Do recall a party where somebody did expose themselves but it wasn't Brett Kavanaugh it was a completely other boy I guess then young men\nThat's why Ramirez was calling up her classmates saying was it Brett Kavanaugh I Can't collect now I I don't think it is her stories are bogus her allegations are bogus and then there's Julie sweat Nick\nAnd I'm going to get to that later this hour\nThat word she now is backtracking on her court claims the one that said there was a gang rape network and that Brett Kavanaugh was at the epicenter of this gang rape network allegations that are so ridiculous so preposterous they don't even pass the laugh test\nThink about it if I'm going to get she's backtracking completely Michael ... has committed professional suicide\nThat the mainstream media even around with the Julie sweat and the story should be to their eternal shame this was garbage think about it just common sense she's alleging that she went to Penn consecutive gang rape parties where she witnessed gang rapes taking place\nWith apparently Kavanaugh and mark judge as the big ringleaders where dozens and dozens and dozens of girls were systematically raped like at some kind of a un war crimes tribunal investigation\nAnd all of these women were raped by all of these boys over so many parties and no one not one pulled a friend or family member apparent somebody's teacher at high school a police report anybody nothing\nAnd then after she witnesses nine ten of these gang rapes she keeps going to every party and eventually she allegedly gang raped herself\nAlthough now she's singing a bit of a different tune is BS after BS after BS this is nothing more than a coordinated smear campaign and what you see happening now\nIs now the sex allegations are blowing up in the Democrats face\nSweat Nick went down last night in our interview with NBC News I'm going to play a part of it Deborah Ramirez is laughable and now Christine forward thanks to the corner man\nIs now being completely and utterly exposed on every level as having lied and misled the country misled the Judiciary Committee and having perpetrated a fraud\nSo now the Democrats have changed their line of attack\nThey're now moving the goalposts now he didn't attempt to rape her now he didn't attempt to sexually assaulted her\nNow they're claiming he shouldn't be on the high court for another reason was that the reason I've got that your reaction next\nTo our car Well Jeff flake we told you this would happen\nMore than two minutes after the weak link senator from Arizona's decided to subordinate FBI investigation to

they're trying to cover up for Christine Blasey Ford is now becoming more obvious by the hour by the second by the day so listen now to this again hot tip the gateway bonded\nIn Nineteen eighty five which is ...\nThe way the time that she told her therapist she was sexually assaulted or allegedly sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford not the early Nineteen eighties she added that later\nSo she claimed this was about the time but she was sexually assaulted when she spoke to her therapist okay was about eighty five eighty six anyway let that go in Nineteen eighty five Christine Blasey Ford was still living in Potomac, Maryland I Know Potomac, Maryland very nice area\nHowever\nOn June fourteenth Nineteen eighty five Christine was a Christine Blasey Ford was arrested at a traffic stop and given a ticket in the\nCapital our cat all by how you pronounce it cannabis county okay cannabis county North Carolina now no big deal\nShe was charged with a traffic misdemeanor no problem it was disposed of on September eleven Nineteen eighty five I've had tickets you fat tickets that's fine that's life\nHowever however\nThree days later June seventeenth Nineteen eighty five and\nA cat a cannabis county on that day\nThere were two alleged arrests involving Christine Blasey Ford\nHowever\nIt doesn't say exactly what she was arrested for it just said that this was not a misdemeanor case type was quote\nCriminal\nSomething criminal modern misdemeanor but it's a felony something criminal took place\nNow we don't know\nBecause I assume she was still a minor then or whatever Eighteen or whatever still young\nBut it was something criminal what we do know\nHopefully we'll find out soon but what is even more interesting and I think extremely telling is she delivered the letter to Dianne Feinstein in late July\nGuess what happened just several weeks before she delivered the letter\nTake your gas tank of gas\nChristine Ford's criminal record was scrubbed clean on the\nDatabase there just suddenly puff it disappeared\nThey scrubbed clean somebody went in there and scrub it traffic violation is no big deal but for whatever she was arrested for as a potential felony or whatever it was a crime\nThat something else so they have to clean up her background to make or seem as plausible unbelievable as possible\nNow\nLook at what they're accusing Kevin of day how come they're not digging into her past how come they're not digging into her background\nI'll tell you why\nBecause she's been used\nThey told her I don't think this began in late July I'm gonna I'm gonna go out on a limb here but I'm I'm a hundred percent confident they just didn't happen in late July they didn't just willy nilly get this out of the blue and say oh look at this time we got a shuttle disregard no no no no they were planning this for months\nThey knew that when Kavanaugh was named came up they had to get somebody that they could grown that day could coach that they could prepare they have to scrub or criminal background\nThey have to make sure that are therapists notes would never be released and then they sat on it they lawyer to her up\nAnd they made sure it was democratic operative lawyers lawyers that they could trust that they could control that could make sure that they were on the same page all espousing in spouting off the same talking points\nAnd pour Kavanaugh meets with Diane Feinstein on August twenty for a private one on one discussion\nAnd none of this was mentioned nothing then they conduct all these hearings in public nothing\nNothing Grassley didn't know Lindsey Graham didn't know Ted Cruz didn't know nobody on the ... nobody\nKnew what saying Brett Kavanaugh certainly didn't know\nThen they hearing is closed and they go behind closed doors\nAnd when you go behind closed doors this is a very key point just happens to every judicial nominee then in private they all look drugs gambling debts credit card debt or anything booze alcohol anything that can be used to blackmail you on the high court we need to know now let it all out\nThey didn't ask them a thing about this nothing vanish two days away from being confirmed shutdown baby that's when they dropped it and they\nOrchestrated and have orchestrated the whole thing right up until now and Jeff Flake is going along with this first and you have these clowns these rhino Republicans saying like Jeff Flake over\nAfter hours ... from around\nThe Democrats aren't after truth this was a set up it's been one big set up and the strategy was\nYes smear him and your smear I'm having a smear him and now notice it's\nNo longer sex 'cause that's all been exposes a bunch of ... is a bunch of lies so now he's a drunk now he's an alcoholic now he's got anger management issues destroy this guy's credibility that's\nWhat this is now all about the fact that his life is destroyed the fact that his wife slices destroyed the fact that his children's life is destroyed\nThey don't care the ends justify the means\nKavanaugh must go down the left must protect its power and ultimately this is a dress rehearsal to impeach the president of the United states [noise] Gary in California you're up next to go ahead Gary\n... H A buddy I Love you and they were what birds\nThat their Gary [laughter] what's on your mind by there and\n... whatever you say I haven't experts say that I go to release in two days you've got me

country we are caught in the middle it was ... the firing squad ... swelled in Washington\nAnd the media propaganda machine ... to me that the atmosphere the cabinet or hearing says go any better it's clear that you just get worse to the point where I keep saying over and over and over again this is the perfect example of the fact that we need\nTo limit to Washington that will dry up this world\nAnd they try a media propaganda machine which is whipping it into a frenzy\nWhen are we going to alert when are we going to do something about when that happens it will only be Americans find is that it will evaporate and dry up the socialist movement in this country\nGary let me tell you something thank you for that call I think this is going to blow up and the Democrats his face I can already see the black the backlash building look at North Dakota\nHeidi Heitkamp democratic senator she's now down ten points against a Republican opponent she's up for election in November ... ten point swing is in the wake of the Kavanaugh what do you want to call it a smear campaign\nThe officers and the columnist goes on\nTo say that she should not be around children on basketball courts\nAnd not only that he is such a danger to children he is such a pedophile he is such a rapist he's such a sexual predator\nThat they even now have contacted the archdiocese of Washington because Kevin are just so that you know not only teaches his girls basketball teams but he also teaches a for kids in the Catholic youth organization\nAnd so what the article now says this quote\nCredibly accused sex offenders\nShould not coach use basket ball girls or boys without deeper investigation so now USA Today through this Guy Davis the ... are now putting pressure on the archdiocese of Washington to say he should not be allowed to coach basketball now or ever\nNot just for his girls basketball team but for any team in the Catholic youth worth or youth organization\nThe spokesman for the archdiocese of Washington has said what\nWe did multiple background checks multiple and not only that he hasn't been convicted of a crime you want us to throw him out\nAnd prevent them from coaching basketball\nBased on an allegation an accusation that has never been proven\nAnd the reason why they're going after him now is because she admitted this should never have admitted this because now they're using his love and his passions against him remember when he said this in front of the committee roll it written\n\nFor the past seven years\nI've coached by two daughters basketball teams\nYou saw many of those girls when they came to my hearing for a couple of hours\nYou have a letter from the parents of the girls I coached that describe my dedication commitment and character\nI coached because I Know that girls confidence on a basketball court translates into confidence in other aspects of life [noise]\nI Love coaching more than anything I've ever done in my whole life\nBut thanks to what some of you on this side of the committee of on leash I may never be able to coach again\nYou're never going to coach again I'm telling you are right now
