I'm telling you right\nNow take down my number right now get that pen and paper eight five five three one eight eight three eighty seven have them give me a\nCall and we will talk to them about how we can help them a sense they qualify for mass out the Medicaid and protect a portion of their you know ... if not all the assets okay right but yes planning for the unexpected is extremely important you know planning for retirement and itself\nThough is is is important you know planning for life in general when you get to the point of not working any longer\nIs is of course important you know so we always tell families when they when they come in and see us you know the first appointment that we have just to kind of reiterate well first of all you got to call us right so you got to pick up the phone and give us a call\nEight five five three one eight eight three eight seven you set up an appointment you come in\nThat first meeting that we have is just going to be an open dialogue between you and I in your family to discuss what your concerns are what your needs are and where you're at in retirement\nAnd then what we're going to do is we're really going to break into your portfolio and figure out first of all running in the morning star report you know seeing seeing what types of fees your pain do it or the analysis right\nFigure out the standard deviation ride I you know what what does that mean well how much your asset how much your return can fluctuate\nEither down or up you know what are the you know if\nYou have an eight percent or or if you have a five percent return but or twelve years a standard deviation well that's not that's not good it means in deviate quite a bit so\nThe bottom line is you come in and we'll do a morning star report and see what the average return is we'll see what your greatest thirty day last could be you know we had the two thousand eight where we lost thirty eight percent and and the centrally a day and the S. and P. five hundred I mean when that was a terrible as an off year\nBut you know we want to know what your greatest opportunity for losses as well as what your greatest opportunity for earnings are um then\nWe can say what would you say is the most common things that are your clients should bring in on that first meeting I mean aside from a ... like they've got their whole shoe box of life if you will a with accounts or various account acts return all their okay statements\nA tax returns are extremely important you know that's another thing we're going to do it we're going to do a tax analysis right we need to see how we can lower taxation of retirement so there's two things that can really affect your return and we talked about this earlier\nTaxes and fees right\nYou know you got to make sure that you're not paying ridiculous fees\nAnd we'll put like several put your portfolio through the uh you know through the scan scan your cart as we talked about before right will scan your cart through the uh scan your portfolio make sure that you're not paying too much in fees uh and\nReally break things down and then will establish a plan for you you know that has a good income guaranteed income for like ... making sure that your rebalancing not take it on too much risk\nSo I let I still have to say I've got X amount of money or you know all these accounts and stuff and but my dream of what I Want to do retirement exceeds what I have\nBrought in so what do you tell us then and I mean do you say well you're if you want to uh try and you know expand your income here are the options that you can\nDo yeah yeah so so we'll we'll try to see what well first of all you're just basing it on your own calculations right\nMost most likely they're not accurate right okay you know like I said we we had a lady come in a you know that was taken a thousand dollars out of her ah IRA every month and ... and she had worked out that she could take a thousand dollars out of her IRA based on her returns\nEvery month and she would run out of money at age Ninety\nWell we were able to practically double that\nAnd she was never going to run out of it even if she lived to be a hundred and twenty\nSo she was astounded she was in you know she was on cloud nine she was a dream we have very so that you know that we're going to you know that's also we're going to look at your income ... how we can\nHelp you benefit your income so these are all the things the Social Security analyze or you know analyze what is the best tend to take Social Security if your financial professional has not done these things
