United States and Saudi Arabia right we\nBoth wanted high prices between those two countries we produce twenty twenty five percent so if they could clued\nThose two countries could absolutely keep the prices high no question about that but you know ... and I think we've both been kind of bowls on the issue of prices and and also I think I don't know about you know I I've been a bull on some of these oil companies be honest with you\nI think they're pretty good value they're good ... that's what I was trying to get out of balance sheets the cars investors are staying away from they are and uh I I think\nYour profits collectively their profit reports have been fantastic and I know believe all the sectors I Believe the biggest increases in earnings have come in the major oil companies where they got to those companies they got rid of literally\nHundreds of thousands of workers\nAnd billions of dollars of expense\nWhen the price went down what did we go down to like twenty something briefly yeah and it's it's been steadily up since then these companies are sitting on Ninety billion dollars of excess cash\nMaybe it's a question of you know were they going to put that to work but investors some reason are still skeptical of these companies will continue to exercise the discipline they've had and let's face it buried at the at the you know hanging over this market\nIs a long long long term reality\nThat there will be much oil used by the world every alternative fusion energy and incrementally every day\nThe percent of oil we use and developed countries is coming down you know you look at you just look at how much solar you see around how much when you're starting to see and we're in the instance of that whole sector so that you look at alternative energy\nOne could say that where I I think the total ... it's not even like two percent\nIt's it's nothing and when you violate value company is the discounted valued today of all of the future cash flows what is the future cash flows because there's going to learn in Thirty years you know they're owed them they're going to get into that I noticed right like Exxon Mobil will take over the wind sector and like ...\n... wouldn't you in the convenience store sector or some yeah you're right so I mean but there is that question of of you know their game right now is not going to be the same game a generation from now but I I Would argue in the meantime this can be a lot of money to be made in these companies are in great shape\nMarket is down I ... you look at stocks you know the Dow is down four hundred and sixty eight points we're down five hundred points maybe an hour ago the deaths that goes down more than the Dow the NASDAQ down to point zero three percent and where's the Dallas only down one point eight percent\nThe S. and P. is down one point nine percent crude oil we were just talking about the oil is out two dollars and fifty four sets a barrel at sixty six eighty two and a ten year treasury note is trading at three Thirteen in terms of the yield on that on\nStarting to get a mortgage is coming down with your family loves you yes yes what would hold them hugged them\nYesterday [laughter] CNBC turned on the TV and do all of your ...

D. to Boston and I are radio station [noise] what's going\nThat this would put Trump in a corner or forcing him to either stepped down from his positions or potentially roll out the military\nAnd uh they thought that was going to hurt him in the elections because it would play well off are Democrats who are looking for women supporters not playing that way at all\nAnd uh in fact my latest forecast models show as a result of this crisis on top of the Brett Kavanaugh crisis uh for additional\nSee they're swinging toward Republicans in the house one additional Senate seat is swinging toward Republicans so this is having an impact on the election\nThat is a pretty powerful but the word we hear at least from the pundits course on the Democrats' side they think they're going to win the house and they think that those are very close states are going to go Democrat but it seems to me\nThat the moderates I've always thought and it's pretty clear that the independents are the ones who determine these elections in the end\nAnd it seems to me that whatever problems they may have had with Trump and those seem to be diminishing because he's not been as a boisterous with his rhetoric lately as he was in the past is being much more restrained and even his tweets present things and reasonable fashioned common sense fashion\nI simply think that their independence or going to say that he's the right person at the right time to protect the border or to to bring back some form of of civility because if you want to talk about his brash this tweeting look at the Democrats and\nThe left wing or or going interrupting people's dinners interrupt the kicking them out of restaurants doing all of these sorts of things that make Donald Trump looked like a kid on the block\nAbsolutely oh let me say something too about the latest numbers you know Nate Silver came out with their updated a\nWebsite information and that but you notice that\nTheir results tend to be oriented around polling you know the the average of polls in this race or that race in his Nate Silver even pointed out ah\nAnd he is you know one of the ones the Democrats like to follow a point that that a lot of districts they don't have any polls on at all and others are are over poll a but once again the problem\nAh with Nate Silver estimate that eighty percent likelihood of a ... house going a Democrat is the fact\nThat it's relying on poles who I fundamentally disagree with because I think the polls\nAre reflecting old modeling and old models and they're not up to date with the trans then I\nI've documented a lot of trends in my writings about what trends are going on in the electorate the move from identity politics to tribal politics and and on and on and on and on and so I think that's the reason why I disagree so strongly\nAgainst the the general polling results and then the aggregator\nAppalling ah people like Nate Silver and that by the way is the reason I think Nate Silver was wrong and twenty sixteen and of course my electoral college forecasts was almost precisely on target\nYeah I remember you and I want to confirm that because you had said for six months before the election\nThat the president would get the well now president then candidate Trump would get a three hundred and twenty two electoral votes he got three oh six you couldn't have been any closer and if he got New Hampshire which she probably did a uh although it didn't go his way in the end or it would have been even that much closer so I mean you are right on point\nWell you know what every state Trump carried I predict it correctly and\nI also predicted he would would weigh in New Hampshire and I still think he wanted but your six six thousand votes that are in question about whether or not\nThat some folks across the border into New Hampshire given their lenient ability uh taken voters and they cross back to their home state after the election after voting for Hillary so I still think I was right and New Hampshire should have gone to trial I wouldn't\nBe a let me ask you I I I Know it's not going to be good news but let me just ask you start out with 'cause we had a long conversation on this program yesterday about Jeff deal\nAnd or his campaign against Elizabeth Warren a lot of people feel as though he's not being strong enough is being polite as being a gentleman which is a nice thing to do but in this game of politics especially with Elizabeth Warren you've got to be tough\nUh and people some people feel he's not been tough enough in the debates when I Know that for the last six months or at least since June anyway it's been about fifty five to thirty approximately her lead or give or take a couple of points here or there that's a huge leap a what do you make of that race if anything\nIt's much closer than that now right now ah and I'm Talking about literally right at the moment I cuss forecast models can change do change but right at the moment I give her very slight when\nReally so in other words over the next two weeks\nA pickle ... that it could still change and and have you know it uh one of the great hosts in the city of Boston for many years a legendary Williams used to say that events will dictate events that are beyond anybody's control\nWill dictate oftentimes what happens in an election an over these next two weeks no one really has control over whatever events might take place you can have control over your response but not necessarily over the event and so a ... who knows what may happen even in the commonwealth of Massachusetts\nOh absolutely I I mean the entire a thing about DNA testing that Elizabeth Warren participated in that guy that really put ... on her face in terms of the electorate and I think that the cost or two or three percentage points believe it or not\nI think that the one one thousand and twenty fourth\nIndian blood or I might have that for all I Know but uh but uh you know and plus it may be even been from South America it may not have even been a North American a Native American blood it may the ... the DNA expert who did it said it might have been South America\nYeah because that that it it just the way the testing is done uh there's no way to pinpoint that one\nOne one thousand twenty four that's to the tenth power by the way for the mathematicians listening you know that are really was most likely a South American blood as opposed to Native American because the sample sizes so small so\nI'm right back then pick it up there let's\nSee if there is no conclusion about her being a Cherokee Indian by any\nLaw and they and they of course criticized there\nAs the state of the Cherokee tribe or made it very clear that she was inappropriate about this whole thing will come

senior strategic analysts they turned to him when they need the best general how are you sir nice to talk to you\nI'm doing well Mike are you so\nI'm doing well except I Would have enjoyed to have you on today talking about a Dodger Yankee World Series knowing that you're from the Bronx and I'm from Brooklyn\nYeah it would have been something special to shore yeah that would actually anyway like most other small bags are looking for the next year [laughter]\nYeah it's always ... that are looking for the next year or the twenty nine and about a week or two I guess I'm just general let me start with something that's been\nPicking my interest of the president's with regard to this what could be a dangerous situation at the border is talking about bringing in the military now you are a four star general retired uh you could have been there as a commander in chief\nSaying to you relive send those troops what would you say given the fact that our military is supposed to be protecting us externally not domestically is is is there a problem there\n[noise] yeah well there are I mean we can use the United states military shortly after two purposes or being the homeland one that is obviously purpose number want us to defend against an invasion\nAnd number two is to deal with an insurrection and in the in the second one we have we have the extended that to mean hum when we've had why as some some of our cities that will be on the control of police departments and they were asking for\nFor federal assistance sometimes we have deployed our military to do that\nAnd that is well within the legal authority\nThey in Beijing issue is is what the president would be using here\nUh with the so called caravan people that are heading heading towards the United states um the employing the national guard right now there's Twenty one hundred of them they're being used under a different title is referred to his title thirty two\nAnd where the national guard is employed as state militia\nBut to assist or a federal agency in this case is the customs and border patrol that they're assisting but they cannot perform a law enforcement and function they could only provide a support role\nSo the president wouldn't be able to use the national guard in that role to block the border because they could only reinforce what customs are doing he would have to go to federal forces and then use the the legal authority\nOf quote an invasion as the the legal justification to employ those forces I Do think that probably would be a legal challenge to them in doing that also I'm\nA pretty obvious reason that people will say that's really not an invasion of the people that violated our border um but they're\nThey're not suggesting that there's going to be any violence or harm done as a result of that but I'm not I'm not I don't know how the legal argument would be structured I'm not a lawyer but or something along those lines I I think would be the basis for the challenge\nHair always a pleasure to speak with the general journalist turned to um Saudi Arabia mystic shockey I'll just very briefly here\nAh what is a very complicated situation that sometimes some of the medium make very simplistic to if they did this let's just cut ties and all of that sort of thing but we've got a complicated mess here because Saudi Arabia is part of a group of Arab countries Sunni Arab countries\nWorking with the Jared Kushner and David Friedman are ... Israel on a peace plan Saudi Arabia has been talking to Israel for a couple of years privately\nThey are uh they realize that run as the bigger problem by far than Israel Israel is not really a problem to Saudi Arabia militarily they they're going to get along and we also have the hundred billion plus military sale to Saudi Arabia or what happens to that so even if the prince\nWere involved Mohammed bin Salman or in this killing can we just say the Saudi Arabia see you later or do we have too much complication and connection to them that we can't afford to do that\nYeah we have for the U.S national interest here where we are definitely\nInterested in a stable Middle East ... percent of the world's economy is dependent on Middle East oil and were connected to that\nBecause of our allies and and the global and we want to have us stability of the global economy and then we come down to the regional issue certainly of Iran and the strategic threat that that presents to the middle east and this president\nUh began standing up against Iran last year and his visits to the middle east when he stood there were fifty five leaders ah an entire region and told them that he would be standing shoulder to shoulder with them against a strategic threat\nTo the peace and stability of the ... which is a wrong and also that he would work with them to stamp out a radical Islam which the middle east the breeding ground for so we have significant national interest and\nIts colliding with our values and these are challenges that\nEvery American president and I think a says the modern era of global responsibility post World war two has had to deal with\nAnd I think it's something we can work our way through 'em and uh but I Do believe that\nFor us to come out of this or we're going to need some cooperation from the Saudi is that right now\nIt doesn't seem to make much sense you know their narrative a fistfight leading to a a premeditated that killing a is ... is on the surface of it and the fact that the regime is trying to absolve itself but any responsibility whatsoever\nAnd suggest to the world that their security agents who are all government employees operating under the auspices of the intelligence directorate applies to a foreign country and kills a Saudi national who's an international court of the regime\nThe thought that this is some kind of rogue operation is also cautious because they're operating in in in concert with\nCurrent Saudi policy and current Saudi culture and environment\nAnd they you know for a fact that every one of those men who was on that mission believe that they were doing something on behalf of the state and it was certainly legal what we're doing and there were there to protect the regime are we going to solve the horrific nature of it\nOr none of them thought they were criminals and that they was subsequently be arrested and\nCharged with murder all of which I think it was justified but I'm going back to the problem is that\nThe Saudis are trying to absolve himself this responsibility\nAnd at some point this narrative has got to change I'm hoping that the secretary of paper was coaching them through this so that in time when they complete the investigation that could come forward and say something like this uh look we're taking a close look at this\nWe recognize that we have culpability here and we're going to make some changes based on this horrible as that and and and and trust these problems internally something to that effect they've got to find the words to do that because they have to rebuild trust with us Mike\nAnd right now we've lost confidence in them all over this issue was is they haven't been transparent with us and they're certainly while charging Eighteen people that may have been involved in a sense of in a\nBit but it still trying to maintain that the regime itself has no culpability here or there is is is not going to contribute to a lasting relationship so I Do think the Saudis will eventually change their narrative that I'm I'm hoping that we're we're participating in that process what\nWould it be advisable in the end for the king the same ... been Solomon is or not they're not going to exceed to the ah monarchy or that he really appoint somebody else and other relatives rather than him\nYeah well I think that's that's something I don't think we should be involved in and I know we have you know people have suggested that Lindsey Graham who's a good friend\nA partially outraged by what took place here because he was such a supporter of more of a been so long and uh and I understand that but that that's their call and I I think if if\nIf they don't believe if they believe that ... have been some or all NBS as these calls for short I'm just so weakened that he's not going to be able to carry through with this transformation strategy which by the way most of us who knows something about the middle east is you know like\nA is economic social or religious reform or just desperately needed and ah he had the model cars to put forth a very ambitious programs to achieve those funds and it's one of the reasons why he's quite popular side of the country because Seventy percent\nOf the population of Saudi Arabia is thirty or under a he's promising them work social outlets recreational outlets that they've never had\nAn also pushing back on the right wing clerks the hobbyists who had been the gateway to radical Islam for years and it was a gateway to nine eleven uh and so all of those things are very positive but they're also has been some dictatorial controlling\nA policy that the he's been responsible for where he's been criticized for the ... and I think of it comes to the conclusion that his son is a no longer able to to achieve objectives because he's so we can politically than actually than they probably make a change\nAnd then with them look good to the world got a couple of minutes is let me ask you quickly\nOr John Bolton is gone to Russia having meetings um Mikhail Gorbachev I Believe lives in San Francisco now who had great respect for President Reagan\nAnd he and Reagan signed the intermediate nuclear arms limitation agreement and I'm Gorbachev is saying it would be wrong for the president I think he was responsible\nTo leave that treaty what do you make of that\nNo I think it's appropriate that we leave and and and here's why Russia was developed a a ... a land based a cruise missile in violation of the treaty and\nAnd they they fully you know that the only way to get the Russians attention on this is to do with the president is doing and that is to pull away from it\nAnd I do believe that who will eventually come to the table and negotiate on this end because I remember a number of months ago he was asked a question about the eye of the treaty and the violation of it\nAnd he said well that's debatable or whether it's a violation of the United states is in violation also not a true um but then he said this but it's a point of negotiation\nAs ... and and I think that's real who as he's a dealmaker at the end and listening given the rapid militarily development of the Chinese we have got to pull them into this uh they were excluded\nAt the time because they didn't have the capability but the Chinese military and best when there's been rapid is the most rapid it in the world today\nAnd that they have the capability as well so I think we can get back up and with the Russians but to pull out is the first step to actually come to some negotiated agreement and we have to bring the Chinese into it it might be\nYou know the art of the deal or that he did that with tariffs and using that as livers doing the same thing here is you're pointing out general it's always a pleasure a good ... good luck continued success as you have always had and we'll look forward to talking to you again real soon thanks being on the program sir\nYeah and good luck for the red Sox fans out there tonight\n[laughter] good to talk to affect you in spite of ... says go Red Sox how 'bout that these are the bird diplomatic shall we say I were to come\nBack stay on the line if you're there if you want to call feel free to do it on anything we talked about during this hour or other matters six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight\nSix one seven six six sixty eight sixty eight of the voice of Boston W. or kale Mike Segal Geoff good a good to have you with us it is now one o'clock see on the other side [noise]\nI Believe it was an eighty eight 'cause shockey was embedded with al ... hung around with the Osama bin Laden excessively and during the Afghanistan situation so um there's a lot more behind this but is still on the surface\nIt it's the look of we have a bad guy or the the only thing shockey did do we know of is to write negatively about Saudi Arabia now if you were a problem with regard to um if you want to call a treason if you want if they had evidence of that\nAre in a free society at least most of the time you don't just committed an assassination what'd you do is uh have a trial or having the ability to put the person behind bars and leave it at that\nUnfortunately this turned out to be a real problem and unless Saudi Arabia where to come clean with evidence about what he did and why they did it or we're going to be left just um\nBasically staring at the when we have nothing to go on with that publicly unless they come out in and say that that was the reason they did this\nOpen some and Mike it's been trying to clean up the mess that is in Saudi Arabia or you know with the general Keane mentioned about the ...\nAnd he he was ... he was trying to tamp down a little bit but then some and we're not going to allow ... to take him in the Muslim Brotherhood which is poison is we all know involved in it and and the government and\nYeah the ... the ... the kingdom but you know here in the United states all of a journalist they fall all over the Muslim Brotherhood they Jen you flick to them and they get their rings so\nI find it I think you know for for everybody talking about let's leave Saudi Arabia alone I got his interject who was it that got on his hands and knees to the king of Saudi Arabia and and a kiss to pose the rear end who was that as president\nBorrow was a vial Obama\nLike owns the Toro he's\nOnly a few different names so you so you met the same guy going\nYes absolutely in in in the media here in this country just I cannot believe how the whole thing they are to the Muslim Brotherhood I I just I Can't believe that even some of our elected officials I I'm astounded by\nWhile I'm more of a you know that's one thing but I'm astounded by the media and on and and the illiterates journalistically at CNN Tony ... you\nKnow we ... we learned nothing after the holy land trials did we Michael\nNot a thing and that was a another story where a listen yet care involved with the council on American Islamic Relations was involved in that one but\nThey didn't even around here narrative freely doing what they want to do thank you for calling to talk to you like\nIt's going to rush in Boston hello Russ you're on the voice of Boston W. or kale\nFirst of all I'd like to thank you for having to great guests on you know one way one of his political and put the other thing is the general is one of the few talking heads but I always look forward to his commentary is actually when it comes to foreign affairs and also in in the defense of this country and\nSo and the gas to\nThe best by the way he ... he wouldn't\nTell you this um but he um obviously was offered situations in the administration I'll leave it at that\nAnd he likes being a private he likes being on the outside in the private sector he's he's very close to General Mattis\nAnd he gets his information directly from the top secretary of defense or very close to General Kelly or they're all very close colleagues and he's a a General Keane is premier courses yeah man you may not like that but go ahead\nOkay no\nSome of the United states set of the United States Congress men drive me crazy when they fall in the mouth and then make it difficult for the front of the United states\nAnd at our other officials then I got ... to try to make deals with foreign governments and Saudi Arabia is a good example look at where we have a closer relationship with Saudi Arabia okay we need them to fight the terrorists there's no question about that but we don't need them for oil\nAnd the other thing is there's tens of thousands of families that are supported by the defense department or a\nPrivate companies that sell stuff the Saudi Arabia right here in Massachusetts and you get these idiots that really try to make it so bad for the president and they go shape\nAnd I'm so sick and tired of it and uh it's one that's holding the general to clarify that stuff\nSo they ... maybe some of the ... that the that because it's the talk radio you don't have many political as much as a few and ah it's really understand how how it really is how the world works\nIt's very difficult it's complicated it's not as simple as people think thank you for calling and that was my simple point I'm not listen what happened to Mr ... show he should never have happened the way it did its\nHow outrageous on the other hand we don't know all about his background as I said I had a guess nine was talking about his being involved in the Muslim Brotherhood and also with the al ...\nWho knows but I'm the circumstances put the United states in a very difficult position and Congress doesn't like what happened to either so we'll have to see how it plays out in one of the more comes out about Mr ...\nTo perhaps um modify some people\nFirst of all night I don't trust reporters to begin with\nNo that's a that's the first thing I thank you for calling to it's good to talk to let's go to Bruce on the highway I'm no you don't have the trust thing um I there was some reporters you can trust I wouldn't trust some of the cable networks though that's obvious Bruce you run the voice of Boston W weren't kale hello\n\nWe try to get Bruce you with us here go right ahead sir\nOkay ah the while I was calling about the people that are coming here from Central America yep a parade of people is you know as far as setting the military down there we've got to have some kind of a presence there as a deterrent\nI Want to qualify something I say that as a multiple decorated war vet\nAnd I never wanted ...\nYeah well thank you I said fact people that have been here while I was away keeping an eye out in the store so that those of us that were out there doing what we were doing at a decent respectable place to come home to you guys did a great job [noise] so\nAh the thing that I Want to make clear though is that\nIf we're white and don't send anybody down there to mind the ... the border they gotta come streaming was covered in here is it going to say what they want but I mean you know they they it's been proven that people from let's say hostile countries have come in a mixed among\nPeople but for air for sale dinner reason but I Know that my great grandparents had a goal for the whole process to hear\nFrom Europe and the thing is is it was we let them in the financial aspect of it has got to go through the roof because look at a welfare medical fighting has all this other sort of stuff\nAnd all that being said let me ask you this if if if you have a private residence and you have a nice lawn\nAnd you have neighbors on either side and all of a sudden people are coming over camping out on your lawn bringing their sleeping bags\nAre hanging out there are doing their ah relieving of themselves on your property let's say is this happening by the way in San Francisco with the homeless and Los Angeles or by the but in other words they using your property would you have a right to build a wall around your home to protect it\nFrom the invasion by these are people who would want to use your property for their own benefit\nYeah we I I Believe that I Would ... the thing is is that I think as a nation that so we need to do beforehand because once they get in here trying to get rid of them to you know all those people to take a different identities and drop off into another world someplace that's like trying to write a bell wants to\nRun as you say in my point is that you just said it if you have the right and by the way Nancy Pelosi has a has that kind of a fence around her home and want to allow the United states and its own sovereign territory to do the same if we were to put a wall on our property\nUnited States property to block the illegals from coming in and as the president said have a golden during the middle where people legally coming in can do it why wouldn't we do that why should I Believe that it's irrational\nNot to do it and the reason is and I'll say until I'm blue in the face\nA the the cheap shot leaders of the Democratic party\nOr Cory Booker Kamala Harris\nChuck Schumer Joe Biden Dianne Feinstein Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters they all want illegals coming in because they are future voters and they will vote for Democrats because they want the big government programs\nThat the ... and ... again I think if the service and I appreciate the call we're going to come right back to more of your calls at six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight\nAnything you want to talk about that we've covered already feel free to continue the conversation and you might answer the

R. K. our number is six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight your\nCalls are welcome uh what do you make of this attempted incursion into the United states now we find out that some Honduran marchers in a mob not a caravan by a mob and this makes the point\nHave burned an American flag but first of course they had the temerity to place a swastika on the flag or you're going to put a swastika on the American flag why would you want to be in that country\nWant us to stay out of it what what is the nonsense and are they saying that because we want to protect our borders and let people in legally\nLet people end but let them in legally but there's something wrong with that what do they think they can just go across the border to border and do whatever they want to do do their own thing and not have accountability\nKind of thinking is that we have separate sovereign nations folks except for global is like George Soros and Tom Sawyer and others of that ilk a by the way Brock Obama Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton they want globalism\nThey don't want the United states to be a strong sovereign nation you need to get that through your heads and those independents who are still wavering I wanted to vote for Warren or deal get that through your head\nThat those people\nThat I just described including Elizabeth Warren a global is\nThey don't want to protect the sovereignty of this nation they want to protect\nThe interests of the global economy\nAnd we're just one small part of it ... the United states will never settled for being one small part if anything is the president said last night he's the nationalist so when you call here now I'd like you to tell me if you believe you are a nationalist Paul and Boston you're on the voice of Boston W. R. K. O. hello Paul\nAin't might nationalist sir\nNow I Am a a Republican\nBut I so that must mean you're a nationalist you protect the borders of this country\nWhile a nationalist means ah to me that you\nPut this nation first sir that it's that it's time\nTo charity begins at home than they should come before us no question about it\nAnd that it's not our job to have everybody on the planet come into this country who's poor\nUnfortunately they can't they come on I shut ... neither\nNo but what you look at why does the Hondurans have anymore right to enter this country than the people in Somalia who are poor oh what are the people in the Congo who are poor or the maple in ah Mozambique who are poor\nHealth costs not\nJust because of a geographic proximity doesn't mean that those people have anymore right in terms of poverty and they're not in poverty anywhere near what the poverty is in some of those African countries or some Asian areas or middle ...\nIssue what something that the general said Yes sir\nYou said the armed forces weren't trained to handle large\nWell they're not trained and what his point was not trained to deal with civilian insurrection such as this or invasion\nA system that I spent ten years in the national God and that was a unit went had training would fix ...\nEvery year as to lob control and riots because the national God is the\nIs the first offense for the state itself is a it's a state militia\nUnderstood in the end the governor brings them out I understand that but when it comes to when look when it comes to a border situation that's just that's very different and then the general made that point not\nThere's no difference there there certainly is different about the assert back up and what\nDo you coordinate and a half a dozen rocks at ... ... mile of\nOne reason number two Seventy five I Love you but in a nun sexual way not doing well you know and so [laughter] that\nGet back to more my ...\nAnd then back we aren't going to have you with us Mike Seeger for Jeff was off today and it's a pleasure to be here coming up\nNot a one fifty let's go to your calls or the dilemma of the United states faces with this march toward the border oh we've got of course the election coming up what's the impact do you think of this border incursion on the election\nI Would think that the independence particularly who might be on the fence are going to say enough is enough ah I'm voting for Republicans to get the wall built in to protect the borders of this country and to stop the nonsense Scott in New Hampshire you're on the voice of Boston W. or kale hello there\nHey Hi Mike so I heard a story about a ... a mother that crossed a muddy river down there too with her two year old daughter who just had heart surgery\nSo these people it's not a normal thing for all these people to gather together they're being paid you can clearly see that being paid by mystery people and these guys are packing guns too so we got so dangerous\nIndividuals coming over but there are eleven hundred miles away from our border and I definitely think it's a ploy to disrupt because it's going to be just in time for the midterm elections\nYou'd have George Soros who's an evil doer we're trying to get this going paying people he's worth eight billion dollars he's one of the richest elite\nNationally as he he just he just put Eighteen billion into his open societies found [laughter] he's in his eighties and they you know he wants to make sure his nasty in this continues look he was um I said every time it comes up and I was going to bring him up to but you did so that's even better\nHe Nazi sympathizer in World War two was a teenager he went with a guy who was the Nazi general\nWho um pretended that George was his grandson because George happened to be Jewish\nAnd so he ... they pretended to be non Jewish and the grandson of this Nazi and they'd go together to take property away from Jews and when when he was at one source was ... and you can YouTube is one source on sixty minutes interview by Steve Croft was asked about it he said well\nOr somebody else would have done it if I did and I don't feel guilty at all\nWho cross said well I sure would lose sleep as I said something like I Want to lose sleep the rest of my life over having done that\nA Soros is as pure evil it's not just is no about ... million Feinstein or Chuck Schumer and they're left wing radicals a bit but I wouldn't put them in a category of evil only one that Charles is pure evil he is sure he's the guy with every six is on his scout period\nAbsolutely what a truck say about ... about this so is he he's got a plan does have to with Mexico to have them be involved now he's threatening them\nYeah but the problem was that at the corner Guatemalan border on the Mexican side\nOf the Mexican troops were as general Cain said there were very small in number so that when when this large group came along and they were going to cross and they weren't going to stop the Mexican troops just back them they didn't have enough to support the anyway and they didn't want to get into a firefight\nAnd start yelling people so they backed away so the Mexicans you know it costs medically did what they said told the president they would do but it didn't work they didn't really stop these people\nAre in it in a trunk say though that Mexico better smart enough and take care of this\nWe also is that you know he's ... will cut the funding to automobile Honduras and El Salvador you know they want to they want money from us so they can cause of where you know where the sun don't shine we're not going to give them any money\nFar as foreign aid is concerned now of course Congress has to be part of that\nBut uh that's the president's view on that and I'm not show or you know I'm not sure the Republicans could oppose it what are they going to say we're going to keep giving them money even though they allow their people to come to the border of the United states and invade illegally how would the American people feel then\nThat the Republicans in Congress would let those countries do this dastardly thing\nAnd then still give them foreign aid ... all the Republicans would be forced to vote down the foreign aid to those three countries I agree if it came like thank you very much a lousy John on the south shore you're on the voice of Boston W. R. K. O. hello there\nMike how you doing it's good to hear you on the radio thank you sir it's good to hear now you're during the week I'm ...\nI Do in a nightly show it's hurt on your couch the national show and it's ... every night\nYeah good to hear you on this Times Square to I was gonna say you guys are touching around a lot of the things I wanted to say but you're absolutely\nAfter years the military on the border so disengaged and the other thing is is is Trump pass through cuts to these countries that are causing us that has to happen\nThat has to be followed through on\nThe other thing is something I'm sure you've heard\nYou're saying and people like minded people like myself have you can't prove citizenship in this Israeli usually stuff you get nothing you get no assistance you can um um rent a car you can't rent a hotel room you\nGet nothing if you\nCan't prove citizenship this is um you know easy pickings that\nKind of yeah but you know here's here's part of the problem what what's the view of the commonwealth of Massachusetts for that so that I and I are both sanctuary cities right on and there are there are others in the state I mean and and I'm I'm I'm not I'm\nA surprise if the Democrat legislature which has been for decades Democrat commonwealth or that they wouldn't make Massachusetts a sanctuary state\nExactly right and this maybe maybe Charlie Baker maybe Charlie bigger would veto that but I wouldn't be surprised if it happened\nYeah I agree with it a hundred percent and that this is why we have this divide in and really in the whole country of course we're in ground zero for this um liberalism Democrat foolishness\nOr number among I got on an airplane and Boston didn't they\nThat's right that's right and that a guy like you one of the few guys there's the guts to remind us of that stuff\nAll the time a Jeff does it all the time you know that's why we love you and and Jeff the bells and we listened intently because of that stuff appreciate your call a truce like ...\nAnd I thank you for that and we will keep up the good work in the ... going to continue that with the same way that great energy a time in New Hampshire you're on the voice of Boston W. or kale hello there\nAfternoon hey Yes sir go ahead\nYeah I can hear you um are you on the ... sauce I say I'm like well I'm calling from my point of view it's shocking Kiley eighty what the hunter and all those countries\nBut there's money going to continue to flow in here to support this stuff and and you pointed out it was a ... he and his father or not they sympathize and people try to criticize that tell you it's American ... five what people think is and\nThe other say he's a self hating Jew that's what George Soros says\nAnd another thing a lot of people don't know this but he's brought down other countries in in\nEngland he brought down anyway he brought down the British pound and that's how we made us billions a by selling short and buying it back when I dropped\nIt might question how do we stop the guy they violated a whole bunch of laws\nI you know I I'll give you this answer if he wore a conservative\nOn the right doing this stuff if for example the Koch brothers or the conservative wealthy guys and I commend them for being patriots if they were doing the kinds of stuff that George Soros is doing that have been brought down by the Justice Department twenty times over\nBut I think that as a left wing radicals Soros or the Democrats look the other way or they take his money and run a they tolerate him because of the money\nAnd it's a disgrace it's guys like Chuck Schumer a Jew\nShould be condemning this guy left and right uh but he's gotten Adler from Brooklyn the congressman should be condemning this guy another Jewish member of Congress but they don't do it they take us money and set up to him and it's a disgrace or an absolute disgrace\nLike light yes we\n... we ought to keep in mind too that the the OJ isn't isn't the my Father's Day oj\nI agree that's why I just set it\nUp because of the deep state of the the OJ would go after a conservative of great wealth if they did the same dastardly things that George Soros does look I remember when I was on the air here at W. R. K. O. when I Ninety three was blocked by black lives matter he paid them to do it they chained themselves\nTo the barriers and it wound up being a huge traffic jam for hours in the morning during drive time Mike Segal for Jeff Cohen are good to have you with us we come back\nWith lots more on the other side and we'll say right there please [noise]\nBoston is ready for the fall classic good afternoon ... news game one of the world series is tonight\nAt Fenway Park between the red Sox and Dodgers Boston mayor ... says officials have worked to put a good security plan in place we're taking\nIf it's the white skin color versus the wrong skin color\nWhite men are terrible or white men are evil just because they're white but listen I Want to go back to my question\nBecomes what first racism there ... or ... it's a throw in just to finish unless of course if you happen to be Asian or so with the Harvard racial discrimination admissions coast right now\nThat evidently some minorities are treated differently than others you know Asia has an age of applicants speaking speaking are being discriminated against because they are the wrong type of racial minority\nNow let me add that the bird correct but let me go back to my question that they ... they would that told me about Janet Reno not wanting to investigate voter fraud in the Huffington case or the ... case and and they lost because of voter fraud illegal alien\nVoting that tells me that ah that's ... and I was told by sources in DC that when Bill Clinton made her attorney general one of the one of the agreement was that she would not pursue voter fraud I wasn't going to illegal alien votes because they'd be voting democratic\nAnd she agreed to that supposedly but what does she agreed to it or not she never followed through in what she should have done to investigate it\nHow do we know that it's not any better now\nA given the fact that we have a concern from your group the American ... civil rights union about voter fraud in this coming election how do we know we're not going to see that again\nWe don't Maryland that's exactly the problem and that's why these are things that need to be addressed we need of for example there is a there is a federal database that actually tracks the names of every non said this and who is in this country legally\nNow of course this does it picks up with illegal aliens by ... this was like ... it's you know speed limits don't catch a ... every every person or extending the speed limit for that matter if that were the case even even those of us who are generally regarded as law abiding citizens would perhaps not the same as a as very law abiding\nUp but that but that each of these becomes a piece in the puzzle to try and wrap our head around that\nThere is a database that states could consult teams that are not trying to consult at the federal level just to be able to check the names on voter registration that the state level against the federal database that tracks all non citizens legally in this country\nThat in itself would be something to check because I have to tell you that only ... there'll be illegal alien starting\nThere could be people who entered this country legally who are in fact voting it's that the information is at our hands like to be able to try to at least investigate this\nSituation to be able to to inform ourselves regarding what the scope of the problem is which I think is a precursor step to being able to figure out how to solve it how to address it up but it's just a matter of political will to even take advantage of the things we have said they're not our finger pets\nBut the question then becomes\nWhat role does does the president play because he tweeted out about this the other day regarding a voter fraud even during the early time of the voting or before election day people are voting already now as a matter of fact the in in terms of that that's right I think they're getting their balance or on election\nDay to any more selective about yeah and they exactly um [noise] but but the the\nThe bottom line is that we have\nA very serious problem and the president recognize he said in his tweet all levels of government and law enforcement are watching carefully for voter fraud including during early voting\nSheet at your own peril violators will be subject to maximum penalties both civil and criminal now he says all levels of government and law enforcement I assume that means state federal county and local but the question is isn't the state the primary arbiter of dispensing the election process\nOr during the election day and during the election cycle [noise]\n[laughter] well that's exactly right and of course under under the tenth amendment the president for all his vast powers most powerful man on the plan that uh that that he has no authority to actually command state local officials\nSo I mean the person that can speak with authority regarding what he's going to have federal agencies that they're into can exhort in terms of aspirations and leadership upon calling for state and local authorities to also be doing that but you're right this requires political will on behalf of state and local officials\nTo actually enforce the laws on the books\nAll right so what do we know about for example the north Carolina case where they can use photo ID the ... the Supreme Court has said we can use photo ID ah for voting purpose is to make sure the person is who they say they are and if there were a citizen am I correct about that\n[laughter] yeah it's a is aspects of that are actually still tied up in court right now uh we we head into election day with actually some degree of uncertainty\nRegarding that now on one level\nThere indications to say yes you can do it but on the other hand you of all of these flags in these recent court decisions\nThat basically are tough to invite a lawsuit on behalf of individuals who want to cry and press the cats that to say that how would this being applied is actually being done are in violation it's not a federal statute of even the U.S constitution\nItself yeah what ... what is a convoluted legal environment a governing the state of North Carolina\nWell can they use ah can I ask a person to show photo ID when they come and election day\nUh yes yes they can issue is now ... and and of course and they should do that the issue is whether it's going to be subject or late to immediately called challenge\nWell here's the point Eric Holder went after that and when he was attorney general and said it was a unfair to African Americans are which is stunning to me because he's insulting African Americans thinking that they can't get a state issued\nA photo ID I mean every state issues or if you wanted\nA photo ID for its citizens of that state\nAnd uh that photo ID may not be a driver's license you can use a driver's license with ID but it may not be\nA and so you can get that at no cost if necessary\nOr do they use that to go vote so he's insulting African Americans but I don't think that's the reason he did it I think the reason he did it is because he doesn't want anybody checking on anybody who comes to the poll because he knows that the people who come to the pole to vote who are not legally entitled to vote would be illegal aliens and if he can stop\nThe ... the process from checking those illegal aliens as\nTo whether they're entitled to vote it means they'll get the vote and that means more Democrats will win what do you make of that\n[laughter] I I think that uh\nIt makes perfect sense or as to whether as to why that would be a scribe it take to use an aspect of it that we have more numbers on because they get part of the maddening frustration here is that or is that steps are being taken to just affirmatively block people who are trying to find out\nAbout the scope of aliens folk didn't including illegal aliens could have gotten all the way to get\nIllegal aliens being an

organization they fight for voter accuracy\nVoter legitimacy so my question to you because I raised during that conversation do you believe and do you trust the commonwealth of Massachusetts to carry out fair and honest elections\nIf there was a close election do you believe\nThat this commonwealth will do what it could to make sure Elizabeth Warren wins\nAn election day do you believe that the commonwealth of Massachusetts\nWould stop illegal aliens from voting and would use mechanisms measures by which they would ask people to prove they are legally entitled to vote as citizens of the commonwealth\n\nI Will give you the story of what happened in Washington state a number of years ago\nThere was an election for governor\nBetween a woman named Christine Gregoire and a man named Dino Rossi she was the Democrat he was the Republican he won the first vote it was so close that they had a recount\nAnd then she won the second election and it was so close at a third count and she wanted the third but what we learned was\nThat move on dot org the left wing radical groups funded in part by George Soros of all people had gone around to collect ballots from people in the area\nAnd they would only turn in the balance for people who voted Democrat\nAnd these were called provisional ballots that had to be verified but they never verified then they just accepted them and counted them\nAnd after the first vote on election night the woman who became governor Christine Gregoire said not to worry because in the end\nThe votes would be there for her she would be the next governor now how did she know that\nMaybe a little bird he told her but that's another state like Massachusetts very left wing with pockets of conservatism\nBut she was going to win that election some way somehow even if it were not proper\nAnd that's what I fear in this case because if Dr ... on this program at noon is correct\nAnd that the election between Elizabeth Warren and Jeff deal is close the fear\nThat the people in charge in the commonwealth will manipulate the result to make sure Elizabeth Warren ... obviously if you if Mr deal we're going to win in a landslide then there wouldn't be\nAppropriate a racket there would be academic I mean he'd win but if it's close are they going to find a way to get her votes will do you believe that the commonwealth will not allow illegal aliens to vote or dead people devote\nOur number to Boston to six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight\nThe other question I Would ask you is whether you are consider yourself to be a nationalist or
