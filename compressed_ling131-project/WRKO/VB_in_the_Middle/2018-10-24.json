from the landlord point of view it's good for you because you're guaranteed the money since the government's paying\nThat on the other side and that you know here I have a child that works two jobs but they're out there oh they can't afford it and they say\nIt's it's it's despicable and I'm going to say it again guys like Ed Markey are delighted about it I won't even talking about Elizabeth Warren I'm hoping Geoff Diehl beats her\nBut guys like Ed Markey who's just as bad as Elizabeth Warren by the way may be worse\nOr they don't he doesn't care about you market couldn't care less about you what he cares about is getting these people coming in so they become votes down the road either legally or illegally it makes no difference so the Democrats have a new base because they've lost the blue collar worker which\nI'm going back to John Kennedy Hubert Humphrey Walter Mondale\nAh Richard ... who was the ... house minority leader for the Democrats in the nineties\nUh that crowd of Democrats was yes liberal\nBut they had the support of blue collar workers blue collar workers don't support the Democrats anymore because the Democrats went after all these special interests that a transgender gay\nUm which is fine protect those people's rights but they're going after much more targeted groups and one of those groups as illegal aliens which will be a voter base for them that's what they're doing\n[noise] [noise] it's just a shame if any do you look at ... they were looking at it that\nIt ... and now it's done Susan good luck to your daughter up she finds an apartment or I'd rather give her out of tax dollars the money than the illegals for sure let's go to CJ in Boston hello CJ you're on the voice of Boston there'll be more K O hello there\nWhite thanks for taking the call what's most troubling as I see these young men or the foreign invaders marching to as a country and T shirts carrying weapons or I see also went in Burke is\nA prospect can you look at the prospect of people flying in to Mexico City from the Mid East fly in from all over the country who people who just can't make enough to their country and just thinking that they can walk across the border here I think two things that Trump can do a ... to stop this\nIs the number one which he has mentioned is shut the checkpoints on the border so that no transportation gets by so that the factories down they shut down and also stop air travel between the United states and Mexico\nA bad idea it would be terrible for Mexico for tourism but um you know I mean that it's getting to a point where we have to use all of the resources available to us but think about this you made a point\nYou got a pregnant woman she sneaks across the border\nThan the ones who sticks across the border the ... the federal courts say she has constitutional rights and needs to process and while she's there by the way you have to give her medical care as part of her due process rights on the humane level\nSo then she goes to a hospital because she has the right to do that once you stepped foot on American soil and then she gives birth to the baby\nThen you want to carry out but when you can't kick her out because the baby is an American citizens are born in this country that's at least what the interpretation would be\nNow with that but when the founder interpretation\nBut but if they have broken the law entering the country illegally they have broken a federal law who is who is a circuit court judge to overrule a the constitutionality\nI ought to be with you listen I I was on the air in Miami in Nineteen eighty in eighty one when the Mariel boatlift happened it was the same question does more of an issue but Atlanta was giving all these people rights\nAnd he he was he also was saying that the illegal alien violent criminals in Georgia in the federal penitentiary\nHad to be released because it was overcrowding and it was um a violation of their constitutional rights the proper treatment I mean you're talking about a court system that is dysfunctional but you know the answer to that the president is now appointing judges\nAt and more so even more important maybe than the Supreme Court at the ... that the circuit courts which are the appeals courts in the federal system that's where he's appointing many judges who will reflect the different point of view idly by calling I appreciate it the other thing\nThat um we can we can say is that the constitution only requires the Supreme Court the Congress can't get rid of ... like the Ninth Circuit and California the left wing radical communist court they could get rid of it if they chose to do that\nWill come back after all the news and get into problems with our deficit stay with us Mike Segal Jeff corner\nFederal officials are investigating the discovery of several packages that contained potential explosive devices good afternoon ... news NBC News is reporting that former attorney general Eric Holder received a suspicious device\nPuzzles me my because even people who ... who are strongly supportive of this and they want to be able to\nTo ah to address this and have people go through the process and so forth understand that if you if you abuse it this badly you end up turning the clock back you're not going to be able to do anything and so I Would think even strong supporters\nImmigrant advocates would be out there saying this isn't good because this put so much pressure on the system or that it's going to destroy it for everybody else\nWell the but but I think we both know certainly I Do from all the years I've been covering immigration problems\nIs that the Democrats won everybody coming in because they're going to be votes down the road at some point maybe even immediately because we do have illegals voting in some cases in California in San Francisco they are going to sanction illegal aliens voting\nSo on local elections which the state has control over you know so the the the feds can't do anything about that um uh but the\nThe question of not enforcing the law\nI'm I Wonder if an interest group could bring a lawsuit that there's something called a ... of ... which if a judge issues that in the certainly the U.S Supreme Court justice could\nIt means that you're ordering a public official to do what they otherwise should have done of their own volition\nI Wonder whether a somebody ought to try to do that and get a court to order the Congress to do something about a ... illegal immigration problems\n[laughter] well it we'll we'll just see you know Trump is said he's going to put the military down there I've tried to tried to sort of think in my mind exactly what that would look like would they line up would they put a tear gas road there that they could uh because even if you get seven thousand coming in\nIn the area they can just push right through if you're not going to shoot 'em\nSo I don't I don't shoot nobody and by the way some people took cheap cheap shots about that a Geraldo Rivera set of the other night\nWhen he was on Hannity um what do you want to do Sean shoot him I mean that's ridiculous I mean you don't bring it to that level you know who's going to shoot anybody except if somebody tries to commit a violent act of their own against other people what you're going to do though I think that Dr mothers have intimidation or maybe the I guess maybe ... maybe bring some tanks down there\nAnd just have a line up just as an intimidation factor um how many ... do that and less power or that they ought to uh uh get approval from Mexico to go a mile into Mexico with our troops that we would that would be in a foreign country which is proper for the military and just a line up there and protect against their coming through that line maybe doing that\nAnd I don't know how the optics of all that looked at me you you could also get out the big water hoses the fire hoses but all of that sort of ... or ... takes us back to the early sixties which is not the same situation but you are the optics that it might not look good\nI I'm not exactly sure what he does but I suspect there'll be some people up there between homeland security and others that can figure out something they can do\nWell uh you're right and they'll they'll figure I'm sure they'll figure out the working on right now I Would assume you know any of that one of the\nThings you when things you could do I say we just have buses lined up right behind the the truth as they break through you've ... you've final and ride on a bus and then you drive and right back to Mexico City or something\nThere you go ... that's what I ... I Believe I volunteer to drive the bus [laughter]\nEven if it's a stick shift them how to drive a stick alright I'm let's get to the issue here are of great concern should be of great concern to everyone\nWe have last year we paid interest on our national debt which is over twenty trillion or the interest last year was five hundred and twenty three billion a\nLet's see ... uh Seventeen million I guess three hundred and one thousand four hundred and forty six dollars and twelve cents so five hundred and twenty three billion was just the debt service last year on our national debt Fifteen Percent of our total revenue last year are we going broke\n[laughter] why that you could argue that we already are ... we we have to borrow money every year [noise]\nUm but what's ah what's happening here is the there's a there's been a long running discussion about interest on the federal debt they usually in the past few years they typically have highlighted in the neighborhood of two hundred and fifty million moving up to three hundred million that is only interest on public debt that is\nTreasuries and other things at the federal government sales and that puts out there and and uh uh takes on that\nBut there's other dead and that's the Social Security trust fund the Medicare trust fund other inter governmental\nOr loans that that go on\nAnd when you put and that's not typically calculated in the\nThe sort of the publisher number on the interest\nOr that we have to pay when you put that money in it jumps from about three hundred and twenty five a billion dollars up to about ... that well the five hundred and twenty three billion dollars so when you include everything all the debt that we have you get up over half a trillion dollars in debt and it's rising quickly\nAll right so what does this mean to the average American um in terms of um the way we live I mean obviously this that is going to be passed along to our children grandchildren great grandchildren but it strikes me Dr Matthews that if the debt holders called into debt\nThe twenty trillion or a substantial portion of that this country would have to almost declared bankruptcy wouldn't it\nWouldn't we wouldn't have any money we have to go out and borrow the money to pay for it but we go out and borrow the money to pay for everything else right now we're in Social Security\nMoney but but then we'd have hyper inflation if if that happened when we [noise]\n[noise] ah yeah well that's what you would have thought that remember during the during the last financial crisis the federal or the Federal Reserve essentially increase the money supply by I think about four trillion dollars and we were sort of anticipating seeing some very high or\nOr interests coming in from that inflation and it just it just didn't happen so that's actually has economist scratching their heads as to why inflation didn't come when the federal when the fed funded a flooded the market with money\nYeah but they what they did was just print that money right they they're just raise the debt ceiling\nPrint the money and um it would be like I I I guess a a borrowing money against your credit line going to the hill I'm let's say you create a hundred thousand dollars in debt on your credit cards if you had the credit lines to do it\nUh and you're making twenty five thousand dollars a year\nI mean that's yeah that's sort of what we're doing here isn't it\nYeah we used to use the term print the money but that they didn't actually print the money these days it's just making accounting in tree\nHouse done digitally but at the same thing I mean I say print the money because people understand that they can visualize that were based on what they do it digitally they're ... they're printing money digitally but the point is they're still doing it\nAnd the money's coming from whole cloth that at some point when you keep doing that\nA look well let me without getting too technical here the international Monetary Fund has talked about creating another international currency the brick nations real Russia India China have talked about creating another default currency right now the the dollar is the fault currency on the planet meaning that everybody goes through that\nBut in recent years the Chinese and Japanese have dealt directly between the you one of China and the end of Japan they ... they went straight to each other for the first time what if all of a sudden a some international group said we now have a new default currency ah and the dollar goes away as the default currency\nWe'd be in huge trouble because everybody would walk away from us they wouldn't care anymore\nIt's one thing to make a default currency it's another thing for the world to trust that in the fall currency so there are as as you point out there have been efforts and discussions about doing that China here just a few years ago was hoping that you're there you want would become\nSort of a a ... at least a second layer of default currency that's before its economy started going downhill\nSo ... we're still have the strongest economy and the strongest dollars so ... even though you have the efforts out there\nI'd be surprised if they actually come to fruition anytime soon but going back to your point because we are borrowing so much money um it is a ... and we're spending so much it at some point you may see I started to collapse as well\nWell and that's that's the danger of I'm trying to describe birds and the audience which is why we need to demand that there'd be accountability and they stopped talking about cutting spending in Congress to start doing it that's that I have a need to do\nPresident Trump has as reporters have gone to his as a secretaries and agency heads and said I Want you to look at for trying to cut your budget by five percent right that's a small start but it has to start\nWe'll come right back with Dr Merrill Matthews and your calls a you folks are paying the bills your children grandchildren great grandchildren\nAre now great great grandchildren and great great great grandchildren will be settled with all this debt a when are we going to start looking at it and saying let's get\nResponsible and start cutting spending in this country tangibly realistically and legitimately look the Republicans are just as bad as Democrats folks John Banner when he was the speaker of the house of went along with Obama creating over four trillion dollars of new debt between twenty of Lebanon twenty four team\nAnd then Paul Ryan and his first budget gave Obama the kitchen sink including money even for Syrian refugees and for illegal aliens Paul Ryan gave it away\nSo the Republicans have done nothing\nTo really tangibly cut spending\nAnd that we need to get that done and we ought to expect any help from the Democrats but we certainly should get it from the Republican six one seven six six sixty eight sixty

New York at the residents of George Soros in Bedford New York\nAt the residents of the Obamas in Washington DC apparently Eric Holder as we just heard on our news report received something\nAnd CNN now the one common element\nThese reports is that those individuals\nOr Democrats or support a left wing ideology many of us myself included absolutely unequivocally reject that ideology I think CNN is nothing but a\nWater carrier for the left wing there in the pocket of the left wing one small example one Don Lemon the other night complained about the president\nHaving my ... go to Saudi Arabia and Mike Pompeo smiled when he met the king and Don Lemon at CNN got all upset because he shouldn't have smiled\nGiven the circumstance of Mr ...\nIt was stupid fighting to me that Lehmann would even bring that up\nWhen you go to me it was somebody\nIt's about the substance of the conversation smiley is simply a way of non verbal e acknowledging the meeting\nAnd yet he had the audacity to bring it up and the reason I bring it up now is because he actually said how low can this administration go\nWell my answer to Don Lemon\nIs oh Brock Obama who gets the Post's theory or end of the king of Saudi Arabia and when he went to visit him who kissed this ring who got basically theoretically conceptually on his hands and knees to the king of Saudi Arabia at the time\nAnd the lemon would remember\nObama was visiting the United states in a speech he gave in Cairo apologizing for the United states and you want to talk lemon about\nHaving a smile when the secretary of state meets the leader of the royal family in Saudi Arabia which is very complicated situation because of all the\nInteractions we have with Saudi Arabia the relationships the military sales of the oil sales the history history historic nature of all administration's having pretty good relations George Herbert Walker Bush George W. Bush Bill Clinton\nAll had relationships with Saudi Arabia's royal family\nFor the benefit of the United states I use that only has one small example because he made a big deal about it and they find anything they can to this Donald Trump and his administration Don Lemon to get on and say how dare rock Obama kiss the ring of the king of Saudi Arabia\nThe Don lemon complain when Obama apologized all over the middle east and Europe about the United states behavior which has been outstanding by the way over the years we've said people from infamy blasphemy born for the United states the French people would be speaking German today\nLiving other Nazi swastika\nAnd so I have no tolerance for the Jake tappers and Brooke bald wins\nYou just throw out these epithets that's what they do on the left they throw it out there without any substantiated whatsoever and we don't even know who did this and he's blaming Fox News and Donald Trump and talk radio polling Newberry port you're on the voice of Boston W. or kale hello there\nOr they might thanks for taking my current during a great job for ...\nThank you uh\nYou know the timing of this this and not anybody noticed the timing of this whole event just weeks before the election of desperation from the left because they know there's no blue wave a no PC at Obama has two thousand people at his rally Trump is fifty thousand people are just\nRound isn't I said earlier Obama's not doing it but I said the doctor Matthews Obama can carry himself and deliver his own success but he can't do it for others\nWhere where was brand Collins complying with these ... and the rest of us got shot up on the ball field\nHe was nowhere to be found it was probably in his in his hidden in his mother's basement applauding\nRight exactly it's too coincidental to have all these major ... leaders clock CNN all at once getting bombs into their addresses\nYeah that ... you know and that's why I said if it's somebody on the right they're doing a complete disservice to conservatives are but certainly conservatives have an advocate of this no one of any responsible nature anyone behind a microphone or with a pen writing articles has suggested any of this that and yet\nHillary Clinton and the rest of the left to go all over this promoting inside and that in your face I think it's going to be civil until we get control again ... you know you report you saw\nAnd and by the way the ... complain about that at NBC when Hillary said we're not going to be civil which means that get in their face in the real antagonistic one step away from violence that he ever complain about that\nOf course not is a paid ...\nThat's the you know the American people see past the you know one thing to remember\nTrump won in spite of all of the media and George W. Bush won two elections and he was the visceral rated worse than any president up to that point and he still want to elections because the American people saw through it\nAnd Ronald Reagan was eviscerated by the mainstream media when he ran and he won two elections so I think they're important but they're desperately trying to do something here I'm going to be very interested when the FBI hopefully in the secret service find out who did this\nIf it's somebody on the ration they should be condemned gun if it's somebody on the left doing it as a guy's\nA to create a problem for the right now than they should be prosecuted just as well\nI'll make a prediction if it's somebody in the right we'll find out before the end of the week and a left it will get buried in the news we're going to hear about any money\nCould be you could be right thank you very much for calling George in New Hampshire you're on the voice of Boston W ... hello George\nHi how are you good thanks yeah you're\nDoing a great job and I totally agree with your caller previous um but anyway you you've heard of the Hail Mary pass\nThis the Democratic Hail Mary pass and he and I have absolutely no doubt\nThat as a Democrat so they have done this if you talk to them and they want to go after Republicans and shoot up the uh the softball field and they wouldn't do something like this they'll lower than a low\nOh there's no question about that and I've said for decades that the left would love to suppress free speech they don't want you to have free speech they don't want me to have free speech they don't want Jeff corner having free speech they don't want this\nThey would they want to be able to suppress everybody with their left wing ideology and why because they can't win a legitimate debate that's why\nWell if you just look at the timing like your previous caller said if you're just like at the charming any idiot wouldn't realize who did this pitch a Hail Mary pass the Democrats are hoping that the Republican\nGet blamed for it and it brings them up in the polls and then in mid term election\nThe first thing this guy been Collins said it's the Republicans it's settled\nOh you know how to how old is he did it you know when the bombing happened\nI Want to say when the bombing happened in Oklahoma City I was on the air\nAnd the first thing I I Know it was easy to say it was a a a radical Islamic jihad as terrorists and I said repeatedly we don't know who did this we can't start talking about blame at this point it turned out to be in that case legitimately or right wing fanatic\nTimothy McVeigh um but right now we are here again we don't know who did this and this guy is blaming the Republicans what if it happened to be a radical trying to blame the Republicans then what is he going to say\nAll these other say that there were the first of all they'll never admit it it's just like when I'm when a a Romney was accused of not paying taxes for ten years\nAnd then it after the election and he was being well it worked isn't it\nYeah that was that was of course the Senate majority leader from Nevada ah who's a brute thug himself anyway appreciate the call and I thank you for George Li and wall Pham you're on the voice of Boston W. R. K. O. L. Ollie\nGray and after I thanks for taking my call I just want to mention something that would cover pretty much everything out there in in a way\nTrump calls himself a nationalist okay he calls himself a nationalist that is a sign that he's throwing up in front of the Democrats who are not national as their new world\nOrder Tito they're All right out of it and it's all part of of Wall Street\nAnd the fact that he says he's a nationalist\nGets the staple all riled up now you've heard of ... have you ever heard of this guy called it as first age demoralization the very fact that seven thousand people can lodge okay\nOn our border when we know it's not right and we have to have a national discussion about this that's when he calls demoralization when you get so much\nUm you know propaganda that you know wanting to get things straight anymore and that you have to stop and think about something like this and we shouldn't have to stop and think about this these people on the air they shouldn't be walking in\nAnd yet you know that when he went back at national is this is part of the world order out of the new world order is to get people in the United states where away our values our culture our sense of thinking actually\nAnd then now they seem to take over\nAnd well that's what it looks at you as you know they're following ... I mean he was\nHe's the godfather of Brock Obama Hillary Clinton and the solar crowd were you to create distraction disruption and by the way the fundamental message of salt ... is the end justifies the means do any blanking thing you want\nIn order to get the result and all the I don't know is it how does he issue but if they did this did it to try to ... and co pay\nConservatives and Republicans\nI'm from the left what an outrage that would be but it would be a ... I Hope they find out who did it before the election so people understand that but I thank you for calling\nIt's good I talk to you will go to Steven Georgetown Steve you're on the voice of Boston W. or kale\nHello Steve dropped so we'll go to Dennis next hello Dennis joined the voice of Boston to New York hey oh\nHey Mike I think there were all falling for the shiny object again I strongly suspect it though are the ones who planted to these bombs as a distraction to keep a spinning and spinning and to divert attention away from them\nI think the Democratic party in concert with a new although it was crowded like two episodes of the ones who planted the bomb I mean how else could do see with all the ... security all these people have how I was ... months to make it as far as they did\nI don't believe it I Believe that they are doing this to divert us and keep us just keep us to keep us distracted until the election\nWell you know what I'm a you can go to the bank\nThat CNN has cameras if somebody's delivered its apparently they they they mailed them so they have to go back and try to find that one of the problems is of course you've the Unabomber operated for about Nineteen Seventy seven to Ninety five\nAnd they couldn't catch them for about Eighteen years because he would mail the stuff's very carefully so the mail stuff is going to be tough to track but uh the the George Soros a device was left in his mailbox in Bedford New York\nAnd uh you could be shared\nAs sure as as sure as the fact that you're talking to me on the phone that George Soros has all kinds of security obviously at his home uses the nature of who he is\nHere with cameras and all the rest so they're they should be able to find out who it was who did that and their own and and then if he says he doesn't have any cameras he's full of it so we'll see how it plays out but I thank you for calling and talking about two cents\nAnd that's all I Know I appreciate it very much and I you know there's gonna be a lot of cynicism like this caller believing that it was possibly somebody on the left obviously do not know that we don't know who did it but Ben Collins at NBC does right Ben\nIt had to be the Republicans who caused it but it was okay to go after Mitch McConnell and his wife and having dinner it's okay to kick Sarah Huckabee Sanders out of a restaurant you thug\nBend you're nothing but a thug at NBC and your whole network is that stay with us [noise]\nAlert after packages containing potentially explosive devices were sent to several\nHigh profile targets in afternoon ... news the packages were mailed a former President Obama's former first lady Hillary Clinton CNN studios in New York for a Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and former attorney general Eric Holder\nAnd he's afraid they're going to shoot her head off if she goes near them when he sees them on his property he doesn't say get off my property turns around and goes home\nWhat if I came to your house intimidated you and then you want to go inside lock your door and you couldn't use your front yard how would you feel\nWhat didn't kill it and I'm not buying that story is their\nCredit and you're not by a story that people are living it man\nOr a oh I think that's another like Trump story but\nI tell you I I I've been to I've been there I've seen it there are people I Know but ...

today or frankly outrage from people on on two fronts\nOne is the subject we're going to talk about which is the march of this invasion of what I call a mob is clearly is all the mainstream media wouldn't\nAnd secondly ah these are devices that were allegedly placed at the homes residences or\nBusinesses of CNN [noise] uh the Clintons the Obamas George Soros or possibly Eric Holder\n'em and interestingly enough colonel my audience with the exception of one person is saying that they believe that this was something done by the left as a distraction just before the election\nI Know we don't know anything yet as to who were why this was done but any comments about these devices that were placed\nWell certainly it's indicative I think of the desired division within our country Mike and and that's a very worrisome I think for wherever\nYou are politically that we don't want to see you know that their rhetoric I'm the kind of latch over into behavior much less violent behavior and yet or over the last uh certainly months\nOr even years in some college campuses we've seen some pretty bad behavior you know I Would argue well mostly on the left but ah you know if this was in fact done by somebody that was their ranged or trying to make a political statement to you know that's beyond the pale and not be tolerated\nThere's no question about it but I've just the fact that there
