my Eighteenth birthday\nAs I sat alone at the end of the bar Julie approached me she was alone quite beautiful well dressed in no drinking hand consequently my initial thought was she might might be a high in hooker call girl because of the time I weighed three hundred and fifty pounds so why would someone like her what what\nWhat what someone like her with someone like me I'd never been hit on with a bar on a bar before so he starts um\nHe he uh ... you start seeing her\nI felt she only had an interest in my three hundred and fifty pounds self because I was on television and well known\nAnd

more than one guy at a time\nIn fact sometimes with several at one time she wanted to know that would be okay and our relationship\nI asked her if this was just a fantasy of her she responded that you'd first tried sex with multiple guys while in high school and still liked it from time to time she brought it up because she wanted to know if I Would be interested in that\nSo he's he sees what's going on here and he says uh I was that he has a new wife and I guess he's lost a lot of weight and all this I was deeply troubled and felt a moral dilemma Dwight reach out and tell the truth of what I Know and risk family relationships to remain silent\nUm I Know I also know what it's like to be accused of something significant that I didn't do it when people leave because of this and the turtle
