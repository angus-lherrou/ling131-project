I don't know what it is that your pick honestly but if you're one thousand one one thousand twenty fourth Native American Indian you're not Native American Indian\nAnd furthermore furthermore the New York times ...\nFirst a landmark study a story about a landmark study done in two thousand four team in the journal human genes and in the journal human genes researchers found that the overwhelming majority of European Americans are white Americans listen to this\nThey're not really one hundred percent white some of them in fact have African American blood or black blood in him and almost all of them are most of them have point one eight percent Native American blood\nDo you know what the percentage for Elizabeth Warren is by her own DNA test results point zero\nNine eight percent or so as I point out in my column\nShe's less Indian than most white Americans\nHow I probably have more Indian blood than she does\nAnd as I point out in my column I'll tell you the best Geoff Diehl who she's going to be debating on friday his family goes back several generations in America\nI Will bet you the best steak at the Hanover street dropouts that Jeff we'll probably has twice the amount of Indian blood that they are that are cheap spreading bulldogs\nSo you're claiming to be a non white minority\nYou're claiming to be some kind of a Native American\nWhen most white Americans have I'd probably twice the amount of Native American blood and ancestry in them than you do\nI'll tell you what she is she's a self hating white American she's over Ninety nine point nine Ninety nine percent white\nAnd to perpetrate a fraud and this gets to the heart of the matter you want to know why this is going to ruin her I'll tell you why it's very simple it's very simple\nBecause she's a fraud but it's even more than that it's more than that and I hope Jeff deals people are listening because he's got her in friday night's debate if he pushes this point\nWhen she was a kid she never claimed to be Native American when she went to college she never said she was a Native American Indians in fact when she was first working she never claimed she was a Native American Indian [noise] the only time she ever claimed that she was Native American Indian\nWas in her late thirties early forties for a ten year period\nFrom Nineteen eighty six Nineteen eighty seven to Nineteen Ninety six Nineteen Ninety seven when she was climbing up the academic legal up professional ladder once she wanted to get a tenure tracked job first at the University of Pennsylvania and then at Harvard law school\nAnd what is the heart of Elizabeth Warren's political narrative what has been the basis of our entire political career\nThat the financial and economic and political system is raped that the system is rigged\nWell what did she do she read her professional career in order to advance yourself by claiming a status she had no business claiming\nThis is why this is such a seminal important point\nIn other words you are the biggest fraud and con artist this country's ever seen and that's saying something you go on about how the system is rigged yet all you did was try to rig your professional advancement by claiming to be a Cherokee Indian when you and you and everybody else knew that wasn't true\nIn fact won't even take my word for it she's never going to live this down I'm telling you the Cherokee Nation it's in my column the Cherokee Nation released a statement\nCondemning Elizabeth Warren\nIn fact saying what she has done is not just deeply insulting to Native Americans all Native Americans\nBut to DNA tests and to the tribal nations listen to this quote this is from the Cherokee Nation secretary of state truck cause skin by the way the Cherokee Indians are livid they are livid\nUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nations even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses while also dishonor ring legitimate tribal governments under citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with our continued claims of tribal heritage translation she's a hug sir\nTranslation she's been using Cherokee Indians and a false claim of Native American ancestry to line their pockets rigor professional career and advance at the expense of these for Native Americans\nYou don't get lower you don't get ... you don't get sleazy her than that\nNow I Want you to listen to this because this is from two thousand and twelve\nWhere she was interviewed on any CNN with a gym or the bully rowdy okay so there she is what rowdy listen now how we're story keeps changing what a liar my God is this woman a liar listen to her\nYou know what I Want to I don't even want to tease it roller Brittany\n... you're right or wrong about what it is I have to wait wait what started the associated with okay\nMom and dad were very much in love with each other and they wanted to get married and my father's parents and absolutely not [laughter] you can't marry her because she's part Cherokee and she's ... and\nUm [noise] after fighting it as long as they kind of my parents went off they loved it was an issue in our family the hotel micro up about these two families say she's still race it might not have seen [noise]\nSo what I Know about my parents as I Know that in that little town they grew up in that my father's parents knew enough about my mother and her family to say I have no doubt what Susan\nOkay let's just okay now there are so many lives there it's not even funny Okay Number one just very quickly they never looked\nHer parents never allowed just as well proven well documented what they did was they drove to a neighboring town look and look it up it's all documented they got married in the neighboring town then they went back to their home town the same day\nAnd that's where they held a reception were family and friends attended so that that that that's not an open and I don't know what she's talking about okay but let that go so her mother was a Native American according to chief spreading bolt in two thousand and twelve\nOh now her mother is not the Native American listen to this it was then her\nGreat great great grandmother\nYou remember then she's found that a couple of years later now it turns out from the DNA test it's no no no no it's not her mother and it's not a\nGreat great great grandmother it's her great great great and non now great great great grandmother\nWho could have been Native American or that six generations or out another four grapes to that and you're trying to tell me that this DNA test exonerate still what it does\nIt shows her to be the liar the fraud and the Charlotte and that she is chief you didn't build that BP\nTime Jeff seal she's going to try to do what she can be negative in this debate I'm sure a little bit more and that's not going\nTo sound leadership to face and you can talk about with Boston bulldozer Jeff coming are fighting a from nine to ...\nReally need a minority we really need a minority

known at the Cherokee Nation or our colder out she's a phony Indian she's a liar I our ... if she's in India and then what are you going to make me chief\nCheese no not yet Jeff I haven't been convinced to heal the looted\nRight right it's All right so you're taking a ... thank\nYou thank you Bye bye I mean you see these moon bats I mean this is how sad is\nSo now it's like well he's got a private one million dollars why is he got to pay the one million dollars in the past proves and that's the point in my column she's not a Native American can I be honest with you if that woman had half a brain\nShe said just don't even do this just bury them this is not fish is not what we were looking for bury it instead she comes out with that phony video\nSpontaneously allegedly filming her and then another one in California her stuff is in California filming bustamante spontaneously saying I've got great knows your one one thousand Indian and this guy calls\nThe show and says Trump all sorts of money you know he doesn't genius okay my friend's coming up next [noise]\nSanctuary cities are doing great yeah right have you checked Somerville lately genius if you look at your own city\nWhat's sad is that bill won't even take a simple site bet on himself at the group so smart oh after deciding to stir it up the fiction Easter painting is going to run into reality show enough and he knows it\nWell then Jeff deal tweets back saying hold on we had a bad over the gas tax\nAnd if if I lost I was going to wear a hoodie\nThat said the guy you know I support the gas tax increase or whatever and if you lost your going to wear a hoodie tank the gas tax well you lost you couldn't get the automatic increases in the gas tax what occurred atone do he never took up the bat\nHe never followed through on the bad you will shift\nSo Geoff Diehl shoots back and says well the last time we had a bet and you lost you didn't order it you know why Jeff didn't say that but I'm going to say it 'cause he's a sleazy wine corrupt politicians that's what he is he's a lawyer like Elizabeth Warren is a Democrat that's what they do they lie\nSo just like going to make another bit after you well on the last bit\nSo he kept trying to go after deal and I said you know what he's just going after Jeff because he knows that this is backfiring and blowing up on a loser this war in space\nSo he's trying to make an issue now out of Jeff deal and why won't eat drink a dumb beer with them so the corner man I said enough is enough so I tweeted Kurt atone chicken cacciatore oh and I said quote tough guy why don't you come on my show\nOh and debate me\nYou want to make these kinds of childish pure aisle pathetic bats in challenges as the mayor of a city\nWhy don't you come on my show and debate to me and let's see what you've got a whole when\nI challenge chicken cacciatore do a debate so an ally you should have seen the way he was backtracking then it's like well oh who cares about this issue or you want to talk about this issue it's on the Twitter feed you can see it for yourself and I'm like you're the one that's talking about it\nYou're the one that's making a big deal about this so come on tough guy put your money where your mouth is will you come on my show and debate me man or woman or chicken cacciatore\nNothing nothing\nAnd so finally I sent them a tweet said I get it your chicken went a little gift fun it\nIs it a gift for a Jeff Jeff to guess\nWhat do you call it ... it's like yeah okay so it a little gift on it of The Simpsons doing I'm a little chicken I'm a little chicken I'm too chicken I'm to check and I'm too chicken so he's a little chicken\nAnd that's I see what I mean he's all talk and no action and I got to tell you okay I'm going in this Twitter war with Israel\nAnd I can see he doesn't want to come on my show because he knows I Would destroy him I Would destroy sanctuary cities I Would destroy how we run Somerville I Would expose the corruption that's under this guys watch\nAbout his relatives and how he puts them on the payroll and now he's got false disability claims for many of his corrupt cousins I could go on and on with this guy\nSo he knows that so instead he runs instead tough guy now is in such a tough guy\nBecause he can hide behind social media and Twitter and I'm thinking is you're the mayor of a city and you're like a clown\nMaking challenges to people about whether you have the guts to drink a beer with me and why don't you drink a beer with me and so I told him and one of these tweets I sent back to him he says you know why won't just drink uh Sammy with me I'm like number one nobody calls it a Sammy day Sam adams I ...
