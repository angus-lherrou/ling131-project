to the seasons fifty two dot com for menu information in reservations\nBooked your holiday party today and get a special gift for all your guests [noise] I I I feel\nBad because I've already been talking about the holiday shopping season I think yesterday and today because there's been a little bit of news about it so I Can't help myself but we're now into four so we're allowed to start thinking about it from at least they are earnings perspective and FAO Schwarz\nIs that making an international pushing also reopening their flagship store in New York a head of the season\nYou know we we hear so much about everything going on line and bricks and mortar closing down but the fact the matter is\nBricks and mortar is still a great differentiate or for companies if it becomes a destination chair and let's face it everyone knows the FAO Schwarz in New York City if you're drawing a blank here I didn't come along to yeah it's a tourist trap yeah exactly yeah\nAnd you know they are smart in my opinion opening up again I'm a ends at thirty rock you know right by NBC pretty good timing with toys are us disclosing every single one of those okay hands out early and and you know like I said it's a it's a tourist destination get people on there you don't get a lot of talk\nA gay ... that's a luxury toy brand new when they were open back when you have like personal shoppers and your air you would have concierge type services so I mean it's Manhattan It's over the top it's that's what it's supposed to be\nAnd they're also going to pop up shops in Spain Australia and London for the holiday season people go in there and get some very nice expensive ideas\nYou know what's going to be the other interesting show among all the other companies that are trying to pick 'em to Toys R us a new app since I'm party city\nThey do get you know those Halloween yup up shops that they do a ... year they're also going to do toys city pop ups ... they're going to take that same space that they rent for Halloween and open up these little toy pop up shops\nTo try and gobble up some of this Toys R us absence that we're going to have this year and a get a lot of people like to go these stores and see the stuff in person and find out how goofy they look in those outfits or whatever you know you know at whole foods doing what\nAmazon's giving up a toy brochures to whole foods shoppers ah okay here's the British are and all that stuff all the crap that we sell on Amazon dot com that you can buy for your kid that you know trying to grab everything in the store so smart move ... smart move getting these pop up stores people will definitely go there and they'll spend money I think so\nThree housing trends to watch this fall job we've talked about the real estate market extensively and some weaknesses that we're seeing what what do we what are we should we be looking at this\nFall will you know the bottom line is despite this huge recovery and you know an almost all of the recoveries the key issue was housing\nThis is a recovery that's been fantastic and housing simply hasn't come on housing starts have or have not done well housing stocks are doing very poorly right now\nAnd I suddenly keep an eye on to see that things could get even worse is can rates stay under five percent if they go elsewhere said it's going to walk a lot of people out of the market you have a ... ...\nISIS ease up on the gas pedal a this is something to keep an eye on two we\nHave seen so this was three months in a row now where we've seen the year over your home prices the median home prices nationwide increasing it less than five percent and that hasn't happened since twenty fourteen so clearly we're seeing some deceleration anyway we're not seeing every adoption and home prices were seeing some\nDeceleration in the increase we're seeing buyers and sellers coming together and getting an equilibrium price that seems reasonable I don't hear the stories about Fifteen bids over asking price anymore exactly\nAnd I saw a number of I think is reflective of what's going on here the ratio at banks\nOf loans to deposits is the lowest in forty years which means banks are sitting on a lot of capital and they're not lending it out and in part it's because a lot of people applying don't qualify because these prices are too high incomes don't justify it and on top of that has been a lot of regulations that have precluded a lot of one thing\nThis is going to be an interesting issue as we go forward to get banks to kind of open up and start writing business because it was just the opposite extreme eleven years ago\nYeah young buyers still really aren't in the marketing force a twenty five thirty five year olds are thirty six point five percent homeownership rate\nThat still well below where ... where at the same point in time a number of different factors can point to where there'd be student loans are not getting married yet still you know millennials are not buying homes at the same rights that their parents and grandparents were buying them\nNowhere near but the trend here is encouraging because millennials are now starting to increase their share and I look forward I think a lot of this purchase has been delayed not put off\nUm and I think you can see a lot of people doing in their thirties with previous generations did in their twenties is going to be a huge boon I think for housing going forward\nI keep your everyone pointing to hey you know great news you don't need to put twenty percent down every you know everyone says oh you need you need to be buying a home with twenty percent down and\nThat's clearly not the true because not true because of all these programs that we have I really don't love these programs that exist though I mean I Know that they are important to get first time homebuyers in the house but the ... are we going back to some of the issues we saw back in the early to thousands comes out of the issue\nOf scholarships for students going to college the more money your hand out the more prices actually go up you know the easy you make credit in terms of low down payments the more likely you are to get people to buy more house than\nMaybe they should write and got VA loans guaranteed by the department of veteran affairs or require no downpayment right kind of agree with that one uh USDA loans allow people to buy rural homes without much of a down payment so\nThey I don't think we're running into an issue there but you something to keep an eye for an eye on it yeah it's all the time we have

she sleeps with a loaded gun by her bed\nHoly moly I mean\nIs what I'm saying only I sleep with a loaded gun\nI I you\nKnow the reason why she's doing that\nIs because Cory Booker I Am Spartacus wrote

encouraging violence intimidation\nAnd threats against their political opponents\nNow I'm telling you\nThe Democrats are going to get so lax [noise]\nBecause I think middle America looks at this and says this man worked in Venezuela\nBut in America no way baby\nI think what has changed to be Frank\nIs that Trump's national security team now has changed you now have my palm pale as secretary of state and even more importantly you have both and John Bolton as the national security advisor Bolton previously was the U.S ambassador to the un\nSo I'm not saying that her job there became obsolete of course you need somebody who's going to be a a forceful advocate for the United states but with Bolton now supervising her with bolt in on the national security team\nWe've got the un covered\nIt's the you know there is no leadership vacuum the leadership is being provided by both in and buy palm pale so the question now is\nUltimately do you believe the reason that she and Trump gates listen now to Nikki Haley roll it Brittany\n... on her at all I Want to pay\nIt [laughter] you know allowing us to come out in the the way it is then an honor in a lifetime you know I said\nLeave the state

not citing any sources I don't have any sources but my suspicion is as follows I think\nEither\nShe's gearing up for a Senate run\nAnd well who would possibly be leaving Jeff well Lindsey Graham who denies it Lindsey Graham who says he won't take the job even if he's offered it however it is now being floated that after the November midterm elections Trump is going to fire sessions and he's going to need a new attorney general\nAnd you know who he wants to be as next attorney general you guessed it lion Lindsey\nHe would love to have Lindsey Graham be is next attorney general so if Lindsey Graham becomes the next attorney general that's going to leave a big opening for that Senate seat\nAnd you know who would most likely win that Senate seat would be Nikki Haley so this could be Trump playing three dimensional chess whereby less clear the decks I'm getting ready for after the midterm elections\nThe moment whatever the election results are whatever happens I'm firing Jeff Sessions I'm\nGoing to bring in a Lindsey Graham that's going to leave an open seat Nikki Haley will then be stepping away from the un and she'll be ready to run\nPick a few weeks vacation gets some are in our and then when the primary is set in a special election is that she'll be ready to run and take Lindsey Graham's seat that is the first theory the second theory\nIf you listen to the press conference

Kushner the quote hidden genius unquote inside the White House ... von ... is brilliant Jarrett is brilliant\nMaybe she's stepping down maybe it is burned out and she needs are in our or maybe she wants to come back and become secretary of state in a second Trump term\nShe'll write a book do a foreign policy book to make some money on this speaking tour and then be ready to be secretary of state potentially in a second Trump term\nAnd even on cut Trump becomes now the next UN ambassador\nSo let me ask you this why do you think Nikki Haley resigned and who do you think should replace her\nAnd do you think of von cut Trump should be the successor to Nikki Haley\nI'm gonna tell you what I think and I'm gonna tell you surprisingly what Britney thinks right after this short break All

[noise]\nI mean I'm looking at this I'm saying what country or are we living in\nThey have said if you want our politics we're not Republicans we're not conservatives in fact I suspect all of them are probably liberal but they're just honest researchers it doesn't matter\nThe researchers in the professors are now being vilified they are now being attacked they are being threatened noticed by the way like what happened to our country that all of it everybody's getting frightened now\nEverybody\nDo like the less now these just death threats like it's like I'd like to get sneezing\nYou know it's like it's hello hell and I'm going to kill you by the way how good morning and you know what you better retract that the research number or else a boom boom you're going to sleep with the fish is okay and I have a nice morning so now they have been getting death threats\nTheir families have been threatened they have been threatened there's pressure on the MIT and yelled to fire them\nTo literally cost them their career because they're angry and furious that they know came close to the truth I said no the real illegal immigrant population is twenty two million now part of this twenty\nTwo million not all not even close to all\nBut the fact is part of this twenty two million cars remember\nThey're not vetted illegal immigrant is the akin to somebody just coming into your house to squander that's one of the legal immigrant is it is somebody who is not invited\nNot part of your family not a friend not an acquaintance not a colleague and they just come into your home countries like go home and they just barge in through the door\nAnd then they occupy your house there in your basement they eat your food they go to your fridge that empty out your medicine cabinet they they just they just live off of you\nAnd you don't know who they are they're complete strangers\nSo because they're under vetted many of them are criminals and they're being deliberately set\nBy MS Thirteen now you're going to say Jeff Jeff Jeff ... said that that race is Jeff Jeff ... hey Dan Rivera is gonna be the next governor of Massachusetts after Charlie Baker is done what his second term okay by the way that I'm not kidding but Dems are already promoting them\nThan the ... the reason why they're promoting I'm he's bilingual I Swear to God\nWell he speaks Spanish so he speaks English really speak Spanish so the illegals love him and he's communicating to the illegals and he's gonna be the perfect governor of Massachusetts but Jeff shut your mouth shut ate a diversity Jeff it's good for us Jeff require Jeff bumpy erases Jeff quiet now All right so listen to this\nStory now from the Associated Press the a P you don't get more establishment then be eight states not from Breitbart it's not from the Drudge Report from Fox News it's from the associated\nPress listen now to this you want to see the cost to illegal immigration listen to Boston alone and the greater Boston area it was but it is [noise]\nSo in east Boston recording now to the Associated Press there has been a huge powerful um group of MS Thirteen gangs\nIn fact it is getting so bad that every summer\nThe people who live in Boston and according to a pie I find this ridiculous\nThat ah they've that MS Thirteen has now quote struck fear into residents of this majority Latin American neighborhood\nWell it's not a Latin American neighborhood it's a Latino neighborhood maybe many of them come from Latin America but it's you know we're not in Latin America but anyway let that go\nSo church pastors police officers dozens of residents are now handing out signs bearing messages in Spanish like last year event us on foot total us are the future or Utah split all up odds together for peace why\nBecause they fear MS Thirteen\nAnd fat Sandra isle of man ... she's in fact from El Salvador she's one of the woman that organizes the marches\nSays that they're trying to let people know that everybody that's been directly impacted by the rise of MS Thirteen and the violence that comes with them that we are with them we stand with them all of the victims\nAnd that we will care about them and we still worry about them\nThe FBI conducted a massive\nRate of east Boston several years ago according to the a P thirty sorry sixteen members of MS Thirteen were rounded up by the FBI fifty seven of the six feet were illegal aliens\nAll but three of those sixty that were rounded up are going to be sent for deportation after they finished their sentences here in the United states gay so basically it was overwhelmingly illegal further more as the AP points out\nLeaders came from El Salvador because the El Salvador we in headquarters of MS Thirteen told them we need to mobilize in Boston\nAnd their direction was round up more gang members in Boston and the greater Boston area listen to this we want you to target the schools the high schools we want you to get into drug dealing broad distribution\nOpiates heroin big money to be made and so now according to the FBI I'm just reading now from VA pee story\nIs that forty nine gang members have so far been convicted many of them I'm not quoting verbatim facing Fifteen Years to life in prison\nFor racketeering crimes like listen to this attempted murder drug distribution robbery and extortion\nSixteen defendants were charged in six killings from two thousand fourteen to two thousand sixteen alone they say three other MS Thirteen related deaths from that period are also being tried in local courts\nBut hold on according now to the FBI\nThey said that veteran gang members were sent to Boston I'm reading it out for bait them from the story from El Salvador\nTo organize local factions ramp up high school recruitment step up drug dealing and undertake the Savage attacks often with machetes and nights that I've become MS thirteenth hallmark\nAccording now to ask the FBI\nAnd former assistant us attorney Peter ... who led the prosecution and the Boston case it's he now says there is a recent surge in MS Thirteen violence in Boston and in the greater Boston area\nMS Thirteen after the raid were kind of disrupted\nAnd it kind of it it it it it ... pampered down some of their activities but now he says MS Thirteen is back\nAnd they're back with a vengeance there as strong as ever in fact Lynn police are now saying that murders inland tied to MS Thirteen are now up\nIn east Boston murders are now back up tied to MS Thirteen now what does all this mean in a nutshell it means that is\nThe more illegal immigration vote more crime the more violence the more MS Thirteen the more people are murdered\nThe more people are raped the more drugs are dealt on the streets and the more our high schools become greedy breeding grounds for M. S. Thirteen and vicious murderous gangs\nAnd Elizabeth Warren wants to abolish ice Elizabeth Warren wants to abolish the border patrol\nElizabeth Warren if she had her way and you want to know why you need to vote for Jeff deal this reason alone\nYou would have more murders more beheadings more drugs not just in east Boston but according to the FBI inland\nIn Chelsea in Dorchester in rocks brewery in mold than in Salem in revere all across the greater in Lawrence bubble a Espanol\nAll over the greater Boston area\nElizabeth Warren and the moon bats in this state or on the side of MS Thirteen which side are you one\n\n[noise] so let's see what they went out with they've done they've given us Fifteen thousand dollars to give away every day made possible by who else\nOf course they don't
