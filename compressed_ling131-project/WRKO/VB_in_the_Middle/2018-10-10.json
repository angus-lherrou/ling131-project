mouth I Want you to listen now to Nancy Pelosi described\nExactly how the Democrats conduct their smear operations and when she refers to you she's actually talking to members of the media\nSo she's telling depressed look here's how we you know this but let me tell you how we do things here and you tell me after you've heard this that if this was not the exact thing that they just did to now justice Brett Kavanaugh roll it Britain\nTo selling demonized and then you recall that wrapped up in the air and you might tell talented caught that wraps near near somebody\nFalls Church and all the rest\nAnd then you write his report and the press that this this is a mess\nSo they had that down the ... the past we've put it this lawyer\nAnd then it's called the wrath of news now than it merchandising passenger checkpoint near that we made and it's\nAnd it's it's self evident\nBingo but it's a tactic\nWorks because what we do is how we roll it ... smear\nYou see so what we do is we make up stories BS your smear a guy like Brett Kavanaugh gate possibly get somebody else do your dirty work but come out there\nHe's a sexual predator he's an attempted rape as he runs a gang rape network he was at the center of it and then of course we give it to you because you guys are our allies you're basically mouth pieces\nOr party and then you guys merchandise it meaning you sell it you're promoting you repeat it\nAnd you're just repeated and repeated and you sell it and you're promoting you merchandise it so that people out there oh my God wants to media setting and it must be true oh my God for serious oh my God I Believe her I don't believe him I mean we I don't believe her\nAnd uh that's how we roll\nMaxed maxed now\nListening to James Carville now notice he's coming back now that Hillary maybe getting ready to run in twenty twenty notice now he's on CNN more often he was long gone for a long time we thought he was dead and buried oh no no no he's now back\nListen now to James Carville 'cause he's they're nice fighter he's their kneecap or\nLook at him now come out of the woodwork and say no no no with Kavanaugh oh\nHe's worse to was a hell of a lot more alive than dead we're going to use this all the way to twenty twenty we're going to call 'em a rapist a sexual predator we won investigations we want to impeach him we're not going to stop until we get all of our power back roll it Brittany\n... that's the money question Michael\nAnd I just found myself today is that the Democrats Kavanaugh's worth a lot is worth a lot more alive than dead\nAnd what isn't going to be very interesting about this is usually so you do confirm Supreme Court justice egg on the Supreme Court whenever it out and then you hear about 'em to ride a decision and people like adult life or something like that\nThis is not going to go away that they're not going to stop doing stories on Kavanaugh ... that they can you know they're going to keep them front and center or the Democrats win a house they'll probably wholesome kind of hearings on on the fact that a lot of people are just really Ralph\nSuffer right there notice he's talking about the media\nLike when he suddenly speech for the media the media is going to keep writing stories about this to me it's not going to stop no you know why wink wink 'cause we've given out orders\n\nWe're told them they came out they came out he sleeps we'd be free ... he's a gum he's around it based on a fish and I had a ... and you just keep putting putting that OK keep going Brittany\nOr inefficient and he's not going to go away and if they had they defeated him they would have just pick someone equally as right wing his cabinet on at a random through in in a lame duck session that we're not going to get this said on the Supreme Court\nAnd I think in terms of political optimization that think today's resolve it is probably as good as she could help on him\nBut he's worth more to us alive and dead\nBecause we are going to run against is God we're going to investigate them and do people in the media are going to do her dirty work and it's still wrap up smear\nWe're just not gonna stop smearing this guy I mean it's all being laid bare and they want to get even more ruthless [noise]\nWhat else would honestly how how more ruthless do you want to go to Ross in Boston Thanks for holding and welcome\nFirst of all it's all going to depend on what happens here and now it's just\nIf Elizabeth Warren gets or not and and and ... and just said as a mess just United States senator\nShe got to run for president and the Democratic party is not going to make the same mistake ended without ... and and I made a loose a for a second time and the reason why I say that it is that\nReally ... with ... as the standard bearer for the American left and Hillary Clinton really is not they don't trust for and they've got to put all their eggs in one basket\nAnd let's face it the American a law that owns and runs the Democratic party it owns and runs the American media\nIn Elizabeth Warren is going to be that choice if he gets re elected or messages\nSo Ross if we block or now if we cut her off at the pass your saying we're basically stripping the Democrats of their standard bearer but if she beats deal in November you're thinking she's going to win the nomination and challenge Trump's been twenty twenty\nI think that's what's gonna happen because I don't see anyone else out there that's a viable candidate for the American ...\nInteresting ... as always rush thank you for that call six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight is the number okay my friends from\nNow turns this fire on Dianne Feinstein\nAnd Elizabeth Warren [noise]\nNow they say they should lock Dianne Feinstein up\nShould they will discuss but first having hiding a rich has the latest story the White House says President Trump is still deciding on a replacement\nFor UN ambassador Nikki Haley taken away even [noise]\nAnd basically undermine every ethical norm and break the law then they should be held to account now that's why if the if the Republicans that any stones if they had any guts they would call for a full investigation\nThey would I be ... to me you would investigate number one Dianne Feinstein\nYou would investigate how she got the letter why she held on to the letter\nHow she got into Deborah cats how she recommended Deborah cats how she got into Michael Brown which how come Andy McCabe the deep state lawyer was recommended\nWhat did James call me play a role in this the deep state play a role in this Chuck Schumer I'm positive he knew about this from the very beginning\nBecause Tom Cotton I played the clip and the last hour rightly points out\nMonica maclean the F the former FBI agent that blaze e for coach to beat a polygraph does is in fact very good friends with one of Chuck Schumer's former top lawyers and by the way a staunch Democrat it and the Trump ...\nShow and she's the one that walked up to him and said you got to hear what Christine Blasey Ford's got to say\nOh we're going to sink tab and all and that's\nWhen they said to her write a letter write a letter or who are rated to write it to the Senate Judiciary a ranking member\nThey've been to your member of Congress she's going to give it to Dianne Feinstein relax then we're going to take over from here and then they even told her lawyer up with democratic operatives both for Feinstein even met with Kavanaugh\nSo she knew about all of this and so did Schumer when they interviewed Kavanaugh one on one when there was Kevin on the hearings he was under oath\nAnd they waited and waited and waited and then they leaked her name even though she expressly asked to keep it confidential\nNow there's no getting around is\nYou got them you got him\nSo not only frankly should Hillary Clinton go to prison\nDianne Feinstein should go to prison members over stuff when gauging this should go to prison and to me what I find remarkable I'm looking at all of this and I'm saying and my living in the twilight zone\nHow come nobody wants to hold Christine Blasey Ford Deborah Ramirez and a Julie sweat Nick accountable for committing perjury lying under oath\nChristine Blasey Ford has now been exposed as an all out liar\nIt never happened none of it happened so\nWhen she and her own witnesses said it never happened but more than that her own therapists know show that she kept saying the attack took place in the mid Nineteen eighties when she was Nineteen years old not what she told the committee in the early Nineteen eighties when she was Fifteen because if it took place that she sold her therapist\nAnd she told others for years\nThat's another thing the media is covering up she told others after the therapist meeting yeah it occurred in the mid Nineteen eighties I was Eighteen or Nineteen\nWell she's at Yale so it couldn't have happened the whole thing was a setup\nShe committed perjury she misled Congress furthermore take a look at Julie sweat mix the gang but one ... that the gang rape is the Michael ... client\nShould completely backtrack from her story after a sworn statement to the Senate saying no no no no I saw him he was spiking the punch ship was with ... which was grain alcohol oh my God the men were lining up outside the door by the dozens of rape all these women\nAnd then she basically tells NBC News now [laughter]\nMaybe [laughter] well it wasn't quite like that and she walks back or central allegations she lied under oath no I'll tell you this you lie under oath you're going to jail Brittany you lie under\nOath I'm telling you you're going to jail I lie under oath I go to jail but if I'm part of a democratic a smear campaign and a democratic assassination attempt no sorry to use Nancy Pelosi's term\n... smear if you're part of the Democrats his wrap up smear in fact you know what I Want to play it again\nI Want to play the wrap up smear again because this is exactly what they did the capital this that she's so stupid she actually revealed the Democrats his playbook\nSo listen to everything Nancy Pelosi is telling the Prescott you guys know how it works listen to her this is exactly what they did to Kavanaugh rural cut for\nBrands herself and selling demonized and then you recall that wrapped up in the air and you might tell talented caught that wraps near near somebody\nWith false alerts and all the rest\nAnd then you write ... who will say this report and the press that this is this a mess\nSo they had that Donald ... past reporting this layer\nAnd then it's called the wrath of news now than it merchandise passes reporting from near that we made it\nAnd it's it's self evident\nThat well you know how it works I mean generally and work this time it didn't because you are Donald Trump\nBut what did we do\nAn alleged sexual assault or an alleged rapist wrap up to smear\nWrap it up nice hide it hide it hold it hold it hold it then wrap it up beautifully\nAnd then you give it to the media which is what they did to the Washington Post and then CNN New York times on MSNBC everybody kept saying and then you merchandise you sell it you're promoting you push it\nAnd it's false we know it's false but it doesn't matter it does the job\nNow that's going to stop because this is going to continue unless people there are consequences to be paid until until people are held accountable Dianne Feinstein needs to be investigated and sent to prison\nHer staff anybody who is involved Chuck Schumer but in particular Blasey Ford Deborah Ramirez and Julie sweat Nick\nIf you lie under oath and your mislead Congress and you engage an outright slander and defamation it's time to pay a price agree disagree six one set up to six six sixty eight sixty eight your calls next\nSo let's see what they went out they've done they've given us sixteen thousand dollars to give away every day made possible by who\nElse me of course they don't have

Johnny McKay\nWent to a bar in Vancouver, Washington and Johnny drives a Nissan tighten pickup truck\nNow I'm staring at the truck right now I kid you not you would think it's in Iraq or Syria\nOr maybe like in El Salvador or Mexico when they report on you know some kind of a terrorist act or a a gang killing or the drug cartels attacking somebody in blowing up their trucks\nIs scorched\nIt has been burned\nIt has been set fire to it's it's it's it's just it's a holiday would show well what happened was that Johnny McKay has as I told you is pickup truck and on the pickup truck there are two bumper stickers on\nOne says Trump wants people on the make liberals cry again\nAnd the other one I think just says Trump twenty\nMake America great again or whatever so he's a Trump supporter ironically he didn't even vote for Trump in twenty six theme however he's become a Trump supporter because he's seen how successful ineffective his policies have been\nSo now he says you know what I I Love this guy so he's at the bar his truck has been parked in the parking lot and Johnny has a few drinks too many\nAnd so does the responsible thing rather than driving under the influence he gets some cell phone over he goes home he sleeps set off well apparently when he got back in the morning to you know to get his pickup truck it was scorched it was burned\nI mean literally the seats are melted the engine has not been torched it and there was Trump spray painted on decide\nAccording to the neighbors that live near the bar at about two thirty PM\nAccording to my uh Flores she lives right near by the bar\nQuote we heard a loud boom we feel the boom it shakes our bed just opening the door and seeing the flames it was like crazy it was crazy to see\nThe police now say that this was clearly an act of political terrorism\nThey suspect that this has all of antifa written all over it the marks the markings and the makings of an ... all over this and what happened was some crazy moon bat either black lives matter or antifa saw the truck\nSaw the Trump the pro Trump's bumper stickers on the truck and looks around said nobody's looking what the hell let's tortured\nAnd so they burnt the truck it had such severe damage that they got a total the truck to truck is finished\nSo listen now to pour Johnny McKay say what was my crime just what a couple of bumper stickers and for this ... I lost my truck you burn my truck\nRole because Britain turn then all of a sudden I saw\nThe tires were melted and the windows are shattered and [noise]\nI was just in shock I literally just put those on this weekend literally just put them on and uh if I were to nominate somebody who's going to take their politics as far as I I thought they were funny\nAnd apparently somebody then get the job if you say anything that somebody doesn't like you're automatically a target you're you're automatically the enemy and they have to hurt you\n\nWill Elizabeth Warren disavow this because she's the one that has now polled the left to go after Trump supporters that Trump is hijacked our democracy\nThat they need now to take back the streets to take back our neighborhood to take back our communities to take back the capital that they need to do everything in their power everything to stop Trump and his apparent ... dictatorship from taking over the United states\nAntifa and Elizabeth Warren are tied at the hip\nShe supports them and they support her and what do they support political violence political terrorism now they're blowing up and poor ching trucks\nThey've gone from torching campuses to now torching trucks parked at bars\nYou want to know the real left you want to know the street left the revolutionary left the Elizabeth Warren ...

I fast forward to twenty seven in\n... fascist action the Democratic party of the United states of America\nIt it never went away Jeff it never went away it's the same group it's the same mindset and there's no difference between the Nazis and the communist they want and this and\nDo you think this is going to blow up and the Democrats face Jerry\nJeff I think something bad is going to happen is a guy by the name of Dr ... he's out of Florida he's ... and he has a blog spot in a Web site he's encouraging attacking Sean Hannity Laura Ingraham Michael Savage\n... in a Alex Jones was hit squads this is what he's talking about killing conservative people [noise]\nThat Jerry in mind the list\nYou probably are\nThey're just a joke about so can you know why\nBecause I've got Brittany that's all I don't want to say anything more\nWhy would you even give him that kind of legitimacy that kind of important ...\nThis is what I don't get I mean to me why we ABC News is one of the biggest enemies and opponents of President Trump and the Trump family so why would you even reward them with an interview never mind than exclusive allegedly tell all interview\n\nThis there's honestly the one thing I don't get about the Trump communications team you rightly called them fake news\nYou rightly expose their lives and their propaganda under smears and yet you also will send some of your top people or the president himself for his first lady or whoever to do interviews that just gives them more legitimacy more credibility\nMore attention ... interview I'm telling you right now is going to be a huge scope for ABC News\nThey're going to have record ratings\nHuge revenue all you're doing is putting money in their pocket\nAnd if they're fake news I mean just the the subliminal messages obvious well if there's such fake news so you're agreeing to interview to be interviewed by them why\nI mean\nYou wouldn't go to I don't know some crazy conspiracy website and be interviewed\nBy them you wouldn't go to some you know wacko uh uh uh uh uh you know some fringe a network you wouldn't you know you wouldn't our T Russia Russia Today Russia television you wouldn't do an interview by them\nSo if you're going and doing an interview with ABC don't you kind of passive leaned or some don't you're kinda tacitly said there were legitimate news outlet\nSo honestly I don't know why they do it I really don't I Would ignore him not sorry\nStops smearing me and then maybe we'll talk stop being a real news outlet and do actual real news instead of fake news then maybe we'll talk\nBut if you're going to have Jonathan Karl and Steffi Stephanopoulos\nAnd a a rat it's Martha Raddatz and that whole criminal gang stand there and make up a lie after lie smear after smear false allegation after false allegation why would I even bother to sit down with you\n[noise] ... why sure fake news\nYour garbage and use\nYour nothing more than a democratic propaganda outlet why do I want to be interviewed by propagandist instead she's agreed\nAnd they're teasing summer for answers listen to apparently how she's going to answer the question or at least part of it on that hashtags me too movement rural cuts five Brittany\nYou support the me too movement [laughter] I have to put the ... can be say we need to support them and you know also men not to the men\nDo you think man and and the news that I've been accused of a sexual assault sexual harassment had been treated unfairly\nYou need to have really high diving do they you know if you're ...\nSo basically she's saying um show me the evidence\nWhich is I think the right answer I mean we're not just going to believe somebody on the basis of an allegation or an accusation you have to have you know I don't know cooperation substantiate ... ... you know you need actual ...\nThat's the other world works that's how America works this is not the old Soviet Union or Nazi Germany doesn't work like that at least in theory it shouldn't work like that\nSo I thought honestly that's a good effective answer now what I Want to know is is they're going to ask about the alleged affairs they're going to ask about the alleged infidelity is we know because they're touting it they're teasing it\nNow number one why you would allow yourself to be asked these humiliating questions the purpose of the question itself is just to humiliate her really I'll tell you what this it's obvious what the tacit messages this you are such a beautiful graceful woman\nAnd your husband cheats on you all legit leave with porn stars like Stormy Daniels oh\nOh my God\nIs he dissing you always see disrespecting you oh is he slapping you in the face you must be humiliated you must be outraged oh my God you must be so ashamed and be graded by this they're doing it simply to embarrass her\nThat's why they're asking these questions now I Hope I Hope\nThat her answer is going to be something like mind your own freaking business\nThat's between me and my husband\nIf you want to run around and peddle this kind of garbage in your no better than the national Enquirer\nBut what goes on between me and my husband is between me and my husband and it's nobody's business it's none of your bees wax\nI Hope she gives an answer like that if\nShe tries to give them any kind of credibility or tries to seriously address them in any way then she's going to become the butt of jokes and that's I think the whole purpose of this ABC News interview\nIt's a trap it's a trap\nTo do another hit job on millennia Trump not because to be fair they hate Milan your Trump they don't care about millennia Trump she's collateral damage\nIt's to go after her to go after her husband and so my question to you is this\nBig interview with ABC News this week it's going to air a friday ten pm Milan your Trump will beyond exclusive one on one interview\nShould millennia have agreed to do the interview\nWas it a big mistake on her part and if she's asked they she will when she's asked the question about marital infidelity alleged infidelity how sure she answer it\nIf you were asked that question and you were the first
