{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Sort of just throwing stuff while the what will stick and even things that you would have thought would do well like iron and it's just part of the whole\nDisney marvel empire they canceled bad after two seasons 'cause you know it just wasn't a show that a lot of people are really into so I think that's like taking a lot of risks and you know many of them are paid off but it just a lot of money that they continue to spend I think\nThat is you know on state I'm all for the long term\nBut one of the things that I find interesting here is this is a market overall this year that even though it's it's still up somewhat for the year it's the market that's gotten cheaper because earnings growth has outstripped what we've seen as far as appreciation for the broad market\nNetflix isn't in that situation they've gotten a more hype and who say they're definitely not yeah so there are company even with this quarter you could make the case it's it's riskier today than it was at the beginning of the year still\nYeah I think that that is a very good argument that gets to the counter that I Would have with that is that Netflix seems to be treated in this club like Amazon or you\nCan you be overvalued for two decades that mean that's really you know when it comes to Amazon ... always been over ... type yeah and it keeps going up and up and up and I think it's really just because\nPeople have faith in what Jeff pays are doing it and then the numbers kinda know prove it with all the growth there and I think with Reed Hastings ... like you have a similar ah you know argument this kind of a cult that the c._e._o. sort of a warship if you will people really seem to think that they can't do anything wrong\nPoll in terms of competition for Netflix you know we we we were asking this earlier this week in terms of who the biggest competitors are\nIn my opinion one that's not a pure streaming service but HBO just because they have that subscription model in a hundred and thirty million subscribers worldwide obviously they've they've got that good base that's already built in\nYou've got companies like Hulu you've got companies like Amazon who even though they don't put it out they still have a big streaming service who is the biggest competitor in your opinion four foot right now\nYeah it's a tough question I think what's really difficult to try and figure out with regard to competition a lot of people talk about how competition could be bad for any of these services my counter to that would be that\nAs long as the broader economy is doing well it's not really a kind of binary option I don't know that many people say\nWell you know what I'm not going to subscribe to HBO even though I Love the game of Thrones because I only can afford Netflix and I want to watch the final season of arch the new black I think people\nAre very ... consumers live\nStreaming content right now and you know most people I Know they they have an Amazon for ... for the Amazon chose they watch HBO they watch Netflix and you know various authors as well I think it is going to be interesting to see whether or not but Disney Fox\nStreaming service that launches next here takes away some of the uh you know a traction for Netflix but uh you know even there I'm not so sure that people are going to drop Netflix just to go to it\nBut one of the things that's missing from Netflix right now if you will get all these other services out there\nThey all have some other kind of lived content they can offer whether it's you know Amazon has some Thursday Night Football games and some soccer games even Twitter has some of those uh you know obviously the legacy players like a Disney and Fox have sports news and things like that any ...\nSwitch getting heavier into those areas because it's one thing that seems to be missing from their portfolio right now\nYeah it definitely is something that uh you don't have right now but I think for the most part it's not something that I think uh you know they really feel a need to get into especially when you look at how\nWhat streaming the streaming media explosion kind of it done to TV in general I mean live TV seems in many respects to be\nAn antiquated notion unless you're talking about a big\nSporting event or or some big news event or you know because of\nPeople's very busy lives time shifting is kind of what people do and you know you don't have to necessarily have to have an appointment live TV yeah as a draw I think\nIt really is more about having that attractive appealing content that you get to watch whenever you have time to watch it whether or not that you know two o'clock in the afternoon if you work in the evenings or you know eight o'clock at night if you have a regular day job\n[noise] pretty good Paul we've got to run now but thanks for joining us to have a great weekend and we'll catch up with the island\nYou too and I

Commission one of the greatest political blunders in recent American political history\nSo right away is handler said no that did not look good for you so right after the debate or the I misspoke\nI Know it it came out the wrong way or you didn't come out the way I said it I I well I really meant it but I I shouldn't have said what I said rural cut to Brittany ... like\nSaid I was just for the thick of it\nYeah in the\nMidst of all the sources again I'm going to vote for some of them even though he doesn't mention before\nHearing is correct then why then why [noise]\nThis is something an after\nRealizing how the conversation when during the debate that you recollections here or you know look I Am\nIn the back and forth um [noise]\nI simply missed both of us with us I guess\nI don't believe him I don't believe him he's a liar\nIf no one else has the guts to say it I'm going to say it Charlie fake Kirk is a lawyer he's not going to vote for Jeff deal and I'll tell you why he's not going to vote for Jeff deal why do you vote for Jeff deal if he didn't vote for Trump in two thousand sixteen\nAnd I suspect he voted for Hillary Clinton but let that go why we vote for deal\nOn what issue that she actually agree with deal on deal is for the wall Trump I started dealers for the wall Baker is against the wall deal backed Kavanaugh Baker is against Kavanaugh\nDeal oppose this sanctuary cities and amnesty Baker supports sanctuary cities and amnesty I mean I can run down the whole line of a deal is pro Second Amendment Baker resent the second amendment\nI mean on what issue does do Baker and ... and deal actually agree on\nSo he didn't vote for Trump in two thousand sixteen there's no way in hell is going to vote for dealing two thousand in Eighteen deal is in America first conservative he's in America first populist\nSo of course Baker is never going to vote for deal what he did was he made the mistake of actually speaking of the truth it slipped out during the debate and he did this just one deal was starting to get a lot of momentum and a big bounce from that whole DNA test debacle\nAnd furthermore there is a very interesting piece in today's Boston Herald by Joe Biden felt and Batman felt really I think exposes how Baker really can't stand Jeff deal\nAnd according to the baton felt piece he mentions that there was a Harold editorial board earlier this week we're Baker attended and to the shock of everybody at the Herald editorial board\nThey asked him why do you think deal would be a better US Senator than Elizabeth Warren according to Joel baton felt Baker couldn't come up with one single\nReason not won his answer\nI'm going to talk about why it'd be a better governor then Jacobs Alice and why Karen ... would be a better lieutenant governor then Quentin ball free a Baker said I Believe it's up to the candidates to make their own case for their own position\nAs it should be in other words Baker is more than happy to trash Trump every chance he gets to rip him apart you mentioned towards Jeff deal and he runs like a chicken\nHas he done a fundraiser for a deal yet has he caught one TV ad endorsing deal yet has the even written him a fifty dollar check for his campaign yet because I'll tell you why\nBecause Charlie Baker is a Democrat\nOn the issues Charlie Baker agrees with Elizabeth Warren on pretty much every issue\nHe's against the wall he's pro abortion she's pro sanctuary cities he's pro amnesty I mean just run down the line where he and Elizabeth Warren disagree on fundamentally on the issues\nThat's why when he's asked well on what issue is deal better than Elizabeth Warren he can't name one you know why because like a Democrat which is what he's turned into\nShe he prefers Warren over Jeff now let me tell you what I think is really going on here\n[noise] there was an unholy alliance there was a pact made remember\nMassachusetts is essentially a democratic mafia state\nI think as a mob and you understand

I Would say moderate but a sensible reasonable on threatening alternative\n... it's a delicate balance but this just have to be careful how he goes after Elizabeth Warren drawn in Kingston Europe next go ahead John\nHello John okay let's\nSee if we can get back to John Lou in Rhode Island blue thanks for holding the floor is yours go\nAre you doing Jeff of here's what he needs to do first of all he's got a point out that she's basically using Massachusetts as a stepping stone to run for president he's going to represent Massachusetts She isn't she's going to mediate Lee go out and run and twenty twenty and she and ignore the people of Massachusetts number two he's got to go after the issues like\nThe ice issue protecting the community if you take if you take us away\n... illegal criminals will basically be allowed to run free\nThe whole thing about the police supporting the police which he said about the justice system about taxes her fifty percent tax rate means more money leading Massachusetts and going to the federal government and it's and and the other thing that's really interesting about Elizabeth Warren you can just point out\nThat she's telling the truth one one thousand for\nThe time which is exactly what it is when she went with her with a with her test for being a Native American\nShe doesn't tell the truth about anything and you can't really trust her it's the trust is you can't trust her she's lying about on just about everything she says but the bread and butter issues eyes open borders and to and also to say he's going to be an independent representative\nAnd he's going to leave the United states just like the Republican senators and members of the house did\nThis last term and bringing us more strength\nMore prosperity a lower unemployment rate\nAnd making us feel safer in this country which is exactly what the last Republican Congress did under with along with President Trump\nAnd he's got a point them out and he can be staying there be strong he can be reasonable show he's like he's got the facts behind them and just be able to do that while she unravel and I think that's the that's those are so the big thing is a big bread and butter issues\nThat are important to the people Rhode Island and the end they're reporting to the people in this country\nBut she's just or put out and she's just a while though I'd open

that he has to watch his tone like the way Lin mentioned doesn't come across in the house dog me too movement a woman the media that he doesn't come across a bit like a bully the way he looks out or

you noticed nobody is asking a very important question about this Saudi missing whatever he's not missing you dead it's obvious to solve these order and execution a hit job and assassination\nOf this guy why did the Washington Post hire him as a contributor in the first place besides your mouth ...\nNumber one\nThey're going on about ... in a way that for example they never did about I don't know a Otto Warmbier on American was butchered and and tortured and eventually allowed to pretty much allowed to die in North Korea James Foley who was beheaded by ISIS\nThey never went on about Americans when they were killed or beheaded yet when it comes to cash ... who's not an American citizen in fact wasn't even a a a green card holder he just lived in northern Virginia and self imposed exile for a year\nThat's it that's it and I'm asking myself why would the Washington Post even hire this guy he wasn't a journalist he was a long time Saudi operative he was this book\nWorked for the Saudi intelligence agency he was close to the top guy the head of the Saudi intelligence uh uh a service\nThis for years so number one he was part of the regime of the Saudi royal family God Knows what he was involved in\nSo not that's not a journalist that's a political operative that's an intelligence spy insider and you choose him to be one of your contributors and then number two what the media is not telling you\nCrush Augie is not a defender of liberal democracy or a constitutional government or of human rights ... was Muslim Brotherhood\nCrush again he was a political Islam is\nHe fell out with the Saudi royal family you know why because she joined forces with the head of the president of turkey aired on who's Muslim Brotherhood that's what this was all about this was an internal

just American Kids or Canadian kid's or European kids Snow White and Cinderella is popular in Latin America in Africa in the middle east in Asia it transcends all cultures why\nBecause it's so beautiful love story about a princess and a prince charming\nAnd it's about human love\nAnd human warmth the prince show love Snow White even after she's been poisoned by the evil which he hasn't forgotten about her and so he goes back to kiss or to bring her back to life\nBut\nYou see they want to destroy all human warmth they want to destroy all human love between men and women\n\nAnd somehow find something as innocent and beautiful is that as something somehow nefarious and sexist and massaging mistake and perverted and dangerous\nAnd what they're doing is they're it's this is very dangerous if this does not pass modern political correctness\nIf this does not pass the ideological litmus test that we envy elites impose well then we're just not going to watch it and we're not going to read it\nThat's not art as propaganda that's literally\nThe definition of propaganda but everything must serve a higher ideological cause\n\nAnd if it doesn't serve the higher ideological

of what it is to be human\nI've given up a lot for my wife for grace or love dearly I'd give up a lot every day for my two children there you want to know the truth one of my greatest passions is to

ban and censor Snow White and Cinderella\nEnough is enough so let me ask you do you did\nYou watch Snow White did you watch Cinderella will you allow your children to continue to watch or read
