dollars of earnings\nIf you apply a thirty multiple that it gets you Fifteen hundred those are aggressive optimistic projections on a very large company to begin with\nSo now we realized gee you know

[noise]\n\nDown to ... news executive order could be signed by the president would stop birthright citizenship for babies born in the U.S the mothers who aren't citizens including illegal immigrants like ... the story\n... reports Trump made the comment during an interview last night according to actually use on HBO Trump said the U.S is the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen in the United states in an excerpt released today Trump said it's ridiculous and it has to end actually says it's bull interview with Trump will air Sunday and\nIs now putting the Democrats and the lives on the defensive one week before the midterm elections have them defend birthright citizenship have them defend anchor babies have them defend chain migration have them defend birth tourism\nIt's so lose lose lose issue because the overwhelming majority of the American people are with President Trump on this issue\nListen now to the president lay out his case he now wants to rescind effectively end birthright citizenship\nWith the stroke of a pen through an executive order\nRole caught one Brittany\nImmigration some legal scholars believe he can get rid of the practice and ship without tension between ... to ... ah have you thought about that is totally law it was always told me that you needed a constitutional him that by ... and\nYou don't need a number one number one you don't need that nobody can can you get into well you can definitely do with it an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order [noise]\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us as ridiculous and it has to end have you talked about that with counsel young I have to wear in the price that it's in the process it will happen [noise]\nWhat are the executive order that's what you're talking about it but I think that I didn't think anybody but knew that but me I thought I was really on China's a good guess\nSo basically you know the reporter I'd been working on this story for weeks apparently there were leaks coming out of from the president's legal team but the president was seriously thinking about it they had the interview in ... basically Trump said yeah you're right\nIt's in the pipeline I'm gonna pass and I'm going to sign an executive order and uh we're going to see what happens and I'm going to restrict if not the fact and birthright citizenship now\nWhat I think it's going to happen is this this is clearly going to be contested bitterly bitterly\nThe lips are going to oppose it with everything they have sorted dams so is the mainstream media and I'll tell you why because they want birthright citizenship they want anchor babies that's the big incentive for illegals to come into our country\nEverybody knows once you get into America doesn't matter if you come from Russia Eastern Europe Asia China Mexico Brazil Guatemala it really doesn't matter\nOnce you get in illegally\nAnd you have a baby on American soil you stay\nYour child is an automatically ... automatically conferred citizenship\nAll of their rights all of the privileges all of the benefits they get to go to school for free they get healthcare for free ah they're basically an American citizen my basically they are\nAnd they're not going to deport the parents and from that point on then you can bring in your whole family through chain migration\nSo the Democrats know that is the key to flooding this country with illegal immigration keep anchor babies and birthright citizenship in place cheap chain migration in place\nI get on illegal immigration I get on your just on a work visa I get your on a travel visa I get your just you know traveling for a vacation or whatever to the United states but what is say you're a green card holder you're a legal resident of the United states a permanent resident\nShould you have to be a citizen\nIn order for your child to have a baby in America for your child to be an American now my honest answer is yes I don't think I don't even think of green card holders should be given automatic citizenship if they have a baby in this country until you become an American your child should not\nBe granted automatic US citizenship\nSecond question [noise]\nWe used to rail against Obama all these sorts of executive orders [noise]\nIs this I agree with the mission I agree with the

denounced the practice\nWas the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits

wing agenda is now driving this caravan financing this caravan\nAnd so what Trump is now saying and he's right is they're not getting into the United states and I've just got to see this very quickly before I get into Trump I have never seen anything like this in my life I never have\nWhere you've got these so called refugees who by the way have been offered refugee status in Mexico Mexico's offered them asylum has offered every single one of them jobs free health care\nEven free housing and their answer we want America\n... we don't care you know we don't want a job we don't want your health care we don't want your housing we don't want your asylum we want the U.S of a baby nothing but the best for us\nAnd they're waving hunter and flags they're waving Guatemalan flags they're singing the Honduran in Guatemala national\nAnthems and they're demanding that Trump and America has to let them in\nOne of them in fact they were painted a swastika on the American flag so you're standing on this country before you even got here\nAnd I I'm Sorry but when you look at them they I've\nSeen a morning titled group in my life even the way they're walking there walking with their you know it was closed fist center\nYou know with their arms jutting out there like dealing with you know it's sort of like you know you always to us we're entitled to come to America worm migrants we have a right to go anywhere we want says school\nYou've got no travel documents no passports no visas\nAnd on top of that if you're throwing yourself at the mercy of the United states you think you would be humble you think you would be grateful how you think you would be thankful instead they're literally acting like we owe them\nNow there's another lie there are so many lives peddling from the mainstream media but let me tell you one of the biggest they're not walking yes they walk in periods certain times they do walk for the for the photographer for the camera man for the media but in reality now they're being bussed\nAnd they're being bussed on very comfortable air conditioned buses obviously paid for by Soros case financing the whole thing and one of the reasons why they're busing I'm up north Elmore date\nAs they're rejecting asylum and jobs in work and and uh and health care in Mexico is because if they keep just walking they're not going to make it here in time for next Tuesday's midterm elections so the left is saying\nCome on come on get 'em up there quicker to get\nThose buses going let's go let's go\nSo they want to provoke a crisis and the goal is obvious they want to inflame the Latino or Hispanic community because Filipino Spanish community all polls now show they're not going to come out for the Democrats they may not come out for Republicans\nBut they're not going to come out for Democrats because frankly the Latino community has never done better than under Trump\nSo that's why they need the caravan and I got to get up there as soon as possible so they're not really tracking up north they're being bussed up north on very comfortable air conditioned greyhound bus okay well believe me there are being taken up here in style now\nPresident Trump in a wide ranging interview with Laura Ingraham\nTold her point blank they are not going to get in\nAnd in particular he now told Laura Ingraham that he's going to be sending at least five thousand more U.S troops to the border\nShe said you mean the national guard has been mobilized he said no I'm not talking the national guard I'm Talking US troops five thousand are going to be sent to the border we're gonna militarized border\nThen lower angry made the obvious point\nWell how are you going to prevent them from coming into the country are law say all you have to do\nIs say you want asylum you claim asylum you desire asylum and by our own laws you have to give them a hearing which means you have to hold them feed him clothe them and wait until at least they see a judge most of them are just caught and released and you never see them again\nListen now to what Trump says he's going to do rural cut to Britain\nApplying for asylum isn't the law because Congress is a salad and we're going to hold them until such time as trial where we have the facilities are going to put up we're going to build ten cities with adequate tense up all over the place we're not going to build structures and said all of this you know hundreds of millions of dollars\nWe're going to have pets they're going to be very nice and they got away and if they don't get asylum they get out and very few people they don't actually if you want to wait they don't usually get asylum you know that ... percent prior has\nReleased them and and then they have the trial three years later and nobody shows up but we're gonna unlike Obama and unlike others\nWe are going to take the people were going to put 'em in and they're going to wait\nAnd you know what to things happen when they find out that that happens that far fewer people come up [noise]\nAnd also President Obama separated children from parents nobody talks about the only ice and on and said can never have separated now President Obama separate out in the beginning okay just so we all under said\nOh by the way Trump is completely right Obama did separate children from their parents he did or the media never complained they didn't care there were just using this to try to be Trump with a hammer or with a club now there is another ... in fact there's a third caravan\nSo as this one is making its way north there is another one now coming from Honduras and then another one coming from El Salvador so it's obvious what's going on here it's going to be one\nAnd then another and then another and then another\nAnd it's not going to end until all of Central America has been depopulated\nSo what Trump is now saying is I'm putting troops on the border\nSo no one's coming any legally they're not going to sneak through the border we're going to round them all up when they come and we're going to stick 'em in ten cities and I love his idea we're not going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars with brand new facilities now it's going to be nice it's going to be humane but it's going to be a tent city\nAnd nobody gets released the kids will stay with the parents no problem there is going to be no separation but they're going to stay in that tent city it's no longer catch and release now it's just going to be catching hold\nAnd your expedite him through the court system\nAnd almost all of them are going to be rejected because of the ... refugees there are just migrants frankly ... trying to get a better life for themselves and their family they been offered a grand deal is sweet deal in Mexico that's not enough for them\nSo they're going to be kicked out and they're going to be deported\nIn other words the zero tolerance send the military to the border militarized border built ten cities detain them hold them and then eventually deport him\nAnd he's right if the word gets so that that dumb gringo borders are no longer wide open that being needle signed a welcome sign has been taken down they're going to stop comic\nSo my question to you is this do you support the president sending five thousand troops to the border and most importantly do you support him constructing ten cities and ending catch and release six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight\nYour calls next the twenty Eighteen W arcangel being the\nRadio's on his friday November ninth presented polo

politics are able to go just good afternoon I have a comment on the border and then I have a question for you please let me get to both of keep a concise yeah a quick sidebar yes people on TV you nailed it they're they're fake they're awful that pretentious reminds me of a song by Don Henley called dirty laundry\nI won't get a job that's yes oh about it the bubble bleach blond comes on at night so that but a plane crash where the gleaming her I it's interesting what people died\nI don't get me going OK I'm Jeff not only as Trump right Camilla tries to border it's his duty as she was elected in sworn in\nTo do if he didn't protect outdoor I'd be the first one as a staunch Trump supporter I'd be the first one to be saying impeach him if he didn't support if he didn't seal the border okay he's not doing special she's doing what he said he would do under oath in front of the Supreme Court justice sorted out variation day [noise]\nJeff I'm a constitutional us that art um we may disagree here on the west coast\nI'm across the traditionalist [noise] if you are born on us soil you are\nA United States citizen okay that's not my opinion that's a constitutional fact now if you want to get into what do you do it the mom she crossed over just to give birth you know I call it ... it's the reverse anchor baby right it's reversed anchor baby what do you do this may sound rough\nBut I'm going to give it to how I see it\nThe baby is a U.S citizen so facto immediately should be taken into adoption or held or put in a a nice home the mother or should be deported and she should go home and get our papers lined up so she can read it with her baby\nThe baby stays it's a ... she he or she is a citizen the mother go home and get your ducks lined up and come back All right sorry that's tough but it's tough love okay she should have thought of that before she across the border pregnant it legally\nNow here's my question for you when this caravan crosses the border if I I think it's going to dissipate by then people can do what you walk to the store just to feel as though it was closed up\nExactly what whatever number it's going to be when they get to the border again here's a question for you please educate me how does it work if they come in illegally how do they get a vote do they get to illegal can vote how do they have to get a\nPlease tell me they have to get at least an ID I mean it's disgusting on its face but how do hypothetically five thousand illegals come across with the caravan how can they vote which is what the Democrats\nWant here's Scott thank you for that call I appreciate it I'm here's how it works this is how the scam works\nYou come in legally let's say you're from Guatemala can you come any legally what you do is you claim asylum you say you're a refugee\nSo now by our immigration laws the dumb Ringo suddenly now you have to be given a court date you can't just be deported that's all they're all told us just claim your refugee the moment you're caught so your refugee\nSo usually it takes many months if not years to get a court date\nSo they don't hold you 'cause it's too expensive to hold you they release you catch and release\nNinety nine percent never come back for that immigration didn't so now they're into the ... during the country they're walking around the streets illegally but they are now in\nWhat you do is you buy your driver's license you can get them anywhere you can buy a fake Social Security number you can get them anywhere and now you're in the system\nNow you're in the system\nSo you got Social Security card you've got a driver's license you bought a Social Security number you can start collecting welfare it's illegal but nobody checks nobody corrects down\nSo you get your welfare you get your food stamps you get your ... you get your mass health you get your section eight and then if you want because you have an id you have a driver's license you have a Social Security number you go and register to vote\n\nNo one has to present and I ... in Massachusetts I complain about this all the time I go for it I go to vote I'm going to vote on Tuesday that they don't even want to look\nLike presenting a crucifix door vampire they don't no no no I don't want to see your driver's license no problem and that's how I vote\nAnd that's how the illegals scam the system and then after a while they're just here so long that basically they say well look I mean we're working under the table were collecting welfare many of us are even voting so what are you gonna do deport us\nAnd that's why the left says given manifesting that's the scam in a nutshell now we're one of the very few countries in the world that allows this now\nI disagree with you it is not in the constitution that you just have a baby on American soil and that automatically makes you a citizenship that's the way the fourteenth amendment has been interpreted\nThat wasn't the intent of the fourteenth amendment I Know I taught history it had only to do with slaves ex slaves or\nThe slave trade slaves brought in from other countries [noise]\nThere was never intended for immigration that's why I Believe if this goes to the Supreme Court with a five for conservative majority Trump may actually win on his executive order okay coming up next\nPamela Geller you don't want to miss it don't touch that dial but first Whitey Bolger he's dead after being found unresponsive in a prison in West Virginia ... has that story taken away Evan\nIs that this is a man who harbors deep anti Semitic feelings and impulses and that what ... the fact that he's very pro Israel I mean I just saw a guest on Fox News yesterday or a liberal\nSaying well the fact that he is good for Israel that may be good for the Jews over there but that's not the Jewish American experience here the Jewish American experience here according to what the left are saying is it Charlottesville it's white nationalism it's Steve Bannon so what do you say to that argument time\nThat that is a a a complete lie and it's a complete it completely absurd\nLet's take it one at a time the first thing you said that he is associated with white nationalism where who I I I'm associated with him and knock on Yahoo is associated with him where is this white nationalism you cite the New York times and viciously anti Israel\nA propaganda organ CNN I let let's talk about CNN and who they are they're they're they're newscasters and never I hate to say newscasts because they don't they they don't catch the news anymore they just they just they just kept their opinions\nAre probably hand didn't wait wait\nStatements viciously anti Semitic\nConsistently at the summit equipped it never in the past ten years when anti Jewish crime has spiked\nOkay has never reported on it and when we're putting on Israel is always always subjective and anti Israel President Trump has eight not just the Jewish daughter\nNot just the but the ducks Jewish daughter who was converted at by rabbi looks peanut reminds\nA where I Am affiliated and I can tell you\nIt's it's ... it's a very ah the religiosity is what ... not like these were formed what you almost feel as if\nWell there's no Judaism in reform Judaism just because people say it\nDoesn't make it so I don't know where we lost this connection to evidence\nI don't know where we as an American society decided that what we want\nTo be is what is\nYou cannot I mean I was startled let's go back to the great philosophers Aristotle said a as a and this is just completely disconnected from reality I wrote for Steve Bannon for years\nAt Breitbart he was the ... he would ask me all the time for pieces on Israel for peace on the Jewish perspective I don't know where\nYou are referring to wear Nazis collaborated with Jews the only Nazis icy collapsing collaborating with Jews is back with the cop shows and the Jude and rot\nAnd today the left and these and these these these left wing Jews that are advancing these anti Semitic tropes\nI disgusting and I call upon you and people just like yourself to before you advance these lies and that ... that they should be they should they should be some evidence not because quote unquote the New York times set it on CNN even worse\nThe left is I mean look at the people they're running look at this army of anti Israel anti Semitic Lewis ferret can I ... the ... that evidence\nThen that standing up with Louis our can't is evidence Lewis ... who is it the most disgusting anti Semitic anti Jewish ... as early as late as ... as early as last week that it's not the end it to semi termites I mean according to juice to to to insects and what have you\nAnd he loves Hitler he's on the stage with Bill Clinton\nAnd and you know is embracing him into the women's march I think the leftist movement is embracing him I Want facts\nI'll give you facts about President Trump's pro Jewish pro Israel and the ... his heart his daughter his grandchildren his love of the Jewish state I mean it's just there's just this disconnect\nFrom reality and I will tell you ... you could avoid reality but you can't avoid the consequences of avoiding reality\nA power I think you hit the nail right on that I really do a ... I Want to plant costs for you I Know we're going to a couple of minutes left but I Want to play a card for you and\nGet your reaction because it's gone everywhere now as you know CNN or basically it's a propaganda arm for the Democratic party they had on G cues Julie I all your ... whenever last name who among mispronouncing it\nShe was actually kicked off political she was fired in twenty sixteen for writing that Trump was having incest having sex with his daughter with the longer well she said were Jake Tapper rural cut three written\nI have to have to agree with some on here I think you know this president one of the things that he really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic rattle radicalization and this president has radicalized so many more people than I ever did\nSam radicalized more people than I\nWill again here again I mean why is this girl she's a moron she's an idiot again we talking about evidence and we talk about you know what we want to believe 'em and why is she on why she on CNN\nI I'm saying how did she get on how did she become a voice\nAt why she given that platform I mean she's an idiot and I'm not saying that pejorative Leah hyperbole ... will in the dictionary under idiot is the description\nThat fits this young woman is this the the sad young woman I'm particularly because she is Jewish so they love that that she has she has Jewish so she has if she has she's giving legitimacy when she has none of the the the the ... the book the understanding\nAnd the belief but that said I'm radicalized I mean what what is Trump do a ... some\nGave a voice to the voice all this hatred that you see this hatred that you see is not anti Trump they tend to you than the meets the people that said no you know ... you know they said no to the corruption they said no to the criminality they said no to Clinton they said no to the machine they said no\nThey said no and that's what this is this is a putting down I'm a freedom movement and in plain and simple and it is extraordinary when you have this huge machine or in media in academia and the movies and Hollywood and I mean the culture\nThat shy guy ... ... ... ...\nUnder this this boot of the left I mean completely and utterly capture you can't be cool if you're on the right you can't have a career in Hollywood okay you can't teach at colleges ... you you can't sneak I used to speak all the time never never\nI mean the last few times if you want to see the last time I spoke at Brooklyn College pandemonium it's insanity it literally Germany in the Nineteen thirties people say oh you can say that\nThey can call us not to use they can go the Jews Nazis you know they called me and not see I Am if the U.S proud you I'm not saying I mean this is the age that we're living in and this is America\nAnd so you know this is do you have this cultural ... iced of left ism autocratic left as him and yet and yet despite all that than twenty four seven cycle\nOf propaganda NBC ABC CBS a New York times the LA Times Boston Globe blah blah blah blah blah blah and movies and movies and movies is that one decent Republican in the movie or TV show\nEver and so you and the\nTrump won and still you'll have a red wave a week from today so can you imagine can you imagine if for one moment there was some light some light in the culture some light in the universities\nSomewhat if there was some I mean this is literally an underground intellectual movement\nThat's what they say is is an underground hey look at history of taught us anything it's that great it intellectual movement was started by a ...\nA small group that is what you're witnessing here you're witnessing something really great and of course the naysayers look they they won control they love control that you didn't you know a hundred years ago the left was silent ism control\nA lemon ism communism and of course not see is um is it a national socialist Workers Party remind times

start banning things he speech to labeling them a speech and then to ban these words words like globalism words like nationalism a many conservatives they want to see band off of social media\nDo you think in the wake of this meeting\nWell not to use them and white supremacy they hate that we're seeing on some of these social media outlets\nThat there needs to be some kind of hate speech code enforced or do you think that let freedom of ideas rain and the way to combat extremism is not with censorship but with free speech\nMe now Trump was asked specifically about this line of attack here
