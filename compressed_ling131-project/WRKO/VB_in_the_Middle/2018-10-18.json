Netflix shares even I mean they had a great quarter and they're down Seventeen dollars Tesla shares rallied yesterday I guess Musk said what he was going to buy twenty million dollars for the sheriff's\nYes during the next uh open period for him to buy a stocky said that he would buy shares did rally yesterday going from a works like about two sixty four at the open up the two eighty two not back down to two sixty five so you know giving back a decent chunk of that over the course of the day\nWhy would he announced that before he bought and not after\nJust to get the message out there you know you know hey I'm buying you know you know ... so to try to create enthusiasm toys so focused on that stock price right now 'cause she's got all this debt that wrote that he's got to roll over if he doesn't get it close to three sixty and the next few months\nAlcoa seems to be doing pretty well view for those old timers you remember when al ... used to be the first company that would report earnings recording every quarter\nYeah they used to be the ones that are kicked everything off a as a as the earnings quarters would start up\nAnd so al ... stock up about seven and a half percent they one of the stocks that is actually up today and largely a ... is on the back of them raising their profit outlook\nNow as a terrorist as have lifted aluminum prices and a lot of cases and so they report a fourteen percent increase in third quarter revenue largely due to those higher prices um and so\nYou know that's really what you're seeing driving them at this point and so\nAgain those costs are being born eventually by consumers who have to end up paying higher prices for you know whether it's\nA you know renting a building that used aluminum whether our cars that use aluminum ... hands you know you you name it car stocks have been getting crushed\nThey have new General Motors flow sales don't look good\nIn a cottage sales numbers who don't go through it is but\nI I just think that you have a case with auto sales it it's the the two groups that you need to match up it's the people who have money to buy a car and the people who actually have a demand for a car right now\nAnd if you were previously one of the things that kept us a full back in twenty Seventeen was actually the hurricanes ... people it created a lot of short term demand\nThe hurricanes this year ... haven't done that and you're just you're not seeing auto demand the way it had been previously\nBut the darn cars you want to go buy a car it's thirty six thousand forty thousand dollars you not getting any special\nAnd that's the thing is I think where the demand is it's on the lower end and people just you just don't have enough cars in those price range that people want to buy you can't go get a new car for Fifteen Grand Canyon can okay it just like ... and again I'm someone who says what don't spend too much money on a car but for whatever reason Americans aren't buying those jeep cars\nJet Blue has a little bit of a gimmick going on they're giving away free flight\nIt sounds enticing I saw this yesterday actually and I cook dodged cars I was intrigued myself ah when when I took a look at it\nAnd what they're actually doing here\nUh this is part of a promotion called Jet Blue for good month [laughter] uh and so it's going to be a trip that takes place from November twenty seven to the thirties so not giving away just any free flight after Thanksgiving what is going to be as you have to go and sign up for this promotion here\nAnd pretty much it's going to be a largely community service oriented trip for four days the Jet Blue is going to cover all your costs on\nAnd you are going to go with pretty much a hundred people a fifty passengers as well as a guest or their choice and you're going to go somewhere the location being completely unknown to you you have to get to New York\n[noise] yup and they are going to fly you to go do community service for\nThree or four days it's it's kind of a cool little promotion that they do or just to you know raised visibility for the airline it's it's good that they're doing some good as well but it doesn't cost much and they sure got a lot of publicity out of it that they get a ton out of it so it's a it's overall you know I wouldn't be surprised if you start seeing more of these types of promotions these the kinds of things\nOr to build a lot of goodwill for companies in the day when companies need good Wilson ... you know we're seeing obviously just about every day a guilt companies doing whole bunch of things wrong but this year pretty good promotion I think\nThe run and I was surprised to see that thirty one percent of baby boomers are not saving for their retirement of if you're a baby boomer I mean you're getting pretty close to retirement and they're not saving for retirement because they're still paying student loan where did you have to be for their kids when\nI I Would imagine a big chunk of it is probably for the kids you their parent plus loans and things along those lines and I know you've been kind of on the uh the edge of that battle saying look stay away from these parents plus loans\nAnd don't yield sign for your kids I mean either have the money or you don't and you know if they want to go to college and the only that's fine they can also join the military and get money that way\nWhen the other big thing is look if it's all well and good to want to support your kids get I don't have any so I don't understand\nIt but here you always want the best but here's what I always point out if you run out of money in retirement right eventually you're going to boomerang back with your kids and that's what I've worn my children about and I can guarantee you that is not

he said the Democratic party is leading an assault in the country with their support of open borders and weak laws he spoke about the thousands of migrants attempting to enter the country\nAs a caravan from Central America and he said many of them are criminals and their leaders are doing nothing to stop them president asking Mexico to prevent the migrants from entering the U.S\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo says Saudi Arabian leaders are clear the U.S takes the disappearance of Washington Post columnist you're Monica ... very seriously\nThey do understand the serious nature of the disappearance of Mr joking but they also assured me that they will conduct a complete thorough [noise] best occasion\nThat top diplomat brief the president this morning after his trip to Saudi Arabia won't pay a set of Saudi investigation will hopefully reveal the truth very soon the Saudis have denied any involvement in the ... disappearance former HUD secretary in San Antonio mayor Julian Castro still won't say whether he's planning to run for president\nPullout all\nEconomic foreign aid and all economic assistance\nBy the way since two thousand and Fifteen we have given the governments of Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador two point six billion dollars taxpayer dollars we ... beach\nWhere did that money go\nCome nobody ever asks the obvious question\nWe're paying you to point six billion dollars this is supposed to go for I don't know a basic health care or economic development\nAll kinds of projects to help raise the standard of living in those countries I'll tell you where it went right into the pockets in the coffers of government officials the corrupt officials that run those countries that's where the money went\nIt was stolen and siphoned off Trump however went even further quote\nHe now says that according to him he is now going to put the military to close our southern border\nI Am watching is we tweeted out this morning I Am watching the Democrat Party led because they want open borders and existing week laws assault on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador whose leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people\nIncluding in caps many criminals from entering Mexico to the United states\nIn addition to stopping all payments to these countries which seem to have almost no control over their population I must in the strongest of terms ask Mexico to stop this onslaught and if I'm able\nTo do so I Will call up the U.S military and close in caps our southern border\nSo basically what Trump is now saying he's threatening he's threatening Central America is threatening Mexico if you're not going to stop this invasion if you're just going to allow these people by the way no passports ... says no travel documents they don't even have a right to enter these countries\nYou allow them to go through knowing they're going to come to our border to cross into our country illegally than I Am going to load up that southern border with the military I'm going to seal it shot and I'm going to put the U.S military right along the southern border\n\n\nA couple of points and then I Want to throw it open to you six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight is the number\nWhat is remarkable what is remarkable\nAnd I don't want to keep just throwing out statistics but you really need to listen to this statistic\nDo you remember in June when we had that those caravans were coming in wave after wave and the media when they just melted down they went ballistic of the alleged separation of children from their families so if you remember Trump ended his zero tolerance policy\nAnd now you calm the children are kept with their parents right and many of them are it's catch and release\nSince he ended his catch sorry his zero tolerance policy\nThere is now a record number of illegal immigrant family members who have been caught illegally pouring into and crossing the border in September alone\nIn September alone\nSixteen thousand six hundred illegal alien family members were arrested crossing the southern border or trying to cross the southern border illegally\nThat is eight eighty percent increase since Trump indeed his zero tolerance policy in the summer\nThe word has gotten out on the street pose\nAs a family pretend to be a family pretend that you bring children with you claim these children to be these kids to be your children\nBring these young boys and girls pretend to be their father or their mother and the dumb gringo has no choice but to let you in\nAnd you can't be separated anymore at the border so they have to be kept together and then because of us the immigration laws children cannot be detained for more than twenty days so after twenty days what do you think happens they're released\nGiven a future court date to appear in immigration court in six months or a year and you never see them again it's catch and release\nAnd sold the word has gotten out\nForget trying to cross as an individual bring me yeah\nBring a family member or pretend to bring a family with you and pay these kids or give them cash they've been caught being giving him cash here you take that kid you take that kid here's the money for those kids pretend to be a family member say they're your kids or whatever go cross the border dumb gringo has no choice but to take you in\n\nIt is getting so bad listen to this even though Washington Post sent a reporter down to the southern border and said there are so many illegal immigrant family members who are now pouring in and being arrested record numbers record\nThat the border patrol are now in open revolt saying we are being overwhelmed\nQuote\nThis is why they border patrol agent in South Texas told the Washington Post quote we're getting hammered daily\nAnother border patrol agent tells the Washington Post we are getting crushed down here the numbers are sheer Lee are sheer overwhelming\nSo let me tell you who I ultimately blame I'll be very honest with you\nPeople are saying Chaffetz the Mexican government Chaffetz the Central American government snow I blame Congress\nI blame us\nDon't ask other countries with all due respect you know you have a house I have a house who's responsible for protecting your home your\nWho's responsible for protecting the property line your front door to make sure squatters or a a vagabond are criminals or drug\nDealers or whatever strangers don't just come into your house and squat you are don't ask your neighbor to protect your own property and your own home you need to protect your own property and your own home\nCongress has done nothing where's Paul Ryan Orion\nShe's still technically the house speaker were less than three weeks away from my mid term election have you seen Ryan's campaigning for any Republican where Izzie\nThe biggest mistake of President Trump's presidency\nWas his decision to listen to rhino Ryan when he said we need to do health care first\nThen the tax cuts vendor deregulation and then we'll get to the border wall funding down the road what Trump should've done immediately was tell rhino Ryan forget health care forget tax cuts forget everything\nI Want my wall and I wanted now and nothing is going to move until I get my wall now there's no wall\nZero tolerance is over\nAnd now you got the families coming in because you can't separate them and now we've got a major border crisis and in historic invasion from the south my friend's immigration is a winning issue for the president and for the Republicans\nThe country wants the borders secured the country wants this invasion to end\nMr President declare a state of emergency send in the U.S military seal the border\nAnd when you declare the state of emergency say I'm taking the money forget Congress blank you I'm gonna take it from the military budget the Pentagon\nTwenty five billion dollars and the military is going to build the wall you want to stop the invasion that's how you do with Mr President\nTime Jeff ... she's going to try to do what she can be negative in this debate I'm sure I'll listen to the ... that's not a gallery\nLeadership debate and you can talk about it with Boston bulldozer Jeff cleaner tomorrow night from nine to ten\nIt's I think they spend on the country they came from\nYeah they're they're they're traumatized by all the stuff that they've gone through then not super proud of that of of that flag\nCatherine we came from what used to be Yugoslavia in the ... with us today Croatia right but it was in former Yugoslavia and so the there was a flag it was blue white and red and in the middle was the big communist Red Star you know my grandfather and father would always tell me\nA dinner table the only good communist is a dead communist ... that that's how much they thought of the country they fled from they wouldn't be waving that flag death\nSo now there was only let me ask you this what do you think is going on here do you think they're being paid I knew George Soros is involved he's paying a lot of them do you think that they're um they're just activists posing as refugees or do you think many of them are legitimate you know poor people who just want a better life\nI think that's absolutely a big part of it the legitimately poor people who want a better life they want to live in a land where you know they can get an immunization hey speaking of that why isn't the the fund that we send them being used for immunization\nIs that you know ideally what it should be used for to help those people if they're suffering where they are [noise] you know there are a lot of problems at all it is also Mexico is a country with Spanish spoken everywhere wouldn't they be more comfortable in Mexico why don't they stay in Mexico I think this is a good question I asked the Mexican government\nDon't they stayed\nGray call Greg call well I'll tell you why I'll tell you why\nBecause in Mexico they don't have a welfare state as generous as ours [noise]\nThey don't give out that government goodies in Mexico the way we given out here with a ...\nTelling you that's what it is [noise]\nOkay my friends a lot more to talk

[noise] um there is a\nBrilliant piece in conservative review dot com it's one of its becoming one of my favorite go to places phenomenal are just some phenomenal analysis I Know mark Levin is a big fan of conservative review and I can see why\nUh and there was a really good piece by Daniel Horwitz and I just want you to listen to this a little bit\nBecause I think you hit the nail right on the head the title of the peace almost says it'll President Trump has full constitutional power to stop the border invasion even without Congress now I don't want to get into the entire\nPeace but I just want to read just a couple of excerpts because I think they really Horowitz hits the nail on the head\nQuote I Love his lead just as President Reagan is remembered for ending the Cold War President Trump can be remembered as the one who ended the war on our sovereignty will he rise to the occasion\nHere's the stone cold truth about our border we could construct a border wall as high as the stratosphere\nAnd it won't help much if we continue our self destructing policies of allowing bogus society leads to come through our front door and legitimizing the opinions of sanctuary judges who make Dennis ... of aliens\nQuote unquote and so he's completely right\nWe don't say enough is enough and start enforcing our immigration laws then a wall is essentially meaningless but if you start enforcing our immigration laws and you combine it with\nWith a wall if game set match and so as he points out look this is nothing short of an invasion Daniel Horwitz goals and um\nHe goes into all the numbers I don't want to get into all the numbers but basically ever since we've been to zero tolerance there's been a massive surge at the border\nAnd he says essentially um egos look Trump is right Congress should step in but Congress if they will not act the president has the right and the ability to act\nAnd this is an invasion at the border and if it's an invasion at the border then he has the inherent the executive powers from article too as well as delegated authority from Congress under existing\nLaw just say enough is enough\nI'm declaring a state of emergency we're being invaded I'm going to send the military down\nAnd to finally secure this border I'm going to go into the military budget and whatever I think it's twenty three point four billion to be specific I'm going to take twenty three point four billion dollars and there's your wall\nAdios ender story issue over\nAnd so and he's ... and Daniel Horwitz is completely right so if Trump wants to do it\nHe can do it\nAnd just like the smear coordinated smear campaign against Kavanaugh blew up in the left space this is a political coordinated campaign by Soros by the Democrats by the left to try to use these migrants\nTo create another border crisis do they believe is going to lead to a PR disaster for the Republicans just before the November midterm elections\nAnd just like that first Kevin are planned blew up backfired\nCall their bluff\nThe American people to search to Seventy percent will say amen stop the war on our borders stop the war on our sovereignty stop the war on America\nHe wins games set match six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight\nI Know President Trump's people listen to the show so I'm going to say very loud so everybody can hear in the Trump Administration Mr President the left is now giving you a gift on a silver platter this is an historic opportunity\nSees it rise to the occasion\nYou can break 'em right here right now Ross in Everett Europe next go ahead Ross\nI I\nI Would agree with you but I Do a little bit further because I think if you declare martial law all the way from California the checks as you can do more\nBy making sure that the press and the media and all that are kicked out of there this is an invasion everything you say is correct\nBut you got to declare martial law nothing else will work and if you do that then you have a chance of kicking these people back into the country is the second point I Would like to make\nIs that the president ought to convene a meeting of all the Central American countries with Mexico\nAnd get to the bottom of why these countries why these leaders cannot handle their populations and why a I D which is a scandal in itself is not financing to write things down there and it's a something that I have a\nCome close to it one time with the id\nThey're full of both will leave it that way when you get into these countries\nAre Ross thank you very much for that call look U.S foreign aid is a scam\nIt's or it's international socialism it's a complete waste of our money uh ... most of it over Ninety percent stolen or used by corrupt leaders for their own personal gain a it's a complete rip off in a scam\nNo I honestly I don't I this is look I Know the president has to do certain things he's president okay\nSo Mike Pompeo is going to be going I Believe to Guatemala he's later this week you can also be flying to Mexico in Mexico city you got to be diplomatic I I understand that okay I Do really I Do\nBut let's be honest we ... we don't need to meet with them\nThey're outsourcing their poor Honduras is a failed state\nPick 'em up let the let the Tom Green go take care of all these people we can't take care of them\nThat's what El Salvador does look I I Know I keep throwing out numbers listen to this one third of all El Salvador Reince now leave in the United states most of them you legally but let that go\nWasn't jobs wasn't healthcare wasn't taxes wasn't law and order amnesty for the dreamers\nTheir goal she says is to protect illegal immigrants in America and to make sure that they rammed through amnesty for the dreamers at least two million will get amnesty under a Democratic Congress\nAt a minimum and by the way not a penny for the wall no deal so they see a party that wants to give amnesty to illegals\nThat wants to literally destroy our borders remove our borders completely\nAnd stand on the side of MS Thirteen against law enforcement and against ice now\nYou don't get more radical you don't get more crazy you don't get frankly more dangerous or anti American\nThan that they're going down\nIf the Republicans can just get their message out if if the Republicans can choose to have the courage of their convictions and go after the Democrats on these issues\nIt's over check mate\nModerate Democrats you know the the walk away movement that's good that's gaining like wildfire moderate Democrats will defect independence will defect\nAnybody with half a brain will defect never mind you're going to pick up all the Republican votes all the conservative votes all the populist votes that are out there so this could turn into a potential huge red wave in November and I hope a real repudiation of the radical left wing of the Democratic party\nNow this leads me to tomorrow's debate\nThat's why I'm urging all of you I Know the Sox are doing well OK last night was apparently an incredible game\nThere on the verge of making it to the world series I get it there's baseball fever but look I Love the Sox I Hope they win my Ashton by the way loves baseball were actually watching baseball together it's a great father son experience but\nThat's going to pass\nThe results of the mid term elections are going to be with us for many years to come\nFriday night's debate between Jeff deal and Elizabeth Warren is going to be on from eight to nine on WB Z Channel thirty eight I'm going to have a special corner report starting at nine o'clock\nShe is the poster child of the radical left wing of the Democratic party if deal can hit her not just on the phony Indian issue but especially on Kavanaugh and the caravan\nOn open borders on amnesty\nOn siding with MS Thirteen on abolishing ice on destroying the presumption of innocence on insisting on a society that you're guilty until proven innocent if she can if he sorry can go after her on these two big issues\nShe's going to be exposed as somebody who is so far to the left that even Massachusetts will have to ask themselves why she our senator\nThat debate tomorrow could be one of the most important historic debates over a lifetime six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight is the number William in fair haven you're up\nNext to go ahead William\nHow you doing Jeff Jeff this was a lot more serious than we think it is purely look at it they got an um the inside America already possibly twenty million working am asset Thirteen holes to tell that they ain't got um stores all over the place\nNow for the last year the rope and our border not meaning getting on their bellies like a sample we do it for all the border there actually probing the border to see what will happen if they can get Jake masses of human beings and try to push 'em into the country and if the Democrats\nAre behind this in supporting it if Trump will get a hold of these people are handling these people are in a jail were big trouble [noise] matter of fact I think we're in deep trouble than you think we're in right now I think there's a lot more going on\n... the ... behind the scenes in the eye can see George Soros I Know you're saying he's probably involved that yeah it probably is but I think these is South American government's they've been getting money from has for decades now and they want more it it it chaos\nBut if Trump doesn't it was something about this right away he's gonna look really really bad because guys like me to go look and say you can do nothing to stop at the thought to stop that she has to stop it now Jeff ...\nOh William I couldn't agree with you more and William ... hey ask you this because you're really onto something this is very dangerous look I Want every dangerous William let me ask you this okay and I want to ask all of you this if we allow four thousand that's why I think it's going to be Kavanaugh\nCaravan the caravan\nIf we allow it's at least four thousand it could be even five thousand by the time they hit the border if we allow for five thousand illegals\nTo blatantly openly cross our border with impunity\nThen there's gonna be another cameraman and it'll be more and then another caravan and there'll be more than ... ... what what we're that's my question if we allow one to keep coming in is it not logical and inevitable will have a second and third and fourth and fifth\nAnd then William before you know it for overrun\nWe're overall already overrun there in every dish great musicians entering the country they getting CDL licenses they getting voices licenses here in Massachusetts they want us all\nRight without even give it a civil service number but we like you have to leave your Eighteen years old they're actually in student loan that's why I said you people buying is the chamber of commerce job placement agencies for sure all of this country had to have a good look taken at\nAnd South America is the government cites Mexico we have to say Mexico a message saying you want to say you want to invade a country we can take your country from you make it is eight and those people they are down you'll probably be on our front right\nWilliam very good call thank you for that call ... others images now coming you guys I mean it's an army I'm In Britain you're seeing the pictures up it's an army\nI mean is just line after in line after in line and so now Trump is actually saying or not only does he want to send the military he just wants to close down the border with Mexico\n\nHe's actually got apparently now the latest of timing is developing almost by the hour he's now come out and said look forget forgetting militarized the border\nI'm going to shut down\nWhich by the way it would completely up and you know the new trade deal the what is it the uh am what is it what is it ah the America M. C. A. however you pronounce it a master two point oh okay the latest trade deal\nHe's sending all these ... that like look either you're going to help secure our borders or you're not and if he shuts down but border completely Mexico is forgive me blinked Mexico is screwed\nThey rely on trade with the United states they rely on American investment they rely upon that trade deal with if we cut off our border to Mexico Mexico collapses overnight\nSo Trump is now basically upping the ante and saying look you keep them coming in um just shutting down the border I'm just going to close it we're just closing the border nothing or nobody moves in from the from the Mexican side of the border\nSix one seven and you know what Trump would be right and I would support him Anthony in New Hampshire Europe next go ahead Anthony\nOne hundred percent Jeff and to quote or rock Obama elections have consequences and we now have a five four majority on the court so I think Donald Trump its its people they'll listen should take this all the way that the Supreme Court and do what he has to do\nTo stop this because that's what we put on that for a job to do stuff like that and he's doing so doing\nAnthony I agree with you on the Supreme Court don't get me wrong\nBut if you're advising the president you're sitting right across the table from him he would say look Anthony Supreme Court that takes months that takes years what would you advise him to do now because that's terrifying that invading army their market share your dogs\nDeclare emergency and shut down the border do it that's what I'm telling you ... if they won't give him a wall you put up a virtual Raul it gets it ... into into you give me my walk but ritual off base up at the ... the U.S military so be it\nWe have to stop this invasion in print out the constitutional right to stop it and watch the ... the court and let them and he doesn't have to start a less Supreme Court right away because it made you change it to our country so the Supreme Court or ... or\nTake it up and guess what we have control of the Supreme Court ... rip well\nAnthony don't get me wrong [laughter] I only have ice for my wife [laughter] but I\nLove you [laughter] and I'm not sure\nWhen [laughter] when when I'm a liberal [laughter] [laughter]\nSix one seven six six sixty eight sixty eight Trump is now threatening to literally shut down the border with Mexico send in the military should the president do it agree disagree more with your calls next\nEvan hiding rich has the latest developments take in a way of\nThinking has the White House's naming a new legal counsel at least on a temporary basis after White House counsel Don McGahn to part of the role this week the White House now says Emmett flood will feel the role until D.C attorney patch civil loan towns aboard\nNo time table for the transition has been announced in flood has been working as a special counsel to the president and the Russia investigation\nMeans I'm secretary of state Mike Pompeo says Saudi leaders are sure him\nCommitted to conducting a complete thorough investigation into the disappearance of Washington Post columnist ... outside the White House today the secretary of state said you'd vice president Trump to give the Saudis more time to conclude the investigation bomb pale brief the president this morning\nAfter he went to Saudi Arabia earlier this week you get a check traffic now with Dave garden\nStill slow on route one southbound on the earlier crash it Lynn street in revere still back and things up there stole drive east bound a left wing bloc that Charles circles so traffic gets back to ... there is a work crew on the upper end of one twenty south bound so heavy delays for main street\nThrough that crew after north add in reading Ninety three north down slow at the merge with one twenty eight on free north than in Hanover\nThere is a work crew at fifty three there so I bet sluggish getting by the toll bridge okay through a left wing crew on the center spanning the inbound side I'm Dave Guard near and the W.

I'm just curious as somebody who works in a nursing [noise] why are these diseases coming back is it because not vaccinating is becoming inland how do we say in vogue\nSo I'm actually in time if the um ...

I just wish there was an example uh you know I pay taxes how come my child shouldn't be allowed to go to school what do you say to that argument\nBecause he needs to be vaccinated and I'm Sorry you know I'll go home\nOr in other words you can't pose a threat to other students\nOh yes you can you have to go home you cannot stay here if you're not ... that came from South America the Mid East\nAfrica I don't care where people are coming from they need to be vaccinated and we need we need to find out what illnesses what else health problems and all that sort of thing going on in these countries okay was stupid hey have a good day okay\nThank you thank you John [laughter] Ross in Boston and Europe next going ahead Russ\nYou know first of all just fifty years ago who got cheated allergies you know I think a lot of our problems is because a re engineered foods that of course all the you know multi billion dollar companies that produce ... and the food you know they they don't want to go down that that\nThat road and I think that's a big part of the problem\nAnd as far as kids being vaccinated a concern\nYou know especially things like polio and so forth things the way that radical that there's no question that ah it's more of a risk not so that the back of the kids vaccinated now I understand this some experts that feel that ah it causes autism and so forth and so on\nBut I have not read any ... anything concrete in reference to that what had evidence um\nSo again I think we should look much Audrey engineer so\nRuss I take it do you you're a supporter of vaccinations you think they work and they're good for for kids and for everybody\n[noise] first of all Jeff I was fascinated and the wife was vaccinated like kids were vaccinated and say but they don't have any of those problems\nThey man a man that that's how I feel Ross thank you for that call I mean really my parents were vaccinated I was vaccinated grace was vaccinated my passion and even were vaccinated and I'm banging on my desk right now but knock on wood they don't go to any of those diseases and I thank the lord for it can we squeeze one more in Brittany\nAlright\nAnd stowed them and so in Europe ... head at right now why you I'm good how are you at\nA Wal Mart vaccinated\nI'm fine [laughter]\nServer I I'm In I was in the pharmacy business there for a lot of years or a might call me or I saw on and I feel that the mercury as a preservative\n... nations like some people some of the time is why the autism is here with us\nOh I didn't know that so they went they the vaccination vaccines have we're Korean them\nThey do not take the mercury out\nOh I didn't know that and I'm going to look into that more because that's that's a very very serious issue\nOr I'd like honestly I'd like to talk more but I'm up against\nThe heartbreak okay my friends\nIs the real Elizabeth Warren [noise]\nFrom identifying or self identifying as a Native American\nThat they looked at the records they interviewed people at Harvard and everybody said she never got a leg up because of it what do you say to the Boston Globe's argument\nWell there's two responses to that the\nFirst one is we don't know what records they've looked at they did lists some of them but they didn't list all of them it does not appear\nFrom ah the article that they were given access to quote complete higher and file at Harvard law school and that's\nWhere there might be your reflection not that it helped her get the position itself and I've always said she's a very qualified look fetch or I mean she was qualified to be at Harvard law school there's not an issue about that the question is did she gained a leg up on others and you'd really need that complete Harvard law school hiring file\nIt's not enough to go to professors who sat in on the faculty meeting where they took a vote because that it may not have come up with that faculty meeting the question is\nWhy did people at Harvard reach out to her why did they recruit her why she brought into the system the faculty meeting at the end of it so what I Would say is the Boston Globe\nAnswer some questions but mostly relied on documents that Elizabeth Warren gave them spoon fed them and documents that some others gave them but there's no indication that they've ever seen her complete hiring filed the more\nImportant point is let's say she did not actually get a benefit let's say the Boston Globe although it didn't have access\nAll the documents is correct doesn't really matter politically because the fact of the matter is she tried to benefit so she tried to claim an identity\nThat she was not entitled to claim that would have in the normal course of things in the late eighties and early nineties uh assisted are and given her a leg up so to me the fact that she tried it is the problem whether or not it benefited her\nPeople can speculate on until we get those files which we probably never will we can't say for sure and that to me is the real problem here is that it's the attempt it and the use of somebody else's identity a Native American identity that she had no right to claim\nA you know one example that or I'll give you and I and I'm you know I've written about this is you know uh my wife's family\nUh our family lore is\nThat they are descendants of the Jews who were\nExpelled from Spain during the Spanish Inquisition and we actually have some circumstantial support for that I mean her grandparents in her family history on her father's side is from an area of turkey where a lot of juice fled to her father grew up speaking to lead dino at home\nUh and uh so we have some supporting evidence but she would never think to check the box of Hispanic or Latino or which under EEOC guideline she would be entitled to do because she's the Spanish arguably of Spanish heritage and it's the same thing with Elizabeth Warren\nThat maybe they were this family lore\nMaybe it's something people spoke about what she had no evidence of it she had no reason she never lived as a Native American\nAnd that's really the thing she never self identified as Native American and except for career purposes later in life she didn't she wasn't raised as a Native American I Would completely excuse her if\nShe was brought up mistakenly thinking she's Native American she lived as a Native American she associated with Native Americans as a child she applied to colleges and Native American and then if decades\nLater somebody says you know what you're wrong I can I can excuse that but that's not her history she did not live as a Native American until the last year when she's setting up to run for president she'd never done anything for Native Americans\nAnd in fact you may recall an incident from two thousand twelve where a group of Cherokee genealogist flew to Boston because they wanted to show ... Warren that look we have traced\nYour lineage as far back as there are records to the early Eighteen hundreds to before\nThe trail of tears we have traced your family history there is nothing there to suggest any\nNative American much less Cherokee history please stop saying your charity she wouldn't even meet with them and she ... them and she accused them of being part of some right wing conspiracy et cetera et cetera so I think that's really the point she tried to do this\nAnd she never lived that way and she wasn't entitled\nTo claim it professor Jacob so I agree with you a thousand percent but let me just play devil's advocate for a second [noise]\nOkay so ... like in the end who cares but I'm just like what liberals will say in this state well look\nShe supports Medicare for all\nShe or he is for gun control she's pro choice she wants to open borders she believes in amnesty she wants to go after the one percent she wants to raise taxes on the wealthy I agree with her on all of these issues she's a liberal staunch liberal or progressive\nOkay so what she embellish that she was a Native American why does it matter in your view\nWell I I think it's ... I I expect that many of his supporters will take that pact\nAnd if they want to do it at least do it to me do it honestly acknowledge that she fabricated this identity\nAcknowledge she ripped off the identity of one of the most victimized peoples in recent history acknowledge\nAll these things and if you want to say that despite that I still want a supporter I understand that people do that all the time that's why some people a lot of people will say with Donald Trump or some other colleges you'll yes he does this he does that but\nI Am willing to look beyond those things and so people who were honest about it and are willing to say that I understand she committed this ethnic deception I understand she refuses to apologize about it\nI I understand all of those things but I'm going to vote for her anyway I I get that I and but just be honest with it that's what that's my point of view don't make don't buy into this\nNotion that somehow her family lore justified her doing it or this fractional percentage of DNA that might show\nSome ancestor in the distant past ... and if you support Native American causes then\nIt's really hard to say that you can support Elizabeth Warren because the Cherokee Nation has come out with a statement and that's the unofficially federally recognized tribe from Oklahoma I'm pretty sure it's the largest of the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes\nAnd they have said that you have done significant damage to us because the Cherokee and I've learned is through the study of you know Elizabeth Warren's ancestry for them it's not DNA they reject that you actually have\nTo identify the ancestry you have to trace that ancestor back the Cherokee keep ... ... records very much like the Mormons\nKeep meticulous genealogical records so if you have Cherokee lineage\nYou can find it and she can't find it it's not there and so she's offended that group she in their estimation has done significant damage to them and if a liberal wants to supporter anyway\nGo ahead I mean it's not for me to say who somebody should vote for not vote for all I'm interested in is getting the truth out there about what she did and hopefully getting people to be honest about what she did and not just gloss it over with a DNA test which is offensive to actual mid\n... Native Americans and doesn't prove anything anyway\nBrilliant absolutely brilliant professor Jacob's then I got about a minute left\nUm what are you OK the DNA test is clearly pure appears to be backfiring you've blown up in her face where do you think Elizabeth Warren goes from here how she made a huge ... a huge mistake in your view\nOr do you think she can recover politically\nWell it might be a combination of all of them there's no question that this has damaged her significantly politically or you know her brand even before this was of being the person who took on this fake identity fake ethnic identity now it's solidified in people who maybe hadn't heard about it\nBefore this now I've heard about it even liberal Democrats in centrist Democrats are infuriated that she did this so I think it's really hurt or where do I think she goes with it I think she just keeps pushing forward and you want to think of\nThings I've learned about Elizabeth Warren watching her\nPolitical career since April two thousand and twelve is she just keeps pushing forward and people might think that's a good thing they might think that the bad thing but I expect her to act like this is no big deal\nOr she is very a planned out person much like Hillary Clinton nothing is done\nWithout it being a you know ... either focus grouped or run through political consultants and that's what this DNA roll out was it was eight eight manufactured roll out and I think it back fired on her dramatically I don't think it necessarily ends her political career her presidential hopes\nBut I Do think it has been significantly damage them\nWe have been talking with professor bill Jacobson he's a law professor at Cornell University he's the founder and one of my favorite ...
