they already they they have I Can't remember the name of their streaming thing that they rolled out but they have I I Can't remember the name of it but\nThey they have a whole bunch of content they

former vice president Joe Biden in Delaware and one addressed actor Robert De Niro in New York\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders says today the president condemns violence and it's ridiculous but the media to consider him responsible in some way for the packages Sanders compared the situation to the left wing activist who opened fire on a Republican congressional baseball team practice last year\nSo we can't eliminate that from the possibility here because all of a sudden the caravans that appeared for twenty four hour cable are gone and the caravans coming to invade our country\nAnd there was tremendous momentum prior to the story breaking\nThat really hurt the Democrats so called blue wave\nAnd George Soros had an op ed already and written that was published it seem as it was either the day or the day after um these packages came to light you put all that together and\nThose are facts and people can draw their own conclusions from those facts but certainly uh the the way that this is being reported is unbelievably distort it\nI don't disagree one bit with that and I keep thinking about it\nBecause it's very clear to me a James as you point out that it's coincidental that none of these triggered a I I suppose if ... if we're legitimate that that they would have done it in a different way because obviously it never got to where it was going to get\nYou have the FBI the secret service another screening packages\nAnyway so would have been well known that it wasn't going to get to them until that works cleared and then you have\nThe way these labels were written misspellings of John Brennan's last name\nOr all of them coming from Debbie Wasserman Schultz trying to\nShow that there was somebody uh trying to blame or Democrats about this um ... which people would say oh my God why why are they doing that you know in other words they're they're putting the blame where it doesn't belong was by whatever Debbie Wasserman Schultz says she's not\nSomebody sending out bombs obviously so\nUm it it's a very strange set of circumstances and none of them triggered as you point out or they might not have even been able to trigger if there's no triggering device um but going back to your first point about the Democrats\nWin a former presidential candidate of a major party and former secretary of state and former first lady of\nThe United states and the Arkansas says\nThat won't be civility until we win that that's tyrannical that that sounds like Venezuela that sounds like China\nThe president's you getting a lifetime appointment the ... the the the our bases and this of suggesting that we have to win what about the American people voting James what about that yeah absurd comment\nOh exactly do I mean we always hear the left to use the word democracy\nAnd they they always records were a representative democracy were republic but that but that is you point out just flies in the face of the Democratic process the electoral system\nThat supposedly Hillary Clinton you holds dear but she joined the ranks of people like Maxine Waters\nWho have has called for people to be attacked in disturbed no matter where they are in their ... and their private life out to restaurants that gasoline stations she called for those kinds of attacks which did occur Eric Holder said I'm\nWondering are crowds ... ... ... you know in other words when they go low as opposed to Michelle Obama's statement we go higher when they go low we kick 'em\nYeah and he was the general the chief law enforcement officer of the country\nThey exactly and we're so we're talking about\nAnd you know Nancy Pelosi's do would be speaker of the house third and six session it if in fact or her party takes over the house which is likely actually so\nYeah these are extremely irresponsible statements there were repeated\nUm and yet the media the mainstream media ignores those statements and just goes after Trump but we've seen this pattern now ever since really ever since Trump has been a candidate where the media just looks or that their story selection\nThe way they write their stories the narrative is all about Trump and all about undermining Trump we moved from personality to personality from Stormy Daniels\nTo I'm a roast a to a ... ... you know or whoever it may be Steve Bannon\nAnd and one story after another so that fits the narrative when it when the caravans were on\nUm basically what the the press was doing was blaming Trump for the caravans already poised to to say when they came to the border that or the administration was quote separating families and this sort of thing\nSo this of course is tailor made for the media ... you know even an unprecedented way the head of CNN Jeff Zucker comes out talks to the press in an unprecedented way about blaming Trump so this sort of in ...\nThe the left and even um some people the never Trump or his on the right to come out and claim that Trump's book you know relatively blunt talk is is the cause of this um but you know it tells you to raise these facts\nAnd that is that these are extremely conspicuous packages\nFit a anybody that was involved in this is I guess one would say they're amateur and it is we keep pointing out there a failure rate of one hundred percent\nUm they\n... you know I hate to even being real bomb makers were designed it\nSo if it was discovered it would be a very dangerous discovery um and it appears I mean there's been photos on social media showing the box and if they had been open and so I'm assuming that bomb experts knew that they could open them\nBut like I said already the one the CNN one has been confirmed to beer\nEssentially a fake bombs and then as you said it was a only addressed only a ... cent only two very well known democratic figures\nNot one single one has actually been delivered\nUm so it's\nI mean it's it works out timing was two weeks before the election\nIf it's not a stock or a hoax it's a perfect perfectly time perfectly set up to create the image of prominent Democrats as victims and for the media to point the finger at Trump\nAnd and the reason it's so important for the left to attack Trump two weeks before the midterms is because Trump is the single significant factor in turn in really increasing Republican momentum with his rallies which are occurring at the same time\nAnd this is you know the final stretch of those rallies which isn't going to stop\nPresident Trump I'm sure but uh it's um it it it's to the Democrats advantage to anything they can to slow down the president's influence and slow down the fact of these rallies\nWill come right back and pick it up there James and get into a bit more about Nancy Pelosi and some of our shenanigans beyond even this

Trump\nOr back offered apologized just to get at the gate and all that that's not why black eye rich thing for such a scam because how can I make all these farms are you know it gets right to do anyway\nBut they are already at home and they say and they run out of their weight what's probably what you're coming up with this ... they're getting better and better\nWell I don't plan or maybe worse and worse as the case may be Bob thank you for calling who knows Gerry in Cape Cod you run the voice of Boston W. R. K. O. hello there\nAh good afternoon thanks for taking the call can I give you some observations on this please all the intended victims have been outspoken critics of the president all the meal was checked around the same\nTime the other day New York City Florida D.C it was all he delivered it been over six hundred cases of violence against conservative since the election of President Trump I don't think any conservative it's dumb enough crazy enough or insane enough to do this two weeks before the midterms\nThe bombs were not in the end of the intended targets\nSomeone had access to all their information it why didn't CNN open that package Mike it take pictures of the ball and he'd have to be out of your mind that Democrats are doing this to distract Mike they project in a manufactured crisis distracted narrative in and try to pin it on some\nSome conservative that's that's what I think they're intended outcome is here\nI think he made some very valid points and I appreciate the call thank you I Would I Would only say\nThat if this were legitimate more than likely it's a psychopath\nAnd that we had that happen with the guy in Tucson\nOr when the Congress woman had a shot in her head thank God she lived through that um we had that happen in Colorado in Aurora, Colorado a psychopath did the shooting their um with the ... the ... brothers were complete wackos and the hottest movement\nAnd I'm not suggesting that's the case here by obviously but the point is that these are the guy in the south Carolina who killed the people in the African American church\nUm another Wako so\nHe's I think he's right you're not going to see somebody who ... who has a a proper state of mind going out\nAnd doing this as a conservative to retaliate against liberals or Republican or Democrats or left wing or whatever that's why it's a very troubling story and they're just as he pointed out there are many holes in the store and of course when it happens to her Republican nobody really cares when when Eric Holder says step on them\nWhen they're down\nYou didn't hear a Jake Tapper complain about that or Brooke Baldwin or course Cuomo or Erin Burnett or any of them they just let it happen or when Cuomo\nOh no I was actually it was Cuomo have the audacity to defense and ... and his violence is sometimes necessary they don't care about that do they\nThey only care when it's skewed towards them so what do you think is going to happen if you uh do you talk about Donald Trump's rhetoric he's been battered by everybody he's trying to defend themselves and these people\nAre just relentlessly breeding 'em up forty something like forty six percent of stories about Obama that were critical about Ninety One percent are critical of Trump at CNN you told me where the justices are going on twenty four you're on the voice of Boston W. or kale hello\nMike thanks for taking my call you know I mean it's just my opinion but what can you give it away from me with the Blasio and they're all saying that now right away you know that they said\nIt's a terrorist attack yeah but the other parents that\nThey they never jumped on that when it was San Bernardino or Las Vegas shooting\nHow about the one on their own city and he and Cuomo in New York when the guy that I actually I'm On the order the skate boarders will go into people were walking or that they didn't say anything about it being a ... attack\nRight if this is a hoax Mike this is sick because they've taken the fire\nUh rent the police the ambulance away from people who really needed these people are disturbed if this is true\nWell it's a it's a very troubling and that's why we need to get the answers here and hopefully they'll get them and find out how this happened and I only hope that the FBI will actually come out the you know look you look at the top of the FBI and you begin to wonder I have about as much as I used to love Jeff Sessions has a senator now I have as much trust in him\nAs I Do want to three dollar bill being negotiable\nLet's go to Leon more family run the voice of Boston W. R. K. O. hello\nYes thanks for taking my call I don't mean to say that last word that you said I go shovel that's money and that's where it this is really coming from okay if you remember during the eighties and early nineties is that the black caucus travel to Cuba or at well people would talk about it complain about it\nNobody ever call them ... says nobody ever call them communist nobody said anything about it that day but they went over and over again\nAll right all the stuff that we're talking about is is just a lot of uh Loni it's all going to be propaganda now I don't know if you remember the Spock interview and it was brought before Congress it was drinking a coke and he was sitting at the table and for the ... for the longest time that coke was at the time you could really see the coke so much\nAnyone else he took a break come back and check the set and\nThey were talking about version or whatever it was I forget exactly it turns the coke around others like coke and he brought with them to begin with he drank some of it it had the word came on it now why would he get coke bottle whether they take on it because\nWhat would be the point he get one of his name on it maybe his kids that king was totally irrelevant until you find out that Kate Brown who's the governor\nInvolved in this so there is this a little things that are coming out that people would choose to see at what I don't like is that the Republicans are just as responsible as the Democrats\nThere are too many Republicans in there that are looking to Wall Street and all that looking for is the money that comes it as long as the money comes and\nThe bowl won't go out and they will say anything they won't do anything\nI appreciate that point and I fail us U.S Chamber of commerce is a big supporter of moderate Republicans the rhinos pollen Boston you're on the voice of Boston W.

I'm not by on this and I'll talk to and if I'm wrong Mike\nI appreciate that very much John and thank you for calling and sharing those thoughts I think there are a lot of people who are skeptical\nUm

with a great guest Sidney Powell the former prosecutor stay with us\nAuthorities could be getting closer to finding the source of these suspected explosive devices sent a high profile targets you down to ... news NBC News says federal officials believe most of the suspicious packages were mailed from Florida\nWater or does it make it better or the FBI do it on its own\nWell somebody certainly has to be directing the effort I Would expect that to be the FBI\nAnd if if they wanted a martial to do this that or the other then I'm sure there would be interagency cooperation but we sure don't need multiple agencies out there running into each other and messing up evidence or running that risk the fewer people to touch anything that constitutes evidence the better\nNow the other part of that is a it's been a lot of talk about for example DNA\nUh people um maybe looking stamps or touching novel lobes or uh some of them the mailing the fingerprints I'm finding um who might have delivered this\nUh we ... we now have a New York huge numbers of cameras um yeah they look they look at a courier who has one package and then all of a sudden has none none of the worse does that kind of technology you know help today\nYes it does and as many cameras as there are particularly in around the residents as to which or or businesses even to which these packages were sent [laughter] plenty of really good pictures of whoever drop them off\nAnd then the post office to write me in the ... if they went to the post office I'm right in the ... the because of where they run\nCameras in there all the time\nYeah and and and the you know they've had shootings that post offices things like that so post offices have to be careful as well so they have a video I'm surprised\nIf it takes the FBI more than a week to figure out who is responsible for this or at least get some very strong leads\nI suppose it would be good before election day too I mean there's there's a political element to this I realize that wouldn't be your concern or the FBI is concerned it's more about the criminal act\nBut um uh the car they kind of kind of a side effect of the car earlier this will be getting a known before election day so the the voter would know uh what what to make of it so to speak I mean that would be helpful as well\n[noise] yes and I would think they would just want to get the perpetrators interests some as soon as possible wherever the chips fall\nRight now um you you have a ... give us a little bit of that background with regard to a year uncovering of corruption that that the OJ an FBI because your work goes back prior to the Mueller investigation even beginning is that correct\nOh definitely yes in fact taught us all started around\nTwo thousand one two thousand two and then I kept seeing it get worse and worse as I was involved in some of the Enron related\nCases and seeing prosecutors literally makeup crimes\nHad evidence that showed people were innocent do anything they wanted to do to make sure they won and that it's completely antithetical to the kind of prosecutor I was raised to be several decades ago an account\nCounter intuitive to everything the department of justice had taught and I had taught younger lawyers myself when I taught in the attorney general's advocacy Institute any number of times so I was absolutely appalled\nAnd then I saw these prosecutors rise to great positions of power primarily under President Obama though one became acting assistant attorney general for the criminal division under President Bush and set about to micromanage the prosecution of former Alaska Senator Ted Stevens which cost him his Senate seat\nCompletely unnecessarily the prosecution had to be thrown out but only after the jury had returned a guilty verdict and after he had lost his seat\nThe longest serving Republican in the United States Senate on behalf of Alaska [noise] so it's just been one degree just act after the other for these prosecutors who will end up getting the attorney general's award of excellence and then becoming chief White House counsel\nDeputy director general counsel of the FBI the President Obama's counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco a Leslie Caldwell became assistant attorney general for the criminal division of the OJ under Loretta Lynch\nAnd that's a name I haven't heard yet and the more investigation which I find fascinating because it's hard to imagine that things were done inside the OJ although I guess it could have been just through the national security division that was being used to\nCreate the size of applications and all those things\nAnd Sally ate so I'm sure it was and it up to her ... she was in the meeting with\nPresident Obama and others when Comey decided when they task kind of way to go brief President Trump on this only the salacious aspects of steel dust gay so they could provide a news then to see an end to run with the whole story because they could say the president had the president elect of the president had been briefed\nAnd that's the way it came out\nSo you you have this very and it's a kind of a troubling background in terms of what you found out about the agency for what you were working but um you mentioned Lisa Monaco um ... than some of the other names come up a ... you mentioned Sally Yates Andrew Weissmann comes up McCabe\nA striking page Bruce or um uh we call them now the deep state do you believe at the time you've found the corruption that the department of justice and FBI back in those days that this was part of what was even then a deep state so to speak\n[noise] Ah yes I realized that as I watched them move up the ladder and we kept trying to get evidence we knew was\nThere that exonerate our defendants but one of them was always high up in the FBI or the department of justice and I knew they were protecting each other it was obvious it wasn't until we caught a break when all not not one of them I think was in any position at that point\nThat the third team of prosecutors accidently gave us a desk that contained the information I have been looking for for six years so yeah that I call\nHim a corrupt ... prosecutors who was in and out of government and the highest most expensive silk stocking law firms depending on where they want it\nTo be at the time and\nA lot of three of them now or at least some and walk and Leslie ... uh Caldwell Catherine run more who was White House counsel and shown Berkowitz who was head of the Enron towns force at one point there are all three at light them in ... in and out of there and the J and the White House\nEvery few years for a couple of decades\nSo they're all entrenched they're so good so I guess it was less of a surprise to you to see all the expos they in recent times since the Mueller investigation started and all these names that have come up twenty five FBI and department of justice people\nHave either been fired or quit or demoted so that that was probably in less than ... than the rest of us\nExactly and Weissman of course is still long Mueller's task for serving as his\nChief lieutenant and I noticed yesterday there's apparently in one of the indictments somebody was talking about it for the Russian uh\nThe Russian troll farm or whatever that are before dabbling fried Rick who coincidentally is the wife of math the free Drake who is in the book [noise] anyway that indictment I think it's\nBogus and is not going to stand at least a couple of counts of it are going to have to be thrown out because there and it looks like Weissman was up to his old tricks of making up crimes\nHe did that in the Enron case then yeah he got reversed nine nothing by the Supreme Court Weissman to me\nIt exactly that was in the Anderson case and then he also made up ... and Merrill Lynch case but that didn't keep them from sending four innocent Merrill Lynch executive to prison for up to a year\nWas this done strictly just to um put a metal on his chest so to speak that ah he did this and it didn't matter whether it was true or not I just want to be successful and good combination yeah\nIt's it's convictions by any means it that's just their mindset conviction and say\nWhy spend particular developed what I call prosecutorial terrorists tactics and use them against white collar defendants like Manafort and the Enron executives run\nA search warrant against their homes in the middle of the night or the wee hours of the morning you know as soon as I heard that Manafort's wife had been searched under ... in the bed for five o'clock in the morning I Need that was Weissman\nUnbelievably loosely unnecessary yes going ... tactics\nAnd there's no question I'm an oil and let me know real quick last about Lisa Monaco and we'll take a break and come back um because she's now doing she was just yesterday on CNN as one of their uh achieve\nExperts on the matter is related to the in this case to the to the packages that were sent with these explosive devices that never exploded um what about Lisa Monaco what what's her a role when all of what you found\nShe was on the Enron towns force with Weissman than the others and was\nImplicated in serious allegations of prosecutorial misconduct of multiple different kinds including introducing evidence that the judges said just could\nNot be introduce just ignoring court orders and gambled attempting to win by any means in the Enron broadband litigation and several of those cases wound up being tried three times I mean they kept it anytime they lose if the jury was hung on some counts they reach ...\nDefendants I mean they just drag these guys through everything for ten years or so\nTen suspected explosive devices had been aimed at high profile figures good afternoon ... news that includes two packages sent a former vice president Joe Biden in one addressed actor Robert Deniro President Trump tweeted today the news media's fueling a very big part of the anger in America\nAnd he said the media must clean up its act in fast and NBC News says federal authorities now believe most of the suspicious packages were mailed from Florida\nEarlier reports that some of the packages were sent by career but the FBI

R. K. O. with ms Powell go ahead and Washington\nI'm In a ... attack and it ... ... a couple of quick questions you said then that just at the time I just wanted to see\nHow how deep like you say you could probably go in there and clean it up or you could go that are under the journey or a thousand in Arabic don't you think that we have in a country\nWhere you journey\nApt to be approved by the Senate\nLike you have the like sessions instead of a point in his own people that he didn't do the job that doesn't that make it very political rocket and it's very hard\nFor them to be on the way the political system is set up out of like if he had training now Washington D. C. that Trump made a point in it seems to be going nowhere with ... and ... the cave and that person at one time we were sessions and work for calling me\nI'm ... depressed and left\nWent to a private practice now she's running the higher Washington us attorney's office which is still I just went in the country I just wonder what you thought about that\nI think I was wondering yes I was wondering where the current us attorney in\nWashington had come from because I have not been at all satisfied with what I've seen coming out of that office so now that you tell me she was on the Cape and and come the person that sort of explains that doesn't that um the reason that U.S attorneys are named by the president is so that\nWe can enforce the agenda that the administration was elected to enforce change so I mean if the directive is to clean up the swamp drained the swamp which we all know needs to be done\nThen yes it's important to have U.S attorneys that share the president's view on rooting corruption and out of government\nSays it doesn't bother me from that perspective that those are political appointees that the vast majority of people in the department of justice and even assistant us attorney it's our\nCareer employees which I have come to realize is a whole separate problem I mean I used to think that was fine and I don't anymore I think\nAlmost every government office needs some sort of term limits on it whether it be\nYou know ten twelve or Fifteen Years but that don't think it's good for anybody to stay in a government job for ever I think they lose perspective on what the real world is like and it's it stifles their own personal gross and\nIt ... it creates the deep state that we're now dealing with a number of hearing\nOne of the administrative assistants in the U.S attorney's office in San Antonio where I first started practicing when I was a baby lawyer and she would say you know I've seen U.S attorneys come in the U.S attorneys go and I'm Still going to be here\nHow deep is the deep state was the other question [noise] just awfully\nPretty deep it's I think it's pretty deep I mean I Know I Know some people that have been there as long as I have been out and and that's that's a long time one of the the couple of guys that was within the U.S attorney's office in Dallas a long time ago are still there\nOh I was surprised but one of the reasons I left was because I didn't want to wake up and look around and you know find myself but still being an assistant us attorney not that it's not a great job because it is but just because\nPeople need to grow and do different things and see what the real world's like\nVery good point we have about a minute left or what's your production and when Mueller ends the investigation officially\nI don't think it's going to be over by a year end unless there's an indictment coming that nobody is currently aware of\nBut I think the bulk of it will be over by Irin and certainly anything with respect to the president is going to be over before the end of the year hopefully even sooner than that it would be nice to have it done by Thanksgiving but I don't know if it's going to make that I Do want people to know that license to lie is now out in the new\nSecond edition paperback it was the number one bestseller Wall Street journal nonfiction a book\nSo we've done a paperback now that is just literally being shipped to the stores as we speak everybody should be able to find it at their local bookseller\nAnd I'm I'm really excited about that I tried to do everything I can to make it accessible to everyone self published it back in twenty four teams not for any political purposes but just for ... bipartisan criminal justice reform\nThat's a fabulous um gift but you've given to make it available in that way a and people should read it so they understand how deep this problem is is not new it's it's older than that and you have first hand experience describing\n... a regardless of this current event that happened with these packages\nYou know of course Cuomo point blank then and I saw him do it on camera um when he defend that in ... for that sometimes it's necessary right\nWhen he and I really got into it yeah you know as you know I'm a CNN commentator now you'll be argued on that exact point because I think that was totally wrong he said you know all punches aren't the same and\nI pointed out you know one thing when you get punched in the face the or the ideology behind the punch doesn't matter a whole lot it hurts just the same uh either way and I do believe that he went way too far\nIn trying to excuse ... he tried to say that they were fighting hate and my point is boy they do a lot of Haiti for people who are supposedly anti if you look at the er the slogan the motivations and then the action's\nMost of all of antifa you know I was at the inauguration of Donald Trump which is a wonderful that particular\nFor those of us worked so hard to make that election happened\nAnd it didn't get much media attention but I'll tell you there were a lot of antifa bugs and that's what they were there were a lot in the Washington DC and I think we are so many cops that wasn't really a lot of violence there were some you know limited by it but there would have been massive violence if it weren't for such a huge\nPolice presence and I saw it up close I was walking at one point with my team daughters who were wearing ... and the verbal abuse who took was intention wasn't physical frankly but only because of massive police presence [noise] um so you know that's just a reality to our city like Portland, Oregon right now or that at times streets get taken over by antifa um\nInto any in any way excuse the violence or to use any selfish street to try to make it seem like it's acceptable just because it might aligned with your ideological point of view like I I think that's really a terrible trend in America and the one that we need to resist I certainly have resisted that wholeheartedly and by the way though I mean justice tough\nUh on anybody on the right uh who wants to be bought an eye out but I think the vast majority of violence I mean from the left a but the point is all political Bob's wrong in my view\nOh there's no question about it not a free society because of of course Cuomo wants to go down that road then it's going to have to justify the factors are somehow except the fact that if somebody on the right one to do the same thing as an ... for their ideology\nUh then then you've got to give it the same latitude and we shouldn't wide latitude either way but if you want to give it to one I'm a ... that the what he's really saying there is that this country needs to be a left wing country I mean that's what he's saying right\nRight well and and and the the two you know it comes from anti fascist will bear a lot like fascist it's sort of interesting that which they claim to be opposing um is actually that was forcing ironically we often see that with a left right they claimed to be hollering and what they really mean is there are tolerant if you agree or if you happen to disagree\nThey're not very tolerant and by the way that's the only tolerance let's face it that really matters\nIs very easy to be somebody who thinks just the way you do that's not real art style or it's a is saying somebody else you can have\nA different point of view and and while you're there not harming you they're allowed to uh you know that's the way America has always worked at the way any just society work it's not the way the left she said the less said get in line or get in trouble um you know normally that trouble is just a political pressure but sometimes it's actually violent trouble in the in the case of anti I\nThink we see by the way that same phenomenon with the whole Kanye West thing with minorities you know I'm Hispanic I take so much grief I'm constantly called the ... you know Uncle Tom uh because I happen to support this president and his mission and according to the left though if you're a minority at your Spanish are black\nOr you better get in line a which is very fascinated again for people who claimed to be so power who claim to be so anti racism may actually embrace a very prejudiced point of view which said that if your skin is black or your ethnicity Hispanic\nYou have to think this way well that to me the most prejudice a notion of all\nA ended really incredibly discriminatory an ironic coming from people who claimed to be the opposite of that\nYou know the the I I agree with you completely obviously about ... and um the toxic aspect of that of course as George Soros funding them but the bigger problem to me is when Hillary Clinton says I'm well we're not going to have civility\nUntil we were house or Senate or both now right and what did she say I don't mean that that that's that's that's a tyrannical dictatorship way of thinking that people vote it's\nOutrageous it's outrageous you know you're right I'm Glad you brought that up because ... and keep it to some degree maybe you can dismiss say well the under cool again these are young\nPeople have nothing better to do that or act like a street gang but they're not in power right now you're talking about Hillary Clinton who was very nearly ... ... who was secretary of state who was first lady and she was bold enough and brazen than to actually tell us what she's things and and and that is it's\nAlmost a bargain with the people saying we will treat you well if you give us the reins of power I mean think of how corrupt\nOr that kind of logic is you know we will be civil once\nWe have all the levers of power I mean that that is the definition of tyranny right and otherwise we're going to be uncivil so you're exactly right you when\nWhen the less screens that they want the civility after a actions like these packages be mailed Emory I agree with them that we should be civil I think they need to shine that light on themselves and people like Hillary Clinton who again tried to make a bargain with us give us power than will be simple I mean that's just that's outrageous\nThe other the other example I'd give you see that as I'm Eric Holder the the chief law enforcement officer of this country saying when they're down kick them what what kind of obnoxious and this from the former chief law enforcement over sort of the country is that right\nNo it wasn't it it's outrageous um and now of course later he'll try to explain in a way that he was speaking about it for that it was just a but it's it's unbelievable you know the in flight\nBlaming uh when I got to say they're blaming Donald Trump for his rhetoric causing this problem with these packages are but they don't want to do the say the same thing about about um holder saying kick them when they're down somebody some wacko might pick them when they're down right cause real harm\nExactly and and and I think that again that line should be a grim shine that light shining barely and I think that it will reveal\nFar more damning 'em and far more real or insightful rhetoric coming out of the left and you write most of all that Hillary hunter comment I mean I just thought that was reprehensible or you know I I Will say this though on a lighter note or\nAs a heart is in I have to tell you the longer she stays
