{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Arcade oh boy so Boston is America ... member ... PC an advisory services officers securities American advisors and carry on from representative Armstrong advisory group and the security is American companies are unaffiliated\nWith news news is going to break and we're here to break it down and show what it means to your portfolio the financial exchange with very Armstrong in ... on the financial exchange radio network\nNoticing justice that ten year treasury bond gets three ten Tice level it's\nBeen I got three Thirteen actually on it oh boy I focus has two thousand eleven yeah we're going back pre euro debt crisis any a ... is that a concern I mean are these Tucker's mortgage rates going to go up\nYeah Tucker's mortgage rate is going to go up a ... I got an adjustable rate mortgage so mine's going to go up to [noise]\nYou know what's interesting is even with the ten year moving into a higher yields recently to last week we had actually seen the dollar weakening the last week we finally moving back toward strength now or if the dollar does continue to strengthen it does raise some question marks I think you know heading into next year\nUm but it's you know we're pretty much the same level that we were at the last four or five months right now but if we see you know five or six percent strength above this then I start to get a little concerned kind of strange to see the dollar\nStrengthening and oil go up isn't it I mean you had a will now over Seventy five bucks a barrel ... everybody says oh don't worry about it don't worry about it I I I have to find something to worry about that give you plenty no [noise] no they just put it out there you know you got to oil trend is Seventy five bucks\nA nobody's turn the heat on yet yeah when I asked her oh oh I have a story for you so [laughter]\nThe other day my or my mother in law uh she uh decided to put the heat on like amber only watch it if a ten minute Kamber why I was like oh I don't know it was like fifty degrees outside of a bundle up let's go [laughter]\nOr else I Know I was just like surprise he got in September yeah that's a relative ha ha and I was just went under I'm\nShaking just thinking of the money that I Would spend if I did\n[laughter] I Try to wait till November but it's really hard to go to January I being ... I think you wait till Thanksgiving and get away with that\nWhat would I used to do and I still lived in ah I Know you're not if you're married and you want to stay married Tucker who would I used to when I Lived in a city in an apartment buildings I Would pretty much moved off of people so I wouldn't be in the middle for ... everyone else that you know pretty much provide your heating\nFor you that is a nice thing about being on the third fourth floor they do yeah now that the heat from down below you\nHad to do it anymore you know now that I have an actual house it doesn't work that's got to be killing you I I Love to find a way to siphon heat from my neighbor if I could but I I just don't know how to do with what\nUh what do higher wages mean if you're running a dominoes franchise you're running McDonald's franchise I'm just thinking I\nMcDonalds you know minimum wage there's what nine ten bucks an hour and you're a line cook there you're a cashier there are you thinking to yourself why do I have to stay at McDonald's but I just go over to Amazon Amazon Amazon is hiring even Fifteen bucks an hour you have a pulse you can get a\nAt Amazon yeah and and that a lot of restaurants labor expenses typically make up you know between twenty five and thirty percent of the restaurant ... it's bigger than their rent it is and so if you see wages and again let's look at a company like McDonald's or see a lot of McDonalds jobs being posted for twelve Thirteen an hour ... tip you say okay\nIf they need to get up to Fifteen right that means to twenty five to thirty percent bump in wages that you're seeing there in what that means is all of a sudden that twenty five to thirty percent of sales that that labor expense used to be\nIs now thirty to thirty five percent right so you got to raise the question is do they raise prices by corresponding you know five or ten percent to match that and and if they do raise those prices do they still keep people coming in if the value isn't quite what it used to be so\nWhat do you think do you think you start to see some of these lower end franchises go out of business like if you're running a dominos do you just say out of the heck with it or just thinking about a subway cars subways labor intensive where you walk into one of the stores even a small store I have three or four workers\nThere yeah it's I I don't know if you see like the the big names you're you're getting your dominoes of the world you're McDonald's of the world they're not going to go out of business because I think they have pricing power ... the ones that are a little bit more questionable that maybe don't necessarily\nDeliver the same kind of value imagine ... ... what was going to have no problem really front customer the McDonalds\nYou haven't labor intensive again different they they do to figure out how to do that robotically right that's a robo burrito robo burrito I've watched that know how many people that won't be fascinating when you when you go to a ... way though during about how many different people you're working three ...\nThree you've got the person put it actually for in some case you've got the person who first puts the tortilla down then you've got the person doing the meat and the other stuff then you usually have a glock and special person then you've got the cash register\nFor him I mean it's I think it will be curious to see I think what you're going the end result will be most of these will stay in business prices will go up\nBut the workers if you go from ten bucks an hour to Fifteen dollars an hour that's a fifty percent waging clarity bump\nAnd then you're going from twenty grand a year to thirty but they spend it here's the difference yeah that that guy that makes goes who their wage goes from ten to Fifteen they spend every nickel of that five dollars more per hour that they're making\nIt will be good for the economy in the long run the other thing that does all in the short term and the other thing that does is keep them on a lot of those workers that are at or near minimum wage are collecting an awful lot of benefits whether it's a food stamps way housing assistance so by getting higher wages it reduces demands on those programs and actually cleans up things from a budget perspective\nGreat to see happening very great to see happening\nMarkets in record territory I mean in the market has just ripping the Dow is up one hundred and forty one points at twenty six thousand nine Fifteen VS ... everything's going the right direction with the

... news\nWire down and said Kellyanne Conway is defending President Trump's comments at a rally about the woman who is accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault\nShe had like a ... like all of us will make me cry every plane you can ...\nA former ex boyfriend an ex boyfriend of Christine Ford sent a letter now to Chuck Grassley and the Senate Judiciary committee in which in that letter\nHe explicitly says I was dating her for six years from Nineteen Ninety two to Nineteen Ninety eight we were very intimate\nI personally witnessed her coaching one of her close friends on how to beat a polygraph test when her friend was applying for a job in the U.S government\nSo she was applying for her friend was some kind of a job in the U.S government where you needed to take a polygraph test and because Christine Ford is a psychologist\nAnd an academic it's like you know it's like a a a a professor in psychology she knew all about polygraph test she knew all about how to be\nPolygraph tests she\nWas almost an expert at beating polygraph tests and so she coached her friend on how to beat the polygraph test how do I know I saw it I was in the room I witnessed it\nHe\nThen goes on to say and by the way I have to say this six years we were together we shared the same bed we lived in the same apartment\nShe's not afraid of flying that's a complete apply in fact not only is she not afraid of flying we flew everywhere on these small engine propeller plane ...\nWe flew all we did was fly and on small planes\nShe never had a problem she never told me she had a problem we kept doing it again and again and again and again moreover she doesn't she's not afraid of confined spaces\nShe's not afraid of being in small rooms with no exit doors how do I know because we shared an incredibly small tiny apartment together with very small rooms and none of them had exit doors and we did it for six years\n\nShe never mentioned once that she was sexually assaulted not once she never mentioned Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd then he goes on to say that she went off to Hawaii by the way she would always fly to Hawaii back and forth or she loves to surf she loves the white man will she picked up a plane to Hawaii that's not a problem and apparently he says that she cheated on him that's what led to the breakup of the relationship\nThat she you know I don't want to get into it but that's their business anyway so he she apparently cheated on him and then he says when they broke up\nShe you know said we're not using the joint credit card anymore that's my credit card forget it we're not sleeping together no credit card well apparently a year later I guess what she racked up six hundred dollars on his credit card\nSo even says she even committed fraud on the guy but anyway let that go to the fact of the matter now is she has to be recalled\nIn fact if I were Grassley I Would recall her right now and say you now have a former boyfriend who under oath under the penalty of perjury and going to jail says he witnessed you giving somebody a test or a a how to beat a polygraph so\nHow come now all of a sudden\nYou never you never saw a polygraph you never witnessed a polygraph you were afraid of polygraphs doing the polygraph scared you see everything scares this woman\nIt was on an act\nSmall rooms scare her flying scares her small spaces scare polygraph scare her everybody's scares her everything scares are\nBut in reality and I'm going to get to this tomorrow in my big announcement I just can't say it now in reality get the therapists notes\nBecause what the therapists notes will reveal is that she told the therapist the assault took place not in eighty two but in Nineteen eighty five when Kavanaugh was than at Yale so they could not have been him\nAnd that she said there were four men not two men and that's suppose your door or she kept going on about the door\nWe I'm seeing my therapist I'm so traumatized because I Want this door but my husband doesn't understand why we need to door to door was up for years\nThey were running a separate business they needed one door residential one door commercial she has been lying throughout the entire time ... whole thing and I got to be careful now\nIs BS I almost said the actual word it is complete and utter BS now let me tell you this\nThis exonerate Kevin ... this is what they call it scope of tore evidence there's no getting around this fact she is a liar and a perjure not only should the Republicans vote as soon as possible\nNot only should judge Kavanaugh now be confirmed I'm Sorry my friends but now enough is enough it's time that the Democrats were taught a lesson\nIf you're going to drag these women out men nip you laid them co worst some influence um I don't care how they did it what they did we're going to find out eventually to have these people make deliberately false and men ... accusations lie under oath\nTo defame and destroy an innocent good man there should be consequences to pay\n\nAnd one of them is going to jail\nAnd I'm going to get to Julie sweat neck because now her story has completely imploded\nThere's I mean she's finished in terms of her credibility sweat and they collide\nDeborah Ramirez light and most importantly the one that started this whole fiasco Christine Blasey Ford lied\nShe should be charged with a crime with a felony with having lied to Congress with defamation and with perjury agree or disagree it's time for Christine Blasey Ford to go to jail\n[noise] we're expecting the FBI report could it be as early as today you\nThe ... doesn't mean we're going to see it supposedly we're not going to see what are the chances that solidly\n[laughter] I don't think it's really good [laughter] keep an eye out for that

would all be from Asia and in the back where\nNumber two she ... she was talking it when it would ... judge came out that night he came he came out like a few of the cabinet up on Capitol ... latest

I have to be careful how I say this ah I Know many of you think um I may be leaving I'm not leaving it's nothing like that but it is a very very important announcement so I have to be hauled away phrased this um\n[noise] look I can tell you this Senator Chuck Grassley wants to subpoena the therapists notes\nHe's coming under increasing pressure to subpoena the therapists knows because they will completely destroy Christine Blasey Ford she however is now invoking doctor patient confidentiality\nNow Grassley is very upset and he's rightly so because he's saying whoa whoa whoa you use those notes\nTo further your story if you remember she says well it started at this couples therapy session when I was talking to my therapist\nIn May of two thousand and twelve and so she showed only parts of the notes to the Washington Post when she did or interview so we single hold on you use the notes when it's convenient for you\nBut when there could be evidence that will demolished your story or completely exonerate judge Kavanaugh suddenly now you want to hide behind doctor patient confidentiality well it doesn't work that way and it shouldn't work that way\nSo but she's invoking doctor patient confidentiality that's what's going on I Can't say more I Will tell you everything tomorrow at twelve or five I promise\nSix or six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight is the number\nAnthony in Michigan Europe next go ahead Anthony\nDr Cooney thank you so much or as always I always tell him that lovely Britain years ago I worked at a part time is it a building inspectors office and uh Jerry stole a lot of my school under but they do ancillary paperwork it's basically who who what where where\nAre the two doors you can find the photos on the Web I guess it gets ... to ... and how they tried to hide it would have federal and this was for extra space or renting it out to Google kids et cetera um chip I thought it was something while I was waiting on the line for you know these are just you know by background checks are brutal correct\nNot only are they brutal they ask everybody have you ever seen somebody drink it's a question they\nAlways ask have you seen him drunk have you seen him in ... have you seen the ... how much does he drink at a party or whatever silk times we get\nWe go back to the beginning of of a a judge Kavanaugh's career where did he cut his teeth and who had the FBI Files that were ... and run redacted back then he was on the Watergate staff did Hillary others were redacted filed back then I read that that\nNo no I mean you're talking about you're talking about the um [noise] not whitewater talking about Ken Starr\nYes he was on yeah she was on the human Duncan starts\nYeah he was on yeah you have to put our committee oh no no there's no question about it a Hillary is never forgiven him for his work on the Ken Starr committee that's another reason why she wants she wants to take 'em out\nDid she have the donor decade file from back then because he probably had a background check for that over a hundred of them\nOf course she had multiple background checks and they asked about his drinking and about anything that went on and asked them sexual assaults and all of that he passed them six times\nNow Jeff I Want to take it back to two thousand and ... this is six this is really interesting or after the G O P lost the house and Senate I cut Chuck Schumer on a C SPAN and he was bragging how they started in Pennsylvania went westward and they are you know\nPick up a bunch of a house seats and you know I was looking at the Web and one day and I was looking at the seats that said who\nI Wonder if there's a map out there that super imposes a religious affiliation with that son of a biscuit I found one and I did it I guess what all the districts they picked off work they were predominantly Catholic Jeff these places are now all Trump ... territory\nIs this in the anti Catholic move and I got to tell you you know they're trying to paint him with the same broad brush with what's going on in the church right now with their problems how is this not\nBorderline if not outright evil\nBingo that's what it is it's evil and thank you for that call Anthony Barbara in Rockland Europe next go ahead Barbara\nHijacked I won't say it I think Trump wasn't trying to my current he simply skating when she hit show and I'm people calling her she gonna kill Chilean proven otherwise\nI was the only ... in here to talk about and nobody I didn't hear any given media or anybody credit I mean and and now when they when marking ...\nBrilliant brilliant you're completely right Barbara and thank you for that call look when Saturday Night live mocked him as this angry drunk\nAnd as a wannabe rapist than sexual
