World Series victory parade\nAs a celebration will take place beginning at eleven o'clock on Wednesday morning at Fenway Park\nThis is a an all time great team that we had I think a lot of people enjoy watching the steam uh everybody contributed\nParade will head for a lens downstream tapes which streets onto Boylston and then from on ... street and then we'll finish on ... street Boston police commissioner William grasses encouraging fans who plan to attend the parade to act responsibly\nOr it rhymes with like okay so he openly referred to Trump's government as essentially a Jewish government controlled by Jews for Jews on behalf of Jews he loopholes to President Trump with every fiber of his being\nSo how can this guy who hates the president hates the president's policies have the president's movement somehow Trump is responsible for him\nLike this is how unhinged and frankly craze and politicized our country has become\nWe can't even condemn a simple act of vicious anti Semitic terrorism that's what it was\nWithout politicizing it and blaming the president saying that somehow his words led to this his actions led to this how many white I'm I'm looking at these left wing or something like really have you lost your mind\nYou mean what did he move the embassy to Jerusalem\nThat he's promoted prominent Jews in his administration because they're the best people for the job that what he's the love daughter is Jewish are we what did he do to somehow a fanned the flames of this neo Nazi white supremacist not job\nNow Trump then said this\nAnd I have to tell you I think he is one hundred percent right rural cut one Brittany [noise]\nAh he's completely right he is completely right\nHas there been armed security within that synagogue gay the tree of life synagogue then this would not have occurred\nNow no one's blaming the victims no one's blaming or rabbi\nBut I I said they set my own church I'm saying it to people everywhere in the age that we live in now I Am sorry but you need to have armed security in public places especially in so called gun free zones\nNotice these not shops okay piece these vial evil scum bags notice they don't target a police station\nNoticed they don't target or a military base they always hit the so called soft targets targets where they know there are no guns people aren't allowed to have guns nobody can shoot back\nSchools movie theaters and of course places of worship\nLike the one down in in in in in South Carolina in Charleston South Carolina when Dylann Roof at that church he knew nobody was going to be carrying any guns and a church there were no armed security that's why precisely why you hit it\nThat's why and he hit it so hard that's the same thing with this ... example right here I'm asking myself really honestly\nIn the age of terrorism that we live today\nIslamic terrorism never mind all kinds of other terrorism now but it's rising up political terrorism\nYou've got to have armed security look I don't want to give you the story of my life it last week I was in tremendous pain\nI was in tremendous agony I had shingles I'm telling you I recommend it to nobody it is a horrific thing I was in the hospital for three days okay at Norwood emergency their arms security\nI mean at the hospital gotten God Bless but there was armed security at the hospital I mean I saw the men\nThere they had guns on them I didn't feel like oh this is so inappropriate direct sheltering here there are six people here are elderly here just guys like Jeff corner with single scare or semi delusional you know oh my God how could there be guns I feel safe with armed security at\nThe hospital so my point there's an obvious one if schools now are starting to deploy armed security if hospitals are starting to deploy armed security why is it so that a button to have one at a synagogue and for God's sakes\nEverything with the Jews have injured everything that the Jews have suffered over the last hundred years obviously the Holocaust being the big one\nYou know\nOne of the reasons why Hitler was so successful with his so called final solution was that the Jews were unarmed they were not able to defend themselves I don't understand the liberal logic\nTo chew on Jews or people of any religious denomination to be disarmed again in the face of a neo Nazi Mad Men so Trump is getting tremendous blowback oh you're blaming the victims how\nDare you called farms security and I'm thinking like how dare you not call farm security how many more dead frankly in this case how many more dead Jews before people say enough is enough we're going to arm ourselves and we're going to fight back\nWell Trump was immediately blasted by the liberal mayor of Pittsburgh believe me I'm not impressed with this guy whatsoever here is now the mayor of Pittsburgh bill ... saying the president's should basically mind his own business rural cut to Britain\nBut I don't think that the answer to this problem is solved by having our synagogue she lost to the church is\nA field with armed guards or schools filled with our guard so I think\nWere dealing with an irrational person who acted irrationally and trying to create laws around that is not the way that we should govern we should\nTry to stop or rational behavior from happening at the forefront and not try to create laws around a rational behavior to\nContinue like this isn't this is incredible so\nBy the way you know he's acting like just going to I don't know it's it's a it's going to be like a men walking up and down the aisle with machine guns no one maybe two security guards like I saw the Newton emergency at the new laws but all\nArmed one in the front one in the back so when a nut job like this guy comes in and says yells out all Jews must die before he gets the first shot off\nBoom boom boom he's dead problem solved\nMy friends if we are now going to stop the rise of political violence it is time to teach these terrorists\nThat there are are going to be a tremendous price to be paid that there will no longer be any soft targets in the United states and that includes churches synagogues Buddhist temples whatever\nDouble barreled question is Trump right\nShould there be armed security at these places of worship would that have prevented this massacre\nAnd number two the media is blaming Trump\nFor the massacre at the Pittsburgh synagogue or they again politicizing an issue to go after the president or his Trump to blame six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight your calls max\nHey everybody

President Trump now even visit the families of the victims were killed in Saturday's massacre\nThe rabbi of the tree of life synagogue has said look we want the price because the president said he wants to come\nHe wants to console he wants to comfort he wants to show unity he wants to show strength or and so he's really wants to go down to Pittsburgh go into the synagogue itself meet the victims probably give a speech there as well and talk to the family members\nThe rabbi of the tree of life synagogue has said Trump is welcome\nHe said look I'm an American citizen he is our president he will be our honor for him to come and talk to us however a coalition of progressive Jewish leaders and rabbis called bend the arc\nA basically a left wing liberal advocacy organization is now insisting that the president is not welcome to Pittsburgh\nThe synagogue or to address the family members of the victims in fact they're already holding protests first in the White House in front of the White House over the weekend and then back in Pittsburgh and they now have a a letter that they've sent out and the core of the letter says this quote\nPresident Trump you are not welcoming Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism\nPresident Trump you are not welcoming Pittsburgh until you stop targeting endangering all minorities\nPresident Trump you are not welcoming Pittsburgh until you see your assault on immigrants and refugees in particular I'm not kidding the migrants caravan that is coming up from Honduras\nPresident Trump you are not welcoming Pittsburgh until you commit yourself to compassionate democratic policies that recognize the dignity of all of us in other words socialism progressive is\nNow\nI to me I just honestly you want to see where the state of the country is you've got the media pounding Trump\nNow almost every second every minute every hour of the day saying he's responsible for what took place he's dividing our country he's showing hatred and division and yet when you have a loving\nPeople dead eleven Jews dead because of an anti Semitic neo Nazi terrorist your first reaction is to tell the ... the president he's not welcome\n\nWhen he got nothing to do it in fact you wants to fight anti Semitism he's denounced anti Semitism he's on everything in his power to combat anti Semitism\n\nAnd so now you want to even prevent the president from going to Pittsburgh and and and and and console the poor grieving parents and siblings and and family members\nI mean this is the state that we're in now that even when you have eleven dead an atrocity they don't want the president to come unless you were versus his policies that's another thing what is the migrant caravan have anything to do what took place in Pittsburgh\nI mean you can be for it you can be against that whatever your position is but what does this have to do with a neo Nazi lunatic a a neo Nazis comeback\nComing in there and shooting the place up screaming all Jews must die\nWhat does this have to do with migrants what does this have to do with I don't know blacks are minorities or Latino or whatever a Medicare for all over Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage like I I to me how people politicize everything now in other words unless you embrace our agenda\nOf globalism of open borders of socialism of amnesty unless you adopt our policies our radical left wing policies you're just not welcome\nTo we don't want to see your face in Pittsburgh we don't want to see your face at a synagogue and fees are Jews\nEssentially telling the president don't console and comfort fellow Jews in the hour of need\nBecause of politics I mean I'm looking at this honestly and I'm thinking as as everybody in this country going nuts so how come the media's him denouncing them how come the media\nDidn't say look he's the console her and she is not just the commander in chief\nThis is practically a war crime is an act of terrorism that took place on American soil that's what this was and the president wants to show up to show solidarity to show compassion to stand shoulder\nTo shoulder with the family members to send a strong message that we're not going to stand by and allow this to continue in the United states of America and you can't put aside your progressive ism you're left wing moon bad policies and politics for one freaking day\nEven this even this must be politicized\nSo let me ask you this should President Trump go to Pittsburgh\nOr if he's met with these ah with this group bend the ark with a angry Jewish leaders angry rabbis at denouncing him is this going to be an absolute PR tobacco\nAnd people will just take away from this that Trump is so toxic he sold Davis if\nShe's not even wanted when there is an atrocity any mass for taking place should Trump go for should he not go\nSix one seven three six six sixty eight sixty eight I promise we'll take your calls after this short news break but first\nBoston is going to hold a mother for rain for the world series champion the Boston Red Sox is going to be on Halloween on Wednesday Kevin hiding rich as that story thicket away seven [noise]\nHe went down or those steps that escalator when he announced that he was running for the nomination of the Republican Party\nAnd unlike any other Republican presidents slight exception being Ronald Reagan Trump fights back he gives as good as he gets in fact he gives even better than what he gets\nAnd that's what they can't stand that he calls them out\nAnd show today he's not just doubled down he tripled down with the media blaming him for the synagogue atrocities\nWith the media being blaming him for the pipe bombs with the media blaming him allegedly for this rise in political violence and insisting that he must tone down his rhetoric and start taking it on the chin here is what Trump tweeted out this morning quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people\nMust stop the opium the open forgive me an obvious hostility and report didn't use accurately and fairly\nThat will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony fake news must and\nHe won't stop calling them fake news he won't stop calling them the enemy of the people and he's openly saying that it is their fraudulent reporting the propaganda that's what he really means propaganda that is eliciting so much anger across the country now\nI Want to get to your calls but just before I Do [noise]\nThere's not much I had shingles last week I said it already in the last hour so I was in a hospital I was hospitalized for three days\nI don't recommend it to anybody it's an incredibly painful experience that it's a really severe\nA severe form of shingles I was in pain I was in agony honestly I honestly thought I was being tortured some points it really my head my ear my jaw my teeth I couldn't believe that kind of paint one of the luxuries\nThat you have the very few is when you're when you're injuring such pain and you're essentially cordoned off because you don't want to get anybody else in fact it\nIs you get a chance to look to reflect to look at your country to look at your society to take a step back\nAnd I got to tell you as I'm sitting there in the hospital and I'm looking at\nCNN and I'm looking at Fox I'm looking at MSNBC and I'm reading some of the papers\nIt is so obvious it's so crystal clear\nThey hate him I mean they really hate him the media complex\nCannot stand this man and what's even worse\nIs they can stand his supporters I think what they hate even more than Trump is that Trump represents for the first time so much of middle America\nAnd even one of the doctors they treated me and he was a very good doctor he did an excellent job treating my my shingles but just out of the blue you know what do you do for a living I tell them a talk show host blah blah blah blah\nAnd then All right away unsolicited unsolicited he says you know Hillary was not wrong when she called the supporters deplorable\nI said what he goes in she wasn't wrong paint really are neo Nazis races big gates white supremacists and I'm thinking why do you hate your country so much\nWhy you have these poor people in the heartland so much but what what do they do literally what do they do except get up go to work pay their taxes raise\nTheir families send their children off into the military to fight and die\nYou know\nThe Democratic party used to be the pro worker party\nAnimal honesty they used the champions working men and the working woman now you\nKnow under FDR under Truman under Kennedy I gotta say even under Carter even on a bus are even Bill Clinton\nSaid you know we need them to win let's not vilify him in public\nWhat's happened in the last twenty twenty five years that you hate ordinary decent taxpayers so much\nAnd\nSo I said to him this I I didn't want to look he's treating the rights I don't want to alienate the guy which believe me I got shingles I just want the pain bent [noise] but I did say this thing that I could tell it really struck him up I said do you know\nIs that most of the people who voted for Trump in Michigan and Ohio and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania actually voted for Obama in two thousand and two thousand and twelve I go do you know that\nAnd like she just like it was like his head just shot back and I said you see Mitt Romney offered them nothing\nExcept more outsourcing and the loss of their jobs and the loss of their menu factories the loss of their livelihood the loss of their ability to live their way of life\nAt least Obama gave them\nA welfare check on unemployment check but Trump did something very different he offered them a pay check he offered them their jobs back their factories back their way of life back\nThat's why they voted for him\nSo instead of spending and these people's faces and hating them I don't know why don't you call up some of his issues one on trade\nOn immigration on war on all these endless wars around the world I don't know there are sending their sons and daughters for war is all over the world we never win\nAll their ... their jobs in factories are being outsourced to China and Brazil and India and Vietnam Mexico I don't know maybe defend them\n\nSecure the border so they're not getting killed in their own communities are opiates aren't pouring in weather getting addicted to drugs and is destroying them by the tens of thousands every year or driving down their wages are stealing their jobs in other words\nWhy don't you protect your own and so what's happening now is this the elites show despise\nThe people of America the ordinary middle working class men and women\nThat middle America now hates them middle America\nSays we know what you really think of us you really do think we're a bunch of the ... okay that's how you think about us well now blank you and they don't even once ask themselves why do they hate us so much why why is CNN solo\nWhy is the New York times so despised why is Hillary Clinton why do they chant lock her up why do they hate the ruling class the political and media establishment so much\nCould it possibly be that they're not the problem but we're the problem could it possibly be\nEither the world is crazy or were crazy and I don't think the world is crazy which means\nWe're crazy my friends what you are now seeing\nIs the breakup of the United states\nBetween the elites and the heartland and this gap is just going to get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger Trump didn't start this he's just going to finish it and for God's sakes I Hope he does\nTime provide gestures to get the recognition they deserve for their role influencing pop culture and public opinion and you decide which podcasts are

by him cannot be replaced and I I I\nI truly believe and the commandment thou shalt not he'll talk to me during the costs my you\nJoseph you are one thousand percent correct\nI couldn't agree with you more [noise]\nSix one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight okay the accused gunman in we're not going to say his name the accused the gunman in the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh\nTrouble demand you take a look at him just a picture of him does everything you need to know okay very troubled man who's got a history of drug addiction who's got a history of mental illness who drives around this bizarre Trump\n... all I mean littered with a cartoons and pictures and CNN sucks and the ... you know President Trump and uh you know I just everything it just it's so you know it's screams at you when you see it on the street\n\nAnd he sent pipe bomb after pipe bomb by the way those pipe bombs were defective\nThose were not very effective pipe bomb they had never had a chance of going off for example the detonation didn't work\nSo you couldn't even detonate a bomb even if you want it to so they were essentially harmless pipe bombs are basically suspicious packages that's what he sent out so these very shoddy poorly made pipe bombs that could not go off\nAnd you just it's almost like checking the list I mean on like this is incredible Obama check Biden should Hillary Clinton shook\nCheck John Brennan ... works at MSNBC buddy sent it to John Brennan at CNN\nCheck a James Clapper check Cory Booker jak\nWhy Debbie Wasserman Schultz that's beyond me but anyway she's on the list check and so I'm looking at this and I'm like oh Robert Deniro but just to get Hollywood involved as well that the loser check he gets a pipe bomb as well and so I'm looking at all this\nAnd I'm like you see that stupid you see that more on ec or if somebody using this guy to try to damage the president and the Republicans politically\nOn the eve of the mid term elections and blunt the Republican momentum and flip the entire script because this script for weeks and weeks was adult country could see it\nWas left wing mob violence\nThey were going after Mitch McConnell in restaurants they were going after Ted Cruz in restaurants going after them in airports a day at occupy the Senate office buildings they occupied floors they were banging on the Supreme Court doors I mean you saw all of this mob frenzy\nAnd it was getting worse and worse and worse and worse and the Democrats are refusing to condemn it and the more they refused to condemn it the more the Republican poll numbers were surging\nAnd then boom on a dying baby that whole\nScript and narrative got completely flipped just completely flipped and all of a sudden it's this make America great again bomber\nAll of a sudden now according to the media the acts of this lunatic and he clearly is a very troubled men I mean we're talking about we knew this guy is serious we knew\nHe lives in his van apparently according to witnesses it's filthy dirty their alcoholic beer cans I guess or whatever empty beer cans everywhere food containers from fast food restaurants everywhere it's filthy it's dirty it's disgusting\nAccording to one person who knew him he said quote unquote he lived like an animal\nAnd this guy puts together these rudimentary pipe bombs as I said could not detonate ... you know just so show ... made and then he is able to find the addresses of all of these people\nBut I'm just being honest with you it it I mean I honestly I I don't I mean I Know Obama has a home in Georgetown because I write about in the press I don't know what street\nHe's on honest to God I don't know was address was home I don't know where he lives\nYou know I Can't I you know like most of these people you know I I couldn't find most of these people if I wanted to so I'm looking at a guy who lives out of his van who then sends out fourteen of these so called packages\nI mean who didn't get a a pipe bomb and now the left is milking it for all that it's worth listening now I could I could play you ten of these clips somebody just play you one listen now\nThat Clapper had the guy who perjured himself lied under oath well now Clapper [laughter] those are not going to silence from I was going to make me doubled down on my quarters those around the president oil not be silence we're at a time senator speak truth to power role cut for Britain\nTo read there is some portion of the water [noise] this change actually social ... obviously you have to assume they are\nWhether or not this is just only in terms of ... to show fear intimidate or that sort of thing or was it ...\nI don't do that or you want to ah just echo one say that John Lewis said that is this is going to a ... a\nLittle ... clinics\nOh yeah well there are guys that nothing's going to stop you guys are [laughter]\nBy the way wasn't functional none of the bombs are functional\nNone but the mainstream media is not telling you that because they want to ratchet up the fear factor and they want to rush it up the anti Trump factor\nThis is all about sticking it to Trump now listen to the president of the United states because I think you hit the nail right on the head rural cuts three Britain\nWe might never allow political violence to take root in America\nCannot leather hat and I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\n[noise] you know Trump made a very interesting point\nWhen that crazed Bernie Sanders supporter shot up congressional Republicans on that softball field in northern Virginia where Steve ... was badly wounded and there had not been a the congressional police there would've been a massacre\nI'm not talking fake pipe bombs I'm Talking about dead members of Congress\nWhether it'd be Paul Ryan whether it be Rand Paul whether it be Steve ... much of the upper leadership of the Republican Party would have been decimated K they would have been massacred right there\nTrump to his credit didn't run around blaming Bernie he didn't\nRun around and say hey this guy was one is your most Abbott supporters and volunteers dishes you this is on\nYour body you know you and you alone just you know\nHe didn't do that the Republicans didn't do that but notice now when it comes to the pipe bombs\nOr in this case the terrorists to atrocity in Pittsburgh\nThe left wants to pin it all on Donald Trump\nAnd so my question to you double barrel question do you think Trump bears responsibility for the make America great again pipe bomber here's this man of creation of Donald Trump and his rhetoric as the media claims\nAnd easy responsible for the massacre in Pittsburgh six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight is the number and will it hurt Trump
