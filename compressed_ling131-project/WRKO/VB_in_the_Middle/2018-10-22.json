still vote at all I Want to keep you informed get our weekly market ... by becoming a member of berries brigade visit financial exchange showed John calming signed up today\n[noise]\n\nTime to talk of cars and we're joined now by Antwon good when from seeing that road show here to talk about the twenty ninth teen Toyota Avalon Anton thanks for joining us today\nHey how's it going we're doing well so I took a look at the apple and just because I always liked to you know look at the cars before we talk about him my first question is what happened to the front of this car because it kind of looks like a giant mouse driving down the road facing right at you what's what's your thought on the styling\nOr well the Evelyn front end is\nRidiculously aggressive this year I think that's the way it is making some large steps to kind of get away from the boring brand that sort of Beijing\nReputation that it had and it might have gone a tad bar on the Avalon if he if you look at it from this died from the rear maybe even from certain angle and kind of see what they're going forward in the aggressiveness but no one that I Know I really think that it worked out well for them\nSo let's get past kind of what the front end looks like a let's go first under the hood ... what what kind of engine do we have what what are we work with in terms of power there\nYou've got a couple of options are the main option for most people are going to be a three hundred horse Howard of effects engine that actually feel really good in this car\nIs going to be made it with a pretty smooth automatic transmission but if you are the kind of person who wants to live the good you'll economy and you don't really care about having three hundred horse power you could step down to\nAbout a two hundred horsepower a hybrid version and that's going to get you around forty three forty four miles per gallon so if you're concerned with like a mood comfortable right go hybrid if you're looking for something more power\nOr for passing the effects is definitely a style it up and\nWhat about when you when you get inside of this the Avalon is is you know Toyotas luxury cars that they make how close does it get to their brand elections in terms of overall quality and in the comfort that you can get from this\nWilliam period actually my favorite part of the ... um it's actually in the limited trend where they've got really nice leather really nice details like stitching and stuff like that uh the interior of the other line in my opinion a is about as good as what you're getting a Lexus yeah\nSo it kind of makes it a little bit of a toss up between whether you want to pay more for the like this ticket lightly better than finish a or if you're really happy with what uh what what are you able to be called a very luxurious interior and you have a lot is that most of the building with that you can expect from Alexis or something comparable but for a little less money\nWhat stands out as far as bells and whistles is there anything in particular that stands out as far as uh the technology that's available in this car\nWell the I Belong to make the um play of the states and then we band or do your adaptive cruise control your lane keeping hearing is this your blinds monitoring all of that standard teachers for twenty ninth the model year so you don't have to pay extra\nTo get any of those things anymore whereas some of the competition you have to check on like a few thousand dollar a state he packaged to get something like that so out of the box you got pretty much everything that you could want as far as a driver aid and comfort technology for long highway cruises are slugging through traffic\nUm and the only thing that you really have to pay more or then would be nice or things like ... to be\nHere twenty what are we looking at in terms of cost on the novel on where do you start in how Hi can you end up\nDriving around thirty five for the based model which again they'll come with all of that safety technology and is still a really nice looking car on the inside at the very least\nA top of the longer in around forty three depending on whether you go to the stakes are high right there in about the same range they've done an interesting thing where they kind of sport there trends though that you can either go forty or you can go luxurious then at the end of the day you don't end up\nToo much more you just have to decide what are you want\nFor good Antwon we've got to run but thanks for joining us and we will catch up with you soon\nGrabbing\nThat his Antwon Goodwin from seeing that road show talking about the twenty Nineteen Toyota\nAvalon pay forty grand for one of the ugliest cars on the road that is just a ... ... am I wrong and all of that if it does not look good grill I I looked at it and I'm like a big mouth coming at you it just an hideous hideous yeah\nCan I offer my two cents on why they did it sure to stand out it's cheaper to build grilled than to build the do the bumper nor my\nI Wonder if it improves like the the weight of the car which helps gas mileage\nI bet it's stuff like that that actually poison as well because it does not look good I'll tell you that no it was like you said it looks like an open mouth ... the rest of it like the rest of the car actually looks pretty nice but you see the front of it and you're like\nWhat's going on there is part of the ... did the bumper fall off like what would happen to a tough sell that that's it's it's hideous I don't I don't think we're going to see a lot of these on the road you know and and you know the thing is people don't want to buy sedans and the first place no like sedan sales\nHave fallen a beat people want these SUVs these guys you know that either the full size midsize or you know if you have a family and you got a lot of kids you're buying one of those dance your your that that's what people are doing\nYou know the Avalon historically if you look at how many vehicles they ah still per year\nAh it doesn't look like it's done particularly well recently it's declined for about forty eight thousand twenty sixteen or it's going to end up being around thirty two thousand this year than actually twenty fourteen it'd been around sixty seven dollars you know not going to be many next year I'll tell you that they're they're struggling with the

crucial midterm elections just fourteen days away the president will campaign for Texas Senator Ted Cruz in Houston tonight\nThe Republican is in a reelection race against democratic congressman Beto O'Rourke\nAnd President Trump is blaming Democrats for the caravan of migrants who are heading towards the U.S Mexico border on Twitter this morning the president blame what he called pathetic immigration laws on the dams and said it was unfair to those who come to the country legally residents also called the situation a national emergency Anthony\nScaramucci is calling White House chief of staff John Kelly the wrong person for the job\nIs as a civilian base job and I think he's tried to apply military like management style took office civilians and so that doesn't necessarily work\nOn NBC's Meet the press the former White House communications director explain that Kelly is prone to his he fits in his hurt the morale of the plays Scaramucci founded reports from last week that Kelly was in a heated argument with national security adviser John Bolton\nShe went on to say in that event on friday that Ocasio Cortez it may seem like really big it may seem really ambitious it may seem really radical as we'd like to say\nBut the fact of the matter is we are dealing with a radical truth and they radical reality and the war we choose to ignore the worst were doing by our children our grandchildren and frankly ourselves\nThey'll let me just say very clearly we don't have a global warming problem caused by human beings only this woman would know that there has been a political sham created\nAnd it goes back to the early seventies maybe even the sixties\nAnd there was a guy appointed to basically be the guy to create the global warming problem they had a meeting in Colorado Springs in the early seventies and talked about global warming to try to create\nThe stability of certain individuals and groups in this country and around the world to control our resources\nWe don't have a global warming problem caused by people I've talked to scientists one after the other after the other\nAnd they don't get the press the New York times the Washington Post the networks\nThey don't want to even put on the air credible highly skilled highly trained highly qualified scientists who will tell you that the research shows that were not causing the problem\nThat carbon emissions get into the atmosphere over Ninety percent of them caused by natural elements natural resources not buy anything that we have done not by using oil that by using natural gas\nAnd the proof of it is and here's where the kicker comes in according to the June twenty eighth team be peace statistical review of global energy\nFollow this closely the United states led the world last year and twenty Seventeen in reducing carbon emissions across the board even though the president pulled us out of the Paris climate accord Z in twenty Seventeen that same year\nThe American Enterprise Institute as reporting if you want to use facts let's use facts and not this hyperbole of Ocasio Cortez see what she does is to use heroin hyperbole her own exaggeration or on false statements in order to justify her ideology\nIt doesn't matter what the facts are to the far left such as her what matters is let's just get our ideology out there even though the ideology flies in the face of the facts folks\nThe American Enterprise Institute has reported that our carbon emissions in the United states declined by more than forty two million tons and twenty seven team\nThat's way out of the next most environmentally friendly country which is the crane where missions declined by twenty million tons not think about that\nWe declined carbon emissions\nForty two million tons and twenty seven team the next best country is the crane which declined by twenty million times we are more than double their number in reduction of carbon emissions\nWe have Mexico the United kingdom in Japan with major declines in the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere which is a good thing\nAnd so here we go again with this poppy caulk and balls or dash from the far left about this allegation of causing global warming understand something this is all about Al Gore and his cronies\nThey get to make millions hundreds of millions and even billions if we go through the path of trying to stop a problem that doesn't exist which is of course human cause for global warming it doesn't exist\nThe United nations and it's sort of governmental panel on climate change\nHas come to the conclusion already they don't look at the science\nScientists will tell you that the way the UN as formulated it's models is dysfunctional the Senate governmental panel on climate change has\nNot had its models work because of the problem doesn't exist\nAnd the other thing is by the way we need carbon emissions what would happen to plants\nThe photosynthesis prospect the fact that they need to ingest carbon dioxide do the plants so do all those begins out there were they going to get their food if we eliminate carbon emissions are number to Boston is six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight\nI'm going to ask you a simple question\nDoes this kind of bologna coming from a custody of Cortez and her cronies on the left does this kind of misstatement misstatement effect\nFalse could cause you to be more energized to want to go out and vote and support Republicans in the upcoming election in two weeks\nI Would think that they should do that I Would think that combined with all of the radical mob violence and it is mob violence they are mobs on the left going after decent people elected officials when they go to restaurants at their homes wherever it may be\nThat that's the tactics they use you want to talk about the ... tactics who is using the Gestapo tactics\nIs still left they complain about what they call Nazis on the right what do they think they are what they look in the mirror and see the behavior they carry out and the kind of a behavior that is causing\nAbsolute irresponsible maybe criminal disruption to other people's lives six one seven to six six

John you're on the voice of Boston W. or kale hello\nI got about a minute go ahead\nAs far as warm and go to a big joke I did my undergrad senior thesis on the guy hypothesis when you're talking about earlier\nOf the world the self regulating editing right and I remember one case a credit score of ... do you think about things why not actually drop the temperature of the earth to degree\nAnd this was actually measured in a jar by around her all across the world there weren't title shifts and it was so much sucked into the atmosphere that you're actually dropped then rebounded self regulate [noise]\nIt's ridiculous this whole thing that we're actually terminated because when you look at the you know the hate or any matter the amount of\nMethane is fair and they also don't treatment or teach 'em the carbon cycle anymore\nYou know they don't and and and that's that's an issue there thank you for calling I appreciate it\nAnd I'm Glad to reinforce the point Mike Segal Jeff Cohen or more after new [noise]\nPresident Trump is ... candidates this week we'd afternoon I'm having a civil your view a news president\nTrump all the insects is tonight to bolster Sen Ted Cruz's campaign against Democrat Beto O'Rourke\nA busy week on the campaign trail for President Trump but just to go before the maternal apps and the president how the system has to life for a rally with his wife time Republican rival Sen Ted Cruz ABC's\nWouldn't that be great that'd be a bigger went for Trump than it was the first time in twenty twenty she cares about herself she has an ideology that she uses to build her career to build her success\nIt isn't about you it isn't about me it isn't about really caring about people\nThe illegal immigrants and and you know one thing that disqualifies ... immediately is when she was interviewed and asked about the death of the young lady in Iowa at the hands of an illegal alien\nAnd she brushed it aside she said I feel badly but the real problem is parents being separated from their children\nLadies and gentlemen let's be honest about it\nPeople who set were separated from their children and many of them weren't even the real parents they were just people who are hustling these kids into the country but those people leaving his parents were committing gross negligence and child abuse\nThey were committing a criminal act to try to enter this country illegally and they were using their kids at their side to help them do that\nSomebody told me how that's good parenting if you will nobody talked about that committing an illegal act to enter this country without authorization under title eight so\nThirteen twenty five of the u._s. code and using their kids as a cover to get them into the United states that's that's not what I call good parenting but\nElizabeth Warren was all angry because they were separated parents from child which had been done during the Obama administration as well\nAnd of course the court decision said well it can only be twenty days that you hold the child so therefore they had let the child than the parents go capture and release which is baloney\nSo my question to you given that and given all of what this woman stands for and why would you support Elizabeth Warren I'm going to give you every ... I wouldn't even interrupt all of you left wing wackos out there who do listen\nTo Jeff corner and won't admit it\nI'm Glad to give you the time to uninterrupted Lee state your case for support for Elizabeth Warren let's see how many people call a during this part of the program to answer that question if you want to oppose her and why you oppose her that's fine to\nLet's go to Kenny first of all Kenny around with Mike Segal for Jeff Cohen or the voice of Boston W.

I've done it hard working and I've lived in Massachusetts on my lungs but it's an embarrassment\nWell and and I've spent many years in the commonwealth of Massachusetts\nAnd I shake my head I don't understand that it's a very intelligent state\nMassive numbers of you and maybe the problem is the university system because as we know the universities are pretty much left wing and they indoctrinate kids with a left wing ideology and they go out and be adults and just follow that ideology and I appreciate the call and you did a great job thank you but to\nSuggest that because I get more money\nFrom Democrats and that's the reason I vote for the title do that but talk about self serving and narrow in terms of interest if you get more money means other state workers are getting more money where's the money going to come from at some point\nYou're going to drive people out of the states who owned businesses 'cause they won't be able to afford to stay in the state because of the high cost of this they Eli an holliston hello Eli you're on the voice of Boston W. R. K. oh\nHey Mike and the reason I'm from my colors um you know I Will get to the bathroom state but question three is way more than desk about\nBathrooms okay it's about me being able to go to a restaurant\nBeing able to go to a museum being able to sort of the pack and not certainly come up to me and say hey I don't like how you look I don't like how you sound get out of here that is legal that is why in two thousand sixteen to government said that's not right\nOf a restaurant simply because they're transgender that's an easy lawsuit to win the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause applies the first ten amendments of the constitution the bill of rights to the states\nSo the states are required to follow those first ten amendments an equal protection clause applies to the states therefore uh that's on equal protection so that's an easy one but that's different than a male going into a female bathroom Kenny in West and you're on the voice of Boston W ... hello\nI'm Mike Mike a good a good show or you know I saw an opening their I mean Elizabeth on gay Geoff Diehl of the opening she want to get like my truck when she kept hanging up Trump Trump Trump Trump I Would have said well just like when Trump said during the debate was telling me\nThe reason she said that Bill Clinton and he says the reason why you know like Clinton because he also by the un Obama so just should have said well listen says Donald Trump don't get mad at me hey listen he's the one that exposed you and told you should be apologizing he's kind of kind of site\nAnd that kind of level he doesn't I don't think he has a denim a little\nBit well you know it's such a fortunate because here's the point to me if if I were running against Elizabeth Warren and she starts bringing up Donald Trump\nI'll say I I Would answer and I'd ask her directly and I'd have the moderator allow me to ask the questions or senator you disagree with the lowest unemployment rate in history for African Americans\nDo you disagree with the lowest unemployment rate in history for Hispanics you disagree with the lowest unemployment rate for women in history the ... disagree with the fact that we have better employment now that we than we've ever had since Nineteen sixty nine\nI go through all of that do you disagree with the fact that we're now energy independent thanks to the fact that the president or remove the restrictions on the Dakota access pipeline on the excel pipeline a on Anwar now being open for a go exploring for oil you disagree with all of that\nLight and right right right I mean I I Would just I I Would just ask her how could you say no but I'm Still getting out of the trade agreements even Bernie agrees with Trump on the trade agreements\nEnding that because it just limiting the United states and hurting our our workers they disagree with four hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs in this country said as president took office they disagree with three or a million new jobs overall just the president took office they disagree with the fact\nThat we have over a four percent gross domestic product increase\nWhen Iraq Obama in eight years never had one year of even three percent gross domestic product increased never one full year of that you have some quarters but never a full year he's the only president in history that never had a three percent gross domestic product increase for a year\nWhat do you think of that senator you have a say so what country what about that\nWell it also might but then the second part of that too I Would have said are useful sanctuary cities are you on board is just like Donald Trump was on the campaign so the Democrats\nThey want you know it illegal crossing so he should have had it on on both sides you know what I mean to come by but ah I don't think he has to kind of a fight on that kind of level of like that now he doesn't and she goes back and says so disgusting it was\nWell he he anybody running against there has to be tough enough to take her on right on the issues you can't worry about the fact that she's a woman you respect there is a woman you respect there was a senator but you know I've always thought even and talk radio\nThe way the process should be for a host is that you don't talk you don't demean the person well you do is attack the issue\nThat's precisely right exactly\nAnd that's what she that's what he should have done and done it in the thing is I Can't talk\nOn that right she was talking on Donald Trump and it was like wait a minute\nWhy just gave me the answer about Donald Trump if she wants to see the gate and if she wants to denigrate Trump give 'em all they give her all the facts because the media will cover it\nThey don't want to cover all the good news if if Obama had done the good things Donald Trump has done or they would have been celebrating all over Obama but he did nothing he got done in the domestic or foreign policy\nThat's for sure like actually can be very much good to talk to you\nBob and middle bar you're on the voice of Boston W. R. K. O. hello\nHey Mike I don't listen to\nThe things I've been a member of\nThe killing in Boston for thirty seven years when Obama was running the two times they each union union heads called me up please vote for a bomb ISIS into something if people are wacky I I don't want to tell you what I told them but I wouldn't vote for Democrat now I've always been\nEither way I can vote for them in the party\nThat was years ago but today I tell everybody I talked to and I keep up with politics I tell everybody I talked to if the man got an hour beside his name be smart and vote for him don't vote for ... days because they're out to destroy us I don't know if it's because of a\nJudge sorrows paying people off of whatever it might be but we're in deep trouble and I wouldn't vote for all is with no way no how\nBy the way why don't the Democrats condemned George Soros the way they condemn the Koch brothers George ... and even worse George Soros was a Nazi sympathizer in World War two was a teenager\nAnd he's never rejected that in fact he's anti Israel and these Jewish born Jewish\nHe's anti Israel or he wants to on he wants to undermine this country they don't want this country to succeed sir they want us to fail so they could control everybody in the country and have this elite group that runs things and he wants to be part of that that's what it's about\nLook I'll tell you what if all that junk that we're going through now and we got the problems really deep and quick sense if you put all the problems in a fun all the first one would pop up would be George Soros he's the leader along with the Clinton was in the\nFellow season all the rest of it but we've got some problems but I Try to tell anybody ... up don't listen to the the fake news like Trump says vote for the car and as far as one two and three I'm voting no yes and no\nPresent it and I thank you very much for calling sir good to talk to you Scott and New Hampshire you're on the voice of Boston W. or kale hello Scott\n[noise] so um can you hear me okay I sure can yeah\nSo I've been in the union to Thirteen Years and I'm the same way I used to getting a lot of arguments before Donald Trump was president\nAnd believe me I talked to a lot of union workers a lot of uh would never vote for somebody like Elizabeth Warren they know her socialist scheme it we're going to house search so overrun by different migrants and if what the Democrats get in there and take over the house like Hillary Clinton says those countries over\nWe're not going to have union where they're going to be non union union everybody mixed\nWith the economy to it right now with Donald Trump\nEverybody's working so don't you get that it's not just shooting in on you and you know you hear all the the L O nine you shouldn't be working for failing wage and this and that will catch what they're solace or and gets in and Hillary and everything that Democrats want a bunch of babies are going to be\nThere's going to do nothing for us it's going to be older run this country is going to go down\nWhich I Do is to see what they want us power\nRight power they want to control the American people that's why Hillary wanted a universal healthcare in Nineteen Ninety three she fought for it\nAnd got beaten and what she wanted was about Eighteen percent of our gross domestic product is in the healthcare field she wanted the government to have control of that entire field and by the way I can assure you should if she has the opportunity you can go to the bank on this she's running again for president\nYup and look at look at how the economy is now you tell me Obama had eight years to do nothing and he did nothing\nPre shape at all and I thank you very much many good that Scott good to talk to you let's go

don't know what she taught me to be quite honest I I see no results\nBenefit me from Elizabeth Smart and yet I see plenty of results from Donald Trump and the thing that got me was when he gave everybody that that tax breaks that I saw a little increase in my paying us jeez you know this was this is tangible this is something I put my hands on literal\nAnd one of one of the lovely governor to attend an eight hundred million dollar a payroll tax to pay for\nPain for vacations as far as I'm concerned that ballet or a\nState workers I couldn't believe that the minute we get a little bit and take it right away and it's just it's unconscionable if they do here and I\nMean he was an ... what are their head below sea and she's in there because she doesn't even know the issues what an airhead Pelosi say she's she's going to get rid of the crumbs and increased taxes if she gets in the speaker that's\nExactly this is this is what will face that if people can't see through this charade I I mean what are we really dealing with a guy that called in a union guy that says I'm going to vote Democrat 'cause\nI've been in the state like I said I was born and raised in everybody's been a Democrat every because the Democrats at one time really gave a hell of a gave him you know what I mean the gang of care about the working person they don't care about the working person any more than ... that's what the working man was for the Democrats equipped\nRight on that note I was going to close it out coming up to two o'clock in the voice of Boston W ...\nI think he's just he's tried to do it in such a way that he looks professional well he hasn't seen in motion\nAnd and you know what's going to happen to the question is how do you win not out of your work but how do you win and and but I don't think anything's going to do it either well the Trump proved do you do I mean Trump called names of his opponents I'm not saying they all should do that by that I found out beyond just that you're not Trump\nSo there is not Trump or his Trump he can't act like ... or ...\nI think that ... you're not hearing the I'm saying he needs to be more aggressive he doesn't have to be Trump and he has to go after her weaknesses in a very forceful way on the issues and they should do with the same way with a she's a woman or a man that should make no difference because you're going after her on issues not on her gender and he had been in the\nSame breath think about her followers if he's trying to take her followers he can't exactly you know try to act like somebody who's going against a woman\nWill get you know what is the first thing is that you can take that position and I respect that but he's going to lose the way you're describing is going to lose or you can go to the bank is going to lose\nI can drive through any street right now and find most science and I find warrants that they'll get that\nI've seen one well and I am everywhere and that's what I Do for a living I\nListen I'm saying this a ... with much chagrin I don't like saying it but she's she's breeding them\nAnd in in in order for somebody who's being beaten badly too when they have to create the impression that that person who people are voting for um it's not right to be the United states senator for Massachusetts and and look who was the last Republican to be in the United States Senate\nThat what Scott Brown but I mean in the same breath I mean it\nWas he got there because of the Obamacare vote before him yet Ed Brooke\nWas a moderate Republican I'm you know ... has the\nHammer down on the issue at least if the illegal immigration especially with this caravan that's coming at us I mean this is insane\nWell they set it up so early on that I agree with\nYou know he's he's got to go into this stuff listen I Want him to win that's why I'm saying this stuff I I have a certain view of how we can win and they can't win by being polite and reserved unrestrained he can't win that way just my view\nI don't think I think it's just a matter of he again he wants to look like he's for the issues I mean that was why he dismissed the Indian\nPoint out that she's not for the issues that she doesn't give a damn about this country's border that she doesn't care that we have no say auntie that she wants to lead overhead April and then and then when she said ... when she had the audacity to get on a network show\nAnd ... and when when uh the above the young lady from Iowa was brought pivots\nAnd ah she said she felt sorry for the family but the big problem is the parents being separate from the children at the border are you kidding me she wants all these people coming in so their democratic votes that's what you got a hammer on\nIt's not going to say things in my life as saying that if you're like this woman you're not going to get the wall\nRight my thing is though I was an independent\nAnd and that's and I went to jail because the fact that I did see something in the emergency honesty I saw integrity I saw somebody who's going to do what I asked him to do and he continuously says that whereas she's just not she's gross\nAnd three on it as a woman looking at her as a woman it makes me sick that she's part of my gender she ... she says always alone makes me cringe I Want to throw up\nI ... that you know I agree with the illicit we agree I'm we just disagree on how we should go about running his campaign that's all for the call and I thank you very much for calling to say there we go to buy buy we go to Tom in New Jersey Tom you're on the

that's how he made a billions now he's put Eighteen billion and to his open societies foundation\nAnd the guy is a neo Nazi and I don't say that lightly he was up advisor of the Nazis in World War two let me just say okay somebody who doesn't know it he he was a teenager and his father paid off a high ranking official in the Nazi military to pretend to be was Georgia's grandfather\nAnd what happened was this Nazi would go around taking property from Jewish people Soros happened to be a Jew\nAnd he was pretending to be a non Jew he'd go with this official while the guy was taking property from Jewish people less Soros was and source went right along with it\nAnd went stiff Croft sixty minutes interviewed and you can go on YouTube and watched the interview you don't have to believe me you watch towards ... that was a great time of my life I have no apology to make because somebody else only done it a fight in\nSomalia so don't tell me about George Soros I'm ... and Tim Kaine from Virginia is buddies were the son of anti\nLike\nNobody's houses ... that he's here he's got a Nazi mentality this guy\nLike what my main point was he made a comment maybe he can get a tape he said

evening pope says I Want to blow up the White House you know we basically she got ignored\nBut this this came up the ladder piece George Soros makes a comment like that against our president I Would detach some peace in CIA guys and and we talk about the phony Russian collusion I thought the collusion between the Democrat\nParty and their daddy George Soros how about that like\nI think you know what I'll say two things one is there was Russian collusion with the ... with somebody named Hillary Clinton that's the gas thing clearly unquestionably beyond a reasonable doubt she colluded with Russia by paying off\nA fusion GPS who paid off Christopher Steele paid off the Russian sources to get the phony dicey so let's go let's put that to rest and she also gave uranium one twenty percent of American uh your uranium or of which was bizarre she proceeded proved it is the bottom line\nUm uh but the the Democrat connection to ... and they don't want to condemn him because he simply has the money source for the Democrats but at what point do you give up taking money from my uh hey he's not just a partisan\nHe's a despicable he's able this guy is pure evil\nYour exercise scalp or should he's the he's the human body amount of the devil that's George Soros people better understand that he is a disgrace to humanity\n... and he's the worst absolute worst 'cause he ... it would be
