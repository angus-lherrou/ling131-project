{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Yeah definitely I think that has been a smart move you've seen other big beer companies most notably a ab ... making a significant investment in colder you walk rafters Mike rivers are\nBut uh I think in the case of a constellation it you know adding the craft element\nTo the corona del aligned which are brands that actually are still growing in a in the U. S. wild I think there's been a lot of talk about a\nBacklash to big beer where there's been some sluggish sales of some of the more well known not most recognizable for has like a like an adviser and die and Coors Light that hasn't really been something that hurting or corona at all\n[noise] very good poll we'll let you go will catch up with the next week and joined the weekend thank you very much you to\nPaula Monica from CNN a scene in business the brand new name by the way check out the website this morning actually pretty good they got some good stuff on their whole Monica from CNN Business talking about constellation brands are and where they go from here let's talk about where\nIranian oil is potentially going from here or Europe and this is a story out of the New York times Europe apparently is working to try to figure out a way to actually of vague these new sanctions that the U.S is going to be putting back on Iran in the near future ... what do you make of this Mike\nI'm what I make of it is the Europeans are desperate to keep this deal that they fought foreign place um but it's likely not going to work so what they're trying to tell them that\nIt's very very difficult to move money between countries without a bank involved mhm it's incredibly difficult if you're subject to\nYou know massive or risk by not using a world wide bank and uh if they do use worldwide back then the U.S is going to hit that bank was sanctions\nI think you also have a tough time convincing big companies to go do any business in Iran right now\nLike ... for instance French oil company had a bunch of plans to do invest in Iran us sanctions flip back and they said yeah you know what I Know this isn't a French law\nBut if we do this we're not going to do any business in the United states that and we're going to get crushed and so it makes no sense so I think any large company is going to shy away from doing any business with Iran so long as you've sent us sanctions are in place\nI think what we're seeing right here is the tip of the iceberg as far as\nUh the push for a number of countries to move away from the U.S dollar we've seen obviously China Russia and Iran are talking about doing so and I think the fact that Europe is sitting here saying the most important thing to us is being able to get you know our energy needs filled rather than where that comes from\nAnd I think that's the message that they are largely sending here now as you said it remains to be seen whether or not they actually go through with this but the fact that the discussions are taking place signals to me hey look they're willing to at least consider a world where they don't necessarily use the dollar as the primary means of conducting\nInternational ... that would be very concerning the Europeans teamed up with say China to allow the Chinese currency to be the one traded in Iran or forward you know for the barrels of oil that are moving in and out of that country that would be\nA a an important first step it wouldn't be significant to the impact of the dollar but it'd be an important symbolic first step\nThis is something again I've been harping on this for the last year so\nThis is something pay attention to this\nBecause what this means when it's all said and done the reason why the U.S is able to finance the deficits are the reason why the U.S has been able to finance its growing deficits over the last thirty to forty years isn't because us citizens went and started buying up more U.S debt yeah it's because internationally Europe China\nIndia all those other countries said yeah this makes sense will continue buying this up in in funding your deficits\nAs of the last three years that's effectively stop they're not buying any more on a net basis right and so if you see a further push away from the dollar what that potentially means\nIs that it becomes incumbent on us to finance our deficit internally which we've never really wanted to do we've never really had a huge appetite for it because quite frankly like it did not get to do that like is it crowds out other spending another\nUh other winning that you would potentially be doing so\nThis is something to watch okay not so much because of what it means in this specific instance but because of what it could potentially signal as a big shift over the next several years years to keep the story in mind uh Mike you've got\nThree young daughters now sure do two of them just north of two years old\nAnd we've got senators now calling for a federal investigation of children's apps as to whether or not or these apps are misleading by misleading parents by labeling the apps child friendly your thoughts on this because you know way more about this than I\nDo I mean the basic story here is that there's a bunch of free apps both in the Android Amazon and apple stores that are collecting way too much information on children and while that may be okay for an Eighteen year old\nNothing should be collecting a you know location data phone numbers or or email addresses\nFour or five and six year olds that that's to me a very clear red line that shouldn't be crossed and uh it sounds like there may be existing laws on the books here that are being broken and it may seem like there needs to be new laws put into place but\nSpecifically location data on children is not something that I feel should be shared\nA little creepy right yeah and buy a little creepy I mean incredibly creepy\nNow that said shame on parents who are allowing that to happen\n[noise] agreed I can agree with that\nThat ... do your research on what you're letting your kids do and how you're letting them do it but in this day and age the the companies or at least somewhat responsible for that action\nAs well for the top of the hour no quick look at market Dow off two hundred and forty seven points continuing yesterday's fell off a as race continues to rise sep in NASDAQ negative territory

debate all the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nOn this vote the yeas are fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nAnd a final vote on the confirmation is expected to happen tomorrow or Sunday and among the senator's voting in favor of venting debate today Maine Republican Susan Collins shoes that the swing vote it's still unclear though how she'll decide in the final confirmation challenge I Will\nAnd outside was an army of protesters many of them I'm looking at the signs right in front of me\nOr ask Kevin Oh\nWow that's really eloquent that's it's a young woman maybe Eighteen Nineteen tops just simply asked I can see the word on the air F Kavanaugh unfit to serve\nNo more rapists in government so he's a rapist now so he's already been convicted\nBy like a ... like that raging mob they just convicted of\nA others we believe survivors um hashtags cancel Kavanaugh and toxic masculinity a with a picture of Trump and a picture of Kavanaugh both of them calling and snarling\nOr there were many signs impeach and imprisoned Kavanaugh impeach and then President Trump\nNow we know for a fact that the there were four organizations that were sponsored\nAnd pushing the protests and it's the same for organizations again and again and again number one is the George Soros funded move on dot org\nDishes all Soros money many of these people work for Soros organizations so they're almost as part of their job they're paid\nMany of them are paid eighty Ninety a hundred some of them a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year and that's their job is to go in there you know people say don't these people have a job I mean I'm working all day you're working all day who's got the time to occupy Senate office buildings well they're paid\nSo one of them is the George Soros fun did move on dot org which by the way is now calling for tomorrow for essentially a riot if Kavanaugh is confirmed so we're going to see what's going to happen tomorrow the women's march\nWhich is co founded by the vicious anti Semite a pro Hamas and Israel Linda star store\nSo now you've got basically Islam is being involved in these protests are Planned Parenthood of course and black lives matter\nMove on dot org women's march Planned Parenthood black lives matter\nAnd yesterday I mean they were in a fury and their goal to intimidate to bully to almost black male to frighten senators into voting no or else we're going to burn Capitol Hill down\nRoll cut one written\n[laughter]\n\nThey'd went on and on and on it's going to continue today in fact is going to be even more people now they're talking maybe tens of thousands or who knows how many are going to show up tomorrow and I played this yesterday but you need to know what's going on you need to know what your senator is doing\nLeading the charge in fact openly inciting them was none other than chief spreading bowl liar walther herself Senator Elizabeth Warren real cuts to Britain\n[laughter]\n\nThing to do that\nAnd I believe\nOne day and now\nWe know what's in\nWhite\nWhen he was how\nIt is where an angry\nAnd angry when I sit down and shut out one time\nAfter that they just poured into the Senate Hart office building into the Dirksen office building they began chanting yelling screaming uh they went literally they took the occupied the whole thing that went on to the atrium they went to the first floor second floor third floor fourth floor\nUh they went into a committee hearings intelligence committee hearings they interrupted these hearings\nOr many of them had to be dragged out over three hundred were arrested\nAnd then they began to confront senators\nListen now to Senator Marco Rubio trying to give an interview with a reporter who's asking him why are you voting for Kavanaugh they began to shout him down the mob surrounded him basically not allowing them to even give an answer roll it Brittany\nWe have when you're going to work out that way you know these are all different\nAnd uh and he does is it needs to be\nAnd they're just uh they just wouldn't let him finish they just wouldn't let him finish and then they went after Orrin Hatch roll it Britain\nCan't\nWe may\nUh and and if you missed it or what he said to them as they were preventing they were struck them from moving you couldn't walk you couldn't move and he basically said you need to grow up and they went crazy when he told them to grow up\nBut he's completely right this is the equivalent of a temper tantrum ... I'm\nBeing honest with you this vehicle my evil who's six wouldn't be have like this and did you when you said you grow up like look I got places to go things to do grow up\nNow you may have the right to protest yes but you don't have the right to obstruct you don't have the right to harass you don't have the right to occupy a Senate\nOffice building you don't have the right to confront senators and and kicking their doors or prevent them from being able to go and do you know go to intelligence briefings ... votes in other words to function so our democracy can continue you don't have the right to do that\n\nWhat you are now witnessing is mob rule and that's another reason why cabin on needs to be confirmed a lot more don't touch that dial do ratings already\nWomen in Boston have a new\nBudget falls\nIn ...

you\nKnow I I was calling to comment on\nOur [noise] so ... so [noise]\nOkay oh yeah my friend\nAnd I got to tell you it could not be any closer it is now\nOn a razors edge here is now the\nLatest so Lisa Murkowski voted no on the cloture vote she now is officially come out and said she will be a you know for tomorrow's final a confirmation vote this to me and I'll come out and say he's a yeah\nSo what you need is fifty votes and many times can be the tide breaker Collins is gonna want an ounce or official decision today at three o'clock\nHere are there's only two possible scenarios now\nI think if Collins is they yes\nThat means then there will be fifty votes for Kavanaugh\nI then believe that Joe mansion to try to make sure that he wins reelection in West Virginia because West Virginia is Trump country and they love Kavanaugh then mansion will probably say look\nIf he's gonna do it if he's going to become confirmed then I'm not going down with the ship\nI'm just I Want to vote yes I'm going to vote yes so I win re election in November it's going to be fifty one forty nine however however\nIf Susan Collins votes no we're says she's going to vote no\nThat means you've got fourteen nine Republicans yes mansion would have to be the fiftieth vote\nMaking a pie and then of course parents would come in that's the rules he's the head of the Senate the vice president is and he would be the tie breaker so that would mean that mansion would be the one that would put cabin all over the top\nHe's not going to do that\nHe I I I don't see how honestly I I don't see him doing that he would become a pariah within the Democratic party I Know you will even if you vote yes but if he's the guy that goes from forty nine to fifty\nAnd makes the fiftieth voted high vote but then sets it up for parents to break the tie the Democrats will never forgive him\nHe'll never get a bridge she'll never get an airport he'll never get funding he will be completely marginalized in isolated in his own party\nI mean he might as well be dead men walking so I don't see him doing that he doesn't strike me as a profile in courage\nShow what that means is essentially now everything rides on calling ... now what the Democrats now I gotta say this they have played this beautifully to give the devil there do they his do her due to give the devil his do\nThey play this beautifully they waited they had the allegations they sprung it at ... at the eleventh hour day dragged it out they coached or they had Christine for talk like a Fifteen year old they got the immense power of the

consuming to open these small and oh security ...\nAnd you have to go into the branch got signed paperwork and they're small dollars and they turn\nAnd it took me to complaints in Massachusetts really tough for landlords and security deposit account you have to give till ten in certain forms when they open up the account and you have to pay interest ... and you can do all this now through Z deposit all that you can do Thursday deposit it literally takes about forty seconds open up an account\nWe handled the automatic forms that are generated with the account number department condition statement all that send to the tenant\nAnd interest is sent to the tenant automatically every year\nThis sounds like something that's going to be very valuable to large landlords that might have two hundred tenants and small landlords that might only have five tennis\nYeah absolutely with a large landlords it's just a lot of hassle to manage this so we make that very efficient for the small landlords a lot of them are afraid of not getting the complaints done correctly so that some of them some of them don't even like taking security deposit to we're hopeful that this will help them do that\nFolks

she will announce at three o'clock today so let me ask you this what do you think will happen\n'cause it now looks increasingly likely that if Kavanaugh is confirmed it will be on a razors edge the narrowest of majorities fifty fifty die and then with Mike Pence being the tie breaker\nIn other words if Trump's guy\nJust on the left is going to look at it if Trump's guy is the decisive vote that pulls Kevin outputs Kevin all over the top is this not gonna unleash even more rage and more fury\nAmong the left and do we now see maybe the real possibility of violence tomorrow on Capitol Hill in Washington DC and around the country if it's fifty fifty\nAnd pants happens to be the tie breaking vote what will happen six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight Arthur in Rockland Europe next going ahead Arthur\nHello Arthur did we lose Arthur okay let's go to Johnny in Seattle [noise] doctor could or are you I'm good how are you Johnny\nGood good good the first of all I Want to say that

for that I really appreciate it Johnny what's on your mind my friend you got the floor God\nI Believe I Believe if judge\nKavanaugh if he doesn't get confirmed as well get mayor your diet the lab do crazy they're out of their lives okay I'm a first generation immigrants I grew up in South Korea live is so thirty seven miles south of the the\nOkay even a little kid you know we we know what danger is we know what the lab could do okay so so he's he's people on the left me in the United states they don't really know what terror and he is okay we live\nYou know we live in South Korea it was it was a real bad time\nAnd I'm I'm just I'm just letting you know they don't ... see they don't even know what they're thinking they don't even understand what they really believe okay and they're out of control I think that's going to be a riot\nAnd or the rights we must quite we must be more the more aggressive in the civilized way of course but we need to let them do what we believe always stand for\nJohnny you're clearly right Johnny and thank you very much for that call Johnny or look you're completely right look I'm not saying it will happen I don't have a crystal ball but I Do think now the possibility is very likely that if Kavanaugh is confirmed\nEspecially the way now it's starting to break down on the vote it's gonna be likely I might look\nIt could be mentioned goes yes ... goes yes it's fifty one forty nine and you don't need my parents to be the tie breaking vote okay so we could happen but the way things are starting to look now that it could very likely be fifty fifty\nThink about it and then Trump's guy the vice president is the one basically on behalf of Trump who puts Kevin all over the top the left is going to they're going to go berserk not [noise]\nSo if they're already occupying Senate office buildings now and threatening senators now what the hell are they going to do tomorrow [noise]\nSix one seven I'm just stating the obvious six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight okay\nDecision by decision and by the way she list what they are [noise]\nShe's going to or whatever or abortion rights gay rights civil rights blocks are going to be back it's going to be Jim Crow it's gonna be segregation he's going to take away voting rights from blacks are women are going to be doing back alley abortions this issue here fear mongering hysteria and open\nIncitement she's a she's a demagogue disgusting reckless\nIrresponsible demagogue and she's telling the mob keep going keep going he's got a target on you he's going to take all of you out she's almost making it seem\nThat if Kavanaugh is confirmed she's going right up to the edge she's hinting at it she's implying it without actually saying it\nHe's going to let rapist out men are just going to be running around raping women all across the country\n\nWhat she's doing now is pouring gasoline on the fire and she's basically saying if this guy's confirmed burn this beat\nDown now on top of that\nAnother breaking story that you need to be aware of to show you how the left is playing this how dirty they are how corrupt they are I mean this is really third world banana republic stuff this is the revolutionary street left\nThis is not the left of the Democratic party of FDR or ... or JFK we've gone way to the far extreme left this issue go ... this this Fidel Castro\nThis this shake of era okay now listen to this so again\nTip to the ... or ... pundits joined with the guts to start printing real stories another hot tip to the gateway\nIt but the real ones that drove this story was the wall Street Journal and I want to give the wall Street Journal a big hot tip they have a story\nIn today's Wall Street journal confirmed by the gateway pond it\nRemember Leland Kaiser she was her best friend at the time still a friend or though they're no longer friends where she said you know where she was cited as a witness and she said I never knew Brett Kavanaugh there was no such party I never met him at a party I have no idea what with Christine Ford is talking about\nWell now she has told the wall Street Journal and her family is corroborating her story saying we saw this week over the conversations\nWere member of the ex boyfriend to Christine Blasey Ford said in a letter that he wrote the Chuck Grassley under the penalty of perjury that he personally witnessed Christine Ford\nCoach\nA friend of hers want it to beat a polygraph test because she was applying for a job at the FBI well that the woman the FBI she's no longer an FBI agent but she was for many years\nHer name is Monica McLean her McLean Monica McLean well apparently Monica McLean called\nReal in Kaiser in fact colder and even texted her we know how to text messages where she was telling legal in Kaiser on behalf of Christine Ford no you got to say the party happened\nYou've got to change your story how can you do this to Christine Leland ... basically saying why\nLee Lynn you've got to change your story it doesn't look good for Christine your refudiate in your repudiating her you're feeling or allegations no you need to say you\nListen to me you need to say or if you know what's good for you that's what she said if you know what's good for you\nLeland you need to change your statement to say that you were at the party and you saw Brett Kavanaugh they're\nSo now she's they're using a former FBI agent a former member of the deep state\nMonica McLean and remember it all comes together now Michael Brown which who is one of Ford's lawyer's he's the lawyer for Andy McCabe the former FBI deputy director\nAnd brown which is close with James Comey the former FBI Director so now they've gotten a former FBI agent Monica McClain a former friend or sorry occurring friend of Christine forward to go after legal in Kaiser\nAnd say you need to change what you have told the Senate Judiciary committee you're killing Christine Ford by refugee and repudiating her allegations\nSo you got the deep state and Democrats openly putting pressure on a witness to change her sworn testimony\nUnder oath she by the way she signed it three times under oath I never saw Brett Kavanaugh I don't know Brett Kavanaugh there was never a party at the house I don't know what she's talking about\nNow they're going ... dishes witness tampering\nNow they're trying to intimidate and bully witnesses to change their story\n\nI mean this this gets worse and worse and worse by the second\nNow what is remarkable to me is that Lisa Murkowski would be a no\nAnd Susan Collins up till now and mentioned are still undecided in the wake of the overwhelming evidence that Christine forward story has completely collapsed it is a pack of lives don't even take my word for it\nListen now to Victor Davis Hanson\nRespected professor writer he's a columnist contributor at National Review say who can possibly ... believe anything that Christine Ford says it's all full of holes and lies role cut for\nRich she gave it sad because she gave one too many narrative she gave a narrative to their therapist she gave a narrative to Dianne Feinstein she gave a narrative for the

F. apparently\nDuring our school hours when he wasn't at school was a local lifeguard and one of the girls are in collusion with another one accused him of having sexually assaulted her\nAt the beach and her friend said yeah yeah yeah yeah I saw it and so T F was arrested\n\nT. F. was expelled from school but he was expelled from being a lifeguard he could no longer play on the teams Basque basketball team because it represents Seneca valley but that wasn't enough\nSo a group of ... the same group said we're going to do a follow up charge against him and another one claiming called the police claiming that he had tried to enter her house with her parents and then when he did and to her house he sexually assaulted her\nAs she claims that they were two of her other friends there I guess the girls party or whatever you call it a sleep over and that they witness Tim sexually assaulted her\nAnd so then they went and arrested PF again and this time they dragged him out in shackles\nIn handcuffs he actually had\nTo spend nine days in juvenile court sorry in juvenile jail my dad he was in ... he was sentenced to nine days detention he went through juvenile court his name was dragged through the mud he lost everything he lost his
