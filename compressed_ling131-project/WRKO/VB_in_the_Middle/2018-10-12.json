P. Morgan we had a whole bunch of banks that came out uh with earnings this morning J. P. Morgan being one of them open in positive territory rolling over a little bit here right now I'm curious what your thoughts are on them and general before we get specifically to earnings\nYeah I mean I think the numbers were a pretty solid or you know but they've had a history of beating\nA earnings usually by pretty wide amount so I think maybe a you know this was kind of expected and you're just getting a bit of a a pull back or you know because they didn't beat by maybe a larger amount that mean when you look at or near Wells Fargo which is actually still up on their earnings which weren't nearly an impressive I I think it was just a bar with someone\nWith a lot of banks the conventional wisdom is when interest rates are moving up\nBanks are typically going to do well in this case J. P. Morgan open the year hundred and Seventy dollars a share right now a hundred and seven dollars a share even though the ten year treasury has gone from two for up to almost three two I'm curious your thoughts as to why we haven't seen much movement in this chair stock price as well as other banks is well\nNo it's a great question I mean I think that there might be some\nConcerns about the negative effect the rising rate obviously a\nYou know it does make a loan or more profitable a increases margins but you do also have the demand side of the equation they now have a mortgage rate third year fix that you know averaging around five percent or so\nThat might make it more difficult for people to get financing could the a a further slow down in the housing market we've already had a couple of a location where\nPrices are starting to uh to slow or you know the the rate of the increase is blowing in some cases where prices are even going down I think you know that could be a potential problem for any bank with a mortgage business large there\nFor the last five years we've seen a rise in a large number of fit in tech companies coming in and trying to under cut the pricing structure of the legacy companies like a J. P. Morgan it could be the robo advisers on that side of things that could be companies like Ben Moon pay pal on the payment side\nWhat is J. P. Morgan Chase doing in order to kind of combat those types of companies and do they need to be doing more at this point\nYeah I think that is a good question I mean you do have a chicken or game with it that that fire or you know credit card I think that something where they're trying to offer more benefit and perks to maybe get people to stay with traditional banks\nThe posed to an online institution or a mobile apps are I think that's something that all the big banks are really looking at more closely\nIs there any one in particular when you when you look at J. P. Morgan is there any company that potentially looks like an acquisition candidate for them either smaller regional banks or any kind of tech company to maybe get into that space it a little bit more heavily\nPossibly on the tax code I wouldn't rule out a deal there\nI'd be very surprised if shaping Morgan where to try and increase the\nBacking footprint with a regional thing we have an ad\nFor me [laughter] we haven't had a lot of banking ill lately a and I don't think that uh you know many of the big banks are\nLooking to expand their deposits that dramatically especially when you've got it back then there are already so large that uh you know I think that you start running into cap when it starts with the Federal Reserve they were doing a significant feel\nVery good Paul we got to let you go but thanks for the time and will catch up with the next week they do polling Monica from CNN Business talking about G. P. Morgan Chase\nSome continued news on the on the Sears front or as the years apparently\nA is trying to go through restructuring but a lot of its lenders trying to make a push for a liquidation we got an update just a little while ago that it looks like spheres has received\nA let's see what this is fear looks like they've received the ability or I don't know exactly what but it looks like they have the ability to stay afloat through the Christmas season right now I'm not sure if it really matters\nI mean it's probably a good thing for their lenders ... their lenders are probably just trying to really push them to get one more holiday shopping season and then just close the doors January to just try to get rid of it as much as ... as much regulatory out of there you know get a little bit more revenue and then take your you know twenty cents on the dollar that you can end up with as a bond holder here\nIt it does look like there are some pretty good deals right now like I'm I'm at ... dot com forty percent off appliances or you can also have warranty is not worth much [laughter] no [laughter] no you certainly can't\nUh you can't get much for that your TVs are pretty good deal or no I mean they're cheap and general right now do we see if they have anything that looks good out there on the TV\nSaw his voice all black friday I mean the problem there's just me no inventory like no one's selling in Detroit a series right now\nNo I mean if you're a supplier you're not going to toss a bunch of stuff and I see her store because you're just not you don't get paid for\nIt yeah you you have to figure there's just not much going on on that side of\nThings quickly get markets briefly all major in these still and positive territory but given away some of those gains as we'll just see if there's mark can bounce back from two week days so it's Henri out for the day and so it's friday so I guess enjoy the weekend and we will see you next week\n[laughter] [noise]\nThe proceeding program has been a paint commercial program does your plan for retirement and corporate tax efficient strategy because we think it should ... certified\nFinancial planner and cofounder of S.

I\nI don't want to say it's worse than Kavanaugh because what they did the cap and I was really bad but notice what they are now doing so Kavanaugh was a drunk and a rapist this guy now is a race traitor and ah\nAh as I put it in my column a mentally defective illiterate according to the liberal left\nShe's crazy she's not his right mind he needs to be hospitalized they got to put a straight jacket on him we do\nHe's mentally unstable she needs serious psychiatric help she's a token mean grow she's a ... a negro who can't read I mean it just went on and on and on\nI mean they are destroying this guy and what I find incredible is this is the same liberal media elites who when conservatives\nTolls LeBron James you know we're really tired of all you're dumb commentary just shut up and dribble oh\nAre you\nAll how dare you\nKnow they're telling Kanye West essentially shut up and saying not even shut up and saying shut up and go to a mental hospital shut up and get treatment because you're mentally ill now by the way it wasn't just Don Lemon listen now to CNN's\nResident never Trump conservative\nA s e cup I mean someone's got to be a mercenary for CNN to go after fellow conservatives your pay or the right money as the cup is open for business so listen now to as the cop just kick the knife and even deeper rural cut to Britain\nOr what have time to be alive I'm may may we live in interesting times look at all jokes aside I thought that was really\nSad um I think you had there a man who is clearly not OK and a president who is willing to exploit that and worse to exploit that under the auspices of\nRace relations than I'm black community is joblessness mental health all the things that ended up in the bucket of issues that were sort of addressed\nIn this free for all I I don't know that any of them were very well served by this circus\nAnd in many ways they are they are the same person right they are both very ego driven and desperate for attention and so they give it to one another they are using other\nFor that ended the call I don't have a problem with Kanye West being a fan of the president I don't have a problem with the president using\nCelebrities to expo is important issues\nBut the problem is I don't think any of that happens today because today was bonkers and it was it was crazy it was off the rails how could anything the accomplished and that kind of environment with that little serious that paid to do is very important issues\nAnd it's just incredible so Trump now exploited Kanye West who's not okay he's ... mentally ill man\nIt's just so when ever a prominent African American let's be clear land on my column I lay it all out if I'm not here to speak the truth what's the point of me being behind the microphone whenever a prominent black or a prominent African American\nDecides to turn away from the Democratic party walk away from the Democratic economic plantation\nThey destroy him\nAnd and as I lay out in my column what's really going on here is no different\nThan what the Democrats have done in the past over a hundred or a hundred and fifty years ago the contrary to liberal miss the Democrats are the party of slavery the Democrats are the party of segregation that Democrats are the party of Jim Crow\nAnd so the only difference is that when they confronted a pity blacks who spoke out against democratic Mr rule and democratic injustice in the past the Democrats would put on a white horrid because the KKK is a product of the Democratic party that's a fact\nThey would put on a white hood and David Lynch a black man that's what they would do to be it's a bit more subtle\nIt's not as violent it's not as crude but it's nonetheless just as devastating and just as effective they use the media and they use technology propaganda to essentially destroy a black man an opposite he black men\nWhat they did was on Saturday Night live those the leftist through Kanye West out on stage with this make America great again hat on in front of a liberal audience knowing that he would be cheered boots and humiliated\nAnd now you have CNN and MSNBC and the New York times and the Washington Post and I could go on and on and on\nNow basically say this man for daring to side with the president of the United states for daring to sink for himself for daring to criticize and expose the Democratic party\nFor having used blocks for the last fifty to sixty years\nAnd given them nothing absolutely nothing outside of a few crumbs well what's their response\nHe's he'll he's crazy\nHe needs to be institutionalized day mark him he's a token negro decision minstrel show\nHe's\nYou're the you're the the black guy that the whites use so we can all laugh at blacks that's with Don Lemon was sank\nMust be very clear what he was saying I'm Sorry I don't mean to put it this crudely but that's exactly what he was saying that's why you got so many people in the African American community rightly outraged I sing Don Lemon it's got to go\nAnd I got to say this you know because somebody's got to defend Connie because the poor guys just taken a beating now you know Don when\nYou talk about black people are watching on TV or on their phones and cringing at what they saw with Kanye West talking about the need for manufacturing jobs are the need to bring back jobs and law and order and make America want again when he all of that\nAnd they're supposedly cringing you know what blocks were really cringing and all Americans were cringing when you were going on about that Malaysian airplanes that they that the Malaysian flight that Malaysian airplane that you claim disappeared and a black hole\nThat's when they were really ... how does a more on like this get his own show\n\nToday they use CNN they use the mainstream media they use popular culture to go after an up at the block and it's a high tech lynching\nThey ... they do great him and they they destroying them

O.\nTrevor in New Hampshire Europe max thanks for holding Trevor in well [noise]\nYeah Hi Jeff I just wanted to say that a lot of what I wanted to but I Would like to expand upon that I agree completely with him a but\nThere's much more to be said about this a Democrat plantation that the black quoting a walk and put on [noise] um I mean this reaction is nothing but about maintaining votes for the Democrats as Ross sad and I've never seen something so bad as the reaction\nAnd the smearing Kanye West I mean it shows how desperate the last days are absolutely petrified ah I mean look at the map many of these elections are won three four percent\nWithin three four percent you know and if we peeled off to the conservative side probably even a third of the black owning a block I Would say probably three quarters of the elections the Democrats would have no chance to win\nI just take away three four percent from their vote totals swing it over the Republicans other than in heavily urban areas or the Republican candidate sweep by and large so it really would be the death knell for them and I also just say that uh about\nHow the left has a with their group thank you so criticized clown yeah they're the ones that are actually doing damage to the uh the ... ... since the left has taken over and I know you've spoken about this but since the left has taken over a\n... around the sixties and maintained black voter block uh it's really quite harmful to a black family if you compare to the fifties with a black family actually at a higher rate of marriage\nAnd better numbers of single Parenthood\nAnd so forth at a lot less of the social apologies and this has done nothing but destroy\nThe black family and there's a culture on why we have the bingo\nHowever you I couldn't have said it better myself honestly the nail on the head thank you for that call and Trevor honestly forget a third I mean I'm not kidding like literally all the Republicans need to do is get twelve percent twelve Fifteen Percent of the black vote\nThe Democrats they may win in suburban areas you're right but\nAs a national force that can never win a presidential election again well Fifteen Percent much so you want to know why they're freaking out Kanye freaks them out\nAnd you mentioned what you were talking about look they're going on about the way he spoke yesterday\nKind of in a stream of consciousness manner he's been talking like that for Twenty years\nI I'm just being honest with you\nKnow so when I look I don't can't look I don't care for this rap you know this like I said it in my column I'll be honest with you I don't care for his music I don't care for his wife personally I'm not a big fan of the show the production is I don't watch it\nBut you know the guy's been the same guy for the last Fifteen Twenty years nothing's changed you know when he went on stage with Taylor Swift I was like very famous up the music awards\nAnd he interrupted her and said no you basically you shouldn't have won Beyonce should have won she got the best video or whatever I mean he's been the way he is for the last Fifteen Twenty years the guy hasn't changed and any stream of consciousness wouldn't wanna call it monologue or commentary here\nDo we address this he said what's killing the black community is that we have single mothers and it was the welfare state he actually said if the Democrats put the welfare state and that took the fathers out of the home and it put the government in the home\nAnd he said that's what's killing us and he went on about you know you don't play catch with your dad you don't have a strong role model he talked about himself not having a strong male role model in a way kind of looks up to Trump but he made it all out there\nSo their goal was you can see it I'm I'm when I watched the whole thing last night I'm like boy oh boy\nHe said a lot of really interesting untrue things they didn't want that message to get out\nSo boom the woman that thing was over\nCrazy bonkers whack job race traitor institutionalize something we all he's crazy all huge crazy heart ... nuts or that he talked you know we were said mother effort they drop the\nBomb when of liberals and Democrats ever cared about rap music that that they use the F. word all the time that they use the word all the time like what are you talking to me about its conservatives\nThat have gone on for years about the debate of our culture by the uh some of these rappers and hip hop stars with the way they talk\nThis is not how they talk on the street is just ... look what you saw last night or sorry yesterday forgive me is no different than what Conyers has been for the last Twenty years\nExcept for one thing he turned on the liberal regime and that's the one thing on up the black man can never do\nGary in California you're up next go ahead Gary\nPaycheck but hey I Love you man a thousand times bigger than that black hole at a ...\nA pretty big oh\nThank you thank you Gary what's on your mind my friend\n[noise] well I out at a gym you just wait till the poll numbers come in with blacks\nFor Donald Trump now after meeting with ah with with ... uh oh can you had to do in the past was saying just a few things without meeting with him and ... and the poll numbers for the president shot up\nYou just wait wait now to see what they're going to be after having a meeting with him I think they're going to be huge they waste them Eighteenth Hussein to duty six percent approval I'll bet you to be a forty five who said I Wish I'd be shocked if it wasn't\nA very very true I I got to look I I Know I saw the numbers he's got thirty six percent approval that's already a dagger aimed at the heart of the Democratic coalition ... forty five or fifty Gary\nCould turn the lights off because the Democrats are finished business over there told I parties that well that\nThat without without a doubt a chef I Want to I wanted to offer the my explanation as to why the praises of the left do what they do including a lemon and including Maxine Waters and clothes and all of them and I don't care whether it's the lowest and teeth with a\n... I Believe I fully believe this that you can explain all this as an addiction that the left has become addicted\nTo socialism the same with the same way and manner that people get addicted to drugs and alcohol they are the resistance Jeff should not be call there was this is ... ... the suppression\nBecause if you ask any addict or alcoholic\nOr in the middle of their uh their diction they know what they're doing is destructive and they they suppress it they keep it down\nInteresting er ... believe that the less interesting thank you very much for that call no I Do I think it's like heroin they're just they're addicted to big government they can't they can't get off of it Dennis Europe next I've got a minute Dennis the floor is yours go\nJeff this this is one of a a don't let a good crisis go to waste moments us what it currently I couldn't do he couldn't publicly chose that entire appear to debate and it totally did the token negro pay for the venue how's that\n[laughter] oh Denis I don't think CNN would take them on a on a ... he would have to pay for it [laughter]\nI don't expect it to be televised\n[laughter] funny is that you very much for that at all no I said look if\nI were him either challenger him or I don't know maybe you saw\nI'm not the one who needs a mental a needs to go to a mental hospital who's the one first spreading the Russia collusion conspiracy\nWho's the one going on since Trump is a dictator who's the one thing that the states should overthrow him in a military coup the only crazy ones are you oh CNN\nOkay I got a big story for you next but first\nPresident Trump is now announcing the return of an American pastor who was held in Turkey for over two years in hiding rich has that story take it away Evan [noise]\nWe've got the divorce papers the official certified divorce papers so you can show to a court and then you can get remarried\nSo ... D went in to the Saudi consulate in Turkey is Campbell now here is where the plot thickens he has never come out\nThis has been going on now for what over at the ... when the ten days whatever it's been he went in cameras showed him going in he has not returned\nTrump now it's come out and said something obviously very suspicious took place something as he put it I don't like but now we're getting more and more information here is now the absolute latest\nBecause they wanted to eliminate a high profile dissident\nThe Saudi Arabian government it has now come out on the very day that ... D was going into the consulate in Istanbul\nThe Saudi Government sent a team of Fifteen hip demand Fifteen assassins who arrived in Turkey in Istanbul that very morning\nFifteen of them on to private planes and all of them carrying Saudi diplomatic passes\nDave van ... arrived at the consulate in a caravan of limousines they were waiting for him\nIt now turns out that the Saudi Government ordered the assassination of ... at the consulate in Istanbul and in fact not only was he killed but of course\nUntil now what is coming out is that the person order they hit and it may even be the crown prince himself not one of his entourage inner circle but literally maybe the crown prince ... himself\nDemanded that ... first be tortured at the consulate that this will be videotaped\nThat then ... was tortured he was then killed he was then apparently be headed and then they want it to show the evidence to the crown prince look he's dead here's this severed head is decapitated head\nAnd afterwards they apparently chopped up his body they dismembered his body they cut it up apparently one of Saudi Arabia is top forensic experts was part of that Fifteen member assassination team and he arrived at the consulate with a bone saw\nAnd so they cut them off limb from lamb I'm not kidding put him in suits stuffed his body in suitcases or the parts of his body and suitcases and then put it in a black van\nWith dark windows and then drove off\nTo dispose of the parts and dispose of the bug or what's left of the by\nNow the Saudi Government is insisting that they had no role and there's nothing happened in fact was kind of giving the game away one of their top officials said well if there's nobody there is no crime\nSo he's gone he's gone\nAnd the Saudis killed them the Saudis assassinated him the Saudis dismembered him they chop them up and God Knows where they put the parts of his body who knows it probably all over turkey and they're saying they're not going to find the body and not going to find a body you're never going to prove that we did it now furthermore\nIt now appears now Trump is getting a window of this\nLindsey Graham for example was all over the top the cable news last night saying that when the proof comes out and the proof now looks increasingly likely the evidence looks increasingly likely that the Saudis did order this job\nThen everything is now on the table I mean everything is on the table sanctions on Saudi Arabia canceling the arms deal with Saudi Arabia who knows what may happen in Saudi Arabia or if this comes out however it now appears\nThat cut shockey was wearing an apple I watch\nAnd I guess because of the way the I watch is it's it's not that\nIt's it's not it's not easy to spot the kinda blends in very easily with or you wear it on your wrist that it looks like the assassins overlook the I watch\nAnd it appears that the I watch may have now actually videotaped ... own torture execution and murder\nListen now to a Turkish journalist who's got very good sources with the Turkish government and the Turkish intelligence services or call in to Charles paying show is a guest on Fox Business uh he basically lays out\nThat it now appears that the Turks have overwhelming evidence that ... was not only kill them executed by the Saudis but that in fact the whole thing was recorded on his I watch\nHis name is Ali al ... met he's the Gulf Institute director listen to him on Fox Business just yesterday role let Britain\nAnd when we you know so far is that the Turkish government has proved that that the ... the ... is dead\nAnd then they at least have the whole deal updated [noise] buffalo filthy of that incident income and I believe that that that was that it quoted though is that apple to watch for much that they're that he was wedding and sending them to be according to his iPhone kind\nOf hold on to LA let's let's go over that real slow because that's a shocker\nSomehow he he was able to enable as iPhone watch to record his own death\nAt the hands of solve the agents\nThat ended that that I have a\nBarge not doing it accorded or if it is but it also gave the time at the specific time and that location of the bit of the body because they didn't forgotten to take it off they would not diminish what it looks like it [laughter]\nAnd did they know where to their body with steak and I think that's why it's sort of waiting\nTo Vancouver basically all that information\nAnd then they go to this this is absolutely explosive\nYou thank you better believe it it's explosive so now\nUh I Know the CIA is all over this story U.S intelligence is over this story or Congress has all over this story President Trump is all over this story let me just say this okay and there's no getting around\nUs if the Saudis were behind this and I think it's pretty obvious they were and the ruling family was beside this which I think it's pretty obvious that they were [noise] I've never liked the Saudi Government\nI don't like their influence on Capitol Hill\nI don't like how they bought influence in Congress in the White House whether it be the Obama administration the Bush administration the Clinton Administration [noise] this is a brutal Islamic regime\nThat treats women like slaves that murders gays and lesbians\nThat engages in barbaric beheadings that is responsible for the humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen in which they are systematically starving millions and millions of people in Yemen in their criminal illegal war in that country\nThis is a nation in a regime that persecute an oppressed his Christians will not even allow you if you work in Saudi Arabia to have a cross or a crucifix on you or a Bible\nAnd more imposed more importantly and most importantly I Believe that the Saudi Government and the Saudi royal family had not only links to al ... that has been proven but I Believe that they were responsible ultimately for nine eleven and the death and murder of three thousand Americans\nTheir regime is soaked in American blood and if this turns out that day in fact we have like a bunch of sadistic savages who think\nThey can go around and murder journalists with impunity then I think it's time for Saudi Arabia to pay a severe price and the ultimate price should be it's time for us to cut them loose\n\nAnd when President Trump recently said that he's going to unveil one of these days who was really by nine eleven let me tell you who is really talking about Saudi Arabia and the Saudis\nI Am sick of this regime enough is enough and my question to you is this what should the United states do and Saudi Arabia is it now an enemy of the United states\nThe way Iran and North Korea and other of the Savage regimes are is it time to put Saudi Arabia on our top list of terrorist sponsors should they now be deemed a mortal enemy of the United states\nSix one seven three six six sixty eight sixty eight your calls ... we had a big

August Garry I haven't heard from you in a while how are you my friend\nI'm not Well Jeff\nAnd if Trump doesn't build the wall that doesn't mean it's not a success\nIs doing a decent job for the country I'll give them that are so I'm a conservative standpoint Jeff\nI Can't stand him he destroyed everything I've done finance last Twenty years and that's all I hear about is how great the economy's going so I have a different perspective from everybody and we're not going to get the walls yet because the Republicans got no balls\nThey've never had any balls and Trump doesn't have any either although you are thinking does\nWhy isn't he built in the wall because he can't\nRemember six months ago when he had a televised press conference and everyone was telling us about how saying he was\nAbout how he was going to build a wall and get the funding he went to that car French cafe game that everyone whatever they wanted and he didn't get any wall in Graham ensure my came back with a deal with him and he rejected it so he's not going to build the wall jet\nHe just pan destroys Republican base and the Republican base goes along with it and my bread he's not going to build a wall he didn't know he didn't take care of Obamacare are asked why he didn't take care of our personal tax cuts you gave it to big business and he didn't put Hillary in jail and he didn't drain the swamp\nSo I don't know why everyone thinks he's still in such a great job Jeff can you please explain this to me\nUm but I mean so Gary you I mean you're saying financially you've gotten things have gotten worse for you under Trump\nYes yes I was great under Obama as a businessman 'cause I make my own living ... did you see just\nThis is what people don't understand since you're born to your debt the government just want you for your money and your tax dollars okay so I don't want to be tied to the system I don't want to have to go to college you have to get up every day at work or somebody else for the rest of my white so if you don't want to be tied to that your screwed okay\nAnd I'll give you some perfect examples okay I I invest in houses jak because I don't work for anybody so I don't get I don't ... to my boss like most Americans do with free health insurance or in case sick\nDays bereavement days all this free stuff you guys get\nWe don't get that is small business owners so I have to invest in myself so I invested in houses to get a ... ... so I can\nIn the future I have a closet of fall 'cause I don't have a four one K. to match like everybody else so I invested in houses jet and Trump since I've invested in houses yeah we've got seven rate increases since he's been in office on home equity lines of credit\nAnd you can't talk to any of the property taxes on any of my homes right now so that's nine thousand dollar hit I just took on every house if I own or rent so I go out and kill Jeff on the him how was that helping me in the car he shut down they\nActually what I Do want to get ahead for Twenty years okay\nJerry and Jerry if you don't let me ask you though but aren't housing prices really exploding aren't they skyrocketing\nYes they are Jeff but I give people cheap rent so they can stay there but what's happened Jeff as I Can't afford the property taxes to pay their mortgages anymore because of the I only get ahead on little ... things like that that's how I grow a little small the directions but\nDo you hold on just raise the rent\nI Will but everyone saying the economy's\nDoing going everyone's ... cum laude complaining that the rent is too much when it's cheapest can be\nReally isn't buddy you got to start charging a lot higher rent my friend you're going to get in on the gravy train Jeff\nI'm just trying to tell you things on as it seems out there why isn't Trump standing up to the Republicans are saying I Want a wall they sang Lindsey Graham out there to do it not everybody else he sent Lindsey Graham and why is that Hillary going to jail yo yesterday you guys talked about Hillary and now she's got her what she should be in jail she should be talked\nAbout right now truck was supposed to put her in jail and call me in jail and drain the swamp I Want the rule of law for them the same as ... we're not getting that\nIt still them against I I don't feel we'd get and that's the conservative base is they get ... Dale that's all I'm trying to say that this guy he's also a big business\nGary thank you very much for the call you're always welcome back on the corner report my friend thank you for that call you Tom in New Jersey Europe max go ahead Tom\n... thank you for it or red white and blue dynamite baby\nMy pleasure Tom what's on your mind my friend\nHey can I ask you um I I I have this second Gary to a certain extent I mean yeah I I'm an old red white and blue constitutional America I voted for Trump I support Trump but I Will never have over ...\n... we got a\nWay to go make America great again Jeff I mean why yeah he's got the tax cuts and it still remains to be seen out of the blue states shakeout in that we got a couple of Supreme Court justice citizenship but let's see if they make a dent in at ten to ... to abortion I wait my whole life for that\nI have my severe doubts sure army at\nWhat about the wall Russia's or the sake of our gas there is no wall by twenty twenty yeah are you gonna blank Trump or you're not going to vote for him where he is still going to vote for him\nWell I I probably still have to warm up\nBut I I mean this this uh we're getting short changed here we got a long long way to go okay we have a and approved the economy but what about the size of government\nWe're ... we're pulling a five hundred billion dollar deficits right now and we're going to go to a trillion dollar deficits pretty soon\nI mean this this this is a crash I mean if we don't start pulling in the size of government I mean I Would cut that sucked corrections is still sitting there at that trader\nThat sleep a traitor I wouldn't trust ten minutes or hours I could throw a what Whitey a traitor I wouldn't trust him as far as I can throw a what Whitey a Whitey ... still prowling around out there\nI I don't know ... we we gotta we gotta ... the trees and get this thing well we got to fortify Trump and push hard because I we haven't made as much progress as I Hope Jeff and that war should have been built by now\nTom thank you very much for that call six wants to take everybody six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight okay my friend's coming up next\nHurricane Michael\nIs the media are responsible\nFor the carnage devastation and math deaths that we're now seeing\nI've got an angle you may find interesting but first\nThat we feared it was going to blow the door right off and then once the door is blown off who knows what the damage would have been inside the house and maybe would have been killed so he said he desperately was screwing in males\nInto the door to lock it down and even that wasn't strong enough he had to sit by hungry you're behind the door to keep it from flying off literally sat throughout the entire storm to prevent the front door from just blowing off completely blowing off its inches\nAnd so the question I'm asking myself ... as I'm reading one person being interviewed after another all of them saying I Wish I had evacuated this was heroin was showing this was frightening a this was traumatic uh we really thought we were going to die\nThis is something nobody should have insured we should have left why didn't we leave and so I'm asking the question well why didn't you know one's asking the obvious follow up question why didn't you know I think there are two reasons\nThe first reason and to me the obvious reason is that hurricane Michael was initially projected as a tropical storm\nBut because it went over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico which apparently were abnormally warm it just got you know we're just spit up that fed into the storm and so it just quickly escalated from category one category two category three and then it became a category\nBefore monster and it just caught people unprepared it just came to move so fast and it wants to hit category for some of the winds were in fact a hundred and Seventy five miles an hour I mean that's extremely dangerous\nThat was blowing trees off that was blowing homes off that was blowing roofs off\nI mean that's just incredibly frightening and very dangerous so I think the speed of the storm and how quickly it moved and how quickly change from a tropical storm to a category for ... I honestly think caught a lot of people off guard\nBut I'm going to be honest with you got as my witness I've got to say it's nobody else will say if I'm going to say it I partially blame the mainstream media and I'll tell you why\nWhat's happening in our country whether it'd be the weather channel whether it be CNN Fox and MSNBC\nThe local networks it doesn't matter they hype everything up so much it is so over the top you know if it's a a decibel level of zero to Penn it's always that all hell at fourteen\nAnd so they how many storms and how many hurricanes have you heard this is this fall dead now this is the storm of a lifetime Hurricane Florence to one just before the storm of a lifetime\nHow many times have you heard that storm of a lifetime how many times have you or governors are members of Congress are mayors leave you're gonna die waved a sky is falling you're gonna die and I think what eventually happens when you live in a society like this\nYou've become numb you've actually become immune is\nJust how much of this am I going to pay it so if I'm living in Florida ... honestly part of me saying oh okay oh so I got to evacuate again right oh so this is this form of the lifetime like the last one was a storm of a lifetime like the one before that was the storm of a lifetime and the one before that\nOh we're all gonna die oh yeah like the last storm and the one before that and the one before that now I think I'll stay\nThat's what I honestly think many people concluded and I think from the last storm Hurricane Florence when you've got the weather channel I know if you remember those images you've got the weather channel reporter\nActing like this storm is so strong the Windsor so ferocious that he's acting he's grabbing a poll and eyes on camera I was like I'm going to be blown off the bowl I'm going to be blown off the poll I mean just look how strong this storm is and on camera literally behind him\nYou got to ... walking on the sidewalk literally walking behind the or the weather channel die\nAs he's acting like I got a hold on to the poll or else who's going to blow me off\nAnd there was walking by no problem\nAnd so I think when you see this kind of sensationalism and that's what it is it's sensationalism this kind of constant over the top height\nI think a lot of people just she just get them you can see and that's the problem and I don't just mean the weather or storms I honestly think that's the problem with our media in general on everything on politics you name it\nTrump is in Nazi Trump is a dictator a disguise gonna fall Kavanaugh women are going to be dying and back alley abortions it's the end of the world segregation is coming Jim Crow is coming it's sold over the top\nIt's so hysterical so sensationalized for ratings\nYou know the expression if it bleeds it leads so how am I going to get people to keep watching oh it's not just to store\nI caught this storm oh my God this is going to blow if both Florida off the map from all of us about our space\nAnd it's not even just hurricanes have you noticed what's going on here that\nThe northeast New England\nI remember growing up I don't want to make it seem like ooh back in the old days but honestly I remember growing up in Montreal with the winters are even harsher and colder than here in Boston\nOkay you get a foot of snow mark the end of the world maybe delay school for two hours people go out they shovel coal maybe they're cursing or a little paid off\nAnd they go to work and they go to school and it's and they come on they go yeah you got to get about ten inches twelve inches fourteen inches of snow and get ready start shoveling early and ah you know see tonight for the nightly newscast will tell you what the actual snow accumulation ultimately was\nNow you get two inches of snow I'm not kidding who's that guy on busy Brittany ... guy on the on the TV that guy\nThe guy looked at the park Eric ... yeah yeah the guy that got the part because they're running now they're like look at ... oh my oh it's really a comment about oh we're just taken a beating here\nIt's two inches of snow but what do you panic and four\nAnd then they find a one car that's going on in a ditch or something I Know oh we've got to interview him we're going to put the put the microphone in his face oh they treacherous treacherous driving conditions\nYou could die at any second you're gonna die you're going cable is sending tape ... tape listening stay tuned in you're going to die\nIt's no\nIt's February or January in Boston it's cold it's life of course it's gonna snow it snowed before it's gonna snow again it's not the end of the world and then like two inches of snow like look at the snow look at the smoke I'm like well what do you think it's going to look like it's no\nAnd then they're already doing it now with hurricane Michael I predict this forty eight hours ago global warming climate change everything has to be politicized\nSo when there aren't any hurricanes we went through a huge hurricane drought global warming climate change when there are hurricanes climate change it's like here in Boston\nWhen it snows climate change when it doesn't snow climate change its course February it's freezing right we're freezing our rear ends off climate change it shouldn't be this cold is stream whether it's climate change when it's warm in February\nIt's it's still warm climate change so let me get this straight when there are no hurricanes as bad when there are hurricanes it's bad when it's cold it's bad when it's warm it's bad\nIt's just always it's just it's always political it's always climate change and it's always hysteria panic and the decibel\nLevel at eleven\nAnd so honestly I'm looking at these poor people in the panhandle I'll be a God as my witness and I'm saying you didn't evacuate I Know why you didn't evacuate\nIt's like crying wolf that old children's story you're crying wolf you cry wolf you cry wolf and then when they're real wolf shows up like hurricane Michael\nNobody believes you\nWhat would it take for you to get a tattoo you didn't want a million dollars how about a
