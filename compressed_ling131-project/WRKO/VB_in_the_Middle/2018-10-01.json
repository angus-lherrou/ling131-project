aiding and abetting they say\nA serial rapist and a sexual predator six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight by the way Warren made a stunning announcement we're gonna talk about it in the third our of the show but first let me ask you\nWhat do you make of the protests what do you wake up make of the one week delayed for the FBI to investigate\nAnd his cabinet going down came he survive this onslaught lines are blazing comrade Sean Europe first go ahead Conrad\nYeah it was war on thought she was entitled to our professorship at Harvard but that's OK right Jeff I'm all for this investigation ally because they're not investigating cabinet right now they're in ... skating the so called witnesses Jeff\n[noise] they're investigating Feinstein who leaked the letter investigating who appointed the lawyers Democrat awkward is by the way who paid for them who appointed them who set up a goat funding pitch for so you just\nWatch what you asked for Democrats Lindsey Graham was on with the idiot Stephanopoulos he waited all out\nWe're investigating everything that the committee did everything and Jeff is the beauty of it who's in charge of the NSA now\nI mean technically Trump's people or what's at ... that's right\nJeff they have everything unless these people are communicating by carrier pigeon which they are not we got everything can you say it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood Mr Rogers\nComrades let me ask you this because you're making has always brilliant point it's really good points but let me just plain capitals advocate with you for a second\nThis is an FBI politicized under combing politicized under McCabe in fact ... came out with an op ed in the New York times let me just read a part of it to you and to the audience\nHe is 'em urging the Democrats to kill the Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd he is in fact are are urging the FBI to go after Kavanaugh and ... the investigation against Kavanaugh as ... as he put it um ah here's what he said that he says that there should be no clock\nSo he's against one week in the investigation wouldn't have been shot a and he goes on about the Senate Judiciary committee in or have already endorsed the nominee\nI Want you to think about this this to me is the central issue here judge Kavanaugh why ... why when asked yourself this one question why\nNow yes part of it is short term to appease their crazed left wing resistance base but I think there's something deeper and frankly more sinister going on here\nBecause if you look at judge Kavanaugh's life he's a boy scout the man is a boy scout\nWomen that you him from high school and college say he was a man of sterling character people who have worked with him as a judge many of them by the way women say amen of\nAbsolutely sterling character judges that he's worked with judges that he's worked for say a man of absolutely outstanding character so as a judge as a teacher at Yale and Harvard law school his colleagues stellar character his students stellar character\nSo whether it be judges whether it'd be law clerks by the way again many of them female every woman that's ever worked with him under him every student male female every judge male female every colleague male female\nLike I said going all the way back to high school and college all say you cannot get a better man than judge Kavanaugh\nHe's a boy scout he's a boy scout\nAnd so what the Democrats are now saying is and I believe this is the real sinister motive here if we can take out Mr Boy Scout America we can take out anybody\nThis is a signal to the Republicans a very powerful signal and to anybody out there if we can do this to Kevin all we can do it to you\nBecause the fact that you have absolute moral integrity and absolutely impeccable character that you have worked so hard for decades to get where you are in life it all doesn't matter\nUh styling famously told live rent the barrier on what do you do about a certain dissident and various said show me the man and I'll show you the crime in other words will manufacture one\nAnd that's what they've now shown that in collusion with the Democratic mainstream media\nThey will manufacture charges and repeat them and repeat them and amplify them and amplify them that by the time they're done an overwhelming majority of Americans think that this man who is a boy scout is a serial gang rape\nIs I'm a sexual predator even though we passed six FBI background checks\nAnd so what they're saying is if you ever think about serving under under a Republican president and be appointed to the Supreme Court or you want to work in a Republican administration we will destroy you\nAnd there is nothing we can do to stop it you cannot do anything it's like a runaway train we will crush you\nWill go back to middle school if we have to and if we can find something like Kavanaugh will make it up\nAnd all we gotta do is crank up the Democratic media complex and by the time CNN MSNBC the New York times the Washington Post the New Yorker by the time the media is done your name is mutt ... mud\nIn fact\nWill even get Saturday Night live to jump in well even popular culture will help us Hollywood will help us so listen now to\nThey got Matt Damon on Saturday Night live remember buddies\nHarvey Weinstein team in fact he refused to ... even do a woman after woman after woman on tape he was caught trying to sexually assault the woman okay it doesn't matter\nThat hashtags me too movement hated him but that was a few weeks ago like an oil wells Nineteen eighty four where we're at war with Oceana no no no no we're at peace now with Oceana well now we're at peace with Oceana\nBecause Matt Damon to read rehabilitate his career all we've got to do\nIs do a skit on Saturday Night live\nWhere he mocks judge Kavanaugh and now they know he's got the votes or they think they fear they know the sex allegations are B. S. so guess what now he's a drunk\nNow he's got rage anger management issues now he's an alcoholic who doesn't have the temperament to be a Supreme Court justice role to ... this is Matt Damon doing a skit on Saturday Night live just this weekend [noise]\nGood Kavanaugh are you ready to begin [noise]\nI'm going to start an eleven\nI'll tell you about the\nI showed this speech to almost no one [noise]\nMy family not my friend's not even PJ or when we're going [laughter]\nThere are others like it but this is mine\nMy ... last night was screaming into an empty bag of Doritos [noise]\nHold it right there are there it is okay now noticed what they've done they've taken righteous indignation\nAbout him from a man who was fighting for his very life his career his reputation his family his honor they have destroyed everything and they've taken a man who spoke from the heart who actually acted like a normal red blooded individual\nDo I want somebody who's going to go up there after being accused of being a serial gang rapist and a sexual predator to give a robotic answer and read from a script like these Democrats\nAlways do no in fact what was the most moving and touching unreal and profound was that he was crying she was choking back tears he was angry she was indignant because he was wrong because he is being wrong\nAnd yet look at them now they're turning him and take a whack job\n... rage maniac\nSomebody who's like you know ... gonna punch somebody's head in through a wall a lunatic and then they take a boy scout who what had a few\nBeers out a couple of underage drinking parties and from this he's ah he's he's got to be in a kind of gold Alcoholics Anonymous right now you don't believe me roll it Brittany\nCon job orchestrated by the Clintons George Soros Kathy Kathy Griffin\nRonan Sinatra [laughter]\nUsually an optimist [laughter] I'm a check is half both kind of guy [noise]\nFrom the monsters on this committee makes me want to hear from here [laughter]\n[noise]\nThey couldn't have done it better in the Soviet Union\nI'm telling you they couldn't have done it better in Nazi Germany goals is Joseph ... Germany Nazi Germany's Hitler's\nMinister propaganda you must be laughing from hell di di di di you do it baby died so it's done so now you've got this poor innocent man who is now become a national joke and that's the whole purpose of this year\nIt's the whole purpose of this smear is not short term political gain\nThis is a warning to anybody who wants to serve on the Supreme Court or in the Trump Administration or any future Republican administration\nI don't care how squeaky clean you are I don't care how good you are how educated you are how qualified you are I don't care if you're a boy scout like Brett Kavanaugh if we can do that to him we can do that to you\nSo don't shoot ever challenge democratic rule and power again you know what this is\nAnd that's what they're doing six one seven three six six sixty eight sixty eight okay coming up next Lindsey Graham declares war on Dianne Feinstein wield this FBI investigation blow up and the Democrats face\nAnd Christine Ford said really oh yeah you need a good lawyer and who should I get Deborah cats Debbie\nYou gotta give that'd be a call ... Hillary's or client bills or client and whenever I Need anything I go to Debbie now by the way that's legal that when it gets that but that's the legal\nSo they recommended number one democratic cooperative with ties to Hillary and bill enticing Dianne Feinstein who is the second lawyer the guy that was beside her during the whole hearing that's Michael Brown which\nOh\nBut Jeff who's Michael Brown which yes what he's another big time democratic operative and you know who he is the lawyer of\nTake a guess Geoff James call me and Andrew McCabe\nMichael Brown which is the lawyer for Andrew McCabe and he's very close friends with James call me\nSo you've got the Democrats operative lawyer write to her left and you've got the deep state lawyer write to her right did you see what's happening here my friends\nSo Lindsey Graham goes on ... George Stephanopoulos which Steffi ABC's This week and says we want to find out\nWho is the one that advice Deborah cats to be Christine Ford's lawyer\nWhy were those two lawyers why did they not tell ... ah Christine forward Christine Fort\n... we were willing to visit her in Washington in California and not have you come down to Washington DC because if they kept information from you that's illegal\nThey should be disbarred and if Diane Feinstein was behind the leak she violated confidential information she violated Senate rules\nIn other words what did Dianne Feinstein no and when did she know it was Feinstein the leaker roll it Brittany\n... got to find out\nWhy she did not know her options I've got to find out who and Feinstein stab\nRecommended cats a to B Dr Ford's lawyer is in in proper for senators to recommend lawyers to constituents I'm going to ask if he thought she needed a lawyer as a staff member\nWhy didn't you come forward and tell the committee about the allegation I'm going to try to find out who betrayed Dr Ford stress to remain anonymous there three people at three groups that had the letter a democratic congresswoman and her staff Feinstein and her staff and I don't blame Feinstein did this\nAnd or a doctor force lawyers no friend are sent this out to the press the friend would do this to or the person has set this anonymous uh destroyed her trust betrayed her request to be anonymous at a political agenda\nNow\nOr by those with Maria ... that wasn't with ABC's Stephanopoulos but he repeated the same thing with ABC's to this week with George Stephanopoulos he basically said the same thing now I disagree with them but I think he's being cagey I think he knows his Dianne Feinstein I think he's just saying oh I don't think is Dianne Feinstein but we need to investigate\nWhatever it is there's only two people that could have leaked that information that could have leaked the letter\nThat started the Washington Post a calling her that hot or basically have to interview the Washington but yeah I have an interview and the Washington Post the only two people that could have leaked it\nWere either Feinstein or Christine for his lawyers there's only two there's only two so either Christine Ford was telling the truth or Dianne Feinstein was lying\nOr Christine Ford was lying and Dianne Feinstein is telling troops\nIn other words either Christine forward perjured herself and lied under oath or Dianne Feinstein light and she was the one who leaked the letter you can't have it both ways\nSo either Ford is going to have to go to jail for perjury herself her lawyers are going to be disbarred or Dianne Feinstein has got a lot of explaining to do keep rolling Brittany\nI'm going to get to the bottom of it I Want to find out who won the Democratic side link that anonymous letter provided to the committee senator Gardner\nWhen Noah posts mark on it no return address claiming that a judge Kavanaugh did something wrong

wasn't aware of a Senate investigators wanting to interview were at her home in private or her lawyers deliberately kept that information from her\nAnd I want to know if the lawyers were in cahoots

I I don't know how they could do it I just think they must all go around with Democrats damp down there fired because their families and grandparents and everybody way that they were Democrats because it was the thing to do and\nIt's just I don't know it just boggles my mind\nJen thank you very much for that call look they're lemmings they're they're mindless zombies I mean really I think some of them as more diabolical or look I'll tell you right now you've got Cory Booker okay I Am Spartacus Cory Booker he now says that if you support Kevin all your\nQuote complicit with evil peace in the same man who wrote an op ed piece look it up and take my word for it he admitted that he molested and groped a woman\nShe goes I Know I didn't\nI molested her eyes sexually assaulted her and he says but in my mind my asking myself I guess as he's molesting her how come I I think I respect women I say I respect women but look at the difference between my actions and my purported beliefs\nAnd he's standing in judgment of ... and apparently for the Democrats Cory Booker is good enough for them look at Keith Ellison I'm nuts\nThink he said she sent pictures medical records doctors' reports multiple witnesses that core robbery what she's saying he beat his ex girlfriend black and blue\nYou got to see her face he practically punch their head through wall no problem\nKeith Ellison now is not only this deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee I Swear to you I think it's going to be the next state attorney general of\nMinnesota no problem Dianne Feinstein Mazie Hirono Elizabeth Warren they love key fellas they love Cory Booker no problem\nSo it's the mindless hypocrisy in double standard what this is about trust me when I tell you this is more than abortion it's more than ... wait this is a dress rehearsal to bring down the president and impeach him\nBecause if you can take a guy as ... as a judge Kavanaugh I said he's a boy scout and you can turn him into a monster you can do it to anybody\nTo anybody and the messages out don't shoot ever opposed the Democrats again because if you do they will crush you Tony in Gloucester you're up next going ahead Tony\nHi Jeff throughout the question that I Wish Mitchell would have asked for us is Dr Ford why didn't you ah clean clean up clean off your Facebook page and your Twitter account and then she gave her after said what would you be willing to give us copies of that so that we can look at that ourselves and the other one I Know she has a fraud now\nDuring the confirmation during her testimony the lawyer said right there there were pro bono if she catches one set of golf on me page at cruise even more that she's up front and and I also like to make an announcement here on the corner on the corner show\nMy my I I Am a hundred percent positive but after that she's got a shop on the view as she is not going to be a neat little squeaky models that testified there in front of that committee\nTony did you find it strange that she never shed a tear\n... one shoe not one here nothing\nNo but what I found a way that my wife and I ... different locations where we're looking you know she was laughing and\nGiggling she's laughing and so just ruined my life and I'm traumatized forever Tony Tony ... called Tony [laughter]\nYeah oh I Do my coffee coffee gotta have my coffee she was the biggest fraud going and I you know you just look and you know what\nThose people at Fox ah like we as a wallet oh she's totally believe all this is bad for the Republicans it out and it just it just showed me how they turned you know like oh and that people will keep on saying this all she she's a legal just credit I don't know I don't know what\nThat only watch Tony let me ask you this yes\nIf you were allegedly sexually assaulted or molested or whatever and how this all the breakthrough was your session with a therapist let's say six years ago and you're now testifying in front of a committee and I said Tony I\nNeed to know could you give me the notes of your therapy session which you hand them over where\nWe could create a ...\nOh you bet I ... this was evidence I got evidence right here here it is Jeff air it is\nNow she ... she doesn't want to hand over she didn't want to hand it over that and just want to hand over now so what does she hiding Tony\nHey I came up with it now just ice at a if I wasn't married and have children I said I Would choose Dianne Feinstein of sexually molesting made when you do what they say well great she got a younger guy [laughter]\nThat's what they would say guy does all this is good for your call ...\n... ... ... ... ... what are your best audience indivisible south\nThrough their ... their ... by me punching me if I used by young fine having I don't know sexually harassed me or molested me they say well good luck she's getting a younger man\n[laughter] this is feminism now it's about ... men that can have younger women now it's time for older women get younger men oh look at those what's the matter corner you can handle a rough rough uh a rough raunchy woman determine handled out doing her\nI mean the hypocrisy of double standards is becoming laughable okay coming up next I'll take more of your calls\nYou're not going to hear the you're not going to believe the latest democratic strategy that you're not going to believe that they've got a strategy even if Kavanaugh is confirmed\nHand Kanye West's\nBy the defense tromp on Saturday Night live will we ever hear from him again plus Elizabeth Warren makes a stunning announcement follows that don't touch that dials but first\nLeft wing protestors hold a rally at Boston city hall plaza to sway Senator Jeff flake vote on judge Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation have been hiding rich has that story and B R K O newsroom take it away I\nThis is incredible so you've got red bear Martha my column and then to weasel walks\nOh Christine fork she saw credible she's so believable whoa whoa whoa she's got to seriously everybody's got to take her seriously and then I you know I I'm sad to say this I regret to say this but I used to ... take the next person actually seriously I used to respect him\nAnd I'm Talking about judge Andrew ... who has become now such a rabid anti Trump or\nThat now he wants to burn Trump down at all costs so here you have a judge no less a former judge\nYou know who's supposed to believe and due process who's supposed to believe in the presumption of innocence who is supposed to say you know when you cite witnesses\nAnd they actually repudiate what you say how could you be considered credible in any way shape or form it doesn't matter they went from Chris Wallace there Andrew Nepal a panel listen now to Andrew in Nepal upon all after Christine force testimony last week roll it ... it\nIs it is a moment I mean ultimately as sick of course was saying it's going to be he says she said at the end of the day but by five or six o'clock this afternoon and I think there will be a consensus about\nWho is more believable this is not about I've been saying there's always this is not about the truth this is about ... ability of the two\nAnd I don't want to form a judgment yeah because we haven't heard of paint from judge Kavanaugh all of us agree that this witnesses exceptionally credible and ... and ms Mitchell has not latest love on\nThis is not about the truth he says about believability\nAnd you're a former judge are you kidding me with all due respect judge I I I Know him I Know him because of my time in the Washington Times Andrew what are you on crack but really what do you what are you smoking crack\nYou're a judge for God's sakes it's about the truth it's all about the evidence it's all about what happened what\nThe reality is it's not what people believe\nI mean of course PR marketing messaging that's important but a man's life hangs in the balance his career his reputation and it's all about quote believability and you're a judge\nSo let me get district you've got a woman making clearly false allegations\nAllegations that have been disproven by her own witnesses who now we find out has changed her story multiple times who we now know can't even remember the address the location the neighborhood how she got there how she left\nNow we find out that her therapist session was very different than what she told the committee\nThat in fact she says she was an attempted sexual assault was when she was Nineteen and not Fifteen\nAnd it was by four boys and not two boys\nAnd it's a second door that she keeps going on about actually it was built years before she even spoke to her therapist her whole story\nIs BS from top to bottom but it's about believability peak\nThis is about destroying Trump by destroying Kavanaugh and the guy's lost his senses and he's lost his mind and frankly should be ashamed of himself but this is what I find even more chilling and all of you know need to hear this\nThe Democrats have a plan B Trump does not have a plan B for Kavanaugh if Kavanaugh goes down that's it that's it who knows what's gonna happen you have to wait till the midterms but he's got NO PLAN B the Republicans have NO PLAN B but the Democrats they've got a big plan B\nSo even if Jeff Flake\nBy the way he just stopped the President Trump right in the chest\nNow flick has said that Trump is not qualified to be president this is what he's telling the moon bats in Boston you've got protesters at this for some it a event and he's going on about how President Trump is not qualified to be president and they're cheering him on they love this guy\nThey can't get enough of them now as he ... on the president okay but ... what I tell you about rhino Republicans\nThe first socialist was loose suffer the first rhino was Judas but let that go now the Democrats are openly saying\nIf flake Collins and Murkowski even if they manage to get fifty one votes and Kavanaugh is somehow confirmed to the Supreme Court\nRemarkably when the Democrats take back the house in November they're gonna take over or the Senate\nLeft off listen now to liberal New York Democrat Gerald Nadler roll it ...\nThis has got to be thoroughly investigated I Hope the Senate will do so if he is on the Supreme Court ah and and the Senate has investigated than anything else will have to\nInvestigate we would have to investigate any credible allegation certainly of perjury and other things that haven't been properly looked into before\nWhacked the\nConstitution says only the Senate has the advice and consent role so now the Democrats are saying well to hell with the constitution but what the Senate if the Senate won't go after this guy and sent come we will how you don't have the constitutional authority or power it doesn't matter\nWhat we're gonna do is we're going to hold investigations\nAnd then they're gonna go after him\nClaiming that he perjured himself Kavanaugh did by denying that he attempted to rape or sexually assault Christine forward\n[noise] so what they're saying is when we went back the house even if the Senate confirms them we're going to launch investigation after investigation we're going to vent indict him\nAnd then we're going either for some off to the Supreme Court either by having him arrested or we're going to push for his impeachment\nIn other words were taken him out come hell or high water we're taking him out\nSo now they're going to burn not just the Capitol Hill to the ground noxious cabin ought to the ground not just the Supreme Court to the ground now they're going to burn our constitution to the ground now the house is going to replace the Senate\nIn terms of its advice and consent role by politicizing that\nThey are out of control\nAnd that's why I'm urging all of you it's time to send the Democrats a loud and clear message in November\nThat that hashtags me too movement that hash tag resistance movement is now in mortal danger to America and it's time that they be taught in less than we're sick of your dirty tricks [noise] It's Tuesday but\nWe'll be looking backward to find out what the be
