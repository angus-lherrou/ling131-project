E. O. ah of the neighborhoods social network\nNext door a this is Sarah fire and I would say\nCome on one level I feel like this is great news but square they've got fantastic talent and you know their talent wants to be rated by a other companies\nThis didn't bring to mind once last time somebody asks you for a credit card and rent it through a square device plugged into into their phone or maybe ... maybe ... actually I was like I Know I I have one about a four or five months ago so I had to have someone come out to fix a garage door that had broken\nAnd it was actually it was the contractor I said hey you get into semi ... goes not just the pulls up a little thing put you in a swing of just payment that will take care of it and I'm like oh this is great it's easy to set automatically generates a receipt and everything and boom everything's done there I see a lot of contractors using them for their businesses actually interesting because it made me think\nI feel like I saw those things more two years ago than I Do now you see a lot more you see a ton of the square payment platforms in retail locations in particular a lot of restaurants using now I'm a lot of the fast casual places I see him in\nBut it does feel like the ones that are built to go into your phone were more popular maybe in twenty Thirteen and fourteen than they are today I don't see quite as many except again a couple of contractors are that are using them here\nAnd I would say even after the thirty percent sell off its still bend\nHeck of a run since January oh you look at it it certainly hasn't and look I Know anytime you have senior leadership believing it did you have questions hey who's going to fill that role you know that person was there through you know kind of up tick here\nBut you know this this person's there had been there for six years you know this is not a case like we saw with testable were the chief accounting officer left after a month and raised all kinds of questions because why do you leave a job after months the buses nuts this is hey I've been here for six years\nThere's a there's a reasonable case to be moving on I think you know certainly there are questions hey what kind of talent comes in to replace a miss prior just because you know gee obviously did a very good job steering them through not only not appeal but then a few years afterwards\nBut in terms of you know should investors panic because she's leaving I don't know if that's necessarily the case and the cool thing about score you know Jack Dorsey walks into this building and goes to he goes to the left\nAnd the c._e._o. of Twitter warning and then after lunch he walks over to the other side of the building any CEO square vice versa but uh it's pretty amazing that he's doing those two things that maybe somebody will figure out how to put them together next from the uh classification of I guess stories that matter today but likely will not matter in the long term for this company\nSnapchat apparently launching scripted shows on their platform as they try to push original content\nThrough Snapchat my kids are not going to like the ... ... ... talk to me about that because they're the

like a you know this is the man attempting to force content and the advertising that I knew\nAnd it's just so antithetical to you know what's happened all about\nIf you look at snapping and we've talked about this since the company ... went public a couple of years back there's nothing that they do that no one else does their pictures disappear\nThey allow you to text your friends there's

areas hardest hit by hurricane\nBut now the sudden ... because he put out an ad hats\nAnd he's an attention war like the president he's all of a sudden now that that the model spokesperson ... he's the token negro of that of the Trump Administration\nThis is ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously he's clearly has issued either any that hospital alive you know I got the trivialize mental health issues but I mean obviously cognac has taken a turn in a very strange way\nAh this is honestly this is disgusting I mean they should be look just when you thought CNN couldn't go any lower every day\nIt shocked me no really every day it's like no no come on even I mean I thought when you guys were going on doing two segments on the president's private parts\nAnd you know how big is it how small is it how does it look like I really thought when you guys essentially turned yourself into a porn station I thought that you couldn't go lower than that no you just did\nShe just said he's a token negro\nShe's quote a negro who can't read now let me what they're doing now is they're insulting him in the most and they're deliberately call that's why they're using the term negro they're doing this deliberately to degrade him\nTo humiliate him\nAlmost to dehumanize them to shame them in the eyes of the entire African American community\nAnd so and noticed something else this is something the Soviet Union used to do in the Nineteen seventies in Nineteen eighties if you oppose the communist regime literally they would say you're mentally ill blockage we're both communism\nTo have to be crazy to oppose communism so there must be something mentally defective with you and that's why I didn't want them all institutionalized notice now how Kanye West is a mental case well he's got mental health issues I don't mean to trivialize it but he's just not right in the head I mean why else would you be supporting Donald Trump\nI mean just because he's brought back millions of manufacturing jobs forgive me hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs millions of jobs just because he's starting to really tackle the crime rate\nJust because now you have historically black unemployment ... why would somebody like him ... who lives in Chicago\nWho comes from Chicago sees what's going on in Chicago see what's been done to the African American community or over the last twenty five years especially under Obama or things did not improve but in fact got worse and he looks at somebody like Trump and he's like hey\nJobs are coming back manufacturing is coming back we finally got a law and order president wants to clean up crime and clean up the streets you know what this guy's not bad\nFor all Americans but for the black man in particular this guy's done a lot\nAnd instead notice he's mentally ill and now the reason why they're going that low is because apparently he did have some kind of a break down while ago but imagine this flip it\nWhat if he was a staunch anti Trump or a leading member of the so called resistance do you think they'd be cracking jokes about him not being right in the head\nDo you think they'd be going on about him having mental health issues no no no no you wouldn't even hear about it\nBut now he's crazy he's a traitor to his race he's an Uncle Tom and they use now now the N. word is coming back to the negro work noticed oh no they like to use that word just\nTo stick it to him to shame them to humiliate them you know what I find incredible you want to see the hypocrisy and double standard here I mean it couldn't be more naked Taylor Swift when she\nGoes out and defense transgender rights when Twitter swift came out and said vote against Trump and the Republicans go out and support Democrats all Taylor Swift is brave oh\nShe's courageous she's our role model for young people everywhere we love Taylor Swift they can't get enough of Taylor Swift the media can stop praising Taylor Swift enough by the way I think our music sucks to be honest with you but let that go okay shut up and sing but let that\nLet that go by Kanye West is insane notice\nTaylor Swift defends the Democrats she's a hero she's a heroin she's brave she's courageous there's nobody greater now that they're under swift ah Kanye West we'll sees a race traitor\nHe's an Uncle Tom he's a low life these crazies meant the mentally ill man you should be dragged off into an institution\nThey're trying now to do to him what they did the Kavanaugh they're basically honestly they're trying to cabinet the guy he's been cabinet\nSo now it sees mentally ill he's unstable apparently his marriage is now on the verge of of breaking up or his wife Kim car does she wants to leave him you know what really sticks in their craw\nIs that you've got a billionaire like Kanye West a pop culture sensation along with his wife ...

witness statements from the ... as they call the pedestrians to learn what occurred from their perspective\nAnd according now to a spokesman for the multi ... county district attorney's office that without additional witnesses it is going to be difficult to build the case against the driver of the silver Lexus\nBut having the pedestrians is statements might strength in the case against the driver so prosecutors can maybe bring a really strong case against the guy\nThe information provided by those individual ... that the Fox is important and it would be optimal to provide the information to the mall Norma county district attorney for their review\nSays spokesmen sergeant Christopher ... early it's important to note that the video may leave questions that cannot be answered

goes down the street and you can see the mob chasing running after him yelling swearing with batons and then they're stopping on his car and then they're selecting a smashing his car\nAnd the police want to charge him\nFor what\nLike what honestly what is he supposed to do when you're surrounded by a Ninety four black lives matter mob I guess what the Portland mayor and the local Portland police

I'm researching findings and\nCheck it out because it was something that I started applying but what I've also found is that conventional wisdom when it comes to health and nutrition and in western cultures\nIs that we've got a lot of things wrong but the one thing that he constantly reiterate is that fat from animal products in the cholesterol contract has little or no effect on your body\nBut as far as but joined the cows fine John Kerry faring\nToo much it's it's leading to a guy got global warming and climate change John what are you going to do their rear ends John what are you going to do\nBut will answer that Iran would cost them set climbed the trees the Buffalo's that were free range the cross all up north America every type of an animal including ourselves as human beings has flatulence for some kind justice and so I mean what what are you going to do are you going to walk around with a special set of\nAmazon you can take the methane gas out of the atmosphere is just so ridiculous and that's\n[laughter] that's why I said I had that I got excited when you've touched on this because I like I said I could kill two birds with one stone I could point out the the lunacy behind us and also if you were a bit of information 'cause I Know like you have had health problems and\nYou know he ... you know this this doctor headed to our touched on it in his writings how you can basically reversed type ... diabetes but I gotta warn you Chuck\nI'm Dr grace and even the ... might take a take offense to this because one of the things that he points out is that a lot of the carbohydrates that we have in our diet is what's causing all of this and I know your wife's the town and so I don't want you to our\nOwn able to hold on John I got that you're saying I got to give up the pasta\nYeah might have to benefit for your health but I'm just staying check it out and I would highly recommend for one deplorable to another ... feet up on it or at least check it out and and see it may help you and and you know it it gives you a lot of good Jeff\nI'll just we need jobs bring it here and as he put it I've got the stones because I don't care to tell people that do you know ... ... to their face what we should be doing and that's why make to make a I also where the make America great again at I'm not afraid now what I found very interesting and very telling\nIs how he says Superman is his favorite superhero it's like a Superman Cape for him when he puts on his ... hot but notice\nThe lack of a father figure\nNotice how we says you know his parents brought they divorced when he was very young you never really had a strong male role model in his life notice how he talks about how we miss is playing catch with his father\nUm [noise] I don't know it's just when you listen to that he almost looks to the president and looks to Trump as a kind of father figure as he's a leader he's a male\nHe's got a forty he's got conviction he's got courage all of these sort of traditional male traits\nAnd he admires that she looks up to that\nHe's almost saying I Wish I had a father like that somebody who'd be tough but fair somebody who'd be strong somebody who carry himself a with conviction with passion with courage who would encourage me and not be afraid to speak his mind\nAnd so I thought that was extremely interesting how we kind of almost looked up to Trump admire Trump and almost sees them as a kind of semi or cause I father figure okay Brittany do we what else do we have I Know we've got some other cuts\nDo we owe how 'bout that the Trump calls him a smart cookie play the play that when the recall some smart cookie\nTrump has said that he does have something that has not even saying we're we're ... we're going to discuss I didn't mean to put your life have roads [laughter] mine's a severe [laughter]\nAlso see that one of the Iraqi state from anytime he wants [laughter] ... smart\nCookie smart he gets these guys Jim Brown and he's been doing this for a long time [noise]\n[noise] a Brittany what else do we have\nBrought a kid with me right here I'm this right here is\nThat I play in the water [noise] Hi\nPlay and this is what our president to fire look at this year [laughter]\nYou know what we're gonna have apple America company or the ...\nSeat that's I I mean I I when I listen to that and I I I I heard some of the clips during the break 'em like he's all about American Jobs he's all about\nAmerican manufacturing putting America First American industry American Jobs rebuild America rebuild Chicago where he's from rebuild the heartland and he's looking around saying to the liberals and to the media we doing tearing our president though\nLike catch you see what's going on\nCatch you see the jobs that are coming back by the millions of economic growth pillow unemployment the restoration of manufacturing like ... like it's almost like what is wrong with you people\nAnd the country is doing so good under his leadership so when you attack him you're really attacking the country\nAnd then I have to say this when I talked about almost like a father figure this was actually it was yeah it was actually quite sweet\nWhere he at the end he he kind of looks up to Trump and he walks over to him bringing my overstating there's almost like a bit of a teenage boy or a young boy the way she hugged him at the end he was so affectionate\nAnyway he walks up to Trump at the end he goes across the desk or goes around the desk forgive me he goes around the desk and he walks up to him and he says you know I Love you so much like I really got to give you a hug it's like a heat like he's a huge role\nModel ramp as a big role model to contract\nTania you can see that I Know I don't look up to have yeah who wants to be like ... ... exactly it's like he admires him yeah yeah he he wants to emulate him he wants to be like him I'm sure Trump has probably been coaching and behind the scenes for many years giving advice proud of business or whatever\nBut you can just see the affection that he has form right\nAnd so this park was just I mean it was unbelievable it was really wonderful to see so he that picture alone is what is driving the left insane that Kanye West this cultural superstar this music superstar\nGoes around the desk the oval office desk walks up to Trump with is make America great again hat on and actually hugs the president and the president affectionately hugs him back roll it written\nOn the line I don't want to say I don't want to put you in that spot [laughter] by love this guy right let me give this guy [laughter]\nI Love this guy right there\nThat's what I thought I didn't want to put in that position [laughter] that's from the U.S special guy he's still a special papal\nNow if you think Saturday Night live was out to get them if you think CNN was out to get them\nIf you think the media was out to get them oh man after this they are going to bury this guy I mean forget what they did that Kavanaugh they are going to destroy him\nSix one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight okay let me ask you this what did you make of the press conference what did you make of ... behavior\nAnd do you think he looks up to Trump almost as a cause I father figure and as a role model and will this have a tremendous impact on the youth and on\nThe supporters of cognac the fans of
