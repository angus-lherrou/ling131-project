Activision that there is\nOne uh PF are out there that has some exposure to it at a you know G. A. M. R. as the ticker okay I'm pretty sure it's a\nYou know as a you know like a barely a year but the you know I think there's always risk when you are looking at any ... that are you know such a narrow sub sector yeah\nDefinitely definitely Paula appreciate you coming on as Paul Monica from CNN Business talking to us about take two interactive and the larger video game industry which has just seen tremendous growth polish criminal and had a great weekend\nYou I'm Tucker where do you fit into your do you still game\nI Do in the scheme from take two interactive a Red Dead redemption too is a sitting in my mailbox as we speak is it so it was already out yeah it's a it came out it came out today what's it going to set you back or Rand sixty bucks sixty bucks yeah okay I mean\nI think it's a little rice but but I mean you know what ... what was the ... games cost in Twenty years ago there were only ... forty or fifty yeah there are more likely they doubled and cause no I mean they've kind of gun with what the market dictates for the most part and how much does a console costs of these is a you can get a console for I Believe two\nNinety nine for like an X. box one\nUh let me just confirmed the yeah two fifty nine Ninety nine at Walmart\nSee I guess that's sixty dollars it isn't a huge price point to be an issue but I really\nGet concerned that you know a company like a game like four nights and come out where you literally don't have to put any money down right away there's no cause there's no subscription cost you can buy initial stuff but you don't have to I don't have a game like this competes with that well it it it's different different\nIs it ... I mean this this game is like it's so detailed it's it's ridiculous like it's a whole open world you know literally take you like a day to get across the map among kidding so it's like ... ... it's pretty much like was world yeah your travel on horse and everything and you can choose your destiny you what do you want to be a hero or a villain are\nPretty much like that but in terms of foreign night it's pretty like linear it just like okay this is the object\nYou know your team is to finish in first and that's it and just rent some repeat okay um well this is a it's almost like a movie this is literally Seventy hours of a story around like a movie it's Seventy it's uh Seventy our movie if you play the storyline like that\nBut you know the thing with you know these video game socks itself you know I I'm a big fan of video game now it is because you've seen these kids you know whether it be for night or a game like this\nIt's wide it rain a each group really is just like this is how you socialize\nI was talking to my neighbor ah they've got to take a Thirteen year old son and um you know they were asking like oh and what's he doing right now and his sister was like oh he's up in his room watching Youtube videos of people play video games\nYeah I mean watching for videos that's a whole nother a raise industry itself you know that's twitch which is um you know owned by Amazon and YouTube has its own division to [noise] um but yeah I mean it it keeps these friends socialized pretty much for 'em you know you go on line you socialize\nAs with their friends and you know you're not just sitting in front of a screen and just being a blob like yeah there's an aspect to that but you're at least socializing like people like you you're not just being a loner if that makes sense\nI I guess I understand and I was wrong about this you know I I thought this was just going to be a bit of a bubble and fired back off but merely to grow industry you can now get a college scholarship in gaming ... multimillionaire a twenty seven year old\nSo I mean ... you saw Robert Craft you know and Jonathan crafts invest in the Boston Uprising I Believe it is that which is an e sports league and it's an easy sports team they invested\nYou know a hefty chunk of money into that team and you know these are sponsored players are re gamers that are getting paid you know hundreds

earnings reports from Amazon\nAnd Google not looking too good either we also had a pretty interesting GDP report coming up this morning or the total number on the top line was about in line with

I tell you or do you I'm sure you agree with me I'm even though we all are worried about how we're tracks and an hour watched by cameras all around us whether they're on red lights are on storefronts\nBut when someone like this is on the loose and they're doing things to inspired terror and our country or this is where it comes in handy and I'm really appreciative on days like today for all the technology whether it makes us nervous\nYeah no you're absolutely right and I do agree with you about that um look this is this is not intrusive into his private life um without justification or probable cause this was a using the technology in public place\nThis is uh the other part of it is that there was one report that maybe there was a ... something left on one of the packages\nOr that gave them a clue as well so\nI'm his own mistakes in part led to his being caught anyway and um the huge ability of law enforcement to find people now um I Hope will deter other people may be the one good thing out of this\nIs that other people who might have thought about doing this will be deterred because this guy was found within a couple of days of starting this horrifying event\nAbsolutely and you know we you know we've been a very critical I'm On I'm On the president's side as a Republican about ah the Pfizer warrant process and and how it was abused or but this is why are you know the the Pfizer warrant process was created this is why\nThe Patriot act was put in place it doesn't matter if it's a domestic terrorist or someone from a foreign country who was trying to commit terrorism in our country or this is why it's there and while we've been I've been very critical of the of the Pfizer warrant process I've been\nUh upset about how the president was spied upon\nA ... during his campaign or but now we understand why you know with the FBI at its best law enforcement at its best and government at its best because of course the first and foremost duty of our government is to protect American citizens and I don't care if these\nDevices were designed to go off are not terrorists terror thank goodness none of them were live bombs but I I got to tell you the fear is still the same\nThere's no question about that and then the uh the the the charges might be different if these were intentionally left as placebos in a unable to be activated\nBut it's still terrorism you're right it's still a look at it still aggravated assault um and and if anything because\nUh uh salt is putting somebody in fear and obviously every one of those people I'm sure had to be put in fear that the well this one got stopped well what about the next one my name is on a list meaning Cory Booker meaning\nI'm Robert De Niro meaning a Clapper or Brennan or the CNN headquarters whoever it might be\nSo they're all they're all put a notice and basically in fear for their safety\nNo doubt and of course there's no other explanation for this and then uh for some kind of lingering\nAnd triggered a mental illness\nOr what kind of a person would want to instill terror in fear and others and in this case uh you know our entire nation has been focused on this and really concerned about this I don't care about political disagreements I don't agree with a lot of people that serve our country but they serve our country\nAnd many of these people are elected officials who are in in place because\nTheir constituents put them there I don't care if you disagree with them you can disagree civil e you can disagree politically but to actually try to instill terror whether you attempted\nTo maim or injured or killed people are not ah to me it's completely disgusting or and I I I'm really uh uh interested in seeing how the the FBI conclude this investigation\nAnd of course we'll ... we'll know more about this individual as well and and learn whether he had the colleagues involved in this also but you know there's another element to this and that it gets that now that we've got apparently the guy in custody the other element of this Michael is the\nFallout from the media you know what they're going to say a here was a wacko Trump supporter\nTaking his advice from his speeches and they're going after the opponents and the fake news organization or I I Want to just put it in context because\nThey said nothing about Bernie [noise] when the shooter or shut up the members of Congress playing softball practicing for the game and Steve ... came within an inch of getting killed or they say nothing about that to connect Bernie but aren't they going to just connect the president to this\nAnd this and that more just fake news coming out\nI I I think you're right I think they're going to try and draw a direct line to the president of the United states a line they could not draw because apparently there and without a bank or when Hodgkinson\nShot down those congressmen and policemen on that softball diamond in Alexandria, Virginia I'm I'm quite I'm quite certain I'll be on CNN's\nAnderson Cooper tonight are discussing this I'm ... I'm this'll be the topic I'm sure\nAre but here here's the the the thing that you've noted which is really important\nImmediately after our congressmen gleefully so gravely wounded in by the way nearly lost his life and has been his wife has been forever alter but after that happened\nThe Republicans and Democrats in Congress closed ranks and held hands and sang cool by and set up the issue one of us face you all of us if they attack one of us they attack all of us but I can almost predict that we won't see that kind of unity\nIn the days that follow or to close friend I went to an election for politicians to unite for any reason\nAnd I think regardless of what happens with his investigation of whether this is even the man or not you know it's quite possible that this is miss fire sorts on the investigation into these\nAre our FBI who are really on edge and really we're not they'll make arrests pretty quickly if it's even smells like a pretty uh uh uh a likely possibility\nSo we have to all sit back and wait and watch and see what this person is about if the if they acted alone there's the ... ... it is indeed the person\nBut I can guarantee you when I'm On there is an Cooper tonight or there'll be pointing fingers\nWell and and I know you'll be there a standing up for the president but yeah but if if they don't look at it this should be bigger than even an election two weeks away or a week and a half away\nAt this should be bigger than that uh they should hold hands and listen I don't blame Bernie what's that guy did any more than I Would blame the president wants this guy allegedly did so\nYou're absolutely right and and back to the point I'll Try to make today and then the ensuing days or as we talk about this um uh but it's clearly a talking point is being advanced um uh and I'll tell you\nThis fellow whoever he is a a and the people he may or may not have worked with a ... they have absolutely terrified not just one side of\nThe political while but both sides right he wasn't just attacking Democrats he was attacking all of us and just like they held hands are in a in the house of representatives on the floor of the house and a absolutely disowned this person\nWho was from ... the a political organization the volunteer side of Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign\nI'm I'm hoping that they can see beyond the obvious political ah advantage that they may be able to gain by coloring that's some kind of a Trump being a inspiration uh but I have no confidence and the politics of our nation at this point to rise above\nMichael you can stay right there and appreciate it just for a few more minutes Michael ... is with us he is a former Trump communication advisor still as you heard the standing up for the president will be doing it with Anderson Cooper are going into the lion's den if you will our number to\nBoston is six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight comments questions thoughts about this I'm\nA legit bomber if you will that's under arrest and we're glad to get your calls from Michael ... who do you have questions for him feel free to present them now at the voice of Boston W. or kale it's coming up to twelve Nineteen stay with us\nA special announcement and the women in Boston I have a new home [laughter] [noise]\nOh gee [laughter] involved\nAnd ...

now the suspect a politically savvy person\nIf uh you know he won't say a conservative and he doesn't like the left or you you just wouldn't do this it's just not a lot of other things to do\nSo um so that there's no doubt in my mind the only thing you would do is help the American left what their propaganda campaign so\nYou know if this person is a conservative I got to be a wacko there's no question about a\n... by the way has been previously arrested for making terrorist threats and he was known to law enforcement so this is not the somebody was\nUndercover evil is that it's not a

with Iraq a bomb and we elected Obama anyway\n... never held the Democrats accountable for having an actual terrorists to be close friends with the president\nAnd and the bill layers to this day

J. hello\nThanks for taking the call and like look good as any anyone verified this guy voted in the last election and the only reason why I'm asking that is that all of these so called devices were sent to prominent Democrats\nWould it would make it appear that this guy or maybe as a ... trying to uh put the Democrats full of his victims ah\nI I understand that that's the way the election that's certainly one argument that that's why right now all a bit of speculation you're right that could be the case or it also could be the case that he's a wacko on the other side we don't know the only thing we do know that if he did it and again he's been arrested but he's not been found guilty is not even\nBeen charged or what's he's charged I think there's more freedom to talk about the about this guy in different ways but right now all we can say is that whoever did this if it more him\nHe is in fact a wacko and I the other interesting part of this is that he's already been arrested for making terrorist threats in the past\nSo it seems to me at least that we have this um\nUm background on this guy and whether he did this act of these packages or not he's got a very shaky back around to say the least or he was also known to law enforcement previously and his local area lives in Avon tour a Florida\nAnd I'm outside of Miami's a former New Yorker\nAnd um that's where we are uh I just think that um as the as the FBI\nUnveils more information about him and they're going to do it\nA advisors lead to make sure gets done without compromising their investigation because there's still an investigation going on they want to know if other people were involved\nMaybe had help in getting these packages on maybe they were messengers who delivered packages or were they just innocent people who he paid to deliver a package or were they I'm a co conspirators with this guy\nOr nobody really knows that yet\nOr maybe the FBI does but we don't know would publicly so there's a lot to be investigated about this guy and uh we need we need to a\nBig one step at a time but clearly a given his background or it looks than the fact that he was arrested looks to be that the we're on the right track and let me somewhere to come back and talk more about this Mike Segal in for Jeff corner good to have you with us is the voice of Boston W. R. K. O.\nPresident Trump is praising law enforcement after the arrest of a man in connection with suspected mail bombs in afternoon ... news speaking at a White House event today the president said authorities have done an incredible job\nAnd a digital a date and time stamping of ah of events that take place or transactions that take place so they can go back and review all of that that isn't that the major part of what's helpful enforcement nowadays\nI think so and also in this case a let's not forget the postal inspection service\nOr since the anthrax attacks in two thousand and one all packages are are are photographed and there's a date stamp and those photographs of every single\nA package so that uh once they had the first one goes through there they'd be able to pull out the other one since and find out a pattern pretty quickly and the pattern of when they uh had the photographs of these different factors that could work backwards to to make an educated guess as to when they were dropped off at the postal ...\nAh and then they could check cameras during that period of time or to see who was in the area and uh I think that would also be a piece of evidence that will see\nA once we'd have a the details some of the details which will probably see later this afternoon the FBI Files and EPA David alone with a criminal complaint\nIs that the other thing that we need to be wary of again assuming this fellow was the right guy who did this is is it I I Would assume there was no doubt that at this moment as we speak the FBI and the other agencies postal inspection and others\nAre doing a complete investigation of whether there were any other collaborators in this matter that or whether they were couriers so might have been working with him or innocent couriers have just were asked to deliver a package or the ones that George Soros is home\nBut for New York for example apparently wasn't male but it was delivered to the home to the mailbox so I'm isn't that something they're checking into now with with respect to collaborators\nAbsolutely uh this individual are clearly resides in Florida but I I Believe there's some yeah some previous connection or residents in New York are you going to be checked his social media they're going to be checking this they will have gotten\nThe search quicker wreck as search warrant excuse me for his phone records\nOr and for a all all of his devices communications devices and computers to see what connections he might have back in New York and if there is an accomplice which looks likely\nA again as we discuss last night and then I think that do have an individual uh pretty quickly in custody or individuals pretty quickly in custody\nYeah um the other thing is the interesting legal part of this again if he's the culprit uh is what the charges would be now if these were a placebos they would just non active\nUm pieces of equipment let's say or that they look like ... but they had no ability to be at night and\nThey will obviously it's still a terrorist act as we discussed the ... aggravated assault that the very least along with any of the accent there any terrorists the laws that have passed by Congress but and this is a federal action because it's interstate obviously I'm would there be a a distinction between\nWhether these were actually capable of exploding versus being a placebo and not being able to explode\n[noise] right I went back in and look that up last night after you and I chatted Mike uh\nAnd the way that the this portion of the national firearms and explosives act is worded\nIt says quote a combination of parts which makes a bomb so even if it was in the upper bowl of all the components were there for a bomb they could charge them or with possession of bomb making materials that could possession with construction of a bomb they could and they could\nOr they could charge him with mailing a a bomb you know to the the federal mail systems interstate commerce so uh I think they're able to make a charge against him for possession of explosives or under all the usual statue which I think he's Eighteen USC eight forty two um but\nBut uh as we also talked or there's also the fake bombs statute won't oil and the federal so a criminal code at Eighteen USC thirty five which specifically talks about\nAh you know the bomb hoax type situations so uh I don't think they need that one uh but that certainly there\nAre things that are that are are unable to prove that this was that he had all the components of Obama here and then as as we also a suggested a I think this is a pretty clearly a case of domestic terrorism\nYeah I that's I'm a clearly the case of given the nature of what this individual did with these multiple packages\nOr and going after a certain targeted people of a similar philosophy and of course that's going to have to be investigated as well as to what the motivation was and what was behind that uh what side of the highly is if it if it happens to have a political motivation will have to wait and see how 'bout you made a point earlier that he he had prior\nActivity or the police were aware of him\nAnd he had been arrested for terrorist activity previously you know the bomb threats so uh this is not somebody who just came into this game\nAs a novice you know you'd you'd scratch your head and say why somebody all of a sudden coming out of the woodwork well apparently this individual whether it did this or not ah certainly had previous activity that caused the police to arrest him and to keep them under there's there um as suspicions so to speak\nRight I think you're going to a really important\nPoint here Mike and that is I don't want your listeners to confuse motive and intent a motive is important I think they can prove motive from you know the pictures we see on the side of it was banned from what are we possibly did earlier\nIn a previous bomb threats but remember prosecutor doesn't have to prove motive showing an overall motives strengths is the prosecutors case that answers the question the jury's mining and probably in the public's mind as to why he acted\nBut oh prosecutor has to show is intent and in this case the intent is to\nA course or intimidate me and so the government or civilian population or change the conduct of governments are which considering the size of the reaction to necessarily reaction both for investigation and for for the prevention or certainly as happens\nYeah and I you know it's ironic because it may have the opposite effect that he wanted if in fact he was trying to\nDiminish the effectiveness of let's say the Democrat Party and we do know that yet but um if that was his intent um he may he may have a acted against his own self interest in that regard which is another interesting side light and that had not relevant to his\nCriminal activity but certainly\nAre interesting in terms of political science will come right back general if we can do that ... McDaniel is with us he is the associate dean\nOf the ... school of law at western Michigan university\nOr he is a former government official in the area of the anti terrorism activity works for homeland security he was deputy assistant secretary for homeland defense strategy prevention and mission assurance so he's here with great expertise and we're glad to get your calls when we come back we'll take your calls for general McDaniel\nAt six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight on the voice of Boston W.

R. K. O. hello\nHello how are you today good\nTo have a question wouldn't it be in the best interest of our country just set up a like a welfare office in the country that the Caribbean is cut off from the people only making five dollars a week he gave them twenty dollars a week long they stay they asked where they come in here and it's caught in a ... billion every year\nWell the ... I I mean as a practical matter it's a good question but it would be totally inappropriate I mean it would set a precedent that we go to other countries\nRight now the ... well the number one what is it coming across\nThat border be run by our government and the not the government is wandering all the money there with\nThat but the but but that's sovereign territory we can just walk into another country and give people money\nI mean you'd have to you know the government cooperation I'm ... and then to start doing that that was so then what happens if somebody in ...\nUh says hey wait a minute you given those guys money were in worse economic shape than they are give us money come here open up an office here I mean pretty soon as we get foreign aid that's supposed to take care of it\nIt'd be really stopping the probably still get me these people come and buy the ad on the TV program at Fort\nFour thousand cross the border we take I mean and it cost us a million dollars a year and a lot but\nI understand your look to your point is well taken a and the the what you're trying to get done is an accomplished is well taken but we've we've really got to do\nIs what we should have been doing which is that you set up strong borders people enter because we allow them to enter not because they arbitrarily previously and the other hand to leave without authorization to enter\nA illegally by the way under title eight section Thirteen twenty five of US Code I thank you for the call and I I understand the point\nBut the real issue is\nUh the we have to close the borders the Democrats are never going to agree or even to pay money and and the other countries because they want them coming here as votes in the future even though they're coming in illegally that's what they want and that's why they support them will come back with much more Mike Seeger Jeff corner the voice of Boston W.

R. K. O. hello\nHello Mike how I Am it's good to hear your today I'm yeah I'm always wonder if you talk about down the bomber that they caught um first of all I Want to correct the term bomber ... nothing has been bombed and I hear on\nI don't think anybody at all I'm a bomb or I think they call them and I and that's what\nThey they're referring to the bombers the in fact I was watching the five yesterday on Fox and uh wind Williams turns of all I'm drawing them down usually when he said it's not a fan that guy I Do I turn it back he referred to as\nThe bombing and now I was surprised Dana Perino she responded to him and she didn't pick up on that they only ... they're referring to this guy has a lot of um you know politicians in the media especially you know the last media\nWhich is most of it is the bomber in and I and I was watching Fox and I think it might have been ... on it was in the evening the gay whoever it was like the ... they had to America's leading experts on\nA ... homemade bombs are retired and they were high level people are actually designed these bonds in the military for law enforcement and they rose up the ranks to real high level um [noise] I'm I'm ... ... people hound hunting down these bombers\nI'm thrilled bombers well anyway they saw\nThe photographs and they said they actually showed on on the news X rays\nOf the um the packages of the bonds and photographs and they were laughing these guys are like at the highest level you can be um and they said\nIt was harm you it stop there was nothing in to explode\nUm even if you know ... ... and the ... red and green wire sticking out of it you know it was like Hollywood props\nRight [noise] how they did not know each other and I know but if that's true um and it may well be that they really\nMean he had to leave the experts in the country ties and they both they didn't know each other and they were green\nAnd I understand and if if but if that's the case then the charges would be possibly different I mean that is still aggravated assault could\nBe could be yeah terrorism or something you know because if you try to instill fear in somebody I guess you could call it Cara but to the point is I I'm I'm just having a lot about the bomber the buying the ... even ... Williams that idiot that the bombing and nobody picked up pointed out enough I that was\nAll I think they certainly there's no bomb obviously and uh right now at least you know that triggered now and you don't know what\nI used to a gentleman or you know like I'm ... I hear ya they and they had they had no more\nThan Hollywood props there was nothing in them that could even explode if you know\nAnd you know I Know you just have to emphasize\nYou've already made that point and I appreciate it um and if if that's the case and we didn't get an official yet but if that's the case\nThen his ... the the only they're just might be different but it's still an act of terrorism to create the level of fear in people the way this guy did um my ... my frustration would be that Cuomo and the ... the governor mayor of New York\nCalled it a terrorist act but they wouldn't call a terrorist act the guy driving down the street on the sidewalk in New York where he killed eight people in his van just driving over them\nI mean all of a sudden this is a terrorist act but that wasn't give me a break please Steve a new report or knew very rather you run the voice of Boston that we are hail hello Steve\nHarvey how're you doing this at the very well calling about is you're talking till that our about taping\nI Am a commercial fisherman and I tried to take ... by the United states coast guard and they get really infuriated until you do not Cape much because of some of the illegal acts that appointing teams of the United states coast guard have done to American official at\nAll you should be able to table or for that matter a there should be body cameras and look I I I had a\nLaw enforcement and they were involved in law enforcement is that there were military group but they're involved in law enforcement should want to have the video to prove that they did everything according to the book I mean that's protection for the officer right\nThey don't want that she had Cruz put out on deck and well below freezing coming out out of the folks in this case and they're helping them with M. sixteens at all and you try to tape that and they'll take care of her away from them\nFrom you know that's how bad things that come with them\nAbout all the government but just the ... of the United states is extremely that like the stop all\nWell all I can say is that there should be the right to tape it's a public event it's it's ah an event where they are holding people under their control\nAnd um to avoid any record of what they are doing would just conjure up to believe that something suspicious is going on as you're describing so I a constant\nIt's almost it's happened many times and no one knows about it although the ... and like ... ... ... no the only the stand up to them\nThen that should be brought to the attention of the higher ups or if it's a matter of policy uh that should be brought to the attention of higher ups they they should have body cameras on them that are operating so that when there is a stop or there was a record of what they're doing\nSo that um and I as I say it again and I appreciate the call and I thank you for it they really\nNeed to um protect themselves and listen I think a ... any police out there who want to call feel free but isn't it better to have a body camera operating so that if anyone makes an allegation if somebody stopped for a traffic stop for example let's say guy stops a woman and all of a sudden she says he tried to sexually harassed me\nWell if you have the body camera of the entire incident and there's nothing like that happening this woman's out for lunch\nWas what was wrong and she could face charges for false malicious allegations so to me the person in charge of the the authority would be the one who would want to\nOkay well that that part's true I appreciate the call and I thank you oh at least we agreed on something good to have you with us Mike Segal in for Jeff corner of the voice of Boston W.
