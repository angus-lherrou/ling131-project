SSI PC an advisory services offered through security is an American advisors and carry on from representative Armstrong advisory group and the securities America companies are unaffiliated\nWith news is going to break and we're here to break it down and show what it means to your portfolio the financial exchange with very Armstrong in ... on the financial exchange radio network\n\nWith textures that are telling us that neither the list portion of the ... so he leaves the driver of five ... ... he gets the entire driver or she is the case may be the entire ... [noise] that's good to know the top\nOne percent of earners paid a greater share of individual income taxes thirty seven point three percent truck than the bottom Ninety percent combined that thirty point five\nAnd ... and in particular then if you stretch that out the top three percent a of individual followers paid more than the entire Ninety seven percent combined while they paid you know fifty percent more effectively if it's rather crazy when you look at it here\nI'm just how much the top one percent and top point one and so on pay the big reason why is because there's such a great wealth disparity in income disparity between them has the pop all out there is half the population pays no income tax right yes exactly um and this isn't changing anytime soon\nNo probably not well what about if wages go up right there if if all of a sudden the guy making forty grand a year as making sixty Seventy start paying some taxes\nSo the the key thing those are those wages for the average person going to go up faster than they do for people at the top and and if they if wages go up\nI think you might actually see\nIt I I for the first time in in probably thirty thirty five years I think you are going to see higher wage increases for service provider people that actually do things as opposed to for paper pushers 'cause\nThe the the the investment bankers and the financial sector has been making a fortune for Thirty years I think that's about to change I think it is our line\nIs I think the the need to get things done right people when you look at your high school graduating class how many of them went in to become electricians plumbers carpenters not a ton probably\nMeg Whitman how about you talked to John ...\nI'll tell you what so my my second cousin who lives out in Michigan ... she's seven sixteen or Seventeen years old now she can become a welder yeah couldn't be like I heard it a couple of weeks ago and I was I'm like oh that's awesome\nBut they know my my point is we we have ... ... is a large gap\nWhere people didn't go into trades and physical work I think now we've reached the tipping point where those physical workers whether you're UPS driver whether you're a welder a carpenter electrician or a plumber you're going to say hey if you want me to show up I'm not showing up for twenty thirty forty bucks an hour it's gonna be sixty is going to be eighty it's going to be a hundred bucks an hour\nI agree on that but I also think that the people at the top and they're not going to see themselves making less all of a sudden\nOn relative basis I think their rate of increase will slow compared to the bottom the bottom fifty percent I think the the masses just because of demographics and demand I think it's going to change\nHe had the whole generation you guys you you're ... like when you went to high school was there did you take shop class did you learn how to wire or do a lot trickle we're now working in a car and pottery those classes there was a car class available and there was like would shop and stuff but I didn't do that\nI didn't watch out for two years actually you know I wasn't very good at it but I did it will never be a carpenter my\nPoint is when you need to hire a carpenter your and pay for it\nI I agree I just I I don't see anything that changes that slows down you know overall growth for the top end in the long like I I just I I don't see it like what what changes there\nI think that change isn't so much on the top and slowing as it is the bottom end right rising which has the same that affect it does so if topping ... let's say top and wage growth the top one percent it's been growing at five percent then that means\nThe the the workers that I'm referring to skilled trades people I think you're going to see them growing at ten percent or more rapid rate did because there aren't enough of them they just you try hiring some tried getting electricity to come up to your house so\nIt's it's tough though if if if you can find if it's two hundred and fifty bucks for basic service called where they're in and out in twenty minutes yeah you know you're you're is just the way it is yeah it's\nI I agree on all that I just I in this world today I don't see things changing that quickly on the top and the one that's that's the thing is I I still see the top and have the

years to go anyway what happens in a TV or the days when it BP whenever exactly whatever happens in the piece that he's going to be the I looked at my cheekbones if she's an Indian style with it I'm an Indian\nI'm marking down my box now I Want to see our fire me now [laughter] let's go to Gina in will burn Europe Mets Gina\nGuy I'm like I'm sure you know which half is yet to coach it for that but um\nThey had an episode not that long ago it's hysterical I think it's called the holiday episode where one of the characters is sitting on the couch and he sees DNA ads and he decides he wants to see if he can make themself minority so\nWhen he did was he threw a big party so there was all these witnesses there and well all the people with downstairs and he went upstairs where he had a Native American guy hiding in a bedroom\nAnywhere in the bedroom and ten kids the guy for like five minutes so we had this live out and then he went downstairs made a big show of spending and\nCut the fun of everybody so that they would be no question that that was actually his saliva going into the cup and then it came back you know things Native American if it's hilarious I I think that's exactly what Elizabeth Warren did\nYou say a gene in a nutshell you think this was wrecked Oh absolutely ... absolutely\nOh I'm so with well Gina I mean look think about it if you got to go back pen generations I met the guy who does the test says you know can't be a hundred percent for but you know it looks it looks good so I mean if you go back to you know you want to go back ten generations I can make you anything\nLike religion and what do you want to be all do or what do you mean they're not what Jeff I'm big on a ... guy but you know his parents are a little old fashioned they're going you know religion or marry somebody who's Italian hey guess what kind of generations ago Gina [laughter] you're not believed as [laughter]\nAs his came back more Neanderthal than she is a Native American and I would attest to him being Neanderthal as\nWell [laughter] you know [laughter] I wouldn't\nSay that he would claim that he is in the end of thought that it came back more that she has so you know these things you just to go\nAnd thank you so much for that call okay on her website Elizabeth Warren now has has tweeted out a link to a video where Trump says that's not what I said about the thousand dollars to where you know charity over choice and she writes underneath that this is what a liar\nLooks like so here's a woman unbelievable talk about what spot here's a woman\nWho lived to get a job in Pennsylvania Who Lied to get a job at Harvard who falsely claim to be a Native American Indian and then by the way once she got tenure\nAt the drop I mean that's a drop of a hat on a dime went from being Native American and minority to being Caucasian and who was used that to advance herself in her career and she's calling Trump a liar\nNot only that but she's but it says having some memory pop problems at the real Donald Trump should we call for a doctor\nSo basically we shouldn't probably like he's senile yeah\nDon't tell me she's not running in twenty twenty you better believe it she's running in twenty twenty\nAnd you want to know how I Know I think a major reason why she decided to release the DNA test results of the bogus tests today was to kill the news cycle and distract\nFrom a huge Washington Post story what was that story what's really going on here I promise we'll continue to talk about it next but first quick news break Trump says he's looking forward\nTo facing Elizabeth Warren and twenty twenty if she decides to run and hide and rich has that story is that they'll be working on newsroom taken away heaven\nSeventh she doesn't even have honestly the decency to pretend don't want your vote so she knew that if that story ... it's it's been published but if that story got picked up here in Massachusetts a lot of people would say hey blanc you\nBlank you even many Democrats would say hey blanc\nYou I mean you think you're going to take his of that for granted\nNever mind you're not into state never mind you're not campaigning never mind you're not doing anything but you're already running for twenty twenty and you have even won this election yet hey whoa whoa\nThat was smack of such arrogance\nOf such sheer condescension of such sheer willful disdain for the people the voters in the interests of Massachusetts the blowback would be huge especially on the eve of a debate with Jeff deal\nThat's why I'm urging deal and I know is people listen to this show Jeff\nAll you gotta do now is say well you're releasing DNA test results boy you're really running for twenty twenty huh are they catch or at least wait till November seventh you think you own a seat it's not your seat it's the people's seat the Scott Brown\nShe's taking you for granted she's never cared for you she's always seen you as a stepping stone so if I were him she's now potentially opened up a major line of attack but\nWant it to distract voters from that huge Washington Post story there's also another important reason listen now to this and this may surprise you and maybe this explains why she needs a lot of attention [noise] CNN\nWho I normally don't trust but when it comes to the Democrats right they are the are the Clinton news network the communist news network they just released their latest poll numbers that is the first major poll for the twenty twenty democratic presidential nomination\nAnd that was also released a over the weekend listen to this who do you think is by far the front runner among Democrats in twenty twenty\nSecond guess take a guess Elizabeth Warren the chief and\nReally just totally OK bottle Kamala Harris and Jeff really\nOkay I don't Cory Booker I Am Spartacus\nAnd Joe Biden\nAnd it's not even close double food drove by Biden is that thirty three percent among Democrats these are likely Democrats who are likely to vote and independence who lean Democrat\nAnd right now by is the clear front runner he is at thirty three percent number two a distant second but these number two is actually Bernie Bernie Sanders is that Thirteen percent\nSo if you combine the two by men Bernie forty six percent\nOld white men VIX dreaded old white men but the Democrats and the progressive and the left keep pounding and pounding and pounding are actually the two frontrunners for the Democratic nomination\nComing in number three Kamala Harris had nine percent Warren is number four in single digits at eight percent\nBookers that five percent ... carries a five percent what I find incredible Michael antimatter you use that one percent\nMichael out of anatomy actually has a small constituency in the Democratic party you want to show a pathetic they become ... that the the sleeves ball scum bags creepy porn lawyer\nOne percent actually think you should be president but anyway let that go what does this mean warns in single digits\nThe media in this state had been inflating how popular she is how like she is how politically formidable she is in reality she can't even hit ten percent\nAnd so she needs a publicity stunt for her to get attention and this is why\nShe's now pushing this whole DNA pass it's so obvious so she is now all in for twenty twenty and the election hasn't even been held in November So let me ask\nYou this that on his question\nThe DNA test results hey do you believe them or do you think she read them do you believe him but more importantly\nIt's clear now she's running and twenty twenty it's obvious from CNN's latest poll that she's in single digits she's not connecting with the Democratic base at least not yet\nIs the stunt list\nI Am a Native American pen generations ago Trump is a liar or pay a million dollars to my charity listen to me stopped calling me Pocahontas because I Am Pocahontas\nDo you think that there's DNA test and the five minute campaign video\nWill this help her among Democrats would help or among the people she needs for support in the primary\nOr do you think it's going to make people even more disgusted and revolted outer cheap antics\nAnd frankly a grandstanding and cheap publicity six one seven six six sixty eight sixty eight your calls in reaction matched the ratings are already\nA special announcement and the women

because\nIt it becomes personal [noise] ah I voted for Trump but I don't think I'm going to vote for him again because you know I end my DNA tests done as well about a year ago\nAnd I have the right in front of me it says I thought it was great one hundred percent mother and father and the test says that I Am forty six percent so European Greece turkey in Albania\nIt said that I'm twelve percent uh east European\nAnd it says that I'm fourteen percent Caucasian\nA six percent from the Iberia peninsula is a Spanish and Portuguese and then it said that I'm six percent from the middle east and it shows the Iran in Iraq and I'm really worried about the travel\nBan that I'm not going to be able to get back into the country so I Know that can support the president and more after this or just because personal you know [laughter]\nMike I got to ask you I mean the Greeks Albanians eastern Europeans I mean I don't want to quibble but aren't they white like aren't they Caucasian or no\nYou know something Jeff that's what I thought too because they couldn't check any boxes every time I applied anywhere but now with this a travel ban I'm really worried let's go through a Logan you know I might be I hurt my family you know I mean I like his policy but [laughter] you know when it becomes personal [laughter]\nDemocrat Ted Wheeler actually released a statement defending antifa\nDefending the police's inaction saying that it's not the job of the police to intervene that they don't want to make the situation worse or inflamed the situation\nAnd so the police did the right thing by doing nothing and allowing a left wing mob to run wild and occupy the streets of ...\nWell they are protesting\nThe shooting of eight twenty seven year old African American a black man by the name of ... he was shot by police officer\nWhat the media is not telling you is that this twenty seven year old man Patrick ... had shot and killed two other people in a shootout\nBefore the police decided to move in but\nThey're basically now angry that Patrick ... was shot by a cop and the cop now essentially the cops the police have essentially ceded downtown Portland chooses to antifa and to the black lives matter and to this raging rampaging mob\nWell\nCounterprotesters have now said enough is enough and so a movement or a group known as patriot prayer or dubbed in the media is quote right wing I don't know what that means but anyway Doug busy right wing group they showed up\nTheir American flags saying we want law and order restored on the streets of Portland and so they went us counter protesters to protest the mayor to protest the police the lack of action\nAnd to protest and T find black lives matter or over taking an occupying the intersections the streets an entire blocks of downtown Portland well word got out that the counter protesters were going to be there\nAnd show empty first showed up in force armed with guns\nExplosives knives baseball bats pepper spray the two sides faced off against each other\nAnd for a couple of hours it was just a tense send off\nBut then according to video footage and everybody agrees on this antifa one antifa member with pepper spray then went around beside kind of vote flunking some of the Patriot prayer people and then sprayed them with pepper spray\nAnd that's when all hell broke loose Brittany rural cut six [laughter]\n[noise] I mean one side was chanting usa usa waving white flags and the other side clad in black with their black mask were chanting black lives matter\nAnd the pictures are heroin you see people getting beaten up you see them with baseball bats with batons with pepper spray I mean they're just and some of them are really taken around the house punches I mean they're just wailing on each other\nAnd it got worse and worse it got so bad the violence between the two sides this is literally on the streets of Portland funny when they get some back alley it's right there on the streets and I'm looking at this by the way and I'm thinking wow it must be great to be a business owner\nTo just see these two are two sides going at one another like this the Street's blocked off chairs flying rocks flying but Don's flying fist flying ... good luck good luck getting any customers are in in downtown Portland\nFinally the police moved in with spray balls shooting artificial bullets we called rubber bullets and they finally managed to disperse the crowd but I'm telling you both sides they were going at it real cuts seven ...\nNow I don't know there's a bald guy with an orange shirt on the Patriot prayer site on the or the ... the side waving the American flag I don't know who this guy is but I think he took down like three four maybe even five and ...\nThis guy missed is true calling that guy can fight\nBut I I don't know if it's boxing or M M A cage fighting or whatever but I'm telling you men can that guy fight and I said I'm looking at this\nThis potentially could be the future of America\nThey don't microcosm just as potentially the future of America\nYou've got street anarchists socialists streets dogs the revolutionary street left incited by Cory Booker\nIncited by Maxine Waters incited by Elizabeth Warren telling them John Brennan telling them overthrow the government get in their face\nOr a cost them harassed some department stores that gas stations at restaurants go after the so called fascists in America\nAnd so you've got them and then you've got the patriots who are basically standing there and saying we're not going to see the streets to the radical revolutionary left\n\nNow Alec Baldwin is now in the news because Alec Baldwin listen now to this he's gotten very famous and he's made a little bit of money out of mocking tromp on Saturday Night live\nWell right after he made fun of President Trump on SNL he flew down to New Hampshire for a big democratic fundraiser and here is exactly what he told eight hundred Democratic Party office holders candidates and democratic activists from all over the country\nQuote [noise]\nI flew here this morning after doing Saturday Night live last night\n\nHe events said he thought it was just going to be three shows that was still the election then he says Trump will be gone three shows it'll be fun but then he turned serious looking to the crowd\nHe said that the twenty twenty Mitt sorry the mid term elections forgive me twenty Eighteen we're gonna be the most important election since the election of FDR\nAnd then he dropped the hammer the bomb quote it is time to overthrow the government of Donald Trump not in a violent way or an unlawful way but it must be overthrown nonetheless\nWhen you have a major Hollywood actor who Trump's priorities tromp on Saturday Night live Alec Baldwin\nCalling for the overthrow of the American government Brennan calling for the overthrow of the American government CNN thanks to fill up mud and other analysts calling for the deep state to overthrow the American government\nCory Booker saying get in their faces Maxine Waters harassed them in restaurants harassed them at airports harassed them at gas stations when you have a lizard bits Warren I Am a charity ten generations ago here me roar\nInciting a crowd on Capitol Hill take over the Senate takeover the offices takeover the floors chase them at the Supreme Court go after Kavanaugh banging on the doors call on the doors when you have this kind of open incitement\nAre you any surprised that the revolutionary violent left is now on the streets of Portland and they are doing battle with their rightwing opposition\nSix one seven three six six sixty eight sixty eight double barreled question\nDoes Hollywood the media and democratic politicians like Elizabeth Warren Maxine Waters and now Alec Baldwin are they responsible for the violence created by the FAA have they given birth to antifa and number two\n\nWhat will be the results in November what you're seeing in Portland is that the future of America your calls next\nAlright v the trip to another hurricane ravaged area\nEasy [laughter] than ... going to Saudi Arabia we got some stuff going on we're not even talking about the DNA tests

kill all those congressional Republicans one man is seriously wounded if there wasn't the Capitol police Rand Paul would be dead and other congressmen would be dead\nBut one of the problem is Trump\nWe we trade anecdotes right\nNow I'm a train an adult dose on giving facts how about let me ask you this\nHow about when antifa practically burned Berkeley to the ground because conservative speakers were invited to speak on campus and they were ... they were beaten by antifa cars were overturned banks were destroyed ATMs were destroyed literally buildings were set on fire no\nThat can't get a condone that but when Trump said\nDuring whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa\nWhat about Maxine Waters saying go after him go after him in the department stores go after my gas stations go after
