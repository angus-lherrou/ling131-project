Supreme Court confirmation process outside the White House today the president said capital is a great man who got caught up in a hoax and charade created by democratic\nWas all made up fabric and I really do you know\nAnd another swearing in ceremony for the Supreme Court justice will be held later tonight at the White House means on President Trump says he has no intention of firing deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein the president said in the White House lawn this morning that in Rosenstein has a very good relationship\nAnd Michael good when\nNot some wild died radical not some flame thrower not some bomb thrower\nBut Michael good when a veteran columnist at the New York post one of the most respected columnist and commentators in the country read by both conservatives liberals centuries I almost always read his column I always find something important or valuable in it\nIn his recent column for the New York post said after the constant Kavanaugh's confirmation fight with the tactics of the left and the tactics of the Democrats\nHe now believes and I'm quoting directly that America maybe sleepwalking into a second civil war\nAnd in his column the reason why he now fears potential violence ... violence\nAnd he says he is sounding the alarm bell to weigh Thomas Jefferson did in Eighteen twenty as he called the fire bell and the night when he warned of potential violence when he saw the extreme passions on both sides but especially from the secession is the Democrat side than the Confederate side\nWhat Michael good when it's pointing out is that he goes to a book or about World War one called sleep walkers\nAnd in that book the author points out that what led ultimately to World War one was that both sides felt they could keep ratcheting up the pressure ratcheting up their demands thinking that the other side is inevitably going to back down\nAnd when the other side doesn't back down because of actually there'll be a time where they won't back down then you're already very serious crisis and that's when violence tends to her upped well here is now what we've seen over the last couple of weeks and there's no getting around this\nThe Democrats organized a coordinated smear campaign with\nDiane Feinstein Christine Blasey Ford\nHer lawyer Michael Brown which who is the lawyer for Andrew McCabe\nJames Comey who kept writing one anti Kevin ... op ed after another in other words the deep state got involved\nThe Democrats got involved George Soros Scott involved Hillary Clinton Dianne Feinstein all of them put forth these bogus fabricated accusations\nShe completely light and then lead to moralize Trump\nDeborah Ramirez Julie sweat Mick they fabricated accusations against Kavanaugh\nThey deliberately withheld those accusations for six weeks and then they unleashed a media fire storm with the express purpose of destroying Kavanaugh's nomination and if they couldn't destroy Kavanaugh's nomination to destroy his character and good name and ruin his reputation\nThis was a democratic assassination attempt a democratic character assassination from the beginning\nIn fact a writer for Steven cold there one of the many Hollywood liberals who played a hand in this assassination openly said on Twitter we knew the charges were bogus but at least we ruined his reputation\nIn other words at least we bloodied him we let him we damaged him we crippled them that it was all BS and based on a pack of life it doesn't matter\nFurthermore which you now see\nAnd this is I think the really scary part is the left now is completely validating and justifying political violence\nThe death threats to Kavanaugh you had a senator again over the weekend say a Cory Gardner from Colorado a his wife got a text with a video on it threatening to be had her\nWhat shoe now see is the mob trying to take over Capitol Hill\nThe mob incited by Elizabeth Warren openly now occupying Senate offices Senate floors Senate buildings Republicans being run out senators being run out of restaurants senators being confronted and harassed at airports\nYou have the names of senators and their children and wives their addresses and personal information leaked to the Internet\nYou have activists being bussed in in front of the homes of senators to harass them and threaten them at their homes\nWe had a ... Maryland Republican congressmen have the mob break down his door an attempt to extract the assault him in his own office\nThen we had that Bernie supporter\nGunned down Republicans and almost killed Steve skull east at a congressional uh a softball or\nPractice what you're seeing my friends is the radical Democrats now justifying mob rule mob action and out and out political violence and the threats of political violence\nIn fact it is getting so ridiculous I Want you to listen now to Mazie Hirono\nThe Democratic senator from Hawaii who did the Sunday talk show around and openly justified\nHaving Republicans and conservatives being chased out of restaurants why because according to the lips and the Democrats and the Democratic media\nConservatives and Republicans are no different they're indistinguishable from white supremacists and Nazis listen now to Mazie Hirono saying well if you're a white supremacist they're gonna chase you out of a restaurant row cut one Britain\nAnd we don't want to ask you about it you know it is one thing to protest at the Supreme Court to do it at the Capitol that's been done for for generations and frankly since the founding of the country it's another thing to run senators out of restaurants go to their home is that going too far\nI think that it tests will that there are a lot of people who are very very much I'm motivated but what is going on because what might happen very often I\nSuffer right there you know when Obama was in power I was motivated you were motivated\nWe didn't harass Democrats at airports we didn't chase them out of restaurants we threatened to kill Obama\nWe didn't make death threats we occupy the Senate office building in a slam on the doors at the Supreme Court and prevent somebody from a Supreme Court justice from being sworn in we didn't bus people to senators homes and threaten them and their families we didn't do any of that\nSo the fact that they're motivated doesn't mean I think\nWhat you're talking about is out and out violence and mob rule but now listen she basically gives it away in her view and in the eyes of the Democratic party conservative equals K. K. K. roll it Brittany\nWithout a fair process and let them in front of ... after that the fourth accountable for what they've heard of that one that before we don't want to hear from you\nToo if we have to hear from you what about ... hearing of that going no restaurant pat from this is what happens now they because when you look at like ... and all that kind of point in our country there's a ...\nIn our country that is the kind of a activists and that occurs and people make their own as an insane violate the law and that ... a company that\nThis is incredible\nHow can we share the same country if liberals are convinced that they're living among white supremacist Nazis\nShe can't\nThe radical Democrats have now shown they're willing to do or say anything to achieve power\nAnd the country now has become ... radically divided fractured and polarized and so my question to you is this what is your takeaway of the Kavanaugh confirmation fight six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight your calls next\nComing up tomorrow on the ah W ... morning show I'll see if I've recovered from celebrating Columbus Day\nTo be easy [laughter]\nI said that getting it is the most useless holiday ever is an option\nThat I have to be the one that celebrates indigenous people how this works citizen you later\nWhat are they gonna do if Trump gets another chance to pick someone on the Supreme Court\nThey're going to burn the whole thing down\nSix one seven three six six sixty eight sixty acres the number\nPresident Trump says he has no plans to fire deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein team\nHaving heightened rich has that story take it away up and\nTake a jets the president's both reporters\nToday and the White House lawn ahead of a plan discussion with is deputy Asia\nThe enemies off we'll be talking on the line\nAs you likely remember the New York times reported last month that Rosenstein talked about secrecy ... secretly recording conversations with the president but that's a claim Rosenstein denied in the meantime Brett Kavanaugh's now a member of the Supreme Court and his first cases begin this week the opening case for this tournament is an age discrimination case\nAnd cabinets taking part in a second swearing in ceremony at the White House today get a check traffic now Dave\nGarden the downtown ten K. road race is under way from the Boston Common over the ... bridge to memorial drive in the back story expects pocketing restrictions on road closures around their\nDowntown not too bad right now on the expressway north down\nYour stop and go from salmonella up into the O'Neill Tunnel expect delays as well get a home delays I Ninety five south than coming down from Maine and New Hampshire also on ... getting off the Cape right now it's very tough about six miles back out before the shock of more I'm Dave Gardner and the W.

left\nThey have for all intents and purposes now destroyed the Senate confirmation process\nThe media throughout the entire two weeks were completely exposed for the Democratic party activists that they are\nWhat I found to be honest with you may be the most incredible of all of the reckless actions by the mainstream media was that they would publicize\nBlatantly patently false and fabricated claims like that of Julie sweat Nick\nThat claims that on their face are so preposterous ridiculous that Kavanaugh was the ringleader of a gang rape network who was responsible for the mass rape of dozens and dozens and dozens of women\nAnd yet NBC pushed it MSNBC pushed it CNN pushed it the mainstream media pushed it the New York times pushed it\nTheir credibility is zero zero after this the

them a lot of boy it's funny how you know um it's abuse of power when it's when it's not her\nGuy and then um\nWhen it comes to the midterms I think we'll go to see what's happening cabinet we're going to see them you know the mob\nCome after everybody probably a lot worse than that now because they know they're probably gonna lose this one and the last point I Want to make is only ... threats to Republican senators I mean what if you when I made a death threat to Democrats they never see again\nWell Steve you're completely right remember when there was a rally or a protest against Obamacare and somebody put up a Nazi swastika comparing Obama the Hitler one guy one poster though last went nuts the media went nuts\nOr when somebody compared Obama to the joker and the media went completely apoplectic nobody threatened to anybody\nThey just one out of Nazi swastikas the other side of the joke or you know that the villain for Batman right and the media went nuts\nAnd the entire conservative movement the Republicans everybody at the disavow it if not you're a racist you're a big it but they can threatened to kill senators kill Trump killed conservatives we've seem humanity no in fact you're a hero if you do it it's almost a decade now the threatened to kill somebody\n[laughter]\nI mean as you're completely right ... thank you for that call Steve no look to me you want to know the truth abuse of power let me tell you with you there needs to be in and it's not going to happen but there needs to be an investigation there was clearer government abuse of power in what took place in terminal with a capital confirmation\nIt came from Diane Feinstein office it came from the Democratic party\nWhat they did was they were ... the Democratic committee staff\nAlong with the FBI's lawyers remember it's no coincidence remember this is the lawyer of Christine Blasey Ford is Andrew McCabe lawyer who's very good friends with James Comey\nThis was a democratic smear operation from the beginning so Christine Blasey Ford lied they took that lie they held the letter for six weeks they've had the media pounce over the letter they leaked it\nAnd then they had their deep state operatives come up with more lies and more false allegations to try to destroy and derail judge Kavanaugh now justice cabinet\nSo there was clear government abuse of power like there was against Trump into two thousand sixteen election this is nothing has stopped it's the same players doing the same thing with the same end goal\nSo then they did a a deep state operation to try to kill the election for Hillary Clinton and then when that didn't go their way they came up with this bogus story of Russian collusion another pack of lies in order to unleash Robert Mueller\nIn the hopes that he'll find a crime any crime to bring down Trump well it was the same thing with Kavanaugh smear smear smear\nI'm up with a bogus story in the desperate search for something to bring him down so this was a government abuse of power from the get go Jen in Halifax Europe ... go ahead Jim\nHi yes I just want to say that the Democratic party has lost their mind and started to show their true Kate crazy colors or when they woke up November eleventh two thousand sixty uh it it just it they get worse and worse I mean you've got Maxine Waters that says you know that if you see a ... supporter or Republican\nTo basically ledge them um I recently just got a sticker on my back a truck and it's just a classic American flag and on top of it says Trump\nI didn't have that aren't for forty eight hours so someone removed that Trump off at the top of it [noise] um I support my present a hundred percent I Am a hundred percent Republican and it just it infuriated me Ari ordered and your when it's coming tomorrow and I've never felt proud are driving around to support\nThe guy that kicking but\nHe's keeping his promises and everything that he said during his campaign no one is showing on you know any mainstream media about the big meeting that Kim jung or we just had um\nYou know watching MSNBC when Trump was over there meeting with him they talked about not not anything about actually\nCreating peace between two countries and they were talking about the food that was being served they've got nothing if they're just they're they're they're disgusting I married to a Democrat and I can't it just [laughter]\nHe keeps saying oh he's going to get impeached on what there is no ground that's all they have\n... if you don't mind me asking I mean since you open the door and if I'm getting too personal please tell me honestly I really want to respect your privacy and none of your husband but how is it like being married to a Democrat now\nIt's some we there there's arguments um he's and he's you know\nHe he's a human employee and he um you know I can remember a couple it during the election I had to go to the union hall and Boston and there is nothing but you know vote for Hillary and\nI bought a bomb in my mouth\nJust seeing the stickers on the poster from the school it's hard um\nHe doesn't you know I tried to tell him you know what\nWhat is it that you don't like the president what what is it that you know the lowest unemployment rate 'em as it does when your pen sending era nudey statement comes in and it's going through the rope does that offend you um you know you haven't ever lost your job\nUm is that when I told him that with\nTrump to a child tax credit that here we have four children\nI told them that we're getting twenty five hundred dollar fact parts per kid I you know\nWow I yes I\nI mean he's a thousand dollars exactly ... I Need I Need your account [laughter]\nYou're like the couple of my shell\nNow Gen so when you find out that changed which to me the devastating case what is your husband say\nHe says I just don't want to talk about it [laughter] oh well whatever he you know it's not going to last that much longer you're going to get him eat and not only argument\nI and that day that I turned Eighteen I went right down to my town hall and east Bridgewater and I voted Republican and I have never turn my back when I Am proud um I just it ... it I've never felt\nMore power than to put that talked sticker on the back of my vehicle and the habit not even forty eight hours that something like that that's how I just\nWill not start out we live in very Jared J. ... maybe with your husband by any chance\nI you know what I read it was neither my husband or my sister in law [laughter]\nI Know I I had this argument with my mother in law my father in ... park stop\nOn I can remember it was just about two years ago when the whole ... tape came out and\nSaid oh he's got to step away now he just he can't he can't go any further you just gotta walk away from the campaign I said for what just because he said I said I'm a female and I said far more worse than things like\nThat I Know that we're most Stein my husband [laughter]\nLike general\nSo I don't mean to cut you off I have to go phenomenal cauldron phenomenal calling thank you for sharing that with us [noise]\nUm they have the last\nBecause there is no answer\nAll right my friends a lot more to talk about I promise but first\nPresident Trump says Democrats should be ashamed over how they handle Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation you think\nThere have been hard and rich has that story in a way of it\nSomebody's going to get killed I I'm telling you somebody is going to get killed now I'll tell you this\nIs talk is Brian kill means life I don't want to tell them how to run his life I don't like it if somebody would tell me how to run my life but a piece of friendly advice don't take public transportation if you're a public figure that's why I don't\nBecause I'm\nAlways accosted by moon bats wherever I go in public that's why I Try to avoid a public places as much as possible and I definitely avoid public transportation but when you you read the story especially when you watch it on line it's chilling\nI mean you're uncomfortable just watching it you're like if somebody's going to hit them\nSomebody got to beat him up somebody got a bunch of them\nI mean they're getting angrier and nastier and these two are those two liberals are just egging them on\nAnd and and and inflaming them and encouraging them and over what you don't like his political views don't watch Fox\nYou can't stand just political views I don't know write a blog write a letter to the editor write a letter of complaint the Fox news write a column a post something on the Internet denouncing him I mean there's many ways to express yourself but now look at the new pattern\nNow which intimidate\nBully its harass it's threatened violence now is either on the surface or just below the surface now further more the other tactic\nThat the left is now using it's not just justifying and encouraging and excusing political violence and intimidation it's now destroy key institutions\nAnd one of the biggest that I talked about this their secret memos that I Will reveal to all of you on late late late last week well now it's already being put into action\nSo that Democrats were circulating a secret mammal among themselves to the media\nAnd two members on Congress and ... members in the house of representatives and on the Senate and that memo said that from this point forward if Kavanaugh is confirmed we must deal legitimize the Supreme Court\nAny majority ruling that Kavanaugh signs off on we must now use the confirmation hearings against them to de legitimize and discredit any rulings whatsoever\nIn other words we have to deal

end goal now\nWhatever the Supreme Court rules if Kavanaugh is in the majority can no longer be trusted can no longer be respected is no longer considered legitimate why because the Democrats goal is to ultimately as the memo lays out to pack the court\nTo add to new liberal justices to the court so it's no longer a nine member court it's going to be an eleven member court\nSo they can erase the five for conservative majority that tapping on now represents to a six five liberal majority\nIn other words so discredited so got the Supreme Court so tear it down in the eyes of the American public\nThat if the Democrats should win the presidential election in twenty twenty and Congress if they continue to do well if they control Congress and control the White House they will say you know what\n[noise] Kavanaugh is such an evil man Kavanaugh is such a despicable sexual predator and rapist\nThat he should never have been appointed to the Supreme Court and to balance the court to repair the damage to the court to repair the institutional credibility of the court we must now packet with two extra justice\nSo we'll take the fight for conservative majority and will recreate a six five

R. K. O.\nW. R. tale of process and I are\n\nYou know my friends I was just thinking about Mitch McConnell now saying that the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh was the highlight of his career [noise]\nAnd you know I'm not that big a fan of\nMitch ... as I call him a in many ways he is a rhino I Would say more of a global is Republican he's for free trade he's for open borders uh I've seen him buckle again\nAnd then again especially during the Obama years but you know I always get this argument from people well you have to support Scott Brown Jess bum off because half a loaf is better than All right you keep hearing about this so always back these rhino Republicans 'cause you know half a loaf is better than no loss\nAnd for example when it came to Scott Brown or when it came to Kelly Ayotte or whatever I say well where's the half loaf\nBut we're showing me where do I eat where's the hassles big it's like Charlie Baker\n... to me on issue after issue I it Obamacare day chef too many guns they shocked me taxes the shaft to me\nUh illegal immigration a shock to me the opiate epidemic they shop to me a corruption welfare fraud and abuse they shaft so on every issue they shocked me\nSo it's not a half a loaf I'm getting crumbs off the table if I'm lucky I'm getting crumbs off the table sometimes I'll get crumbs off the table but with Mitch McConnell I Do have to say this with him at least you do get half a low you do\nBecause for all of his weaknesses and I'm not afraid to call them out when it comes to Supreme Court justices I don't know what it is with this guy but he gets like a spine transplant\nIs like ... they just sticking a U.S fine and it's like what what just happened to Mitch Mitch has now turned into Winston Churchill for God's sakes\nSo whether it be the way he handled Merrick Garland whether it be now the way he handled ... are now justice dominant than judge Brett Kavanaugh a Mitch ... delivered and I got my half loaf so at least with Mitch I eat\nMaybe not the whole oh it's awful low but at least I eat it gives me something to chew on now\nSusan Collins in many ways they heroine of the hour she was the one who delivered essentially the decisive vote she delivered a forty five minutes speech on the house of a story on the floor of the Senate\nThat was measured that was for oh that was comprehensive\nAs that was frankly learned that was made sure that was intended to try to calm the rabble calm the left wing mob and in many ways she'd defend them\nShe went on issue after issue saying you guys are all jumping the gun you're trying to portray this man as to the right of Attila the Hun is he really to the right to vote to live on and so she delivered big time\nFrom six one seven remember I talked about how left wing activists were threatening Susan Collins her life for family as well as threatening to rape per staffers\nSix once up Jeff rape is evil if you\nPut a rapist on the Supreme Court I Am going to rape you and your staffers\nThat's liberal logic bingo [laughter] bingo that's the moon bats for you so let me just say this okay I I I really want to stress very look I Want to stress is very clearly\nI Am extremely proud for the invaluable role that they show played I talked about it last week whereby we gave pivotal important vital information to the Senate Judiciary committee they called us ah\nPretty much a week yeah week from today [noise] ah their chief investigator did Chuck Grassley committee contacted us\nAnd as you know this show has immense influence I Try to do as much research an investigative reporting as I can to give you the cutting edge on what's going on whether it be in Washington in the country around the world\nAnd obviously what we were reporting here caught the attention of some of the top investigators on grass we've committed\nSo I Am extremely proud that we provided exculpatory and exonerated evidence to judge Kavanaugh and showcase an highlighted the blatant lies\nFalse information false allegations that fabricated I there were fabricated accusations complete fabrications\nThat came from Christine Ford truly swept Nick and Deborah Ramirez further more so I Believe a Kevin ... is an innocent man clearly innocent man who's been the victim of a disgusting political and judicial witch hunt furthermore I\nDo believe he's a conservative I think he's a moderate conservative\nI don't think he's as conservative say a Scalia or say is Clarence Thomas I think he's more a chief justice John Roberts but I still think he is a conservative\nProbably a moderate conservative center right conservative whatever you want to call them but I Do believe he's a conservative however\nAll of this being said I have a podcast up and I'm just you know after the show or whenever I always put up a fresh podcast every day which you can catch at the end of every show or the truth on Trump and this one is called did conservatives get screwed on Capitol\nNow the reason why I throw that out there just for you to chew on is if you listened to Susan Collins is speech because I thought was a very fine speech for too long but let that go was still a very good speech\nWhat did she say in a nutshell here's what she said she said that she spoke with Kavanaugh privately\nThen did several multiple follow up phone calls with Kevin ...\nAnd she specifically in these private conversations asked them about how he would potentially rule on roe v Wade on the constitutional right to same sex marriage on free contraception free birth control and on Obamacare\nAnd according to what Susan Collins said on the Supreme Court sorry on the Senate floor regarding the Supreme Court pick Susan Collins said you know on roe v Wade he basically said to me it's a stylish precedent\nOn the constitutional right to same sex marriage he basically didn't seem interested in overturning that\nOn free birth control I what I heard from him seemed very favorable on that issue on Obamacare I don't think he's going to rule differently than the wage judge Roberts justice forgive me just\nSince John Roberts achieved Justice Roberts ruled so she said you know in the conversation that I had with him in private I don't know why liberals are getting so upset\nI call him support it he's a quote unquote centrist in the mold of Anthony Kennedy or David Souter not in the mold of Bork or Scalia or Clarence Thomas\nSo she was basically telling the lives take a chill pill relax\nAnd then she cited David Souter saying I remember when it came to David Souter there are passing out buttons and and flyers and if you've confirmed David Souter women are going to be dying and back alley abortions and of course Souter was one of the coauthors of Planned Parenthood v Casey which upheld roe v wait\nSo Souter didn't overturn abortion rights they didn't overturn roe v Wade\nAs she was basically saying wink wink I think he's another suitor\nI think he's another Anthony Kennedy I don't think he's going to be a conservative I think is going to be more of a centrist swing justice do wake Kennedy was a centrist swing justice\nNow that's now my personal opinion just for what it's worth I think she heard what she wanted to hear\nJay I I'm very ... I'll be very surprised if Kavanaugh rules the way she says he's going to rule but just for the sake of argument type let's just put that let that goal was I Would say\nYou know as I point that in my part time so I Want to point it out again if Susan Collins is right and I underline the word is\nWell let me just let me look at the ledger you want to overturn Obamacare\nShe won't center all the way back to the states she won't touch abortion she won't touch a free contraception free birth control\nOr\nHe won't touch the constitutional right to same sex marriage so we supported you why exactly\n\nAnd so the question I'm just asking there is if you heard Susan Collins of speech and you listen to what she was arguing which is all my liberal friends uh he may be conservative on some issues but he's going to be socially liberal on other issues\nAnd when it comes to abortion he won't touch it when it comes to Obamacare he won't touch it when it comes to the constitutional right to same sex marriage he won't touch it\nWhen it comes to free birth control he won't touch it\n\nAnd so she's basically telling liberals calm down I don't know why you guys are trying to occupy the capital and burned Capitol Hill down and acting like it's the the sky is falling when you're going to get another Kennedy and I'm listening tour and I'm saying you know if what she's saying is true we just got a hat\nOr am I wrong six one set up to six six sixty eight sixty eight is the number Marlene in New Hampshire you're up next thanks for holding and welcome\nHigh high I think I think it's the military tribunals let that\nGirl [laughter] for parents said\nTo to seal the stuff for the FBI and show the public and I didn't even know what you know I think they need to follow that up or the other the other point is Lacey for definitely needs to be indicted in charge otherwise it's going to keep going there still pray for her it's still crazy in her\nMarlene and why why is Feinstein so afraid to release the FBI report what does she so afraid of what is she still scared of\nHer story she's afraid that you know it's more for the truth that's the truth so they're more high end to keep them praise thing for a board well they still have a chance they still have a chance to teach noticed everything you have said that show\nThat's still addict and that's partly cannot get Bob we're right now it's happening now is when we have to keep exposed and exposed and exposed\nThey can't give up oh sorry curve because this morning I was watching a video and within that videotape several mentioned the pillow seen twenty Seventeen cause you were saying\nWrap up near she described that if you just Google that wrapped up in the air or Nancy Pelosi and she said this is what we do we create a false ... and we merchandise that to the press the credits ... court said\n... wheels story as the truth\nOh Marlene that's exactly what happened then thank you very much for that call look this to me you want to know how the ... the Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings if I was an author if I had to write a chapter say on a ... year you know the second year of Trump's presidency the anatomy of a smear\nHow the Democrats concocted to smear\nHow they executed the smear how they implemented to smear how they got all the key players to perpetuate the smear dots with this was all about they try to ambush and destroy an innocent good decent man\nNow let me ask you this President Trump\nSays the Democrats disgraced themselves [noise]\nDo you believe the Democrats will pay a price at the polls\nWill their voters be more energized than ever before for\nWe are now finally protecting American Jobs and American manufacturing against China\nI mean problem after problem after problem is being fixed we're starting to slowly regain control over our borders wages by the way are now up\nFor working class Americans for the first time in Thirty years wages are rising middle class incomes are no longer stagnating they're going up\nWe are now under Trump the greatest energy producer in the world in the world\nWe now have the strongest military we've ever had this year and next year is pouring seven hundred billion seven hundred and sixteen billion we're gonna be the mighty US military superpower on earth\nSo he's rebuilt the military he's securing our borders he's bringing back millions of jobs he's saving manufacturing the economy is booming what are you gonna run\nOn she got nothing to run on the only thing you have is impeached impeach him beach smear smear smear\nAnd if you like the ugliness of the last two weeks then get ready for two more years of it 'cause that's what it's going to be if the Democrats come back to power\nAnd so I think Trump now has a winning message that he can take these key swing districts and ice\nYou may see a red wave coming if the Democrats are not careful now I have to make this point and then I Want to throw it open to you six one set up to six six sixty eight sixty eight\nWhen President Trump says he's right that the Democrats were an absolute disgrace is this going to re downed against the Democrats\nDo you think they will be punished for the way they behave the last couple of weeks or do you think their base and their supporters\nThe ... of the world the the move on dot org is over the world the Elizabeth Warren's of the world\nWho are in righteous fury an anger over the perceived injustice against Christine Blasey Ford do you think they're going to be more energized and mobilize to vote in November who does this help or hurt\nPolitically but when everything is said and done and I want to talk about the midterms I Do have to give a very special how tip to Lindsey Graham\nI think for all of Trump's incredible support and it was incredible it was an F lynching and it was unwavering what port\nJudge Kavanaugh over the top I Believe it changed the momentum of the hearings itself was when Lindsey Graham just lit up a Senate hearing when the Democrats\nWere really going after Kavanaugh\nAnd they sense blood in the water\nAnd they try to shame and humiliate him over allegedly supposedly assaulting Christine Blasey Ford and why won't you call for an FBI investigation and why are you hiding why won't you call the FBI to investigate you and when they kept badgering and attacking him and bruising him\nAnd Lindsey Graham said enough is enough and from that moment on the Democrats went from offense to defense they lost all the momentum and from that moment on I Believe that he was Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to lose roles that famous clip Britain\n[noise] so are you aware that\nAt nine twenty three ... of July the night the day you were nominated to the Supreme Court by President Trump Senator Schumer said twenty three minutes after nomination\nI'll oppose judge Kavanaugh's nomination with everything I have\nI have a bipartisan hope a bipartisan majority will do the same the stakes are simply too high for anything less well if you weren't aware of that you are now did you meet with Senator Dianne Feinstein on August twentieth\nI did meet with center finds you know that her staff had already recommended a lawyer to Dr Ford\nI did not know that there's you know that her and her staff had this alec is allegations for over twenty days\nI did not know that at the time if you wanted to FBI investigation you could have come to us what you want to do is destroyed this guy's life hold this seat open and hope you win at twenty twenty you said that not me you've got nothing to apologize for\nWhen you see some of them aren't cake and tell them that Lindsey said I'll ... voted for that I Would never do to them what you've done to this guy this system out on an ethical sham\nSince I've been in politics and if you really wanted to know the truth you sure as hell wouldn't have done what you've done to this guy are you a gang rape is no\n\nI cannot imagine what you and your family's gone through boy y'all power God I Hope you never get it out the American people can see through sham that you knew about it and you held it you had no intention of protecting dot and for not\nShe's as much of a victim as you are God I hate\nTo say ... they had been my friends but let me tell you when it comes to this\nYou're looking for a fair process you came to the wrong town at the wrong time my friend do you consider this a job interview\nThe advice and consent role is like a job you consider that you've been through a job interview I've been through a process of advice and consent under the constitution would you say you've been through hell I I've been through a\nHell and then so this is not a job interview yeah this is hell this this is going to destroy the ability of good people to come forward because of this crap you're a high school yearbook\nYou have interacted with professional women all your life now one accusation you're supposed to be Bill Cosby when you're a junior and senior in high school\nAnd all of a sudden you got over it spend my understanding\nThat if you drug women and write them for two years in high school you probably don't stop here's my understanding if he lived a good life people recognize it like the American\nBar association has the gold standard [noise]\nHis integrity is absolutely unquestioned he has a very circumspect in his personal conduct harbors know biases or prejudice he's entirely ethical if they really decent person he is warm friendly unassuming he's the nicest person\nDa da\nAnd one thing I can tell you you should be proud of Ashley you should be proud of this that you've raised a daughter said the good character for pray for Dr forward to my Republican\nColleagues if you vote no you're legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics\nYou want this seat I Hope you never get it out here on the Supreme Court that's exactly what you should be and I hope at the American people will see through this charade and\nI Wish you well [noise] and I intend to vote for you and I hope everybody who's fair minded will\nVast shamed just flick that speech\nThat's why flick became I guess that's why I Believe in the end Susan Collins became a yes that speech shamed the Democrats and shamed enough of the rhino Republicans to vote yes\nAnd that's why I Believe Lindsey Graham will go down in history for that speech in fact I Would even go one further I think this speech almost become required reading in textbooks across a high schools across this country\nBecause what Lindsey Graham did was a profile in courage and because of what he did and what he said at the moment that he said it Brett Kavanaugh is not judge Kavanaugh he is now justice Kavanaugh\nComing up tomorrow on the uh W. or kill morning show I'll see if I've recovered from celebrating Columbus Day\nI said that getting it is the most useless holiday ever is an option\nDoes that mean that I have to be the one that's over its indigenous people say about how this works citizen you played here for our nicely Kim is back tomorrow we started\nIn vi V. weekday morning sake they've had a follow voice of Boston\nSuddenly

they've been designing magnificent kitchens in bath since Nineteen sixty seven the kitchen center of Framingham uses\nDesigners with various the credit patients who actually listen to what you want their show room is breathtaking\nNovember six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight Carol in Bridgewater you're up next to Carol thank you for holding and welcome\n[laughter] yes yes I think a ... law then like a ... said it so despicable and unethical how they went after camp and not let me tell you right now I think\nBoth cases are motivated to go out and they tried to go out and vote but as long as we still have the education system churning out ... chill liberals\nWe're gonna be desecrated that some time until we legislate something that has more feminist action type policies that put\n... teaches in our\nEducation system ah so we're doomed for what they're indoctrinated in a few chair ... to be\nCarol I'm just curious the fact that Kavanaugh won narrowly but one\nDo you think that's going to lead some Republicans to saying well we won this battle Trump is doing great I'm gonna stay home or do you want me to motivate Republicans to say wow if they did this the Kavanaugh imagine if they control Congress nobody and no one will be safe\nI think it's getting louder de ... that will be broken about if it dies down and we don't keep it up especially with US Senators and congressmen campaign and not talking about that\nPeople will get the yesterday's news that we need to keep on the issue and ... by\nEverything that they're going to do as a future Khan is not even a socialist that gunfire totalitarian government where there will be dictatorship caught the Democrat Party\nCarole thank you very much for the call or the radical Democrats will just to show you how radical they are\nAlexandria Ocasio Cortez now tweet it out in the aftermath of the Kavanaugh's confirmation fight listen to this\nIt's time to abolish the electoral college why because she says that as a legacy of slavery power\nSo not only now do they want to get rid of borders not only do they want to abolish ice\nNot only now do they want to create a society where by your presumption of innocence and due process and essentially individual rights are are turned over or overthrown but now they literally want to get rid of the electoral college itself\nLike how much more radical do you want to get and Ocasio Cortez is now the spokeswoman for the Democratic party and by the way this is", "show_name": "VB in the Middle", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "08"}
