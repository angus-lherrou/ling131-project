Karen in situ with Europe next thanks for holding tiring and welcome\nHigh like hey hang low fat welcome I\nThink that you are listening you want to watch in ... and then another person in the race what's his name\nIs AJ yes\n... is just totally trashing Gail just got on a terrible terrible thing [noise] he's got to try to take the Indian\nOh God [noise] so that's what it is playing up so ... out there now and now I mean a lot of people watch this channel and I was reading the Sunday was saying like you know he's got he's got ... now so we and it is though\nIt can really like as soon as really a shame and I'm trying to ... and then you know this guy and you any weight is such a will there's nothing you can do that yeah I don't like what he's doing a good deal\nWell he he\nHe's trying to divide the anti war invoked\nI Know exactly what he's doing it because then you have to\nOwn caring look I agree with you and then thank you very much for that call a look he's trying to divide the anti Warren vote peel away enough votes from deal basically guaranteeing that Warren is going to win a I Know that uh it's it's I mean I don't know if you saw his interview or hurt his interview with how we\nAre this was a while back but how we came out with damning evidence about him having can gauge in domestic abuse and alleged domestic violence\nAnd he was like a cage animal and that studio\nThey had to I think physically restrain and he was going to attack how he\nAnd I think they escorted amount of the building\nSo how we try to expose them I don't want to give him the time of day\nI mean if he wants to go after Warren that's fine but the claim that Jeff deal is a racist or that Jeff deal is some kind of a a democratic plant are you kidding me\nWith the way he's going after Warren nobody in this state in the in the political class has gone after Warren as tough and aggressively as Jeff deal has\nSo he's just spreading lies in and disinformation and so who knows on election day that may be the difference I Hope not but who knows six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight is the number okay let's try to squeeze in Pete in little pen going ahead Pete\n[noise] hey Jeff Hi longtime listener first time caller welcome Pete Wilcox\nUm you know my opinion is that all of these liberals get away with what they get away with and everybody's just given an apology\nOr if I go out and I personally at a police officer or a disabled veteran ... benefits which I Am a veteran from get out but don't you start to point a well I get arrested or like go to jail\nOr I go to court on my other figures and if she used an Indian\nDidn't look Indian Trent\nIndian nation a prosecutor\nWhile I mean they asked him if he thank you for that call I mean they can't ... like don't how do I say this their sovereign\nAnd sort of in a cultural sense they're not really sovereign independent countries within America or what they want to have some local laws local traditions a local police force that's what they mean when they say their sovereign no it's it's just very sad\nHer name is Jennifer Carnahan and she says the suspension doesn't go far enough not even close saying he should be immediately fired\nFor inciting this kind of violence and calling for the actual beheadings of Republicans the day after the November sixth election\nIn fact she says that she herself as\nThe head of the Minnesota Republican Party as the head of the Minnesota GOP has been subjected to constant numerous death threats\nAnd that death threats now or no laughing matter\nHow she put it quote the overt hatred and violence that has become prevalent from many Democrats towards Republicans in recent times is unlawful unacceptable and she says now it is downright scary and just to reinforce her point listen to this\nThey suspended this clown Davis this fog days after a Minnesota state representative Sarah Anderson was punched after she spotted\nAnd destroying Republican yard signs\nSo she spotted this person destroying Republican yard signs and said whoa what are you doing and he charged at her and began to punch sure it's a woman being assaulted by a man\nShe said the attack has left her scar scared\nThat her attacker only stopped or trying to uh Salter and beat her only after she fled to her car\nAnd threw it in reverse and got the hell out of their quote it was just insane he was charging at me saying quote why don't you go kill yourself Sarah Anderson told the Washington Free beacon\nTo have someone physically coming after you and attacking you is just disheartening yes thank you I think\nSo now you're getting state reps are now getting punched\nBy Democrats if you catch them destroying Republican a yard signs and this woman got no she could have been beaten black and blue who knows how she hadn't run to her car fled to her car putting reverse and gotten the hell out of dodge when it gets even worse\nI don't know what the hell's going on in Minnesota remember the term Minnesota nice\nYou know the people in Minnesota that people in the Midwest shifts so freaking nice you know they have to be so polite and so nice and not with the dams not with the lives not with the moon bats are they're not so nice anymore listen now to this one listen to this\nAnderson was not the only Republican candidate who was attacked\n\nAnother person running for state rep as his first time apparently Shane medical end was at a restaurant talking to voters at a local eater he was sitting at a high top table went out of the blue\nOut enraged liberal heard him saying he was a conservative and how we supported much of Trump's agenda what do you think happened he punched him in the face he cold cocked him\n\nHe blindsided him ... actually sucker punched him as he was talking at a restaurant that is in bed and county I don't know where that is but anyway in Baton county and that apparently he got hit so hard he fell off the chair smashed\nIs head on the floor they had to take him to the hospital he suffered a major concussion\n\nIt's gonna take 'em four to six weeks to recover in fact the concussion is so bad he suffered a lot of symptoms one of them is memory loss\nIn fact the reporter who's writing this story says his memory loss is so bad he's trying to talk about other people who've been assaulted and he couldn't remember Sarah Anderson his name\nYou know that poor other state rep that was punched when she saw a moon bat the Democrat tearing up yards a yard signs\nSo he says now quote according to this um according to the uh this peace hold on quote I was so overtaken by surprise and shock if this is the new norm this is not what I signed up for\n\nHe's literally saying I I don't think I Want to run for politics like this is not what I thought I thought this was America I thought you go all out campaign you meet constituents you give speeches and then we decided at the ballot box\nYou don't like what he stands for you don't vote for him you like what he stands for you vote for him\nYou really don't like his positions okay you can criticize them you can hold rallies you can write letters to the editor you can go on Facebook on Twitter on social media you can express yourself but you know and it's a different world now because according to the limbs remember what Hillary Clinton said\nRemember what the line with the same thing fell instead\nThe era of civility is over until we get the house and the Senate back it's all allowed political war go after him Maxine Waters go after him Cory Booker getting their faces\nSo now they're emboldened inning and inciting Elizabeth Warren inciting violence\nIntimidate him bully um punch 'em can't come stomp palm do what you gotta do and the fuss style baby\nAnd so this guy is saying I I I just there's just not what I signed up for now\nWhat's even more shocking by the way this poor guy says because of his concussion it's hard for him to campaign now because he's very sensitive to sunlight\nSo he says it's going to limit his ability to campaign going to go door to door and knock on doors for the next three weeks the other ones Sarah Anderson now says she needs an escort\nHer husband says I'll go door to door with you because with these liberals and Democrats they may be true up again\nRepublicans in Minnesota are now saying that they only want volunteers to a campaign or knock on doors in pairs\nWhich by the way limits their ability to cover ground but they say it's no longer safe to just simply be alone campaigning are knocking on doors that's not just for the candidates that's where their staffers and volunteers\nWhat's even worse is that not one prominent Minnesota Democrat has condemned the attack and the assault against him in fact they're making jokes about it they think it's funny\nNow how the hell do you go on Facebook and threatened to kill a team to be had\nAll Republicans after the November six mid term election and the Democrats suspend you one week without pay\n\nHe should be fired is a campaign staffer he knows the rules you don't talk like that or at least this was in the pre Trump era\nThis is before the uh trumped arrangements syndrome came in this used to be considered ... bought ten in American politics\nYou don't beat up people because they're conservatives or Republicans you know the whole car come\nYou don't go after women and beat 'em up because they happen to be a Republican state rep and say you should go kill yourself hey this used to be considered a vet a button in American politics
