that's taught lucky he works at a law firm called Cushing and Dole and\nAnd during the month of October they've been giving away this booklet that is available to you it's called designing and income only irrevocably trust pretty straightforward it's it's not\nIt's not short I mean it's a twenty page document but for those of you who might be over the age of sixty and do not have long term care insurance is a worthy read something you should take a look at study maybe talk to your account and talk to your financial advisor about it because I'll tell you what\nA as you get older you start to think about these issues you start to think about what happens when my wife gets sick what happens when I get sick what do you know what happens all the wealth that we've accumulated during during her lifetime\nThe guide is called designing an income only irrevocably trust them then they give you a phone number to call it's eight six six eight for eight\nFive six nine nine today is the last day of the month and it is the last day for you to call and received this guy that from Cushing and dull and\nEight six six eight for eight five six nine nine is the phone number now some of you might say well I don't want to wait I Want this guide right now simply go to legal exchange show dot com legal exchange show dot com if you want to download the guide right now\nOr if you want a physical copy mailed to you or e mailed to you\nYou can call us again the phone number is toll free eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine China has set the official one rate at the weakest level in a decade why would they do that\nSo pretty much this is one of the tools that China has to you know really affect the overall growth trajectory of their economy they did something similar to a you know a much larger intra day move actually back in twenty Fifteen in pretty much what this does is it makes their exports much more competitive because it reduces the cost\nOr in in other currencies term so let's say that I'm trying to buy goods from China okay and I just had ten percent terrorists placed in on what I'm trying to buy from them\nIf China reduce their currencies value by ten percent you know they can effectively offset those hair\nBut what is it due to the people that live in China like I I just think like if our currency goes down I Know my gasoline bill goes up\nIt doesn't do a ton to China aside from the energy started things does affect energy 'cause it's gonna make it more expensive in local currencies but remember China doesn't import a ton from other places as far as being as good as they produce a lot of them they're now in terms of\nYou know if if you're buying you know seller buying raw material they allow that sourced in China you know if you're not having to go to another currency is not having an impact it when you have to import if you are a debtor nation that imports you know can you be devalued currency\nImports become more expensive right in Chinatown and import that the ... with the big thing they're importing\nIs energy they're importing a ton of oil okay but when you take a look at you know the other stuff all the rare earth minerals they're all mind in China you know you have all kinds of aluminum minds in China there's all you know it's a lot of the goods stores there to begin with\nAnd so you don't necessarily run into problems with your own people not being able to afford those things\nThey've been accused of being a currency manipulator in the past season is this currency manipulation\nTreasury Department found it wasn't ... just as ... and that was two weeks ago yeah Steven Mnuchin came out and said hey there you know they're not a currency manipulator\n... can they continue to\nDo this through the uh you know they went down a little bit here ... ... what if the president's lots of twenty five percent ... terrified are they going to devalue their currency\nIs for us so it's this is kind of the the chess match that that's being played right now is whether or not they are going to go down this road\nI don't think it's beneficial to them for the long term to do this right because they're trying to build up their own currency\nAs a stable means of exchange that can replace the dollar ... in the fall you do is start say okay we're just going to play around with it just to win this trade war you know it doesn't do a lot of good in terms in terms of their long term planning if there's one thing China has been really good at the last twenty five years now it's being focused on the long game at the expense of the short\nGain right but let's use bowling as an example they buy a lot of jets from Boeing yes when they buy those jets they don't buying them in one they're buying them in US Currency\nCorrect so when you have to import something like that it's a big deal the big thing that China's doing they have a state run a airplane manufacturer that just getting spoiled up now that likely has taken a decent amount of Boeing and Airbus technology and they are trying to compete with those exact companies actually\nBut if I'm a wealthy Chinese person why would I leave it say I make a thousand dollars and I have a thousand dollars saved in China why would I leave it in China knowing that my government is going to devalue the currency wouldn't isn't there you'd try to their risk of a currency flight\nYou do there absolutely is but China is pretty good at trying to ah rein that in through their capital controls or you know just saying hey you can't do that\nBecause you see that a lot whether you're in Florida or whether you're in New England you see a lot of Chinese money coming into both markets and buying up\nReal estate loans and specifically it's ... dollars actually because again there's the surplus of dollars that flows over to China and they're sitting there saying look we can't invest this money here let's go buy real estate back in the U.S because a it's out of the country and be it'll hold its value then\nA lot of it sits in the you know yeah they they buy it you know there there are condos in New York Boston Florida that are sitting empty nobody ever sleeps in them yet but they're owned by the Chinese\nDo yeah it it looked in the reason why is because we buy all these goods from China and they ended up with this surplus of dollars and they said something what are we going to do they use to buy treasuries they're not any more you know now it's OK let's buy real estate it's better investment for the long term\nHey see kids at University of Miami that are living in

I mean you're talking to you want to talk about living in an upscale neighborhood I Can't I Can't take three hundred and forty thousand dollars off my house I I don't live in that kind of a neighborhood chief I don't make what you're making obviously so he exposed her as a fraud\nHe exposed her as a hypocrite\nShe's part of the one percent she's a multi millionaire in fact she's worth more than twenty million dollars but let that go she lives in a three million dollar mansion in Cambridge and then when Jeff again pointed out in two thousand and nine Harvard was planning to lay off\nHundreds and hundreds of janitors and lower staff members however they asked academics that get very high salaries like her are you willing to take a small big cuts remember she was making three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to each one course at that time\nOh listen the chief says she's for the little person that she says she's for the little guy she wouldn't even take a penny deduction\nShe wouldn't even take five ten thousand dollars off of her three fifty make three forty to teach one course instead of three fifty to save a janitor job or somebody's job blank you she's all about herself and so I thought Jeff did a great job exposing her now I\nWould have followed up\nWhen she said I don't know I honestly if I was Jeff I mean he hit or good don't get me wrong you ride older you can see it you look do allied she she looked like a fighter who's just got his bell rung she she was like a a I mean she looked why does it go she she was staring like a deer in headlights\nBut if I were Jeff to be honest I would've followed that up\nI Would have gone after you you don't know excuse me senator how can you tell us you don't know when you obviously know know either you're trying to cover it up or you're lying which does it take your pick you see I thought there were opportunities for him to follow up and even hit are harder\nNow let me just say this by the way I look at today's press the Associated Press the Boston Globe nothing nothing on her engaging in illegal fundraising and committing a crime nothing\nThey don't want you to know about that they want to sweep it under the rug they're hoping most people didn't wash the debate last night\nSo they're desperately now and cover up mode for Elizabeth Warren now let me just say this the local media is essentially in the tank for the chief we all know that okay with a few exceptions there into pack\nMy sources were last night confirmed to me they were at the debate\nAnd the more people I talk to the more people say yes this actually took place\nIf you want to know why Elizabeth Warren came across as very strange last night was she kept looking away why she seemed to be always looking in the audience not really looking at Jeff not looking at the moderators it's because she was getting signals\nHer supporters her team were coaching\nHer and sending her signals throughout the entire debate\n\nNow that's by the way that's also an ethical you're not supposed to do that during a debate I mean I'm not surprised 'cause there's nothing to swimming won't do to advance herself she's a cordial pathological liar and a fraud and a hypocrite but the fact of the matter is she was getting coached she was getting signals\nThat's why she kept looking don't get too heated don't get to rabbit tone it down not all tone it up now no go after him now go after him now where they kept signaling her throughout the entire debate\nIf she needs help going toe to toe with Jeff deal that tells you everything you need to know she's not knowledgeable on the issues\nShe knows nothing about Massachusetts\nShe's got a glass draw she can't take a punch\nShe gets easily rattled this woman I'm telling you Jeff deal ... debated as circles around her the only question now is this and I asked my audience last night and I want to ask you to view right now\nRound one round to round three debates are now over Jeff I Believe won all three debates but\nWrite well of course I'm going everywhere I can on every media\nOutlet I can to talk to people as well as much as possible and then face to face

agree with maybe the first you know when I actually I think the lottery or a lousy day they never asked the question is it really affect you know it just shows that some of the country\nOh jak hold on jak but what about the carbon tax jak\nUh I I just say that what ... is a\nLot of radio you know a lousy job [noise] I laugh\nAt it and they got to you know the thing I was afraid or are they still they did and that Elizabeth would dominate the conversation by talking too much and saying nothing she gift when they could have been tougher\nI agree with the uh person that you had a while ago that it wasn't it was a tough enough but he could have done other than a better way and hopefully yeah fires\nJak thank you very much for that call I appreciate it look I thought\nHe could have been more passionate I think there were many other issues I mean I'm not trying to say look I'm dumping on the guy I Love the guy I'm going to vote for him I support him I'm just calling it the way I see it\nShe at times was grandstanding she took up a notice they gave her a lot more time they gave Jeff\nShe tried to constantly bullied him and the one thing I never would've allowed her to get away with notice how she kept trying to paint Jeff by attacking Trump paint Jeff as a racist paint Jeff as a white supremacist\nPaint Jeff has some kind of a Muslim hater\nAnd I I Would have cut her off frankly politically I Want to cut her off at the nice I mean\nI that's why the meter phony Indian issue would be so potent hold on let me get this straight you\nWho views Native Americans do advance your career you who's being denounced by Native Americans and the Cherokee Indians for being a racist\nFor using us to advance your career you're trying to call me or racist are you kidding me are you kidding me I mean there are so many ways I Would a hitter\nAnd look I've said it before and I'm going to say it again this was the genius of Trump and frankly Reagan understood this as well what you want to do when you look ... she is the ... to use a boxing analogy she's the champion\nYou are the challenger gay she's the incumbent you're also in a democratic state you're in a deep blue state so you're fighting this battle appeal\nIt's an uphill struggle from the beginning\nWhat you want to do in these three debates yes you want to present yourself as a viable alternative he clearly did that he's I mean he's he's such a much better senator than her it's not even funny but the second thing you want to do is you want to drive her negatives through the roof she's already disliked\nAnd what you want to do is you want to discredit her you want to de legitimize her you want to make her soul toxic so poison is that her own side will not vote for her\nSee that's what Trump brilliantly did against Hillary you don't ... you don't libel you don't make stuff up I must say the truth just the truth\nAnd I didn't know that\nOh she's really she was running around calling herself a woman of color each you mean the DNA test showed that she's Ninety nine point nine percent white do what everybody in the audience is probably more of an Indian as more than an Indian blood than she does watch\nWhat she's made twenty million dollars as a senator or why she's been enriching yourself for the last six years what I mean you could run down by the time you're done with her they may not vote for Jeff but they're certainly not going to vote for her\nShe that's what I felt he honestly needed to do and it was the gift from the political guards\nThat their first debate if you remember was on friday earlier that week is when she that whole DNA tests debacle I mean\nYou had her yeah had her\nAnd then on top of it all you only have to even a Packer personally all you have to say is that Democrats are denouncing view the establishment media is denouncing you and making fun of you\nThe Cherokee Indian nation has issued a statement saying you need to apologize what you did was wrong it was racist it was offensive\n\nBy the time you're done with her she that's the point anything she says you don't believe it because you've proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that she's a complete fraud liar and hypocrite\n\nAnd he just he just let it go I mean you hear a little bit on the Indian issue but he just let it go and so for the life of me I Do not understand that\nYou know that's why I Love the Romneys analogy she's a wounded sealed there's blood into water finished her\nJust just go go in and finish it the sooner the better\nSo anyway look all of this being said I'm just speaking from the heart all of this being said\nHe clearly won all three rounds there's no question there's no question about it even the Democrats are admitting she won he won all three debates so he beer and all three debates he clearly landed some really good shots she did not come across very well she he clearly came across as a better senator than her\nHe clearly came across that he cares about Massachusetts a hell of a lot more than her\nAnd she did come across as a hypocrite and honestly she came across at times as rabbit and truly dislike couple\nAnd so if you've got all these unions now\nWho are basically saying then and then I forget what we say in public and private we let's vote for Jeff\nIf you've got this and he's won over independence and it seems now some moderate Democrats are peeling away than what you've got is the possibility of a Massachusetts Miracle on Tuesday\nAnd I hope to God he beats her six one seven six six sixty eight sixty eight okay more with your reaction next\nThe twenty eighth team W arcangel being the Radio's on his friday November ninth presented hello safety leaders and safety technology joined W.

I Want to mention the wine and saving grace that are ... losers is that Elizabeth Warren ... face Donald Trump in the election so that's the one saving grace having said that um [noise]\nI watched a\nDebate one and number three and I don't think Jeff Jill won them I think that\nWe're looking at Elizabeth Warren and all the bad things about her her personality or stumble and or this and that through our own lenses um I think the best thing that jet fuel did and the dumbest all time there that he'd be a share went to win\nIs closing statement last night was the best thing that he has done in any debates I I started yelling finally finally finally\nBut I think it was too late and lastly I'll just say there are two things uh number one is he kept\nYou know he insinuate at about Pocahontas\nHe and send you waited about the kind of money she got paid for teach one class\nAnd send your way about her lack of knowledge about gun laws and Massachusetts and so on and so forth\nBut he never followed up on it which you know the channel five moderators followed up\nOn the investigation question that's what she needed to do and he needed to be like a politician every time they ask you a question you say what you want you don't answer the question you get more information out there you want the voters stay there and I'll just say one other thing on the on the caravan\nThe liberals don't understand those people are carrying signs for their country than are carrying a mop to brooms so when they show up at the house to house and not acquainted they're going to be in for a surprise anyway baggage\nI before I let you go ah making extremely good points or do we lose Greg ah okay I I just wanted to ask him because he was an interesting point that we're looking at it from our lands\nYou know we see all the flaws in Elizabeth Warren but Greg was making a point that I think that I think for her base I think what he's trying to say is\nIf you're a ... bat if you're a liberal Democrat if you're an ultra left is\nIn a way didn't she push all the right buttons she kept ... I mean we think is ridiculous but look at it from her point of view she kept hitting Trump\nShe kept time deal to Trump\nShe was almost like running a national campaign and twenty twenty sheeting Trump on everything hitting him on guns on racism on the border on health care or you just name she's kept hitting them again and again and again and again so in a way she kept throwing red meat to her base\nI think that's what Greg is trying to say so they see my point is and Greg look I could be wrong I mean I Am pro deal I you know I'm open about that\nIs that I don't know if it works with independence\nSee I don't know if it works with these moderate Democrats I don't know if a lot of union folks watching this or like comfortable or like what she's saying\nThat's why I think the race is going to be closer than people think I could be wrong I'm just giving in my opinion Washington in Mount Vernon I've got one minute Washington before the break the floor is yours go\nGet this the cool that you're going to win it let me tell you why Nineteen Seventy eight and not yet known for an inch election\nEighteen they make the packets they got upset\nBecause they might look back at that time was not well right she's not well like\nYou to doubt Nathan she wanted to thousands well what are the parental damn I ran for president it turned out not to be the thing that democratic turnout will not be the same those that are out here in the ... and had\nA jet and very tied in those polls Boston go way off that's why from now on don't say it but he's going to win in the white and you're going to win the shows end up on every day and ask her to come on\nAnd then oh well that I reached out to eat in Ohio today at the thing you can do the show state of Massachusetts\nWashington Thank you very much a we've asked her to come on the show repeatedly she\nShe won't touch us with a ten foot pole because she knows all destroyer but I like that\nI reached out to her and she's in Ohio\nThe next day I reached out to her but she's in Milwaukee then the following day I reached out to her she's in Oklahoma okay my friend's coming up next to Paul Ryan Orion sticks the knife into tromp on birthright citizenship\nOne so rhino hallways are rhino will have that story and so much more but first Trump here slamming house Speaker Paul Ryan over the president's plan to end birthright citizenship heaven I rich has that story taken away Evan [noise]\nWhere he said in fact it was insane to have illegals keep coming into our country and just having a baby on American soil and by extension that that child is given\nFull citizenship and the parents and this is the kicker are then not deported because you can separate the parents from the child\nThat Seoul racket get get yourself in illegally have the baby the baby comes out the baby's given full citizenship and you can separate the parents now from the baby\nSo the parents get this day and then through chain migration then they bring in every body because the baby's an American citizen so you can bring in your own goals you're on your grandparents your other siblings every everybody gets\nTo come on down and of course who pays for the whole thing the dung Ringo who pays for the whole thing\nYou me and the American taxpayer it has cost us hundreds if not hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars over the last twenty five to Thirty years it has been financially bleeding our country\nNever mind taking advantage of our immigration laws and constitution now furthermore I said this yesterday but it bears repeating it really does it bears repeating\nThe fourteenth amendment if Paul Ryan would ever bother to study a bit of history was first passed by Congress in Eighteen sixty six it was ratified in Eighteen sixty eight\nDo you think they were passing this because of I don't know what a immigration because it was the era of reconstruction the civil war had just ended over half a million Americans were dead and now they had the issue of slaves and these freed slaves and they didn't know what to do with them\nBecause in Eighteen fifty seven there was the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision that said slaves or not people slaves are not citizens slaves are simply property so to deal with that Supreme Court decision\nIn the wake now of the defeat of the south and the dismantling an eradication of slavery they had to pass a\nFull constitutional amendment and the purpose was to give full legal political constitutional status\nTo former slaves that was the point of the fourteenth amendment it was it written so a\nSummer Russian oligarch and I'm being serious now they love to go to Miami some Russian oligarch goes to Miami and they have a child in Miami and the child now is automatically an American citizen that wasn't the purpose of the fourteenth amendment\nNow many of you may ask well okay why\nWhy are these people doing this why for example here I mean I can go to millions of stories let me just quote you won Newsweek January first two thousand eight team\nThey have found that in Miami and an ... especially southern Florida which is where the Russians really like to go for this sort of scam they found an eighty thousand dollar per baby maternity hospital scam taking place\nWhereby the Russian oligarchs would come in fork out eighty thousand dollars to these hospitals\nAnd allow their wives or girlfriends that have children have their babies deliver a baby\nAnd I'm In Miami hospital and the child is then automatically given American citizenship so why would they want to do this just OK well number one if you're living because most of this is coming from China Russia Eastern Europe and of course Saudi Arabia and the middle east the Gulf sheiks\nAnd American passport is an escape hatch it's a safety valve\nIf things go bad and mother Asher or if things go bad in China or if things go bad inquiry a lot of them are coming from South Korea as well or or from the middle east then you can always right away dash to the United states so number one it provides your family with an automatic escape hatch\nNumber two once the child has citizenship you go\nBack to Russia safer I don't know a Fifteen sixteen Seventeen Eighteen years then your child is eligible to vote because Charles an American citizen to go back to the United states I don't know say they want to go to California Berkley\nOr they want to go to University of Michigan or they want to go to M. I. P. or whatever it may be the child than can go and pay tuition that is um if you're like an American citizen not in a foreign tuition\nSo hey it saves your child a lot of money to go to school you pay the rate of a domestic citizen knocked out of a foreigner but more importantly once your child comes back he can sponsor mommy and daddy\nMommy and daddy then through chain migration are allowed to come and then they're given American citizenship so it's another security blanket for them down the road\nAnd then of course the ultimate the reason is who doesn't want to become an American citizen\n\nI mean it's it's it's it's it's it's the greatest citizenship the possibilities are that are offered to you and your family in the entire world so you have a massive scam of birth tourism taking place where there are shelling out sixty eighty a hundred thousand dollars at these hospitals\nAnd all they do is they cater to rich foreigners who then set it up for their children to come and get citizenship just by the fact that they're being born in the United states and then you've got the other scam of illegals and notice look at the caravan look how many pregnant women earned that\nCaravan that's not an accident in fact what they do is and they're doing it now is they put pregnant women along with women and children in general at the front of the caravan\nTo act as essentially human shields to protect the men in the back and even people in the caravans are admitting that there are criminals within the caravans\nMurderers rapists MS Thirteen gang bangers they themselves are saying that Trump is not wrong when he says there are criminals amongst them\nBut the reason why they put the pregnant women up front there's it's not an accident you Khamenei legally you know whatever Trump can put them in a tent city can do whatever he wants with him once that baby comes out that baby is technically an American citizen not technically the baby's granted American citizenship\nAnd by extension you can separate the mother from the child\nYour in your child's the citizen welfare you beat the section eight mass health all the welfare benefits in the world to you and to your child paid for by Uncle Sam paid for by uncle soccer\nAnd this clown comes out and says oh you can throw out or you're going to do a lot birthright citizenship is a fraud it's a scam and it needs to end\nAnd it's going to end the American people have had enough\nSo either it ends through an executive order and it's upheld by the courts or it's going to end through an act of Congress but either way it's days are numbered\nAnd I think Trump frankly is being brilliant by bringing this issue up just before the midterm elections because you already have Dianne Feinstein defending anchor babies\nYou've already got Elizabeth Warren defending anchor babies you've already got Nancy Pelosi defending anchor babies\nNow what I Would say to them as this you love 'em that much you take them in you feed them you quote called them you ... you give 'em healthcare you pay for them but you have no right to impose those costs on the American people\nAnd just my final point and this really needs to be said\nYou think China hair go visit China go visit South Korea go visit Japan go visit Russia go visit Saudi Arabia go visit France go visit Germany go visit a Great Britain and take your pick you think you can just go on in pregnant\nAnd have a baby\nAnd then automatically that child is a Chinese citizen or a Korean citizen or a Russian citizen or a French citizen or a German citizen or a Saudi citizens they would laugh in your face\nThey would literally laugh you out of the hospital bed they would deliver the baby give you the baby and then say go back to where you came from you're not a citizen of China or Russia or wherever you're a citizen of America get lost\nNow it's a Halloween full of tree\nIs the\nDowntown for trick or treating tonight and who knows what tomorrow\nIt was a kid looking forward to it they'll give you a full recap far I Know that's exciting I might even bringing\nGo on and on you don't know what you're talking about and you know you don't\nKnow what you're talking about but the only reason why you're doing it is to stick it to the president of the United states that's it that's all\nNow\n[noise] um let me just make one final point this is something that is long\nOverdue long overdue\nThe way illegal immigrants had been abusing the so called interpretation of the fourteenth amendment I mean just think about it rationally just rationally okay if I squat in your house and that's when any legal immigrant is\nI come in through your front door uninvited not welcomed\nAnd I squat in your basement\nAnd then I start eating your fridge food out of your fridge I'm taking medicine from your medicine cabinet I'm sleeping in your own home ... illegal immigrant is and then suddenly I have a baby in your own home does that baby belong to you or you are responsible for that baby\nNo the responsibility for the baby is a V. person people who had the baby and the baby should go back to the house were by the people used to live is just common sense\nThat's why almost no other country in the world does what we do\nTrump is right Ryan and the mainstream media are wrong six one seven\nTo six six sixty eight sixty eight is the number okay my friend's\nComing up next [noise]\nThe Boston Red Sox\nAlix Cora now says the championship the world series champions may not visit the White House [noise]\nFar they writes far they wrong should they visit should they not visit\nWe'll discuss it but first\nFirst troops deployed to the southern border or arriving in Texas Evan hiding rich has that story take it away Evan\nThank you Jesse eight hundred troops have arrived in San Antonio and are now heading for the border part of the fifty two hundred troops the president has called on to secure the border\nAhead of the
