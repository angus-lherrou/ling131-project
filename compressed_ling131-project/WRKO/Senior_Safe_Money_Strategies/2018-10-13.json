first of November at the new ... in brain tree right by the home office both of these are Thursday's called eight eight eight eight hundred one eight eight one\nAnd meet Kelly financial family of experts in all fields of financial planning that Thursday October twenty fifth at the Tuscan kitchen in Burlington, Massachusetts and then again on the first of November at the ... in brain tree Kelly financial services eight eight eight eight hundred one [noise]\nAnd\nWhat we're in Studio this morning with Jim Freeman Jim is one of Kelly financial newest team members he's had a long history on Wall street and in banking nearby in Boston and as well as a career as a financial writer so he's got many talents and we're really happy that he's with us this morning\nWelcome Joe it's good to be here again John\nThere's a small place on the Brockton Avon line that I go to all the time for fish and chips showed up the north and the market in Delhi best fish and chips in New England again [laughter]\nAnd I've gone there for years and I've noticed now they probably have close to a dozen employees the place is packed all the time especially at lunchtime I Can't help but believe that the relaxation of some of these\n... rules and regulations haven't done anything but good for small business I\nTend to agree with that and a little shout out to our friends at the Norfolk county Republican committee that were so generous and having a speak\nLast week and some of the anecdotal stories I was hearing sort of post presentation confirmed exactly what you're saying in terms of some of these small business owners coming up to me and expressing just that the regulatory environment is improving for them [laughter]\nBless red tape and that translates into better service for customers a better profit margin anything but bad in all good\nThat's right and ... in Massachusetts the small business community is a huge segment of the economy here and I was just doing a little bit of research and the number of firms in Massachusetts with Nineteen employees or fewer is actually a hundred and twenty six thousand three hundred that represents eighty six percent of all Massachusetts farms\nAnd the number of employees and firms with Nineteen or fewer employees is five hundred Eighteen thousand which represents about Seventeen percent of all employees so that was standing what part of you stand for I got to believe that more likely than not that these are all the beneficiaries of these new policies\nNow unlike the mega corporations which [laughter] no surprise there all I have very liberal Democrat CEOs or worse many many hundreds of billions of dollars the small business guys don't really have the kind of clout they don't have the kind of representation\nThat the the big corporations do and that's why the Norfolk county jail Pete pack is such a valuable tool for small business it allows their microphones to get a little bit bigger they can show a little bit louder\nThat's absolutely true and we were talking about death and taxes as to certain things in life and his will Rogers once said the difference between death and taxes that that doesn't get any worse each time Congress meets\nWhich means taxes do in other words\nWell that's right and that that those are the certainties in life and death and taxes but there's also certain the in life in October and this area what does that John\n... the red Sox bullpen collapsing that's what we can always count on [laughter]\nI I think they need some advising\nFast thanks so they they do it we're going to get Dave de browse skiing here some day [laughter] so we're going to teach him how to run a team right\nWell that speaks to as we speak to quite a bit here on the program a planning and planning well\nAnd there's no better metaphor than baseball it covers well all the bases mean pitchers does is it's it it is the perfect American Game it is well you know the other thing that I wanted to talk with you about is because you just come from the Norfolk county GOP get together\nWe only have one voice and one vote and that hits home why that vote is so important it doesn't matter if we tweak it doesn't matter if we go on Facebook the only thing that matters is that we cast that vote and I'm shocked to hear many of my conservative friends even\nThink the same way as we do but they don't vote\nWhen you need to be resolved in finding three people in our lives and making darn sure absolutely sure they're registered and if they vote correctly and give them a ride to the polls better still have them get an absentee ballot it's harder to commit voter fraud when you have an absentee ballots\nI think giving options to people and really looking at goals we like to look toward the future and what are your goals and that really is a relative or experience as well because many times people haven't thought about their goals because their main goal is to earn enough to be able to retire\nAnd by the stage we can help them to answer some of those questions of what would you like to do what are your goals and that's a very positive thing too because it looks forward it's a positive experience\nAnd I imagine most of what you come down to in these discussions is that more options tend to be available than the client had sought otherwise\nThat's right that's right and coming in earlier in many instances allows us to provide more options to\nWhat you'd like to make an appointment with Jim or any member of the Kelly financial team give a call at eight eight eight

the front pages it's just too late to react\nWe still have Robert Mueller out there on his jihad\nTo frame up President Trump and set the table for impeachment this never seen at all like a legitimate fact finding mission but more like a Soviet style show trial in my view\nBut should that happen should the house of representatives go Democrat in November ... inch in the direction of impeachment I don't think I'm going out on a limb here but the market is not going to respond well\nIt might be great for CNN's ratings but not for our life savings so can your portfolio take that kind of pressure

know to raise a toast to your financial future and eight eight eight eight hundred Eighteen eighty one Kelly financial services with offices bring treats and\nSo boy so Boston New York about one hundred point seven to UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\nSo there's really only a couple of things that you can do in order to address that you can either cut these benefits which is I understand most of them legally you can't\nThat's right on the federal budget approximately two thirds of the federal budget is Medicare and Social Security those are mandated programs that are just not going to be caught\nRight so those are not going to be cut the qualifications the time at which you begin to collect them may be tweaked a little bit but nothing significant so what can you do to protect yourself if you have saved all your life and you have something to take can we let's be honest\nThat's what the government does it doesn't try to cut what it needs to pay it tries to find a way to pay it which means take it\nAnd that's why elections have consequences and our public officials need to be held accountable as far as these types of arrangements that were getting into and really I think the moral hazard that we've gotten into is that we are looking for future generations to pay for these obligations\nThat's the plan kicked the can down the road and let our children and grandchildren pay for it\nThat's right and it's terribly unfortunate I think\nA wave of progressive them that's looking toward the socialist model and I think what's lost in that is that if you look at the world wide history certainly in the last two hundred years worldwide poverty because of capitalism has come way way down and that's a fact\nAnd I think it's instructive to be reminded that capitalism not only makes us better off but it makes us better\nGeorge Will the conservative ... gave a speech a couple of years ago where he said capitalism enforces stern virtues such as thrift industrial miss individuals and and the different gratification and that's what's made this country great\nAt conversely we can look at what the socialist policies right very today in Venezuela did and continue to do it misery it's a living hell to be in Venezuela today\nAnd these problems are solvable I think that again that ... there's a great quote from Ronald Reagan who won says I don't want to go back to the past but I Want to go back to the past way of looking toward the future\n[laughter] pressuring good [noise] well bring it right back down to our clients what can we do as\nGuides to protect their wealth and all of that hard work that lifetime of savings that they managed to put by for themselves and their children what does a financial planner due to safeguard that\nWell I think looking at it from a very holistic point of view is we like to look at it from a mix of being patient and being vigilant\nAnd we can't predict crystal ball what's gonna happen down the road but we can certainly make adjustments along the way\nAnd I think that the combination of patients and vigilance is really a smart way to go about looking at these uncertainties in the future and what Mr Kelly used to call the restless sees the which I think are going to get more restless as we go on I agree\nAnd to that and we would love to invite you to one of Kelly financials dinner events but it's a great opportunity to meet the financial professionals at Kelly financial\nAnd learn more about the issues that matter to you your family and your overall financial well being the next one is coming up

Social Security decisions or any concerns you may have planning for or living in retirement I Want to personally invite you to one of Kelly financial\nInformative dinner event on October twenty fifth at the Tuscan kitchen in Burlington, Massachusetts\nAnd then again on the first of November at the new ... in brain tree right by the home office both of these are Thursday's\nCalled eight eight eight eight hundred one eight eight on and meet\nKelly financials family of experts in all fields of financial planning that Thursday October twenty fifth the Tuscan kitchen in Burlington, Massachusetts and then again on the first of November at the new ... in brain tree Kelly financial services eight eight eight eight hundred one\nAnd\nWe're back speaking with Jim Freeman he's one of the Kelly financials financial professionals and the newest member of the team [noise] we've been talking about some of the great successes of the economy and some of the fruits of the Trump tax plan [noise]\nBut that's the good stuff there are some foreboding figures out there as well Jim and maybe we can run through a few of those because we might need to be thinking about protecting that nests\nThat that we've worked so long to accumulate\nWell that's right John and it's great to be back with you again and over the summer there was a young upstart in New York by the name of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and she upset the fourth ranking Democrat from queens in the Bronx in a primary and she is a self professed democratic socialist\nAnd she has some what I call ... economic ideas that\nI think miss the points and could certainly throw the good news that we've been looking at over the last couple of years into a tailspin and she's really proposing a grab bag of new spending upon the which the legs we've never really seen before\nIt's taken this country two hundred Thirty years or so to accumulate Twenty one trillion dollars in debt and just over the next ten years she's proposing forty trillion dollars with the tea in New spending for which he has no way to pay for\nExcept with other people's money\nWell that's right and that recalls Margaret Thatcher's great line that the problem was socialism is that you eventually run of other people's money\nOr the frightening part is she has really become the new face of the Democratic party along with her mirror image over here in Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren and I think that should be a sobering thought when anyone goes into the voting booth on the sixth of amber\nShe has an economics degree from Boston University butter numbers just don't seem to add up to me she's proposing a grab bag of new spending for Medicare for all housing as a federal right federal jobs guaranteed tuition free public college\nAnd canceling all student that these are noble ideas of the country had virtually no debt but we are stuck in an avalanche of debt\nAnd this presents some challenges going forward given the absolute amount of debt outstanding in the country today\nAnd yet also weighing in on the good economic news as we've finally moved away from those dark days from ten years ago I find it terribly amusing that those people who oppose capitals\nAre the first people waiting hours in line to get their brand new smartphone either using those very smart phones the symbol of today's capitalism and using them to protest against the very capitals and that produce those folks right the irony is lost on many today\nIf you ever watch any of Stephen crowd ... videos yeah he is fabulous he's talking to Alexa you know that the Google mhm product it's frightening and wonder if he says Alexa\nWho is Jesus Christ elects answers Jesus Christ is a fictitious character and then he asks who's Muhammad and it goes on he was the great prophet of the religion of Islam who the who is you know brought it out of that it's really frightening\nYeah well I'm going to recall a story I did a short stint of substitute teaching I've absolutely convinced that substitute teaching let alone teaching third graders as far more challenging than working on Wall street\nFor lots of reasons with third graders they carved out some time to draw so there was this little girl in the April and said April what do you drawing as she's pulling away was her ... she says I'm drawing a picture of God I said wow\nI said that's wonderful April Hi said but there's a problem here and she looked to me quickly and she said what's the problem is that no one has seen gone before and she responded they will in a minute\n[laughter] and I think that looking at the avalanche of debt we will see in a minute what this is all going to look like\nBecause these two worlds are going to collide and especially with our seniors today you know they're weighing a lot of the new ideas that are coming out from the young people at the same time they're also having to look at some of the social services that the government's providing and sooner or later there's a logjam there\nAnd that's going to be the the breaking point and that's when ideas matter decisions matter and ultimately elections matter\nAnd we're as one coming up on November the ... in Massachusetts we face it in the Senate two different choices completely we see perhaps the the more elderly matronly version of ... in the form of Elizabeth Warren\nYou're already is too great to pay for it right then listen to avoid that I don't think would have a [laughter] I think in ... back when we did it\nSeveral years ago it was fun I think now we have people showing up at our homes right\nThey probably would track us down given given that had the ease with which you can do that now\nYou know to criticize a Reverend Sharpton is that right in front right man [laughter] the Reverend Sharpton is here with his limo when ... year old girl friends you know or whatever\nI ... in in oh that was fun when you're on us as being the ... on the show what's that what what do you end up being a park ranger in Wyoming now I Know the whole thing broke down general everyone's gone in a fucking about baseball hats kids leave us too you know they made they come back when we're older we

pass through your too much and and I always be needle in them and you'll be complete father\nAs right [laughter] that's all it takes over we got to close up this segment can you say for one night I

financial services eight eight eight eight hundred one [noise]\nAnd\nWhat we're in Studio this morning with Jim Freeman Jim is one of Kelly financial news team members he's had a long history on Wall street and in banking nearby in\nBoston and as well as a career as a financial writer so he's got many talents and we're really happy that he's with us this morning welcome gym it's good to be here again John\nThere's a small place on the Brockton Avon line that I go to all the time for fish and chips showed out the north and the market in Delhi best fishing ships in New England okay\nAnd I've gone there for years and I've noticed now they probably have\nClose to a dozen employees the place is packed all the time especially at lunchtime I Can't help but believe that the relaxation of some of these string you waiting rules and regulations haven't done anything but good for small business\nI tend to agree with that and a little shout out to our friends at the Norfolk county Republican committee that were so generous than having a speak\nLast week and some of the anecdotal stories I was hearing sort of post presentation confirmed exactly what you're saying in terms of some of these small business owners coming up to me and expressing just that the regulatory environment is improving for them [noise]\nBless red tape and that translates into better service for customers a better profit margin anything but bad in all good\nThat's right and ... in Massachusetts the small business community is a huge segment of the economy here and I was just doing a little bit of research and the number of firms in Massachusetts with Nineteen employees or fewer is actually a hundred and twenty six thousand three hundred that represents eighty six percent of all Massachusetts ...\nAnd the number of employees and firms with Nineteen or fewer employees is five hundred Eighteen thousand which represents about Seventeen percent of all employees so now standing what part of you stand for I got to believe that more likely than not that these are all the beneficiaries of these new policies\nNow unlike the mega corporations which [laughter] no surprise there all have very liberal Democrat CEOs or worse many many hundreds of billions of dollars the small business guys don't really have the kind of clout they don't have the kind of representation\nThat the the big corporations do and that's why the Norfolk county jail Pete pack is such a valuable tool for small business it allows their microphone to get a little bit bigger they can show a little bit louder\nThat's absolutely true and we were talking about death and taxes as a to certain things in life and his will Rogers wants that the difference between death and taxes that that doesn't get any worse each time Congress meets\nWhich means taxes do in other words\nWell that's right and that that those are the certainty is in life and death and taxes but there's also certain things in life in October and this area what does that Johnson\nThat is the red Sox bullpen collapsing yeah that's what we can always count on [laughter] I I think they need some advising that thing so they they do we're going to get Dave brown skin here some day [laughter] so we're going to teach him how to run a team right\nWell that speaks to as we speak to quite a bit here on the program a planning and planning well\nAnd there's no better metaphor the baseball it covers well all the bases [laughter] I mean it just does it it it is the perfect American Game it is well you know the other thing that I wanted to talk with you about is because you just come from the Norfolk county GOP get together\nWe only have one voice and one vote and that hits home why that vote is so important it doesn't matter if we tweak it doesn't matter if we go on Facebook the only thing that matters is that we cast that vote and I'm shocked to hear many of my conservative friends even\nThink the same way as we do but they don't vote\nWe need to be resolved in finding three people in our lives and making darn sure absolutely sure they're registered and the vote correctly and give them a ride to the polls better still have them get an absentee ballot it's harder to commit voter fraud when you have an absentee ballots", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Senior Safe Money Strategies", "city": "Boston", "day": "13"}
