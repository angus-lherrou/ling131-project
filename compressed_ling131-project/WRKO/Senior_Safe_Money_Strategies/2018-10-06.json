all\nOh ooh\nThe audience was yelling screaming and Boeing and what Lindsey do roll it Britain\nOr whether you like it or not I really don't care\nHere's the point I've seen what happened to these one

... was treated like crap\nYeah although yourself here's\n[laughter] now I just I Want to make an obvious point\nI just want to make that obvious point I'm Obama Obama\nIn his own memoirs admitted that when he was in high school when he was in college he's around his own them worse can\nI read his memoirs I'm like most people actually read them that's where it by the way you get a lot of damning information even in his memoirs she revealed how left wing he was but one in particular what he revealed was\nHe was a party animal his words not mine\nAnd Obama said when he was in high school and in college that he was a very aggressive drinker that in fact he would sometimes you drink quote unquote six beers and our a six pack an hour\nAnd then he would head back to class and it wasn't just the six pack he actually admitted he did drugs he did\nMarijuana he did cocaine so let me get district\nThe president that the liberals love when he was the same age just Kavanaugh was belt thing back six packs an hour was snorting cocaine and getting high as a kite off of marijuana smoking marijuana but that\nWas good enough for him to become president of the United states but not when it comes to cabinet\nAll all well\nShe she sure why Senate bill ... at a bar fight in Nineteen eighty five he actually true an ice cube oh my God he's\nHe I think he was drinking a little bit more in in in in in college and in high school than he admitted when he was testifying you know when he said he drank too much no no he was really a stumbling sloppy drunk you know when he got ... parties it was a sloppy drunk [noise]\nThat's perjury that's not acceptable he can't be on the Supreme Court\nBut stoner coke ad he can do line after line after line and then down six pack after six pack after ... six pack by his own admission the same age as Kevin all the dear leader\n[laughter] the anointed one oh\nThe greatest presidents America's ever had he can be president of the United states but Kavanaugh it relax come on\nYou didn't have to ... yeah four beers and from when he got forebears he was joking everywhere he was stumbling [laughter] that's not that's not what we heard from a guy when he testified that's a little leagues that kind of downplayed it a little bit that's perjury it's got to go\nThis is a twilight zone the scooter\nArcadia we created I our radio so you can put it in your pockets of taking everywhere you go to the station using bobcats and more for free everywhere you go bringing radio every part of your life wherever you live you can stream or a

... the voice so Boston following program as a paid commercial program\nUm [noise] God dang\nAnd these problems are solvable I think that again that there's a great quote from Ronald Reagan who won says I don't want to go back to the past but I Want to go back to the past way of looking toward the future [laughter]\nPressuring good [noise] well bring it right back down to our clients what can we do as\nGuides to protect their wealth and all of that hard work that lifetime of savings that they've managed to put by for themselves and their children what is a financial planner due to safeguard that\nWell I think looking at it from a very holistic point of view is we like to look at it from a mix of being patient and being vigilant\nAnd we can't predict crystal ball what's gonna happen down the road but we can certainly make adjustments along the way and I think that the combination of patients and vigilance is really a smart way to go about looking at these uncertainties in the future and what Mr Kelly used to call the restless see is a which I think are going to get more restless as we go on I\nAgree and to that and we would love to invite you to one of Kelly financials dinner events there was a couple of them coming up and it's a great opportunity to meet the financial professionals that Kelly financial\nAnd learn more about the issues that matter to you or your family and

will or a state making some Social Security decisions or any concerns you may have planning for or living in retirement I Want to personally invite you to wonder if Kelly financials informative dinner events on Thursday October eleventh\nAt the Tuscan kitchen in Salem New Hampshire and Thursday October twenty fifth at the Tuscan kitchen in Burlington, Massachusetts called eight eight eight eight hundred one eight eight one and meet Kelly financials family of experts in all of\nHer financial planning Thursday October eleventh\nAt the Tuscan kitchen in Salem New Hampshire and Thursday October twenty fifth the Tuscan kitchen in Burlington, Massachusetts Kelly financial services brain tree in Berlin to eight eight eight eight hundred on a\n\nBoat we're back speaking with Jim Freeman he's one of the Kelly financials financial professionals\nAnd the newest member of the team [noise] we've been talking about some of the great successes of the economy and some of the fruits of the Trump tax plan [noise] but that's the good stuff there are some\nForeboding figures out there as well Jim and maybe we can run through a few of those because we might need to be thinking about protecting that nest egg that we've worked so long to accumulate\nWell that's right John and it's great to be back with you again over the summer there was a young upstart in New York by the name of the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and she upset the fourth ranking Democrat from queens and the Bronx in a primary and she is a self professed democratic socialist\nAnd she has some what I call ... economic ideas\nThat I think miss the points and could certainly throw the good news that we've been looking at over the last couple of years into a tailspin and she's really proposing a grab bag of new spending upon the which the legs we've never really seen before\nIt's taking this country two hundred Thirty years or so to accumulate Twenty one trillion dollars in debt and just over the next ten years she's proposing forty trillion dollars with the tea in New spending for which he has no way to pay for\nExcept with other people's money\nWell that's right and that recalls Margaret Thatcher's great line that the problem was socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money\nOr the frightening part is she has really become the new face of the Democratic party along with her mirror image over here in Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren and I think that should be a sobering thought when anyone goes into the voting booth on the sixth of amber\nShe has an economics degree from Boston University butter numbers just don't seem to add up to me she's proposing a grab bag of new spending for Medicare for all housing as a federal right federal jobs guaranteed tuition free public college\nAnd canceling all student that these are noble ideas of the country had virtually no debt but we are stuck in an avalanche of debt\nAnd this presents some challenges going forward given the absolute amount of debt outstanding in the country today and yet\nAlso weighing in on the good economic news as we've finally moved away from those dark days for ten years ago I find it terribly amusing that those people who oppose capitals\nAre the first people waiting hours in line to get their brand new smartphone [laughter] either using those very smart phones the symbol of\nToday's capitalism and using them to protest against the very capitals and that produced those folks right the irony is lost on many today\nIf you ever watch any of Stephen crowd hers videos yeah he is fabulous and he's talking to Alexa you know the the Google mhm product it's frightening and wonder if ... says\nAlexa who is Jesus Christ elects answers Jesus Christ is a fictitious character and then he asks who's Muhammad and it goes on he was the great prophet of the religion of Islam who the who is you know brought it out of that it's really frightening\nYeah well I'm going to recall a story I did a short stint of substitute teaching I've absolute convinced that substitute teaching let alone teaching third graders is far more challenging than working on Wall street\nFor lots of reasons with third graders they carved out some time to draw so there was this little girl in the April and said April what are you drawing as she's toiling away was her ... she says I'm drawing a picture of God I said well\nI said that's wonderful April Hi said but there's a problem here and she looked to me quickly and she said what's the problem is that no one has seen gone before\nAnd she responded they will in a minute [laughter] and I think that looking at the avalanche of debt we will see in a minute what this is all going to look like because these two worlds are going to collide\nAnd especially with our seniors today you know they're weighing a lot of the new ideas that are coming out from the young people but at the same time they're also having to look at some of these social services that the government is providing them sooner or later there's a logjam there and that's going to be the the breaking point\nAnd that's when ideas matter decisions matter and ultimately elections matter\nAnd we're as one coming up on November the ... in Massachusetts we face it in the Senate two different choices completely we see perhaps the the more elderly matronly version of ... in the form of Elizabeth Warren\nAnd we see someone who was sober as a judge has as the cliche goes and Jeff deal who looks at numbers and understands numbers\nAnd in terms of Massachusetts has done remarkable work\nTo lower taxes for people who pay them\nThat's right and we remember the great line from will Rogers the difference between death and taxes that death doesn't get worse every time Congress meets\nAnd all of this boils down to we need to plan for our retirement\nIf we are in the accumulation phase we need a plan if we are getting near to retirement and we're going to have to be drawing on that we need a plan to protect it so give us a call to Kelly financial at eight eight eight eight hundred Eighteen eighty one make an appointment\nTo sit down with anyone of Kelly financials financial planners or think about attending on the upcoming dinner events the next one is coming up on October eleventh\nAt the Tuscan kitchen and Salem New Hampshire [noise] that's a

times the last great time in fact\nThat you are really speaking if your sixty five and and reasonably good health without any chronic illnesses you can expect to be around at least another Twenty years and half of us will be around even longer\nAnd if your genetics or right team with advances in medicine and nutrition you can see clear through well into your nineties and that's a pretty safe bet so that's all good good news\nSo the last thing you want to be worrying about is running out of cash pardon the pun Johnny in their retirement planning words a fancy word for running out of money is under estimating your investment time horizon your IT age\nSo how do you prevent that from happening that's both a common sense and Damascus owned the solutions have many moving parts\nAnd can take many forms there's no one size fits all answer\nAre you planning just for yourself do you have a husband or wife who live on for some time after you is the most important part of your plan leaving something for your kids are grandkids or a favorite charity the answers to these questions play the most crucial part in your plan shapes up\nAnd that plan is best executed with the team behind you so called ...\nEight eight eight hundred Eighteen eighty one and get the Kelly financial team in your corner they've helped thousands of clients get the peace of mind and security and retirement that we all deserve after a lifetime of hard work eight eight eight eight hundred Eighteen eighty one for a sit down with one of Kelly financials vice presidents\nA key wild card in planning for these years is inflation overtime inflation shrinks portfolios purchasing power has prices increase and they always do with just a matter of how much how fast today's dollars will have less purchasing power in the future\nSince roughly Nineteen twenty five inflation has averaged and important operative word here is averaged about three percent a year\nSo let me put myself in the example chair for a moment time sixty six in pretty good health my genes and both sides of my family have a track record for longevity if you factor out the smokers my grandparents parents and aunts and uncles all lived into their in mid nineties and some beyond\nSo I'm thinking positively for another Thirty years on this great and wonderful or is\nThat once we assume that prices sustained at\nThat three percent average inflation trend annually for those next Thirty years if I Need fifty thousand dollars to cover my yearly expenses today in ten years what I'm Seventy six I'll need about sixty seven thousand\nAnd I'll need Ninety thousand in Twenty years in about a hundred and twenty thousand by the time I hit that's thirty year mark just to keep the purchasing power on the level and pay my bills and that's not adding anything new or significant to my cost column just to maintain and once again\nThat's all presuming a nice average predictable inflation rate of three percent and history tells us and not ancient history there's no guarantee that\nInflation can rise dramatically as it did in the mid Nineteen seventies and early Nineteen eighties in Nineteen Seventy for example here I graduated from high school inflation was almost six percent in Nineteen Seventy four when I finished college it was more than eleven percent\nAnd in Nineteen eighty when I was in graduate school just at the end of Jimmy Carter's presidency it topped out at more than Thirteen percent\nIf your portfolio gets caught and one of these historical inflation storms will need protection\nNow granted inflation has been relatively subdued this past decade but history tells us that won't last forever particularly with the Federal Reserve clearly telling us that interest rates are going up and that's why you need a plan\nAnd a team behind you on that team at Kelly financial is one call away at eight eight eight eight hundred Eighteen eighty one\nPick up the phone right now give the team a call and make that planned at eight eight eight eight hundred Eighteen eighty one for a sit down with one of Kelly financial experts who can evaluate your complete financial landscape\nThere's one coming up on October eleventh at the Tuscan kitchen in Salem New Hampshire and Thursday October twenty fifth at the Tuscan kitchen in Burlington, Massachusetts the changing face of retirement\nBy Kelly financial services brain tree in Burlington eight eight eight eight hundred one eight eight one all events are on Thursdays all complements with Kelly financial\nSo give us a call right now at eight eight eight eight hundred one eight eight one and make you a reservation for any one of those dates come and meet experts in every field of money management\nYou'll get a chance to talk with Kelly financials vice president Brandon Godfrey Brandon is Kelly financials risk management specialist well what does that mean that means Brandon is in your corner\nTo help safeguard your savings or their savings of your children against the high cost of medical care especially long term nursing home care\nWe don't like to think about it we all want to believe will live to be a hundred in good health but the numbers don't support that hope the numbers tell us that every year one in three seniors will have a serious fall and will never be the same again\nSo before illness or accident finds you make an appointment to have a chat with Brandon at eight eight eight eight hundred one eight eight one and get ahead of that\nIf you have questions about trust if you're considering them or maybe you already have one or more trust and want to see if they're serving your needs the way you want Kelly financial has an expert to help you make that evaluation at eight eight eight eight hundred one eight eight one\nThe new tax plan recently passed into law changes the entire landscape of financial planning\nSo get a jump on that by calling eight eight eight eight hundred one eight eight one sit down with one of Kelly financials vice presidents and see how these new tax laws impact your retirement planning\nI had the pleasure of attending one of Kelly financials and parents recently in the event of course was a great success in terms of presenting financial information that goes without saying but I also observed people who had first did not know each other when they came in\nThey sat together and share the wonderful meal\nDisgust common concerns about their futures with one another and when the event was done they left not just better prepared to safeguard their nest eggs and look after their retirement they also left with a few new friends and our age that alone is worth the price of admission which of course is complimentary\nSo called eight eight eight eight hundred one eight eight one and make your reservation to attend Kelly financials the changing face of retirement eight eight eight eight hundred one eight eight one Kelly financial services brain tree in Berlin [noise]\n[noise]\n\nBut I still to\nCome back to the Kelly financial services show did Kelly zone William Kelly junior how are you my friend\nI'm doing good\nHowever William buddy I got to ask you this have you ever been in a hurricane\nWell the last one I can actually remember in the United states was Hurricane Sandy we lost power after Hurricane Sandy I'm my dad said that's it and the generator so of course you about the biggest generator\nThey [laughter]\nThey can call it a house for like four weeks so into that and it's really nice but in Dominican Republic we did experience Katrina I Believe for some reason I Can't remember the names that well\nThey take away from people who have already diver lurking or people have died and the last one if they weren't out\nThe names days the Greek alphabet they called out but data et cetera stuff like that and my\nBritish teacher actually taught me that when I\nWas in the fifth grade and in Dominican Republic which is a British woman American public I went on there it was a small little school\nHad mostly Dominican tracks all English to hit so to speak English and it was talking about her and George and how it hit them and they can show that it wrecked all the houses it causes more poverty I mean do they definitely didn't need it and he was talking\nAbout every so until years they changed the name of the hurricane so that\nMakes it even better it's not even called her and George anymore\nWhat's the most frightening thing about being in a hurricane\nMy dad and I we went to the beach there like five other cars at the beach and you could see them massive\nLike the waves ... Hyun is crashing\nIt's so cool we stood there for about thirty minutes you know just checking out we sat down by the curb and the sugar her candidate that if you're kind of in the outer of the hurricane that's when it's still worry about this little science\nClass for it yeah if we were right outside the hurricane completely fine Lakers fan and it was a ... it's fine if you're showing up on the outside or like inside like far away from the eye it's going to be very very bad like in the middle kind of zone halfway\nFrom the eye and a half away from like saying there is that when it gets like really bad because for example one arm is on a poll a or other armed is holding it out and you're walking around the pole in order for your arm that out\nTo stay at the same speed as you on the on the pole the arm that's out how to go at a faster pace and this is the logic so that means that's why the I is the most peaceful and the slowest and day out or as the ashes\nMost harsh and of course in the middle in the exact\nDie like right inside it it's ... it's also in the Republican hurricane George George passed right over Dominican Republic right\nOver allow Ramona which is where I was saying my teacher will recalls being right under the I couldn't hear single noise from a single bird or a thanks everything's perfect for about like let's say like thirty minutes an hour and then you see this massive\nCloud wall and like you have to get back inside because the hurricane you know passing by like hurricanes have a lot of science behind it\nWe're kind of running out of time a little bit but I Know that there is a big apple special event\nApples special events there the huge next thing you know and an\nApple special event this is one they introduce the newest and best technology for the sheer ... two years in back in two thousand seven when Steve Jobs introduced the first I found out now special event\nIt was huge all across the world everywhere they they I was huge and there are plenty of wait for a new iPhones knew I had new apple\nWatches well they're probably gonna released um about three months later they're huge they're very popular a lot of people who voted on the entire she jobs here is packed\nYou're more of the high tech person into family\nTech and I think it's really cool so yeah more than the tech guy\nCall impacts us about all I can do on my iPhone I Want to wish you a very very happy weekend how wonderful week and we'll talk soon All right but I I my friends you're listening to the ... financial services show Huron W. R. J. O.\nThey'll be back with so much more don't touch not bio\nNews break coming up and during the break the time to give a call at eight eight eight hundred Eighteen eighty one eight eight eight eight hundred Eighteen eighty one and make that all important first step to secure your retirement\nFuture that future can scar today by reserving the police had one of Kelly financial dinner and then the next one is on October left at the Tuscan kitchen Salem New Hampshire\nIf ... twenty fifth kitchen Burlington, Massachusetts both of those are Thursday's so difficult right now the eight hundred one one company for national all over the ... financial vice presidents will be there\nCan be financial CEO Kelly Kelly will be there because they planning attorney will be their tax specialists will be there get to know raise a toast your financial future maybe eight hundred Eighteen eighty one Kelly financial services with offices bring tree [noise]\nBoy so Boston do you worry about one hundred point seven to ... like eighty to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Michelle Brandt them by the end\nTwenty nine billion unfunded pensions thirty eight billion bonded that and twenty billion dollars and all that and those are the optimistic numbers if you look at it from a different way more conservative numbers those numbers are actually higher\nSo there's really only a couple of things that you can do in order to address that you can either cut these benefits which is I understand most of them legally you can't\nThat's right on the federal budget approximately two thirds of the federal budget is Medicare and Social Security those are mandated programs that are just not going to be caught\nRight so those are not going to be cut the qualifications ... the time at which you begin to collect them may be tweaked a little bit but nothing significant so what can you do to protect yourself\nIf you have saved all your life and you have something to take into we let's be real honest that's what the government does it doesn't try to cut what it needs to pay it tries to\nFind a way to pay it which means take it\nAnd that's why elections have consequences and our public officials need to be held accountable as far as these types of arrangements that were getting into and really I think the moral hazard that we've gotten into is that we are looking for future generations to pay for these obligations\nThat's the plan kicked the can down the road and let our children and grandchildren pay for it\nThat's right and it's terribly unfortunate I think there's a wave of progressive them that's looking toward the socialist model and I think what's lost in that is that if you look at the worldwide history certainly in the last two hundred years worldwide poverty because of capitalism has come way way down and that's a fact\nAnd I think it's instructive to be reminded that capitalism not only makes us better off but it makes us better\nGeorge Will the conservative columnist gave a speech a couple of years ago where he said capitalism enforces stern virtues such as thrift industrial miss individuals and as a ... gratification and that's what's made this country great\nAt conversely we can look at what the socialist policies right very today in Venezuela did and continue to do it misery it's a living hell to be in Venezuela today\nAnd these problems are solvable I think that again that ... there's a great quote from Ronald Reagan who won says I don't want to go back to the past but I Want to go back to the past way of looking toward the future\n[laughter] pressuring good [noise] well bring it right back down to our clients what can we do as\nGuides to protect their wealth and all of that hard work that lifetime of savings that they've managed to put by for themselves and their children what does a financial planner due to safeguard that\nWell I think looking at it from a very holistic point of view is we like to look at it from a mix of being patient and being vigilant\nAnd we can't predict crystal ball what's gonna happen down the road but we can certainly make adjustments along the way\nAnd I think that the combination of patients and vigilance is really a smart way to go about looking at these uncertainties in the future and what Mr Kelly used to call the restless see is a which I think are going to get more restless as we go on I agree\nAnd to that and we would love to invite you to one of Kelly financials dinner events there was a couple of them coming up and it's a great opportunity to meet the financial professionals that Kelly financial\nAnd learn more about the issues that matter to you your family and your overall financial wellbeing we have to coming up the next one is an October

K. if you're concerned about the new tax\nLaws you will or state making some Social Security decisions or any concerns you may have planning for or living in retirement I Want to personally invite you to one of Kelly financial\nInformative dinner event on Thursday October eleventh at\nThe Tuscan kitchen in Salem New Hampshire and Thursday October twenty fifth at the Tuscan kitchen in Burlington, Massachusetts called eight eight eight eight hundred one eight eight one and meet Kelly financials family of experts in all fields of financial planning Thursday October eleventh\nAt the Tuscan kitchen in Salem New Hampshire and Thursday October twenty fifth the Tuscan kitchen in Burlington, Massachusetts Kelly financial services brain tree in Berlin to eight eight eight eight hundred one a while\nAnd\nWe're back speaking with Jim Freeman he's one of Kelly financials financial professionals and the newest member of the team we've been talking about\nSome of the great successes of the economy and some of the fruits of the Trump tax plan but that's the good stuff there are some\nForeboding figures out there as well Jim and maybe we can run through a few of those because we might need to be thinking about protecting that nest egg that we've worked so long to accumulate\nWell that's right John and it's great to be back with you again over the summer there was a young upstart in New York by the name of the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and she upset the fourth ranking Democrat from queens in the Bronx in a primary\nAnd she is a self professed democratic socialist and she has some what I call ... economic ideas\nThat I think missed the points and could certainly throw the good news that we've been looking out over the last couple of years into a tailspin and she's really proposing a grab bag of new spending upon the which the legs we've never really seen before\nIt's taken this country two hundred Thirty years or so to accumulate Twenty one trillion dollars in debt and just over the next ten years she's proposing forty trillion dollars with the tea in New spending for what she has no way to pay for it\nExcept with other people's money\nWell that's right and that recalls Margaret Thatcher's great line that the problem was socialism is that you eventually run of other people's money\nOr the frightening part is she has really become the new face of the Democratic party along with her mirror image over here in Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren and I think that should be a sobering thought when anyone goes into the voting booth on the sixth of amber\nShe has an economics degree from Boston University butter numbers just don't seem to add up to me she's proposing a grab bag of new spending for Medicare for all housing as a federal right federal jobs guaranteed tuition free public college\nAnd canceling all student that these are noble ideas of the country had virtually no debt but we are stuck in an avalanche of debt\nAnd this presents some challenges going forward given the absolute amount of debt outstanding in the country today\nAnd yet also weighing in on the good economic news as we've finally moved away from those dark days from ten years ago I find that terribly amusing that those people who oppose capitals\nAre the first people waiting hours in line to get their brand new smartphone [noise] either and using those very smart phones the symbol of today's capitalism and using them to protest against the very capitals in that produce those folks right the irony is lost on many today\nThan ever watch any of Stephen crowd hers videos yeah he is fabulous he's talking to Alexa you know the the Google mhm product it's frightening and one of them he says\nAlexa who's Jesus Christ Alexa answers Jesus Christ is a fictitious character and then he asked who is Mohammed and it goes on he was the great prophet of the religion of Islam who the who is you know brought it out of that it's really frightening\nYeah well I'm going to recall a story I did a short stint of substitute teaching I've absolutely convinced that substitute teaching let alone teaching third graders is far more challenging than working on Wall street\nFor lots of reasons with third graders they carved out some time to draw so there was this little girl in the April and said April what do you drawing as she's pulling away was her ... she says I'm drawing a picture of God I said wow\nI said that's wonderful April Hi said but there's a problem here and she looked to me quickly and she said what's the problem is that no one has seen gone before and she responded they will in a minute [laughter] and I think that looking at the avalanche of debt we will see in a minute yeah what\nIs all going to look like because these two worlds you're going to collide\nAnd especially with our seniors today you know they're weighing a lot of the new ideas that are coming out from the young people at the same time they're also having to look at some of the social services that the government's providing in sooner or later there's a logjam there and that's going to be the the breaking point\nAnd that's when ideas matter decisions matter and ultimately elections matter\nWe did it I don't think would have a [laughter] I think it ... back when we did it several years ago it was fun I think now we have people showing up at our homes right\nThey probably would ... given given that had the ease with which you can do that now\nIs to criticize a Reverend Sharpton user right in front right [laughter]\nThe Reverend Sharpton is here with his limb out when I was wondering [laughter] so you know or whatever I\nEnd up being oh that was fun wedding on us as being the ... on the show what's that what what then yeah you know he's out being a park ranger in Wyoming now I Know the whole thing broke down the everyone's going to talk about baseball that's our kids leave us too you know they may they come back when we're older we hope\nYeah that's what I was telling William the other day said I'd said something so we said what's your job as a doubt it's your ... your kids complain about money and don't let them pass through your too much in and it always be needle in them and you'll be a complete father you know that's right that's all it takes over we go to close up this segment ...\nYeah yeah I got to go shopping the
