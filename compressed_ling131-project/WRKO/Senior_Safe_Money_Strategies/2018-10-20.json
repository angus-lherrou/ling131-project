{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "So he tweeted this out the ... you know by the way he's a clown it's so obvious he's a clown listen now to this clown this is what he tweeted out quote I'm thinking this guy's a mayor quote\nOpen challenge to Web deals for Senate if you win in November I'll post a video of me drinking as Sam adams and congratulating do on your when\nIf you lose you post one of you drinking a ads slumber rule and praising sanctuary cities\n\nSo basically here's this bath and he thinks he's being funny and ... you know he's calling for a boycott of Sam adams by the way what mayor of an adjoining city to Boston\nCalls for a boycott of aid Boston company be a great American company okay only somebody frankly as deranged as stupid as Joan Curtis don't\nAle but anyway so he's going on about so if you win all that I'm going to drink some items\nAnd you're gonna do I want to congratulate you on your victory ... volition Warren wins you're going to have a swarm borough with me and then you have to endure sanctuary cities\nAnd I'm thinking when they get district ... this is a ... it's the equivalent of this\nIf you when I drink a beer with you if I when I have to kill myself\nWhy should chef deal indoor sanctuary cities to bring in what more MS Thirteen gang bangers to bring in more illegals stealing jobs taking welfare driving down wages committing crimes committing murders committing rapes\nOh you've ever heard of a mess you Denise you've ever heard of Kate family do you ever heard of the thousands and thousands of Americans who've been killed by illegals hey oh don't you read the newspaper don't you do something with your life a oh\nI mean I I honestly he was just trying to bully and go after Jeff now Jeff by the way he's such a liar Curtis tone he well she's on his bats so Geoff Diehl thought that he tweeted back to his credit quote\nIt's a sad day when Joe Kurt atone attacks local businesses like at Sam adams a lockout Samuel Adams beer while praising sanctuary cities he undermines our police like when that Senator Warren called them racist front to back\nAnd then um then Curtis tongue listen to this he shoots bat\nSanctuary cities are doing great yeah right have you checked Somerville lately genius if you look at your own city\nWhat's sad is that deal won't even take a simple side bent on himself I think it was so smart oh after deciding to stir it up the fiction Easter painting is going to run into reality show enough and he knows it\nWell then Jeff deal tweets back saying hold on we had a bad over the gas tax\nAnd if if I lost I was going to wear a hoodie\nThat said the guy you know I support the gas tax increase or whatever and if you lost your going to wear a hoodie tank the gas tax well you lost you couldn't get the automatic increases in the gas tax what occurred atone do he never took up the bat\nHe never followed through on the bad he will shift\nSo Geoff Diehl shoots back and says well the last time we had a bet and you lost you didn't honor it you know why Jeff didn't say that but I'm going to say it 'cause he's a sleazy wine corrupt politicians that's what he is he's a lawyer like Elizabeth Warren is a Democrat that's what they do they lie\nSo just like they're going to make another bit after you will on the last bit\nSo he kept trying to go after deal\nAnd I said you know what he's just going after Jeff because he knows that this is backfiring and blowing up on a loser this war in space\nSo he's trying to make an issue now out of Jeff deal and why won't eat drink a dumb beer with them so the corner man I said enough is enough so I tweeted Curtis home chicken cacciatore oh and I said quote tough guy\nWhy don't you come on my show and debate me\nYou want to make these kinds of childish\nYou're a child prophetic bats in challenges as the mayor of a city why don't you come on my show and debate to me\nAnd let's see what you got oh\nWhen I challenged chicken cacciatore do a debate so an ally you should have seen the way he was backtracking then it's like well who cares about this issue or you want to talk about this issue told a Twitter feed you can see it for yourself\nAnd I'm like you're the one that's talking about it you're the one is making a big deal about this so come on tough guy put your money where your mouth is will you come on my show and debate me man or woman or chicken cacciatore\nNothing nothing\nAnd so finally I sent them a tweet said I get it your chicken what a little gift fun it\nIs it a gift for a Jeff suggests to guess\nWhat do you call it ... it's like yeah okay so what a little gift on it of The Simpsons doing I'm a little chicken I'm a little chicken I'm too chicken I'm too chicken I'm too chicken so we use a little chicken\nAnd that's what I mean he's all talk and no action and I got to tell you okay I'm going in this Twitter war with Israel\nAnd I can see he doesn't want to come on my show because he knows I Would destroy him I Would destroy sanctuary cities I Would destroy how we run Somerville I Would expose the corruption that's under this guys watch\nAbout his relatives and how he puts them on the payroll and always got false disability claims for many of his corrupt cousins I could go on and on with this guy\nSo he knows that so instead he runs instead tough guy now is in such a tough guy\nBecause he can hide behind social media and Twitter and I'm thinking is you're the mayor of a city and you're like a clown\nMaking challenges to people about whether you have the guts to drink a beer with me and why don't you drink a beer with me and so I told them in one of these tweets I sent back to him he says you know why won't just drink uh Sammy with me I'm like number one nobody calls it a Sammy day Sam adams I ... I might try call street tough guy\nBut nobody calls it a Sammy that's number one number two nobody cares about having a drink with you\nActually I called him a narcissistic liberal fraud I said you are cystic liberal fraud nobody cares about having a drink with you know you want to have the guts to come on and debate sanctuary cities\nYou want to come on and debate while you think Elizabeth Warren is better than Jeff deal you want to come on about why a mayor you know you got all day you always go way too much time on your hands\nYou all day\nYou're going on Twitter I saw this guy does he's on Twitter all day\nAnd I'm thinking if you got time to tweet Jeff deal and be a troll and get into a Twitter war with the corner man boy oh boy you really really got free time on your hands\nI commend this morning they come in often Ninety three I'm coming into Somerville I got to go through Somerville to get to Medford huge\nWind took me twenty minutes\nTo get through Somerville this morning you know why because just down our street on the intersection this construction\nAnd that construction crew where he was a bit weeks if not months there have been there for weeks if not months I have no idea what they're doing but I'm telling you the progress is zero\nAnd I'm thinking instead of you know I don't know making sure the construction crews get their jobs done on time\nHelp service the public make sure you don't have so much traffic congestion and your own city\nI don't know the crime the illegals the welfare the crumbling infrastructure the corruption the mismanagement that the mayor's office maybe just maybe you should be worried about construction crews holding up trafficking bothering taxpayers\nFor weeks and weeks if not months\nBecause of the absolute corruption under your government under your leadership and instead of you are trolling Geoff Diehl taking pot shots at Jeff deal and then like the little chicken that you are running away from the corner man when I challenge you to what the big [noise]\nSo no credit phone\nDo shift in chicken cacciatore\nSaturday it is just\nSo boy so Boston\nNew York about one other point seven to UCLA H.

tremors or in fact just a little hiccup but Andrew what kind of companies will do well in this environment when rates will be going up\nWhat we're looking at is the companies that are less leverage or less reliant on the issuance of new debt to either create demand for their stock or borrow just find increased gross or the companies that are going to be able to get through a rising interest rate environment much easier than the rest\nYou [noise] [noise]\n\nWhere we are talking this beautiful Saturday morning with Jim Freeman Jim is Kelly financial director of clients services\nMrs Kelly was actually showing us some video footage of you throwing some apples in the ... you have a great voice so I think there may be a future beyond radio for you we can take this on the road I Know some people John\n... when I was singing all that time yeah well yeah I was grinding the apples and singing and the side or had not even fermented yet still fresh\nI was wondering if that was a John Boudreau original we can take this new version of Americana\nYou never know you never know [laughter] okay now let's get down to some numbers often Jim is the first in the last person clients see when they come in and the past couple of weeks have been a little well topsy turvy so Jim talk down could you please\nAbsolutely I think that the market really as I've been\nDoing my own research has really transitioning from a deflation or a mindset to an inflationary mindset and that's really ... things and if you think about a market volatility isn't that rare and the grand scheme of things that it's almost more the norm but I think that clients may not understand this or see this and quite honestly for the last\nYear and a half in particular and the last several years since the great recession\nWe've seen an amazing Bull Run and if you think about it this Bull Run depending upon how you exactly to find it really began in March of two thousand nine\nAnd it's been amongst the if not the longest Bull Run in the market history\nIt's going on a hundred and Fifteen months now the average post World war two bull market is about sixty three months so\nI think that we have reached that level back in August and I think people are taking a look at the markets and there is a lot of volatility today but there's also a lot of good economic news as well and I think if we look at wages are up\nJob creation as up capital expenditure services are up consumer creditors up a lot of really good things happening\nBut last week in particular was sort of a convergence of really bad news all around and we had the hurricane\nThe United nations came out with a report saying that the carbon dioxide levels are so high that we have until two thousand and forty until the world comes to an end there's been more and more trade tariffs with China\nThere's concerns about Brexit there's concerns about flare ups in Europe and in particular the markets are looking at Italy in particular and markets have a way of looking at things through a prism\nAnd Italy's finances are cause for concern as well so if we take all these events combined the market was taking a look at them and taking I think hitting the pause button\nTo protect that week and a half let's say what was the percentage drop\nThe marketing recovered a little bit on friday so I think it was down roughly four percent give or take\nYeah so it wasn't even five percent so this is not something that is earth shattering and it's not mutually exclusive of a very sound economy which has all of the other elements fairly well established and in place\nI think among the biggest concerns right now our interest rates and not necessarily the short term rates but the Federal Reserve announced\nIn the last several days that they've increased the fed funds rate from to point to this year or so to about two point two five with the expectation that next year they'll see more rate increases and I think that that has both the market because remember since the great recession\nThe Federal Reserve is essentially floated money for free interest rates have been near zero and that's abnormal\nAnd if we look at the last forty years interest rates have been declining steadily\nOverall and right now the market is looking at any spike in interest rates especially the long term rates the treasury ten year is the benchmark and right now that's the ring around three point two or three percent\nAnd if you speak to some of the industry leaders even Jamie ... Morgan Chase they're looking at perhaps four percent on the horizon so that has certainly given some market watches concern\nRight and those who had profits took them\nThat's right that's right and really if we look about this\nFrom a more holistic standpoint turmoil volatility can actually have positive side effects because it really sharpens are focused to see what we have our portfolios when the market really hit it fall to point we actually contacted all of our clients which was very instructive for them and many of them reached out back to us so\nIt's part of that process that I talk about a lot with you with regard to our practice era Calif financial\nWhere again we analyze design managing review and that review process is so critical and I think that that's been something that we've been really vigilant about ourselves whether it's a periodic scheduled review or instances and such volatility like this where we reach out to our clients\nAnd when you do have this review of your portfolio by Kelly financial aid is a top to bottom individual review of your needs no template no cookie cutter\nSo give us a call to Kelly financial at eight eight eight eight hundred one eight eight one make an appointment with any member of the team or make a reservation to attend one of the dinner seminars coming up October twenty fifth\nAt the Tuscan kitchen in Salem in New Hampshire and November first at the new videos in brain tree right near the home office both of these are Thursdays\nAnd you might consider the holiday branch now I'm not being politically correct we call it

him if that song has special meaning to you if it touches you in the heart and the head like a church bell well\nIt's very likely that much of your life is already in the rearview mirror now there's plenty of good time left a great time in fact ... speaking if you're sixty five and didn't reasonably good health without any chronic illnesses you can expect to be around at least\nAnother Twenty years and half of us in that category will be around even longer\nAnd if your genetics or write teamed with advances in medicine and nutrition you can see clear through well into your nineties and that's a pretty safe bet so\nThis is Wednesday and did either she gave me a hug it right after she gave me a hug she said if I was in a public school out get fired [laughter]\nSo hold on your teacher gave you a hug she did what caused her to hug you\nTell me I'm doing so well and she's a great teacher always\nWhere he was happy she's proud and she wants to give me like an affectionate hog like a great job and she gives you a little bit of a hog yeah and then she says if I did this in a public school I Would have lost my job I'd be fired\nAnd it you know it's crazy 'cause I mean she's not wrong he even told us she lasted two years in a public school it's insane and it makes no sense again I mean they're just asked\nThem if they want to hug and they all of them I don't understand why why would you want to\nFreak out because all of them mostly affectionate you know and it's insane how public schools now\nIf you will find someone you can get expel like that to be on his chest I think liberals it is because they can cause it's supposedly fun for them\nTo go after these huge fires order torture teachers frog and students now if you don't mind me asking which you how did you feel uncomfortable that it makes you feel awkward when she did that\nSo I Would hope feel awkward chess I mean\nSo you had no problem with it whatsoever oh no not at all\nI agree with you I mean I remember when I was growing up I went to public school and you know teachers would give us a friendly hog or a high fiber nobody complained the parents didn't complained to students didn't complain I liked it everybody liked it but this is now a it's a new world I mean the moon bounce run everything that's right yeah\nI notice there's a direct correlation between liberals taking over something going right down to Portland right I'm happy for you my friend and I'm happy that you're a teacher is able to teach in a Catholic school because she's right if this was a public school and she her view she'd be gone that's right yeah William Kelly junior my friend\nHow a great weekend and we'll talk next week\nTired day we'll be back after\nThis short break\nDome LBJ nuts by [noise]\n\nThe thing with John Boudreau Kenny Kenny [noise] eight hundred a one eight eight to ... [noise]\n\nWe mark the one year anniversary of Kelly financial founder bill Kelly's passing recently\nAnd we thought we revisit a chat bill had a couple of years ago which seems to predict these very trying times we are living in today\nBill called his monologue rest [noise] and we bring it to you again on her life like\n\nIf you're an investor right now you might feel I think the one way to some of the people with whom I'm reading one way to sum it up is the rest will see if you're if you've ever been on a restless see it's it's not quite white caps it's not quite smoothed sock quite rolling but it's a little bit rough\nAnd you sort of waiting for it to get worse and you're preparing and you're hoping for the best\nI think that's what that's what today's market might feel like to you especially if everything you have is now at the mercy of people that might not know what they're doing and if you feel that that might be happening and you're wondering is there a safe way is there a better way\nThere is ladies and gentlemen there's an old picture of a man outside of a church freezing use right below them\nHe's right below the window when it's winter night it's snowing in and you could see a beautiful stained glass window and the cathedral and he's huddled there were some people look at the picture and when I asked him what\nThink it is they say oh it's hopelessness\nAnd I say it's just it's not hopelessness to me it's the fact that all that man has to do is walk around the front walk around to the front of the church open the door and walk in and start praying first of all he'll be warm second of all there'll be people in there to help him\nActually to SUV him maybe feed him and third he can be on his way to something much different in his life so\nIn in the ultimate despair there's hope\nAnd I think that is important as an investor that use preserve\nWhat you have for the most part to be able to come back on the other day if you choose to do so\nRemember ladies and gentlemen you don't have to play by the rules you don't have to play by their rules so if you feel like you're in a restless see if it gets much worse you could become sea sick or becoming injured\nYou're hoping for the best interests Lucy because you want to get to your destination but what might be happening is things could be worsening over the horizon and you can't see over the horizon you know what's happening around you\nSo we prepare for the worst\nAnd right now I think we have to be careful about sustaining losses until this market take shape again and if people are out there saying their goodbyes well I'll tell you what I'll say to them goodbye\nBecause we don't we don't trust anything that's happening right now but anyway it's an underlying feeling that we are ... so we're in a restless sea and we're rather lists\nSo being rather loose means it's hard to get direction you have to control the boat by or Z then you have to push and you have to pull and you have to struggle\nSo in order to do that it's going to take a lot more effort effort to get where you want to go there's a lot more danger than having a ... a vessel and if you have a captain who hasn't done this before it's going to get rough and if you've been out in the ocean and you've navigated the boat than you know it it's tricky\nAnd looks very deceptive so very experienced captains of found themselves loss ladies and gentlemen because things can get out of hand fast so like airplane pilots can they can experience for her to go they can find themselves actually upside down in very dense clouds and they can't figure out where they are and they tried to pull up\nAnd trying to pull up there actually driving the plane right into the ground so that can happen at sea so if you feel like there's a restless see of the markets or a or on a restless see and if you feel that uh people play you\nIf if Reuters has good news about jobs in other words there are less people filing for unemployment what about hiring numbers ladies and gentlemen what about the new jobs\nIf they are less people filing for unemployment if we are five hundred and fifty thousand people into the census than what's gonna what's it what does that do the job numbers takes five hundred and fifty thousand people off of the\nUnemployment rolls or out of the unemployed category but we don't consider the fact that many people many many people have given up looking for work one in five people right now in our country is on government assistance that's a lot\nForty plus percent of our people in America pay no taxes so if you run a but if you're at a bus stop you sitting with ten people on a bus and on the bench of four of them are not paying taxes and the other six are it's getting close to five pretty soon it'll be fifty fifty when it goes over\nThat we're in deep deep trouble so if you're feeling like the investing world is a restless see right now then how do you how do you react you

Studio this morning with Jim Freeman Jim is one of Kelly financial news team members he's had a long history on Wall street and in banking nearby in Boston and as well as a career as a financial writer so he's got many talents and we're really happy that he's with us this morning\nWelcome gym it's good to be here again John\nThere's a small place on the broader than Avon line that I go to all the time for fish and chips showed up the north and the market in Delhi best fish and chips in New England a grade [laughter]\nAnd I've gone there for years and I notice now they probably have\nClose to a dozen employees the place is packed all the time especially at lunchtime I Can't help but believe that the relaxation of some of these ... rules and regulations haven't done anything but good for small business\nTend to agree with that and a little shout out to our friends at the Norfolk county Republican committee that were so generous and having a speak\nLast week and some of the anecdotal stories I was hearing sort of post presentation confirmed exactly what you're saying in terms of some of these small business owners coming up to me and expressing just that the\nRegulatory environment is improving\nFor them less red tape and that translates into better service for customers a better profit margin anything but bad in all good\nThat's right and ... in Massachusetts\nThe small business community is a huge segment of the economy here and I was just doing a little bit of research in the number of firms in Massachusetts with Nineteen employees or fewer is actually a hundred and twenty six thousand three hundred that represents eighty six percent of all Massachusetts farms\nAnd the number of employees and firms with Nineteen or fewer employees is five hundred Eighteen thousand which represents about Seventeen percent of all employees so now standing what part of you stand for I got to believe that more likely than not that these are all the beneficiaries of these new policies\nNow unlike the mega corporations which [laughter] no surprise there all I have very liberal Democrat CEOs who are worth many many hundreds of billions of dollars to small business guys don't really have the kind of clout they don't have the kind of representation\nThat the the big corporations do and that's why the Norfolk county jail Pete pack is such a valuable tool for small business it allows their microphone to get a little bit bigger they can show a little bit louder\nThat's absolutely true and we were talking about death and taxes as if to certain things in life and his will Rogers wants that the difference between death and taxes that that doesn't get any worse each time Congress meets\nWhich means taxes do in other words\nWell that's right and that that those are the certainties in life and death and taxes but there's also certain the in life in October and this area what does that Jonathan\nBad as the red Sox bullpen collapsing that's what we can always count on [laughter]\nI I think they need some advising\nI think so they they do it we're going to get Dave dumb browse skiing here some day [laughter] so we're going to teach him how to run a team right\nWell that speaks to as we speak to quite a bit here on the program a planning and planning well\nAnd there's no better metaphor than baseball it covers all all the bases pitchers does is it's it it is the perfect American Game it is well you know the other thing that I wanted to talk with you about is because you just come from the Norfolk county GOP get together\nWe only have one voice and one vote and that hits home why that vote is so important it doesn't matter if we tweak it doesn't matter if we go on Facebook the only thing that matters is that we cast that vote and I'm shocked to hear many of my conservative friends even\nThink the same way as we do but they don't vote\nWhen you need to be resolved and finding three people in our lives and making darn sure absolutely sure they're registered and if they vote correctly and give them a ride to the polls better still have them get an absentee ballot it's harder to commit voter fraud when you have an absentee ballots\nBecause really what a financial advisor does is he can reveal possibilities to you that you never thought were available to you before\nThat's right and I think giving options to people and really looking at goals we like to look toward the future and what are your goals and that really is a relative or experience as well because many times people haven't thought about their goals because their main goal is to earn enough to be able to retire\nAnd by the stage we can help them to answer some of those questions of what would you like to do what are your goals and that's a very positive thing too because it looks forward it's a positive experience\nAnd I imagine most of what you come down to in these discussions is that more options tend to be available than the client had thought otherwise\nThat's right that's right and coming in earlier in many instances allows us to provide more options to\nWhat you'd like to make an appointment with Jim or any member of the Kelly financial team give a call at eight eight eight eight hundred Eighteen eighty one you can make a reservation for one of their up and coming dinner events the next one is coming up on October

terrorism by the time the news reaches the front pages it's just too late to react\nWe still have Robert Mueller out there on his jihad\nTo frame up President Trump and set the table for impeachment

well and I think if we look at wages are up\nJob creation is up capital expenditure further up consumer creditors up a lot of really good things happening\nBut last week in particular was sort of a convergence of really bad news all around and we had the hurricane\nThe United nations came out with a report saying that the carbon dioxide levels are so high that we have until two thousand and forty until the world comes to an end there's been more and more trade tariffs with China\nThere's concerns about brags that there's concerns about flare ups in Europe in particular the markets are looking at Italy in particular and markets have a way of looking at things through a prism and Italy's finances are cause for concern as\nWell so we take all these events combined the market was taking a look at them and taking I think hitting the pause button\nIf you take that week and a half let's say what was the percentage drop\nThe marketing recovered a little bit on friday so I think it was down roughly four percent give or take\nYeah so it wasn't even five percent so this is not something that is earth shattering and it's not mutually exclusive of a very sound economy which has all of the other elements fairly well established and in place\nI think among the biggest concerns right now our interest rates and not necessarily the short term rates but the Federal Reserve announced\nAnd the last several days that they've increased the fed funds rate from to point to this year or so to about two point two five with the expectation that next year they'll see more rate increases and I think that that has the market because remember since the great recession\nThe Federal Reserve is essentially floated money for free interest rates have been near zero and that's abnormal\nAnd if we look at the last forty years interest rates have been declining steadily\nOverall and right now the market is looking at any spike in interest rates especially the long term rates the treasury ten year is the benchmark and right now that's a ring around three point two or three percent\nAnd if you speak to some of the industry leaders even Jamie ... Morgan Chase they're looking at perhaps four percent on the horizon so that has certainly given some market watches concern\nRight and those who had profits took them\nThat's right that's right and really if we look about this\nFrom a more holistic standpoint turmoil volatility can actually have positive side effects because it really sharpens are focused to see what we have at our portfolios
