{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Open challenge to a deal for Senate if you win in November ... posted a video of me drinking as Sam adams and congratulating do on your own when\nIf you lose you post one of you drinking a ads slum brew and praising sanctuary cities\nSo basically here's this bath and he thinks he's being funny and ... you\nKnow he's calling for a boycott of Sam adams by the way what mayor of an adjoining city to Boston calls for a boycott\nOf a Boston company be a great American company okay only somebody frankly as deranged as stupid as joke heard it on a oh but anyway so he's going on about so if you win all\nThat I'm going to drink some items and you're gonna um do I want to congratulate you on your victory ... bought evil is a bit Warren wins you're going to have a swarm borough with me and then you have to endure sunk for every suit each\nAnd I'm thinking when I get this straight ... this is the ... this is the equivalent of this\nIf you when I drink a beer with you if I when I have to kill myself\nWhy should chef deal indoor sanctuary cities to bring in what more MS Thirteen gang bangers to bring in more illegals stealing jobs taking welfare driving down wages committing crimes committing murders committing rapes\nHey oh you ever heard of a Matthew Denise you ever heard of Kate's family you ever heard of the thousands and thousands of Americans who've been killed by illegals hey oh don't you read the newspaper don't you do something with your life a oh\nI mean I I honestly he was just trying to bully and go after Jeff now Jeff by the way he's such a liar Kurt a tone he well she's on his bats so Geoff Diehl sought back he tweeted back to his credit quote\nIt's a sad day when add joker tone attacks local businesses like at Sam adams or a cat Samuel Adams beer while praising sanctuary cities he undermines our police like when that Senator Warren called them racist front to back\nAnd then um then Kurt atone listen to this issue ... bat\nSanctuary cities are doing great yeah right have you checked Somerville lately genius if you look at your own city\nWhat's sad is that deal won't even take a simple side bet on himself I think it was so smart oh after deciding to stir it up there fiction east spinning is going to run into reality show enough and he knows it\nWell then Jeff deal tweets back saying hold on we had a bad over the gas tax\nAnd if if I lost I was going to wear a hoodie\nThat said the guy you know I support the gas tax increase or whatever and if you lost your going to wear a hoodie type the gas tax well you lost you couldn't get the automatic increases in the gas tax what occurred atone do he never took up the bat\nHe never followed through on the bed he will shift\nSo Geoff Diehl shoots back and says well the last time we had a bet and you lost you didn't honor it you know why Jeff didn't say that but I'm going to say it 'cause he's a sleazy wine corrupt politicians that's what he is he's a lawyer like Elizabeth Warren is a Democrat that's what they do they lie\nSo just like they're going to make another bet after you will on the last bit\nSo he kept trying to go after deal\nAnd I said you know what he's just going after Jeff because he knows that this is backfiring and blowing up on a Elizabeth Warren space\nSo he's trying to make an issue now out of Jeff deal and why won't eat drink a beer with them so the corner man I said enough is enough so I tweeted heard a tone chicken cacciatore oh and I said quote tough guy\nWhy don't you come on my show and debate me\nYou want to make these kinds of childish pure rile pathetic bats in challenges as the mayor of a city why don't you come on my show and debate to me and let's see what\nYou got oh when\nI challenged chicken cacciatore do a debate so an ally you should have seen the way he was backtracking then it's like well who cares about this issue or you want to talk about this issue told a Twitter feed you can see it for yourself\nAnd I'm like you're the one that's talking about it you're the one is making a big deal about this so come on tough guy put your money where your mouth is will you come on my show and debate me man or woman or chicken cacciatore\nNothing nothing\nAnd so finally I sent them a tweet said I get it your chicken what a little gift fun it\nIs it a gift for a Jeff suggests to guess\nWhat do you call it ... it's like yeah okay so it a little gift on it of The Simpsons doing I'm a little chicken I'm a little chicken I'm too chicken I'm to check and I'm too chicken so we use a little chicken\nAnd that's what I mean he's all talk and no action and I got to tell you okay I'm going into Twitter war with Israel\nAnd I can see he doesn't want to come on my show because he knows I Would destroy him I Would destroy sanctuary cities I Would destroy how we run Somerville I Would expose the corruption that's under this guys watch\nAbout his relatives and how he puts them on the payroll and now he's got false disability claims for many of his corrupt cousins I could go on and on with this guy\nSo he knows that so instead he runs instead tough guy now is in such a tough guy\nBecause he can hide behind social media and Twitter and I'm thinking is you're the mayor of a city and you're like a clown\nMaking challenges to people about whether you have the guts to drink a beer with me and why don't you drink a beer with me and so I told them in one of these tweets I sent back to him he says you know why won't just drink uh Sammy with me I'm like number one nobody calls it a Sammy day Sam adams mh what I call street tough guy\nBut nobody calls it a Sammy that's number one number two nobody cares about having a drink with you\nActually I called him a narcissistic liberal fraud I said you are cystic liberal fraud nobody cares about having a drink with you know you want to have the guts to come on and debate sanctuary cities\nYou want to come on and debate while you think Elizabeth Warren is better than Jeff deal you want to come on about why a mayor you know you got all day you always go way too much time on your hands you all\nDay you're going on Twitter I saw this guy does he's on Twitter all day and I'm thinking if you got time\nTo tweet Jeff deal and be a troll and get into a Twitter war with the corner Matt boy oh boy you really really got free time on your hands\nI come into this morning that I come in often Ninety three I'm coming into Somerville I got to go through Somerville to get to Medford huge\nWind took me twenty minutes to get through Somerville this morning you know why because just down our street on the intersection is construction\nAnd that construction crew breeding ways ... weeks if not months there have been there for weeks if not months I have no idea what they're doing but I'm telling you the progress is zero\nAnd I'm thinking instead of you know I don't know making sure the construction crews get their jobs done on time\nHelp service the public make sure you don't have so much traffic congestion in your own city\nI don't know the crime the illegals the welfare the crumbling infrastructure the corruption the mismanagement that the mayor's office may be just maybe you should be worried about construction crews holding up trafficking bothering taxpayers\nFor weeks and weeks if not months because of the absolute corruption under your government under your leadership and instead of you are trolling Geoff Diehl taking pot shots at Jeff deal and then like the little chicken that you are running away from the corner man\nWhen I challenge you to a debate [noise]\nSo no credit phone\nYou're checking chicken cacciatore\nArcane voice of Boston you walk working about one hundred point

that in the Anne Hutchinson trial which I Believe according sixteen thirty eight when the judges couldn't convict or they ban insurance from other people from the state an ancestor mine included\nAnd she plays the curse on the politics of Massachusetts I think this is proof that her curse is in effect Massachusetts deserves a lot better than a fake Indians that senator\nAnd I'm sure you get the monthly call from the alumni office out of Cambridge for donations and maybe your checkbook can speak as loudly as your voice\nI'm broadly calling for reform of charity laws because I think what we

need their individual alumni anymore they're damage they're so big demand for spot this far greater than the number of spot\nThe globalization of demand for ivy leagues lots means that it's very difficult to get into the schools and so and there's tenure and they're not really govern\nAnd so there are a law unto themselves and I think it's time to take a hard look at the ... bridge in Boston and I even an elsewhere why is it that the taxpayers are subsidizing these gigantic hedge funds and private equity funds\nWho have the gall to hire the Indian at a law school\nAnd claim it that's writing social injustice it's ridiculous\nWell at least one of the jury's still out and we'll find out their verdict on November six coming up rather fast and we'll see how she fairs in the

of this publication the stock market heart attack has a real life story\nA couple of years ago one of the bills clients who was a cardiac ICU nurse made a comment to bill about how some of the market graphs looked exactly like an EKG of a\nAlone here Mr Greg [noise] argue sex that is Mr ... Murray Kelly financial senior vice president [noise] cheaper on a Saturday morning what's there not be chipper about who have you been seeing your dogs that might explain your good mood that is one hundred percent the case [laughter]\nThat's kinda what I thought well it's a wonderful day here we're winding down squash season the squash give away season is in full gear right now it's sort of the second phase of the vegetable give it weighs what his first base the first phase would be the greens and apples and the cucumbers and\nBeans and that sort of thing then come late fall crops the winter squash is the potatoes\nAnd those are really fun we're in the middle of those right now it's an important thing to do\nIt is but it's also a fantastic that you enjoy doing it as well will\nI I Do and what I even enjoy more is having six to eight of the neighbors over and we all crowd in my little kitchen around this all about a hundred and twelve year old wood cook stove\nAnd we'll eat and we have these kitchen dinner parties all the time and they're quite wonderful and I really think I shouldn't finished renovating the living room which I'm halfway done because when I'm done\nThen there'll be the living room and the all depart from the kitchen and that would be a sad thing\nBut if you think about it on the other side of the coin you have more row meaning you could have more people over to enjoy it all\nTrue well true then you're putting on a bank way it's not a kitchen parties are that's a little bit different [noise] well Greg I think we're here to talk a little bit about public pensions are we know is\nA good thing but you always have to be cautious with them as well\nWe'll cautious in the sense particularly since I Would say looking at the statistics here most of them are in very big trouble some of them are in a lot of trouble the worst states include nearby Connecticut and New Jersey Massachusetts isn't far behind [noise]\nAnd there's a number of reasons why let's maybe unpack a few reasons why some of these public pension funds are in such trouble\nOne of the big things that we've seen in the past ... they always have abnormally high rates of return expectations so they're basing all of the income on getting like eight to nine percent on any basis in equity bond portfolio since two thousand we see\nAdjusted inflation returns of roughly four to five percent and that's a scary thought so the assumptions that we're going to make ten but we're getting half that\nSo over time the values of the pension fund itself continue to go down based on the distribution [noise] so what is a very scary dot moving forward because this is a huge part of our clients retirees income plans\nWhat you're essentially saying is that the promise to sort of the positive promise of the pension was based on a false pretenses really it was based upon wishful thinking a kind of fuzzy math but it isn't turning it right\nYes that's correct and use the magic we're the problem is I mean politicians can break promises very quickly so they're going to promise you the world but what they actually delivers a lot different so as the politicians continue to state we're going to increase the pensions they don't really tackle the problem of funding for the pensions\nNow I Know once numbers get up so high they almost seem meaningless but to give a little perspective right now which estimated that nationwide we have somewhere between five and a half to seven trillion dollars in on funded pension liabilities\nAnd I don't believe that even includes Social Security we're talking about public pensions\nAnd that is a frightening state your when you think that's about maybe one or two one quarter of the national debt as comparison for a big number [noise] how do you recover from that maybe you can't what you read on that\nIn order to make up the tension unfunded liabilities you either need to take more risk in order to get a better return\nBut if you do that you're risking people's livelihoods [noise]\nSo it's a really tough road to move forward on because we need to take into account the aggressive investments and also take into account the fact that this is people's retirement plans [noise]\nSo it's gonna be a tough road moving forward is it a matter of raising taxes as a matter of dropping the pension payout from what I can see everything's on the table with these people\nGreg we need to take a little break and maybe you can stay with us for another segment absolutely think rapidly great if you'd like to speak with Greg or any one of the Kelly financial team give a call at eight eight eight eight hundred Eighteen eighty one\nOr think about attending want to be a very informative dinner seminars there's one coming up on November first at the new ... in brain surgery right by the home office that's on a Thursday and then on November twenty four which is a Saturday it's the annual holiday branch\nThat's on the twenty fourth of November at the Boston Marathon in Berlin to [noise]\nTo give a call eight eight eight eight hundred one eight eight one Kelly financial they are there for you all the time we'll be right

smallest deflection can send things tumbling off course and very fast\nWhether it's terrorists or terrorism by the time the news reaches the front pages it's just too late to react\nWe still have Robert Mueller out the air on his jihad to frame of President Trump and set the table for impeachment this never seen at all like a legitimate fact finding mission but more like a Soviet style show trial in my view but should that happen should the house of represent\n\n\n\n...\nThe ... ... ... ...\n\nBe\n\nTo be\n... of the time\nThe chef\nPut the\nYeah I did to be the first five years playing

have the opportunity or at least to have the chance if you start a business and it's very successful you could become a millionaire also ... in your field that you might have the opportunity to make the big box dental so but at least you know there's a chance to do that\nWell in that sense of opportunity in the country you did that after you were a player you became a broadcaster an analyst and author you have a consulting company to help other people and other businesses that have nothing to do with sports\nThing with me was that I was always interested in the business world shore I wanted to coach but very few opportunities what a guy gets out of baseball the coach you have to know the general manager or the manager you're maybe a plate with him or come from the same country or the same city\nThat's how it is you know I mean because you feel confident in that particular person you know I look business are you enjoyed broadcasting still do doing some on serious XM\nIt's true I made over the years more money than I ... a player of course been a long time since I've been out but still I had to work for it I still have\nTo work at my age to make ends meet here but that's the way it is that I'm used to it I don't begrudge the players federal\nWay Rico Petra Sally we'll be back in a flash after these quick\nIf you're planning for a time and all all ready in time and I can't

him very much I interviewed him a few times helped him a little bit with his book inside\nAnd he was a true gentleman and I don't think they make them like that anymore they really don't\nLike I said different time it's very competitive the general managers now let me get the blame just as much as managers of things don't go well you see the firing could have happened so far this year in baseball and last year three managers get fired and they were in the playoffs you win and get fired I mean come on\nI think Alex core his job is pretty safe no matter what happens in the world series he's probably right in line for manager of the year I can see it going to anybody else\nYou know what they usually do it that do they give it to a team that really was unexpected they talk about ... when the land of the two managers there because neither team was expected to do as well they both got in the playoffs so they do that a lot but he certainly does deserve\nHe's done a great job it communicates with the players probably as good as any ...\nBefore we go just to let our listeners know where we can find you your book would be a great Christmas present Christmas is coming up so tell

eight hundred one eight eight ...\nSays\nWe're back with Andrew crow Kelly financial chief investment officer and vice president\nAndrew was speaking earlier about the recent hiccups in the market whether there tremors or in fact just a little hiccup but into what kind of companies will do well in this environment when rates will be going up\nWhat we're looking at is the companies that are less leverage\nOr less reliant on the issuance of new debt to either create demand for their stock or borrow to find increased gross or the companies that are going to be able to get through a rising interest rate environment it much easier than the rest would that lead into\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nWell we are talking this beautiful Saturday morning with a gym Freeman Jim is Kelly financial director of client services\nThis is Kelly was actually showing us some video footage of you throwing some apples in the ... you have a great voice so I think there may be a future beyond radio for you we can take this on the road I Know some people John\n... when I was singing all that time yeah oh yeah I was grinding the apples and singing and the side or had not even fermented yet as to the fresh\nI was wondering if that was a John Boudreau original we can take this new version of Americana\nYou never know you never know [laughter] okay now let's get down to some numbers often Jim is the first in the last person clients see when they come in and the past couple of weeks have been a little well topsy turvy so Jim talk down could you please\nAbsolutely I think that the market really as I've been\nDoing my own research has really transitioning from a deflation or a mindset to an inflationary mindset and that's really ... things and if you think about a market volatility isn't that rare and the grand scheme of things that it's almost more the norm but I think that clients may not understand this or see the sun and quite honestly for the last\nYear and a half and particular in the last several years since the great recession\nWe've seen an amazing Bull Run and if you think about it this Bull Run depending upon how you exactly to find it really began in March of two thousand nine\nAnd it's been amongst the if not the longest Bull Run in the market history\nIt's going on a hundred and Fifteen months now and the average post World war two bull market is about sixty three months so I think that we reached that level back in August and I think people are taking a look at the markets and there was a lot of volatility today\nBut there's also a lot of good economic news as well and I think\nIf we look at wages are up job creation is up\nCapital expenditure further up consumer creditors up a lot of really good things happening\nBut last week in particular was sort of a convergence of really bad news all around and we had the hurricane the United nations came out with a report saying that the carbon dioxide levels are so high that we have until two thousand and forty until the world\nComes to an end there's been more and more trade tariffs with China there's concerns about brags that there's concerns about flare ups in Europe and in particular the markets are looking at Italy in particular and markets have a way of looking at things through a prism\nAnd Italy's finances are cause for concern as well so we take all these events combined the market was taking a look at them and taking I think hitting the pause\nButton if you take that week and a half let's say what was the percentage drop\nThe market to recover it a little bit on friday so I think it was down roughly four percent give or take\nYeah so it wasn't even five percent so this is not something that is earth shattering and it's not mutually exclusive of a very sound economy which has all of the other elements fairly well established in in place\nI think among the biggest concerns right now our interest rates and\nNot necessarily the short term rates but the Federal Reserve announced\nAnd the last several days that they've increased the fed funds rate from to point to this year or so to about two point two five with the expectation that next year they'll see more rate increases and I think that that has the market because remember since the great recession\nThe Federal Reserve is essentially floated money for free interest rates have been near zero and that's abnormal\nAnd if we look at the last forty years interest rates have been declining steadily\nOverall and right now the market is looking at any spike in interest rates especially the long term rates the treasury ten year is the benchmark and right now that sort of running around three point two or three percent\nAnd if you speak to some of the industry leaders even Jamie diamond shape Morgan Chase they're looking at perhaps four percent on the horizon so that has certainly given some market watches concern\nRight and those who had profits took them\nThat's right that's right and really if we look about this from a more holistic standpoint turmoil volatility can actually have positive side effects because it really sharpens are focused to see what we have it our portfolios when the market really hit its follow point we actually contacted all of our clients\nWhich was very instructive for them and many of them reached out back to us so it's part of that process that I talk about a lot with you with regard to our practice Eric ... financial\nWhere again we analyze design manage and review and that review process is so critical and I think that that's been something that we've been really vigilant about ourselves whether it's a periodic scheduled review or instances and such volatility like this where we reach out to our clients\nAnd when you do have this review of your portfolio by Kelly financial aid is a top to bottom individual review of your needs no template no cookie cutter\nSo give a call to Kelly financial at eight eight eight eight hundred one eight eight

a hug she did what caused her to hug you tell me I'm doing so well and she's a great teacher always\nWhere he was happy she's proud and she wants to give me like an affectionate hog like a great job and she gives you a little bit of a hawk\nMhm yeah I Know she says if I did this on a public school I Would have lost my job I'd be fired\nOr you know it's crazy 'cause I mean she's not even told us she lasted two years in a public school it's insane and it makes no sense Allegheny I mean they're just asked\nThem if they want a hug and they all them I don't understand why why would you want to\nFreak out because all of them mostly affectionate you know and it's insane how public schools now\nIf you will find someone you can get expel like that to be on his chest I think liberals it is because they can cause it supposedly fun for them\nTo go after the jurors order torture teachers for arguing students now if you don't mind me asking which you how did you feel uncomfortable did it make you feel awkward when she did that\nSo I Would have hoped feel awkward chess I mean\nSo you had no problem with it whatsoever oh no not at all\nI agree with you I mean I remember when I was growing up I went to public school and you know teachers would give us a friendly hog or a high fiber nobody complained the parents didn't complain to students didn't complain I like bit everybody liked it but this is now a new world I mean the moon bounce run everything\nThat's right yeah I notice there's a direct correlation between liberals taking over something going right down to Portland right I'm happy for you my friend that I'm happy that you're a teacher is able to teach at a Catholic school because she's right if this was a public school and she her view she'd be gone\nThat's

a eight hundred a one eight a twang [laughter]\n\nWe mark the one year anniversary of Kelly financial founder bill Kelly's passing recently\nAnd we thought we revisit a chat bill had a couple of years ago which seems to predict these very trying times we are living in today\nBill called his monologue rest [noise] and we bring it to you again on her life like\n\nIf you're an investor right now you might feel I think the one way to some of the people with whom are meeting in one way to sum it up is the rest of the sea if you're if you've ever been on a restless see it's it's not quite white caps it's not quite smooth saw quite rolling but it's a little bit rough\nAnd you sort of waiting for to get worse and you're preparing and you're hoping for the best I think that's what that's what today's market my feeling to you especially if everything you have is now at the mercy of people that might not know what they're doing\nAnd if you feel that that might be happening and you're wondering is there a safe way is there a better way ... ladies and gentlemen there's an old picture of a man outside of a church freezing use right below them\nHe's right below the window and it's a winter night it's snowing in and you could see a beautiful stained glass window and the cathedral and he's huddled there well some people look at that picture him when I ask them what they think it is\nSay oh it's hopelessness and I say it's just it's not hopelessness to me it's the fact that all that man has to do is walk around the front walk around to the front of the church open the door and walk in and start praying first of all he'll be warm second of all there'll be people in there to help him\nActually to SUV him maybe feed him and third he can be on his way to something much different in his life so\nIn in the ultimate despair there's hope\nAnd I think that is important as an investor that use preserve\nWhat you have for the most part to be able to come back on the other day if you choose to do so\nWe remember ladies and gentlemen you don't have to play by their rules you don't have to play by their rules so if you feel like you're in a restless see if it gets much worse you could become sea sick or become injured you're\nHoping for the best interest of Lucy because you want to get to your destination but what might be happening is things could be worsening over the horizon and you can't see over the horizon you know what's happening around you so we prepare for the worst\nAnd right now I think we have to be careful about sustaining losses until this market take shape again and if people are out there saying their goodbyes well I'll tell you what I'll say to them goodbye\nBecause we don't we don't trust anything that's happening right now but anyway it's an underlying feeling that we are ... so we're in a restless sea\nAnd we're rather less so being rather lists means it's hard to get direction you have to control the boat by or Z then you have to push and you have to pull and you have to struggle\nSo in order to do that it's going to take a\nLot more effort effort to get where you want to go there's a lot more danger than having a ... a vessel and if you have a captain who hasn't done this before it's going to get rough and if you've been out on the ocean and you've navigated the boat than you know it it's tricky\nAnd looks very deceptive so very experienced captains of found themselves last ladies and gentlemen because things can get out of hand fast like airplane pilots can they can experience vertigo they can find themselves actually upside down in very dense clouds and they can't figure out where they are and they tried to pull up\nAnd trying to pull up there actually driving the plane right into the ground so that can happen at sea so if you feel like there's a restless see of the markets are uh are on a restless see and if you feel that uh people play you\nIf if Reuters has good news about jobs in other words there are less people filing for unemployment what about the hiring numbers ladies and gentlemen what about the new jobs\nIf they are less people filing for unemployment if we hire five hundred and fifty thousand people into the census than what's ... what's that what does that do the job numbers or takes five hundred and fifty thousand people off of the\nUnemployment rolls or out of the unemployed category but we don't consider the fact that many people many many people have given up looking for work one in five people right now in our country has on government assistance that's a lot\nForty plus percent of our people in America pay no taxes so if you run a but if you're at a bus stop you sitting with ten people on a bus and on the bench of four of them are not paying taxes and the other six or it's getting close to five pretty soon be fifty fifty when it goes over that we're in deep\nDeep trouble so if you're feeling like the investing world is a restless see right now then how do you how do you react you prepare for the worst pray for the best and you make sure you're staying with us at all possible I Wish\n\nDo you need to save money strategy with Joan addressed gold

Mr ... Murray Kelly financial senior vice president chipper on a Saturday morning what's there not be chipper about have you been seeing your dogs that might explain your good mood that is one hundred percent the case [laughter]\nIt's kind of what I thought well it's a wonderful day here we're winding down squash season the squash give away season is in full gear right now it's sort of the second phase of the vegetable giveaways but his first base the first phase would be the greens and the apples and the cucumbers and\nBeans and that sort of thing then come late fall crops the winter squash is the potatoes\nAnd those are really fun we're in the middle of those right now it's an important thing to do\nIt is but it's also a fantastic that you enjoy doing it as well will\nI I Do and what I even enjoy more is having six to eight of the neighbors over and we all crowd in my little kitchen around this old about a hundred and twelve year old would cooking stove\nAnd we all eat and we have these kitchen dinner parties all the time and they're quite wonderful and I really think I shouldn't finished renovating the living room which I'm halfway done because when I'm done\nThen there'll be the living room and they'll all depart from the kitchen and that would be a sad thing\nBut if you think about it on the other side of the coin you have more rural meaning you could have more people over to enjoy it all\nTrue well true then you're putting on a bank ... got a kitchen parties are that's a little bit different well Greg I think we're here to talk a little bit about public pensions are we know\nThere are a good thing but you always have to be cautious with them as well we'll\nCautious in the sense particularly since I Would say looking at the statistics here most of them are in very big trouble some of them are in a lot of trouble the worst states include nearby Connecticut and New Jersey Massachusetts isn't far behind\nAnd there's a number of reasons why let's maybe unpack a few reasons why some of these public pension funds are in such trouble\nOne of the big things that we've seen in the past with pensions as they always have abnormally high rates of return expectations so they're basing all of the income on getting like eight to nine percent on an annual basis in a equity bond portfolio since two thousand we've seen\nAdjusted inflation returns of roughly four to five percent and that's a scary thought\nSo the assumptions are we're going to make ten but we're getting half that so over time the values of the pension fund it sells continue to go down based on the distribution so it is a very scary thought moving forward because this is a huge part of our clients retirees income plans\nWhat you're essentially saying is that the ... sort of the positive promise of the pension was based on a false pretenses really it was based upon wishful thinking a kind of fuzzy math that isn't turning are right\nYes that's correct and use the magic word the problem is I mean politicians can break promises very quickly so they're going to promise you the world but what they actually deliver is a lot different\nSo as the politicians continue to state we're going to increase the pensions they don't really tackle the problem of funding the pensions\nNow I Know once numbers get up so high they almost seem meaningless but to give a little perspective right now it's estimated that nationwide we have somewhere between five and a half to seven trillion dollars in unfunded pension liabilities\nAnd I don't believe that even includes Social Security we're talking about public pensions\nAnd that is a frightening figure when you think that's about may be one third to one quarter of the national debt as comparison for a big number how to recover from that maybe you can't what you read on that\nIn order to make up the pension unfunded liabilities you either need to take more risk in order to get a better return\nBut if you do that you're risking people's livelihood\nSo it's a really tough road to move forward on because we need to take into account the aggressive investments and also take into account the fact that this is people's retirement plans\nSo it's gonna be a tough road moving forward is it a matter of raising taxes as a matter of dropping the pension payout from what I can see everything's on the table with these people\nGreg we need to take a little break and maybe you can stay with us for another segment absolutely think ... great if you'd like to speak with Greg or any one of the Kelly financial team give a call at eight eight eight eight hundred Eighteen eighty one\nOr think about attending wonder if they're very informative dinner seminars there's one coming up on November first at the new ... in brain tree right by the home office bets on a Thursday and then on November twenty fourth which is a Saturday it's the annual holiday branch\nThat's on the twenty fourth of November at the Boston Marathon
