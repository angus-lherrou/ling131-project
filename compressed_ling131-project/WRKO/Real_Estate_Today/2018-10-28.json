{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "More than five years before you entered the nursing home not a loophole for me than not a loophole but if he had set this up long ago was that the other point here I don't know how long ago he had set up day investment accountants it's very possible that if it wasn't within the five years\nThat all of his money is at risk even though he might have thought in his mind somehow half of it maybe wasn't protected when in reality none of it is protected\nNow if you had changed the owner and the beneficiary on the life insurance policy to the child more than five years ago I think he would be okay\nWith that uh it would be protected I don't love that idea but at least it would have been protected so that being said what's gonna happen when we go to apply for Medicaid 'cause she's going in to the nursing home\nAnd you know what what you're probably hearing here folks and realizing is wait a minute there's no benefit to given it to a person you don't short now by your clock\nDo it to your ear evoke about trust Todd's guide for the month of November outlines everything you need to know about these trust how they operate the information that should be in them and then the information those troublesome clauses that absolutely cannot be included in your ... trust if you want it to work when you needed to folks\nCalled fear free copyright now eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that your last chance to do so folks eight six six eight for eight five six and nine nine or download your free copy on our website legal exchange show dot com\nSo okay now we've got\nAn understanding of what he's done we go into the nursing home we apply okay as you are saying Susan from uh I'm going to compare estate recovery versus trust planning mhm right so if this was all put in a trust bank accounts the investment accounts the home you know all in the trust\nWell then you see the ah\n[noise] ah there would be ... there were ... and we're beyond five years there would be no state recovery here right assets would be protected not half mhm all and no state recovery when the individual dies\nBe just die and whatever's left in the trust is there the life insurance on the other hand I could not have probably put that into the euro vocal trust because if I did change the owner and beneficial to the trust\nIf it's still required premium payments than the father could not pay the premiums because then he'd be paying a premium on a policy he doesn't own therefore\nAt five o'clock start every time he makes the policy payment\nBut if he had put assets are bank accounts into the trust then you could pay the premiums would that trust money right\nThen he could as long as there's enough money in the trust to pay those kind of a very good point Susan you could actually do that\nVersus what he did he gave it to the sun changed the owner and the beneficial to the sun I said yes after five years you would have protected downside who's going to pay the premiums when he went to bat the dad still paying those premiums are going to have the same problem with dads or another short cut problem that doesn't actually work\nAt the end of the day mhm so\nYou know at this case I'm thinking the irrevocably trust would have not had any of these issues\nSo now what happens now in his case we're going to apply for Medicaid\nAnd they're going to say the houses non ...\nI like it yes it you've got you know none of the bad things happened by owning it died in a life a state with a child I get it but\nAt least it's protected from the nursing home and you know a state recovery let me explain he even though he owns a life a state interest in the property since it's his home it's deemed non accountable while he is alive and then when he dies\nThe life of state expires like magic it disappears\nAnd any lean that would have been on it also disappears and so it passes outside of probate to the child and he becomes the full owner\nOr in the simple so what that means is\nNo state recovery because at least in Massachusetts you need to check with your state\nBut some states have expanded estate recovery but in Massachusetts a state recovery is limited to assets that are in your own name on the date of death\nThe life a state of voids probate so therefore it doesn't own name means that goes to probe it hey okay so that's a good deal now what about this joint investment account let's say we didn't do it more than five years ago and not even half of it is protected what are we going to do you can't leave it joint thinking that some\nOh that's going to avoid probate because the whole assets accountable you're right or two thousand dollars so thinking you're going to leave it join and get on Medicaid to avoid estate recovery is not going to help you because you won't get on Medicaid you and me apparently\nThat many you name regardless of how the ownership is they have in your name at all that yeah\nIt it's so in this case you're over two thousand dollars so you don't have to worry about estate recovery 'cause you're not going to get on Medicaid right\nSo that's not a good deal same thing with the bank accounts what are we going to do we're going to take the bank accounts and the investment accounts liquidate them and either by an annuity in his name on Medicaid annuity to converted to an income stream allowing him to become eligible for Medicaid or\nPut it all into a pool trust depending on his age and how the numbers play out also avoiding the five year waiting period yes there'll be payback provision on both but at least you'll beyond medicate ...\nAnd when I say payback provision that's really a state recovery right so instead of worrying about it going to probate because it's in a pool of trust\nThat trust itself has the language that says we don't need to worry about probate it's going to say right in the document after you die pay back the state at least the amount of benefits you received from Medicaid\nTakes him and vice so I've always the last minute dance do your planning in advance do it right\nMake sure your trust is drafted properly how do you know what should we shouldn't be in your trust well Todd has written a guide for the month of October it's designing in income on the air evoke about trust and it's your last chance to request

Boston\nNew [noise] Italy or have been one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA ac to Boston I heart radio station [noise]\n[noise]\nABC News on shows his has for synagogue government is expected to have an initial court\nYou know you make a really good point George because there are a lot of challenges for buyers out there there are many homes for sale and prices are on the rise and sore and mortgage interest rates so the buyers who are putting their signature on offers must be really determined to get a house\nYou're absolutely right or based on on the latest um closed sales figures which we released the this past week obviously sales decline and to the point a lot of that was driven by shortage of inventory the head when as you clearly stated\nCome from prices which in September ... up a four point two percent year over here a mortgage rates which now practically at five percent and worth reminding listeners that if if the basis point increase of four point five to five percent mortgage rate doesn't sound like much\nBut it translates to about a hundred and twenty five to a hundred and thirty extra dollars a month to a to a mortgage payments\nWhich for a lot of buyers\nIs a significant increase so we'd all day to find the buyers are still active in the market and indeed put pen\nTo paper you know ... or or or digital and during September indicates that the bars remained a determined to ah to look at at the home buying as a valid housing options\nAbsolutely\nAnd George as you said the biggest challenge of all is the lack of homes for sale but we understand there are signs that there are more homes coming on the market can you tell us about that\nShow looking at a home a permit still building permits and new home construction we've seen an increase in that activity [noise] even though a lot of builders are themselves facing headwinds both in terms of of a labor costs so\nThere are contending with a shortage of labor also materials cost cost the timber cost of a lot of of input into the construction process but we've seen an increase in that during the day here my only concern and going into the the colder months traditionally has been\nWith winter weather construction tends to slow down\nIn the ... the northern half of the country\nInteresting so George as you said earlier the different parts of America were wildly different in the pending home sales report can you tell us about that\nCertainly so while nationally were up half a percentage point that the picture was was quite different so the west a lead the pack would a four point five percent increase and the uh index of of contract signings um\nWhich indicated that this region um despite um high prices\nStill sees a lot of ... interest on a daily basis he was down seven point four percent\nUm however obviously the region is one worth watching because it it's basically the area where we're seeing the highest home prices on where Janet expectations are work on the the the biggest impact from increasing mortgage rates and prices\nThe mid West was also um a showing good results up one point two percent from the prior month in the meantime the northeast lives down zero point four percent of the south\nDown one point four percent from August it's worth remembering that in the south we obviously had Hurricane Florence this here uh which impacted\nCarolinas we also had Hurricane Irma last\nYear um which it shows\nA little bit so they year over year for the south or seeing a three point three percent increase which showed that even with a strong impact of Hurricane Florence there was nothing like that left in the wake of Hurricane Irma so or the south obviously while down a monthly basis still looks much better than a year ago\nI see well George many times you've been on the show this year and we've talked about a decline in pending home sales and even though the increase in this time was just half a percentage point up is up\nYou're absolutely right that and it's worth pointing that out because there's a lot of concern a broadly speaking and and the economy impact on housing or from some of the factors we touched upon in our conversation\nThey including being that a lot of consumers are getting up and the truth is that we have a strong employment we have a wages which even want adjusted for inflation are beginning to take up enough that the fed is concerned about inflation so with this as as a background it it's worth noting that consumers\nStill remain very much interested in purchasing a home which\nBroadly speaking still a means that for the remainder of the year we can expect a healthy market\nExcellent well George I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about the latest pending home sales

thing our annual treat for you\nAs we observe Halloween all throughout today's show we're looking at things that terrify people when it comes to real estate but we're here to tell you that once you understand them those things aren't scary at all and right now here's a really big one but down payment\nThe idea of coming up with twenty percent for a house\nSent some people running for cover but let's take a closer look at that because that down payment might be less than your bank and you might have help getting it\nLet's talk about all of that now with the pro joining us is Rob ... with the organization down payment resource Rob launched a down payment resource to connect eligible home buyers and eligible properties were hard to find a down payment programs Rob welcome to real estate today\nThat gets David it's great to be with you again we are so glad you're here so Rob let's begin with your\nOrganization down payment resource a state by state guide to programs that are out there to help homebuyers come up with the down payment can you tell us about that\nSure is a resource it's a program all across the country over twenty five hundred programs to help people whether it's with down aim at closing cost and other ways to make more affordable\nRob I understand that you have some new research to share with us today about two days potential homebuyers\nThe Urban Institute has released its barriers to homeownership report that found Twenty one million people under the age of forty are ready and able to get a mortgage can you tell us about that new research\nYeah it's very exciting either ... or ... to ... just a great job and were were pleased to say you're in a row and then he teamed up with brave act on this for this study these Twenty one million renters under forty years of age\nOur mortgage ready but what's even more compelling is that about eighty eight percent of those so roughly\nEighteen billion are at all a mortgage rate\nBut they had the income to afford a median price home where they live but Eighteen million people are getting ready and Ken and have the income to buy a home in their area and you know when you think about it that's three times as many homes are sold every year that's a lot of people\nThat is a lot of people and so Rob what does the data say about why they're not going forward with home purchase\nA single word Steven is this perception of the doubt and there's always the most challenging part of\nGetting to ship in this case the data tells a story and that story is that\nBecause of ranchers misperceptions about how much they need for a down payment they actually are making it worse than it is for example this research shows that about sixty five percent of these ... I\nThink that they need at least Fifteen Percent or more down at this report also showed me down payment for first time homebuyer is five percent so right there you can see there's a big gap between what people think and what reality is\nIf you could tell potential homebuyers across the country the truth about down payments what would it be Rob\nDon't give up on homeownership just yet there is help out there\nAnd you might find you think you need to paint or sat down and you can get in for an average by that really a great day long three and a half percent right there you may be ready to buy on even though you thought you were and you can get it to 'em for as little as three percent down\nConventional loans through Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac\nThat is awesome Rob and so the thing that you bring to the table but is so valuable to homebuyers all across the country is that where ever you live in America chances are\nThere's a down payment assistance program right in your area and people don't know about and that's what downpayment resource does he tells people look here and you might find money for your down payment\nIf they're eligible for one program we say that most of those attached wires are eligible for somewhere between six to eight programs and an average down payment benefit of those programs of about ... two hundred dollars\nNinety two hundred dollars money that's just sitting there waiting to go their way but they don't even know about it\nThat's right ... we still have a lot more to talk about would you be able to join us again and the next hour a real estate today yes definitely\nAnother way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nBasin rock and were dating comparison data records racial approval only about thirty three year project transactions call for confirmation conditions equal housing lender licensing office he said and wants timber thirty thirty additional conditions or lose his may apply\nLiberty mutual insurance knows your focusing on the road right now so we'll just describe the advertisement we emailed you\nThere she is the statue of liberty printed on a premium sheet of I last paper the message reads liberty mutual customize your auto insurance so you only pay for what you need you'll think wow this is top notch marketing that makes me want to reconsider my insurance provider\nGo to liberty mutual dot com for a customized coke and you could save energy and covered his underwritten by liberty mutual insurance company affiliate equal housing ...\nNoted author former chief medical correspondent ... user Dr Bob are not\nThe human body has billions of pain receptors block those receptors with the anesthetics found in salon ... plus and you'll have relief\nSalon ... plus ... to anesthetics including the maximum strength light again available that have prescription they numb aggravated nurse for effective lasting relieve relieve try what I use salon ... plus in silver box with blue wave\n\nListen up for one day only a potential life changing event is coming to Boston on November fourteenth ABC's shark tank entrepreneurs Robert hurts your back in ...

Boston\nIs a real estate today [noise] location\nWith our special show scary thing all about how sometimes issues involving\nReal estate can keep you up all night but when you know the fact most of the time it's not so frightening after all talk about something scary back when real estate today first launched we were right in the middle\nBut the economic downturn whether they suffered a foreclosure or they were forced into a short sale for many people the most frightening real estate nightmare of all came true they lost their houses\nMillions of families had to pack up and leave they had to rent or live with relatives and they had to explain to their children that the family had to move\nIt was a heartbreaking time not just for real estate\nBut for all of America\nAs we all know things are better now much better the rate of foreclosure is tiny now compared to bend the economy is stronger more people have jobs good jobs real estate values have rebounded almost everywhere in once again\nWe're finally in a good place but even so I wanted to talk to you if for some reason you are in trouble and still at risk of losing your home\nBecause even though the flood of foreclosures has passed some people still need help they need information and they need to know their options [noise]\nFirst of all if you're having trouble making your mortgage payments talk to your lender right away they might be able to modify your bones so that your payments are lower every month\nOr they might allow forbearance in which they give you permission to skip a few payments while you get back on your feet later on those payments are added at the back end of your loan\nNow the worst thing you can do is nothing\nCalling your lender is really important because they might be able to help if not you can always try another lender but again don't just stay in your house worrying and doing nothing [noise]\nNow if you don't get anywhere with your lender go on line to the federal housing Finance Agency they have two programs you should know about once called harp the housing affordable refinance program that can allow homeowners to refinance even if they owe more than their home is worth\nGo online and check it out now it does have rules for instance you need to be current on your mortgage payments but give it a look and see if it might help you [noise]\nThe other is the principal reduction modification program also at the federal housing Finance Agency now that's new and in some cases of allows your loan them out to be reduced so you own less and your payments will be less also every month\nThe program is actually designed for people who are behind on their mortgages so it's only for those who are in the most desperate circumstances but the fact you this could be just to help you need\nAgain it's the principal reduction modification program you can find it on line at the federal housing Finance Agency\nThey also get in touch with your local and state governments ever since the crash many of them have created helpful programs for people who are having trouble holding on to their homes find out what might be available in your area and whether you might qualify\nYou see keeping people in their homes is really important it keeps neighborhoods strong keeps the kids in school and keeps families on the right track so there's a lot of help available out there\nAgain the housing crisis is now over and done with for most people but that doesn't mean everybody and even if there's one family out there who needs help maybe yours you should know that help is available\nAnd hear it real estate today you can count on us to give you all the information we can every week to help make real estate a good thing and never a scary thing [noise]\nIf you'd like

I was actually on a team and I learned that sometimes a very successful agent\nWill be so busy they have to literally turn away business and so they started chain and also you have a newbie agent who is just getting going and they don't have any business happening and they get on a team\nFrom either side the experienced or the inexperienced it can be a great way to get going\nAnd that makes it a lot of times and it's probably more active for the client that way as well I they're getting the best service from the real estate team as opposed to reaching out to someone who really doesn't have time to take them even though they have a great reputation I in the field and they really want to work without agent\nAbsolutely so let's take a good look at real estate teams across America according to your survey most team members are fully licensed real estate agents right\nThey are and we do you find that most team members hold a license so some may work if they're not licensed perhaps as an assistant or virtual assistant we do see the use of that as well\nYou know that's really important because at one point you know someone has an office manager or something and they're on the team they would not be able to do real estate with the senior members of the team so it's important to be licensed\nAbsolutely that means they can take on all of that ... that are necessary rather than doing one thing\nAnd this was interesting in your survey Jessica virtual assistance tell us about that\nRight so we actually found but as there is a growth and virtual office is the tree no from the profile of real estate firm you've actually seen the use of virtual assistance growing as well so looking at ways where you don't have to have a brick and mortar office\nWhere you can just have one off task or perhaps it's almost like a contractor being able to lean on that\nPerson on a regular basis\nAnd so Jessica if I'm On a real estate team somewhere in the country what do I tend to do most as far as my weekly activities go so\nWe actually do see that most of our agents summer broker's license on the team but we do see that other people in marketing top administrative tasks transaction coordinator so there's a full range of activities that people are doing\nThis is so interesting Jessica and the other thing that I found was fascinating is that even among people who do real estate across the country who are not on a team many of them have thought about it\nAbsolutely is so if they haven't turned one today they've either been on a team in the past or they're thinking about doing so in the future it is a growing wage actually conduct business so it may be something where they can save time where they can be more productive and really grow they're at\nSo Jessica as time passes are more or less real estate professionals getting involved with this team\nWe have seen from other surveys that we've found that this is a growing factor it's not something that we've asked the same way it to the same audience is so uh it's not an apples to apples comparison but it does seem to be a growing wave for people to lean on the team join a team and build their us that way\nThat is so interesting so Jessica was there anything and and they are two thousand Eighteen teams survey that surprised you\nI think it's just you know it's a growing factor and we're going to learn more about it as time goes on but we are seeing that\nPeople are joining them and it does seem to be a very productive way for people to enter the real estate business which we know there's a lot of new trade but also perhaps seasoned veterans can take a step back maybe actually take a vacation and rely on their team members as well\nYou know that's very true again back when I was on a team in real estate I remember I could be on the beach in my team member would call and say hey you just made a sale [laughter]\nI think that maybe everyone's ideal but maybe not practical [laughter]\nWe'll just go again
