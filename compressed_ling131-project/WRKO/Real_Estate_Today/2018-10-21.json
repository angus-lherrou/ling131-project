gotten would have been maybe Fifteen Percent well that's not enough to buy another house now and five or six hundred thousand dollars\nSo they sell the house and then lo and behold unbeknownst to her son decides to say you know what I'm not giving it back to money while she doesn't have to right that's a big problem\nAnd so this is why I don't want you to ever give the house to the children and ask for that permission and so then a little bit longer goes on and she says well you listen I can have this um a aggravated I'm going to file a lawsuit against my children or my goodness oh yeah so she does\nAnd you know what folks before we go any further let this be a lesson to you don't let this be your real life story gets your planning done get it done in advance if you've been wondering

okay so now we've got the lawsuit ... suing [noise]\nYeah the yeah the the one that ... not all three girls cash a check I guess she's suing technically the child who won't get woman he won't give back the money\nUm and so you're right that was a great analysis Susan that you made whereas if it was in the trust not only would you not even just permission to sell your not need to ask for permission to get the money back\nAnd you could change beneficiaries anytime you want your out none of these problems of existence had done the vocal trust okay so she filed the lawsuit\nAnd they're waiting now her argument is that she never really gave away the property and there was really some kind of a constructive trust that was formed I Love it yeah and and so this is\nThe arguments that she makes and the court proceedings go on and she dies\nOr the before the answer so she dies before the answer so that's why the kids the two daughters are in the meeting with me she dies before the answer then the answer comes and guess what she won\nYeah so the money was forced to come out of the escrow account and the judge ordered the return of the money and so now the money did get put back into her account\nBecause it was as if she didn't give it away and so all the other money all the proceeds now is back in her state ...\nSounds like a win because she really didn't obviously she well she was going through the the the the lawsuit you changed your will and made sure she just inherited that yes son so she really didn't want to son to get even one third of the proceeds\nSuccessful you think but\nSo it turns out also that she never went to the nursing home so there was no worry about Medicaid leans from the nursing home except she was on the community mass health for a very very long time to the tune of about two hundred and Twenty one thousand dollars a long time\nSo during her life community mass health had paid and now there's a lean on her state for the two hundred and Twenty one thousand dollars of mass health claims that she fought so hard\nTo have this asset put back in her name because it she died in ... and her name yeah bullshit falling again about the argument why yeah so now with her name yeah I Am so because it's in her name now there's a lean on the property and they're wondering can I\nDo anything now yeah I don't think so\nRight 'cause it's cash you won't even be able to negotiate\nIt's a settlement because it's all their right and they're going to say just take it and this is where as state recovery comes in and takes the money whereas had\nThey left it the way it was with this life estate arrangement at least worst case scenario the sun would have got one third of the proceeds the two daughters would have gotten their one third each\nAt least and that would have been no probate assets so there would have been no as state recovery and so mass health would not have been paid you cannot even make this\nI'm telling you this is one of the top ten\nYou must have been salivating in that way\nTo use this real life story I mean I feel bad for the people that's not to the point and I explained it I'm going to do this just to help

economist at the national association of real chores warrants welcome to real estate today\nAnd Steven thanks for having me on the show\nWe're so glad you're here so Lawrence of late summer early autumn decline in existing home sales what's happening here\nThe mortgage rate in time there was an article that some people are getting squeezed out because of the higher right\nNow some of the buyers will just re set their mind set you may be lowered the price point at which they will enter the market but the initial phase of origin right so that's something or just getting squeezed out a contract polling shows\nA five point one five million unit the latest marked the law was nearly three years\nAnd was it also a year over year declined Lawrence\nOver year declined and the lights and got me started small incremental increases\nBut as inventory and crazy is some wires where are you so now it would be more choices to us or the answer to market in the upcoming nuts but it starts to keep your mind that in September there were some shows down in the region or because of the Senate\nAnd we will have to wait to see how that gets\nAll because generally speaking a natural disaster that is a negative watch watch 'em up this week but down the recovery space people began to buy homes wants to stabilize\nInteresting well Lawrence yes it is a tough market for buyers out there by prices are up four point two percent year over year that's great for homeowners and home sellers\nRecord high in terms of net worth for the country a combination of the stock market I Know the stock market as little wobbly at times but one compares to one year ago it is higher compared to two or three years ago substantially higher so and then you combine that with the middle class well\nWhich is tied to housing so with who says why isn't a great benefit for middle class homeowners but we need to a shirt that homeownership rate not remained just press levels but with infants who are beginning to show up\nOn price grow only ... percent range rather than in the upper single digits against you provide some opportunity for people to enter the market\nAnd the economy is creating jobs and we generally foreign debt as the economy it creates jobs\nEven though on cells may decline initially because of the interest rate increases the buyers will resume back into the market with greater inventory choices\nMarch you mentioned that the hurricanes down south affected home sales but every part of the country was down except the mid west and they were flat so it was a very tough month\nThem it was the most affordable region of the country that will steady wild west region based on a political conditions prices have gone up too high too fast and the west region continues to struggle in terms of buying activity a note the stall modest decline\nBut the Midwest showing civilization is implying that us unless those jobs and affordable condition as the buyers are willing to make that Dick major purchase for home\nI see well Lawrence let me ask you this does it seem to you that with all the challenging headwind that the buyers are facing a today's market some of them might just be waiting for the spring market of two thousand Nineteen\nNow some may be waiting for mortgage rate to retreat back down that will be a false hope in my opinion because mortgage rate is clearly on a wide path probably this time next year maybe five and a half percent mortgage rate average from current\nPoint eight percent and when I look at the past\nHistorical housing cycles when there was a job creation and mortgage rate increase due to job creation or economy improving with a mortgage rate increase because that job creation there were a few months where he sells declined\nBut that virus came back so you may still be soon whether it's springtime the buyers will pursue a as the economy without a doubt is and I just shake\nStrong job creation wages now picking up the number of people filing for unemployment check at historic lows so economic data is very positive we make sure that translates into increase how it's going to demand\nInteresting Warren says you and I have talked throughout the year it seems that it's just been kind of either flat or down for much of two thousand Eighteen so by the time we hit the end of the year what do you think uh down near\nMe hope cells what the down about three percent prices up four to five percent so one can call it you know he said it down and said oh you're\nJust wholesale prices continue to increase\nSomehow the housing market Sloane ... great\nRecession ten years ago that quite a strong recovery the recent past years before being more neutral or not\nStrong look moving up or down that way in twenty eight chain and twenty nine chain I think that to conflict of forces job creation as positive for housing\nA rising rates are not and those two factors may cast sort of each other out so that home so they're not really changed that much but for the buyers will mean more inventory choices\nAnd I want to point out something you just said which is just so true whether the year ends up up or down depends on the kind of real estate you're doing\nSo far as I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about the latest existing home sales reports from any are thank you thank you

R. K. O. the voice of Boston\nIs a real estate today [noise] location\nWe are back again now with our special show retiring wealthy exploring\nYour options as you approach the day you leave the office behind for good\nAs we've discussed on today's show real estate might be able to play a significant role in your retirement and even though that can happen in different ways the goal is this thing and that is to create passive income a revenue stream that you can count on in your retirement\nSo let's wrap up this hour of the show by looking at some of the way he's real estate can help make that happen but before we do remember you should always talk with your financial planner and your account before you make any financial move and that's especially important if you're talking about the retirement strategy\nOf course one way many people generate extra income in their retirement years is to buy a residential property and then rent it out\nThat can be a great strategy but to make it truly lucrative direct would have to be over and above the mortgage the taxes the insurance the maintenance and the condo or age away fees if they're already\nAnd of course you also have to consider potential vacancies\nThere's no guarantee you'll find a renter for the property but in most cases residential real estate is a good investment that could generate a nice additional income stream for your retirement talk to your real chore about the opportunities for getting started investing\nAnother option of course is to invest in real estate investment trust there are a lot less complicated you don't have to worry about qualifying for a mortgage and there's no finding a tenant collecting rent or dealing with vacancies real estate investment trust work just like the stock market\nYou invest in a company that owns lots of real estate\nAnd so in effect you are a real estate investor but you're not a landlord again talk to your accountant in financial planner about which real estate investment trust might produce the types of returns you hope to get in retirement\nAnd there's one more way that real estate can help you generate income and your retirement years and that is seller held financing in this scenario you have an investment property or your primary residence and then when you decided to sell it you hold the mortgage\nIt's perfectly legal and it happens all the time\nThe way it works is you set the term you set the rate and you make it a condition of sale that you hold the note\nSo if someone buys your property instead of getting all the money all at once which by the way is taxable income you just get the down payment and then every month you get a check for the mortgage\nIt can be very lucrative way to structure your finances and you don't have to worry about finding a tenant you don't have to worry about condo fees or H away fees and you don't have to worry about vacancies utilities or taxes\nBecause you've sold the place but you still get the mortgage payments since you are the bank\nSo again there are plenty of ways real estate can help you have a comfortable retirement talk to your real for about any strategies you might be interested in\nThey can help start the process and again talk to your financial planner about which ones might be the best fit for you because real estate is a big part of many people's retirement portfolios and it might be able to help you achieve your goal of retiring wealthy [noise]\nIf you'd like to hear more real estate today's special show retiring wealthy either stay tuned for joining us online at

special show retiring wealthy all about you\nYour real estate and your retirement\nWe're going to continue our conversation\nWith a real chore who holds the seniors real estate specialist designation from an AR who tells us that one of your best real estate investments for retirement\nMight be the house you already live in joining us once again now is Peter Crouch real tour and associate broker with macaroni associates in Alexandria, Virginia Peter also serves as an advisory council member to at home in Alexandria a senior village in Virginia and\nHe was just awarded the national outstanding service award by the seniors real estate specialist counsel at the national association of real tours for all of his community work on behalf of seniors Peter thanks for coming back\nI appreciate the opportunity we are so glad you're here So Peter in our first hour you've touched upon the foreign ways that investing in real estate can help you financially and you're in later years can you expand on that now\nSure first one is appreciation so when you buy an asset barring some major changes wage growth appreciation should continue to increase the value of property so once you've purchased at your fixture cost but now it's going up and values\nAnd so that appreciation is giving you a greater equity in the property in greater household wealth every year values increase in your area\nAbsolutely yeah let's say for some reason they staged flat you still have increasing equity because you're basically kicking your rent and making your mortgage payment so you're tenant is paying off your mortgage and dust increasing your equity\nThat is wonderful you don't have to pay yourself someone else's paying it for you if you rented out\nYes the freeze cash flow it's difficult to make a lot of money on a monthly basis on rental what your first purchase it but over time as ranch go up\nYou start to have a positive cash flow so while your property is appreciation just by the mere fact that ... also getting an increase in rent so that the rental income exceeds your outflow of mortgage\nAll those cuts so you'd have a positive cash flow and how about ...\nFor Peter depreciation the IRS allows you to deep pretty she a rental property as if it were a business which it is and the property essentially wears out\nBut real estate wears out theoretically at a certain patients twenty seven and a half years so you get to depreciated you're building which is basically a paper last that offsets your\nPositive cash flow and sell very often you can structure it that your cash flow is\nTax neutral because it's being offset by depreciation\nThat is fascinating So Peter do you have any clients who are now elderly who started investing years and years ago\nI Do and what they're doing is yes they've run out of that depreciation\nWhich is basically twenty seven and a half years all of a sudden they start having higher tax bill because they don't have anything to help them offset their cash flow that said they've got rent coming in and it's quite often come yet but it's all taxable unless you have some to appreciation\nWhich is a paper last to help offset it so what some folks are doing it saying okay I've run out of depreciation I'm going to start that over by selling my property\nThe tax deferred exchange and purchasing another one iris let you do that without paying capital gains tax\nYou different until the end of the line when you no longer investing\nCorrect so many investors will continue to kind of roll over their games and acquired new depreciation to help offset their rental income\nThat's so interesting but I tell you one more thing yes please\nSo a lot of folks are not aware of the current capital gains tax exemption on their principal resident so there are a lot of folks if they've lived in their home for a long time who's equity has\nGone to the point where it's you know ... well over a quarter million dollars worth of equity that they had in the house because things would appreciate it [noise] but it's a principal residents of subject to certain rules\nThey can sell that house and put that quarter of a million dollars in their pocket free tax\nAnd if they're married it's five hundred\nExactly [noise] so what I'm saying some people doing as well is\nTaking that exclusion by another property and start that excludes all over again start clock up again to try to get to slash five hundred and that's particularly useful for people who are thinking a\nGallon size so why can't sell the big ... fifty five hundred thousand start the clock over the top levels in Kenya Fifteen Years cell that walking ... free forever by condo\nThat is such a great strategy Peter\nSo for example I'm In my early sixties and I sold my single family last year and in addition to locking in that equity I no longer on", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Real Estate Today", "city": "Boston", "day": "21"}
