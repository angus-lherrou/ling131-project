L. C. right maybe not the ... the station property but the rental property why\nBecause if it's a rental property and three siblings own and then somebody gets hurt on that property they are going to sue three people\nOh I didn't even think of that and all of their own personal assets they\nHave families and yeah I Know they remember this isn't the siblings only asked this just just one of them they might have their own home their own IRAs their own four O. one K. is their own investment accounts bank accounts yeah\nThat's a problem ... that's not a problem for the creditors that's a really deep pocket for the older deterrent is three deep pocket three deep pockets so putting it in an El Al see would be my first thought and each of you guys could be a one third shareholder of the yellow sea that way the liability when the lawsuit\nComes for the tennis they will sue the company and not you personally huge difference but\nThe the three of them as shareholders what if they are concerned about protecting from long term care could their individual ...\nBe one of those shareholders so know moving past the El Al see discussions\nLet's say again where would the shares of the yellow sea go the shares of the yellow sea would go into this irrevocably Medicaid trust them from ... if that's\nIf that kind of planning right works for them right yeah I mean if you're self insured and you have enough other assets you know you may not be doing\nA Medicaid irrevocably trust but you certainly would put those shares into a revolt couple family trust yes but let's let's assume you're right let's assume they they want to protect their assets not only from the creditor of the slip and fall tenet\nBut from the nursing home mhm well then there's Medicaid irrevocably trust comes into play and we put the shares in and they put all their other assets in ... into their own respective irrevocably trust so what does this do\nBack for the tenant uncommon idea it's still allows each family took control where their third of the property goes mhm not to the other siblings yeah well that's good it avoids probate also good\nIt's going to help them reduced their probing or their estate tax liability if any also good and most importantly it will get the clock running so that if one of them get sick and go in a nursing home it will protect the assets from the nursing home\nWhy that's so important and you don't think about it as much when you're doing just your family planning mhm vis actually impacts other families because if you don't\nDo it the planning and one sibling goes into the nursing home\nThe other two siblings who are not in the nursing home yet\nThat asset that they own with the one third\nOwnership of the sibling who was in the nursing home is at risk for the nursing home right they're going to now tell you\nSiblings that are are healthy by this out or lose it mhm now there's some sibling exceptions that can work here but in any event you have now jeopardized the other siblings ownership interest in the property and of course you put it at risk for your own\nUh children your own family as to losing it for him so yeah\nLots of issues when you own property like the\nTwo year planning folks don't just roll the dice and not only are you putting your assets at risk and your spouse's assets but you can be putting your siblings at risk as

UCLA HD to Boston and heart radio station [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nAutopsies are underway at a hospital in New York state's capital Albany sixty\nLet's talk about that now with George ... to ... director of housing and commercial research at the national association a real tours George welcome to real estate today\nThank his team and it's a good to be here chatting with you\nWe are so glad you're here so George let's start with why so many foreign investors put their money in American real estate my used that\nExcellent question Steven and to put that in perspective the United states is known worldwide number one obviously is the largest economy but to as an economy in a country which has a very strong private property rights\nAnd but when you combine the two so strong property rights with a growing economy which also means a growing real estate environment you have a very appealing proposition for a lot of foreign buyers for looking for stability number one for their capital and to any return a bonus on top of that\nInteresting so George who are these foreign buyers and what countries do they come from the\nBuyers come in a sense from pretty much all over the world obviously a we have a few particular countries which lead that list and I hear I think of China I think of Canada Mexico India\nAnd a few countries in Europe like yeah I condemn being at the top of that list\nI stayed and are these people looking for vacation homes or do the foreign buyers tend to rent out these houses and generate income\nSo it's a combination of things so we have with detail one no one ever tried to get this information we we're on a survey of members and we try to detail how many of these are folks looking for a vacation you know that's meant or how many of them may be for example temporary residents like diplomats\nForeign students so on and it turns out that basically we're or a little bit split between so\nLooking at twenty Eighteen of those who are non residents so uh it didn't have a ... purchase about fifty a three billion dollars worth of real estate and resident types purchased close to sixty eight billion dollars so\nThe resident maybe edging but just a little bit to the non resident\nYou know George I was so interested in one specific part of your new report on the international real estate and that is that the most transactions by foreign buyers happened in five states can you tell us about that\nThey absolutely tend to be what I Would call sunshine state traditionally so Florida tops that list as a major destination followed by not surprisingly California Texas Arizona\nAnd New York as sort of the top five and then ... the rounding up but you know that some of the other states are Georgia New Jersey Ohio Virginia\nAnd North Carolina so you can tell they're a lot of coastal areas where foreign buyers tend to buy they also tend to be a vacation destination not surprisingly part of our example California and you have an Arizona would markets like Los Angeles San Francisco Miami obviously being at the top of that is\nInteresting but George as we saw in the latest report the shortage of homes for sale and home values which are not joining up has caused a rather significant drop in foreign investment in American realistic\nYou're absolutely right in fact with prices you know looking over the last five years or prices in the U.S\nHave gone up over forty percent\nNow one you couple that with with the exchange rates for various countries that basically has made a lot of us are real estate\nRelatively speaking a lot more expensive during this period which not surprisingly has put the brakes on some of the activity during this last year from now when we surveyed our members\nIn addition to you have an economic as well as regulatory issues for example European economy has rebounded\nSince then the concern of twenty sixteen in addition Asian economies have gained strength still for a lot of foreign buyers there are a lot more attractive destinations for second homes\nAround the world so some of that is also contributing to the declining sales\nA it's very interesting George now if I Am an American homeowner and I'm putting my house on the market\nSelling it to a foreign buyers can be a very attractive proposition because they generally pay all cash and many of them aren't really that worried about the purchase price\nYou're absolutely right in fact the one of the things that stood out in the survey was that for a lot of foreign buyers even when the strong price appreciation of last year's us home prices remain\nA relatively affordable for many of them compared to their\nOwn countries prices so what we see is when they come here they tend to buy also more expensive homes so for example on average foreign buyers paid\nAbout four hundred and fifty four thousand dollars\nPer the typical home when you consider that the average price of all existing homes sold in that state and you know\nTwenty Eighteen was two hundred and Ninety One thousand dollars it tells you that they're all just they're willing to pay a premium they tend to do obviously buying more expensive locales but they also tend to by larger home so\nObviously if you are a seller foreign buyers can certainly be a very attractive proposition\nWonderful well George I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about international real estate with us thank you\nYou're very welcome Stephen always a pleasure talking with you\nYou to George George we're to the director of housing and

difficult designation and they are as it's a five day course\nAnd you cover various topics such as you know international finance different regions and markets different parts of the globe so it's a it's a really kind of course takes five days by the way what separates us is that there's a lot of practical\nThat needs to be done or you can get your designation you know there's some ... ... that's
