then one of you get sick and goes down the hall to the nursing home mhm\nIs that and you want to apply for Medicaid Mm right or you know you've moved them out of that facility to ... facility next door that you can get on to medicate right we're going to last minute plan and even if you've done no advanced planning to save assets for the healthy spouse as I explained yeah\nWhat about that three hundred thousand dollars that's sitting in that continuing care retirement community that initial deposit to get in that's really your money and is it going to cause you a ineligible for Medicaid purposes\nOr the answer would be no really rising way but it's nowhere to ...\nAs long as the community spouses living in that unit\nThat money is not available to come out you can't take that money out of there the facility won't let you know what you well you're living there it only comes out when you leave the first\nOr you leave and you're not coming back right then you could get the amount back less ten percent there's some requirement that they pay for ... and stuff so then that money would be brief freed up so as long as a community spouses living there I Would say it's not accountable asset but\nIf you're single and you leave their yeah you've got to get that back\nThen you know what folks if you're in that kind of a continuing care retirement community and you want to get a copy of this information right on page six of Todd's guide that he has written for the month of August October which is designing ... trust there's information right in their folks\nCall for

trust\n... right now for your free copy of Todd's designing your your evoke about trust guide at eight six six eight for eight\nFive six nine nine that's eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine

looks like it's from the results of a fair hearing just from February twenty teens and it's entitled the right to potential future income what is that about [noise]\nOh yeah this this is a very uh this is a very complicated one to talk about and it it really deals with I like to put you on the spot that it was just it's not that we can explain that it's just that it becomes a very complicated one for for a radio\nOr it deals with a paragraph that talks about you know paying out money to like for a trustee who is serving as trustee oh a on there and and if you're going to continue to serve us trust or if you're a now unable to serve as trustee right\nShould they be able to project forward\nThe ability say well look your life expectancy is ex even though you can serve here's the amount of money that you could have earned\nGoing forward you can't do that okay you can't project forward and their statutory regulations\nThat prevent you from projecting forward you know just say look it's now an impossibility to serve as trustee because you are in the nursing home you created the trust and you're not competent anymore so it's just an impossibility and therefore you can't project forward\nThey try to project backwards but while you were serving they could say what what you have received yeah and this amount would be considered council but so what it turns out to be a small amount of money at the end of the day anyway mhm\nDon't worry so much about the fact that maybe you did serve as trustee so you figure out what the amount is and you you would pay it out in a small\nAnd a lot of clients out there Todd they're concerned that their kids are going to be put out if they're serving as trustee there kids actually can be compensated as because they are serving as trustee correct\nYes absolutely so that's what we normally do we have the kid service trust and they are entitled to get compensation folks don't get jump up and down about this one either\nIt can tell you that most of them don't take it now right why would they take it number one it's just money that's coming out of one pocket going into another pocket they usually don't take it\nAnd real quickly before we stopped Todd for the for the show there's information in here about an issue with having clauses about the right to pay the donor as estate taxes and kind of final cots and here so in Asia that are in\nThe right one right so you\nKnow I I don't want any paragraph in a trust that deals with the ability to pay debts ... of the ... or like there's one that this this one said oh we can pay all the debts of your last illness and ah you know funeral costs and stayed at minister ration costs you know\nThe court came back and said and this particular case well\nDebts of your last illness you're alive that could be a nursing home cost right right and so if a nursing home costs as a debt that we're allowed to use principle to pay that debt than to me I see that clear connection of\nMoney in the trust principal and the trust being used to pay a nursing home 'cause that could be my last illness mhm which is in a nursing home right so we don't want powers in the trust that allow the payment of debts of the ... hour\nPeriod and in our trust we actually as I said earlier we prohibit the trust from lending money\nTo the donor or absolutely not allowed\nAnd you know what folks taught is included sixteen of these problematic clauses that should not be included in your trust\nHow are you supposed to know what should and should not be there refer to tides guy he is our subject matter expert this is a comprehensive guy that shows you what must in what must not be included in that area vocal trust so that when the state starts to scrutinize it\nThey're going to work

City\nGreat to be with you so Joe as you know the fed has already raised interest rates three times in two thousand Eighteen and they might do it again in December so why are they raising interest rates\nThe economy is growing at a pretty good credit by most estimates for all of twenty Eighteen or have the data three percent GDP gross domestic product and that's a good size pick up from what we've seen over the last say post recession years are the last five years\nNow the real balancing act that the Federal Reserve has is that when the economy starts to pick up\nSo to do prices and so with all this talk about it's really great to have a growing economy we know that part of that will be that we'll get some inflation a little inflation is fine the Federal Reserve really wants there to be some price pressures that that's actually good\nFor the economy no inflation is bad\nBut they don't want inflation to get ahead of us and so raising interest rates is one of the tools that they have\nTo make sure that the economy doesn't get too hot create chew much inflation and really cause problems for consumers because obviously if our wages are rising died three percent but inflation's running at four percent we are losing money every year show the feds got to\nReally walk this very fine line they want to make sure that interest rates\nIt's our high enough so that we stave off inflation but not too high to actually choke economic growth so you can see it's a tough decision but we'll probably get another one in December and then next year we might get another two or three rate hikes depending on the pace of economic growth\nOkay Joe but many people believe that if the fed raises rates by say a quarter point and then later another quarter point that mortgage interest rates will automatically go up by the same amount but that's not the case correct\nRight because the interest rate at the Federal Reserve controls is a short term interest rates so that is a rate that intents and purposes is\nNot directly linked to the mortgage market where it's a longer term luck it is linked to say a car loan or um when the fed raises rates which you might see is a business line of credit could rise and cost\nYou could see credit card rates go up those short term rates are linked to Federal Reserve\nDecisions now mortgage rates are usually linked to the ten year treasury and that is not just not moved in lockstep\nWith the short term rates at the Federal Reserve does control I Would say that direction only it usually does\nBut not the exact same rate so if you see that hey the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by a total of let's say one percent for all of twenty Eighteen it may not be that thirty your mortgage rates went up by\nOne percent they probably went up by some fraction of that maybe half a percent\nThe other thing that's really important is one more rates go up it of course does change what a buyer can't afford\nBut I Would be very careful that buyers don't go nuts about this because you may find that the court or or the half a point interest rate increase that you know maybe you have to pay since the last time he went and looked for a house maybe a year ago\nIt may at let's say fifty dollars a month to your mortgage payment may be less than that and of course the larger the mortgage the more it would add but it may not make a difference in your ability to afford the house\nThat is great perspective Jill so finally you've always been one to make sure people don't flip out when they hear news like this so if I'm looking to either ... or refinance my home and I read in the newspaper\nThe fed is raising interest rates no need to panic\nThere beyond don't need to panic the opposite of panic you should be rooting for this because\nThis is raising interest rates because the economy is farming so maybe you could have gotten a cheaper more entry forty years ago\nBut maybe you didn't have as high paying job or maybe you don't have as much confidence that the economy will continue to grow or maybe when you think about refinancing you say oh this stinks I could have refinance and gotten\nThree and three quarters percent and now it's four and a half except that now you have way more equity in your home or except now you are fixing\nA variable rate mortgage which will go up and will cost you more and you're putting into a fixed rate note that makes more sense for you and your family so again\nLike the stock market the headline can seems scarier than the actual impact on you and it's not to say that rising interest rates don't hurt people who own money\nIf course they do but you're buying a home you're making a thirty year purchase and you are making sure that you can afford it based on your circumstances today and maybe you can better afford the mortgage at four and a half\nPercent because you've got more secure job or a better job or a better paying job today then you had five years ago\nSo in that case you're very happy to pay a higher rate\nJew I really appreciate it when you talk us through these somewhat scary scenarios and reassurance that the sky in fact is not falling\nI promise you it's not falling today\n[laughter] diligence thanks for joining us on the show today thank you\nJoe slush and drew the award winning business analyst for CBS News host of the national

the goal of our next guest who plans to own twenty investment properties by the time she's forty years old let's talk about it now with Kristen Smith real tour with Dave Perry Miller real estate in Dallas texas\nChristians are real estate pro and in two thousand sixteen was honored with any are prestigious thirty under thirty award\nShe's deeply involved in the industry and now serves as a director on her local and state real estate boards and she's also a director at the national association of realtors also at any are Christian chairs its largest forum\nThe residential economic issues for Christian welcome to real estate today\nThank you so much for having me back it's an honor to be here\nWe are so glad you're here so Christian first of all how business\nIs a good I Know the markets kinda you know just shifting an evening out everywhere but business is good and you know things are still selling people are still buying\nExcellent so Christian you set out to invest in real estate at a really early age how old were you when you first bought an investment property\nI bought my first and best their property at twenty four years old and I tried my Best Buy and invest their property every year that that I Am thirty one years old and just\nBought my diet so I'm a well ahead of schedule is burning the purchase that but I did sell one so I guess I'm On track\nWell you know a lot of people invest in real estate in some of them do invested a younger age but I'm fascinated by your slogan and your plan twenty five forty what inspired that\nI Am expired by that because my grandparents were both realtors as well as both my parents and every day they wake up and and what they have a sale they have no job we're jobless when I wake up as a self employed or said at the report that we've set up\nFor our retirement because we're preaching that good word short Hi it so we might as well talk talk and walk the walk\nAnd I asked you before about this whole plan and you've said it is a plan you don't just when you really planned this out so now you're ...\nAnd properties what's next\nWell I think that always depends on the market I like I had mentioned just now that I have stalled on my property it's often I Am an atrocity because one or if that's the reason for that is I think that they've reached their max potential for profit and so I Want to maximize profit on there that they take that on truck at that\nRate tested it real estate at a lower price point to allow for the fame appreciation that I was able to get on this project\nThat is such a great plan so you're selling some properties and when you do you can put the entire profit into the next place thanks to the ten thirty one like kind of exchange can you explain that to our listeners\nAbsolutely and I would highly recommend putting your property to church at thirty one exchange it's a great way to defer taxes it will end up paying the taxes at the end but it's a great way to test for them at any time continue to purchase a property\nClause that attracts temporary well actually I think I purchased your new property and a ten thirty one exchange you need to identify your property and a quicker manner but it does allow you to defer taxes which is a great way to build your while to get to that next level especially at a younger age\nAnd the big question Christian and you know the answer to this better than anybody if you want to start investing in real estate a lot of people think oh well that's way beyond me you've got to have really deep pockets to do that true or false\nI Would say falls at first that there's a lot of information at your fingertips I go on I'm not saying that everything is real\nBut what I Would say is don't be afraid to ... to get dirty yourself

show set for life all about creating income and\nOh by getting into real estate when you're young and we're going to wrap up this hour of the show with a quick talk about you your investments and your real estate team\nMatch right your team because if you're starting to invest in properties you don't want to do it alone you'll need seasoned professionals by your side every step of the way to make sure your money your time and all your best interests are protected\nBut start with the hub of the wheel you're real or their the local market experts and they'll know where to look for quality real estate investments don't know how much no cost and how much rent don't pull that that's solid data which you need if you want to create an extra income stream\nYour real trucking also help you prepare a winning offer and negotiate on your behalf\nThey'll also be there to take care of all the details that occur between the time you get ratified contract on your new investment and the time you actually sit down at the settlement table and buy it you are a real jerk and also help you assemble other members of your team who are also very important\nStarting with the lender\nRealtors no lenders in your community they know which ones always deliver the money to the closing table on time\nAnd frankly they know which ones don't\nMany real tours and lenders have worked together for decades and so there's a deep trust there you're real trucking probably recommend three or four lenders for you talk to all of them and find out which one might be the best fit for your investment plans\nYou're real jerk and also help you find a quality home inspector because after all if you buy an investment property and then discover later that you have to pour a ton of money into it well there goes your profit your inspector can give you a good idea of whether you might face big bills down the road\nPlus bill carefully examined the property for safety issues which are critically important for landlords and tenants like\nAlso ask you real tour which insurance agencies in your area or experienced in investment properties you'll need to ensure the place just right making sure that I was the landlord you're protected both in terms of the property itself as well as liability\nAnd finally every real estate investor needs and experienced accountant on their team\nThat's especially important because even though you might be familiar with all the tax implications of owning a home with your own almost all of that changes when it's an investment property\nAll the way from the directions you can claim on the property to the income it generates and even how to trade up from one property to another well differing the taxes on the profit\nThat's really awesome so you can for the entire profit of your current investment into your next one and pay the taxes later maybe decades later and accounting can help walk you through all of that [noise]\nI Know it may sound like a lot but think about this once you assemble your real estate investment team and by your first property\nBut they'll still be there when you buy your second and third and fourth overtime you'll develop quality relationships with every member of that team they'll know you and you'll know them and they'll know what your goals are and how you hope to achieve them\nAnd you can expect that every one of your team members will be a powerful and helpful ally as you build your real estate portfolio and become set for life [noise]\nIf you'd like to hear more of real estate today's special show set

percent of consumers say now is a good time to buy and as we mentioned that's as low as the ban can you tell us about that\nAbsolutely ill when are you looking just at national numbers that is a ... record it but as you said the majority of us households think act now if it got to buy when we look at the different as though I reach and\nWe see that optimism and a whack has been waning and who are in places like the Midwest and the south where it is a little more affordable to purchase on they have higher optimism that now at the time by\nThe ... the that all their household those hill currently own and those who have higher incomes actually have more optimism that while\nI see so Jessica I'm moving to the other side of the transaction another record breaking number because Seventy seven percent of consumers say it's a good time to sell a house and that's the highest number ever\nHad to do if you're currently owners actually have the option if it's actually its highest eighty two first and owners today and now if it got us out they finally have equity in their home they know that they could get a good price Stacey home and our neighbor had going for higher price points and they have in the past that there is a lot of optimism there\nNow could be a good time you enter that housing market as a seller\nI see no Jessica in real life a lot of times people based their opinions on whether to buy on the health of the economy so let's look at that now right now the U.S economy is doing great to consumers opinions about that follow suit\nThey had and it's actually been quite high for the entire twenty Eighteen year and we've actually seen a fix the first time at us how old do you think that the economy is improving now whether that's directly related to their personal pocket book that has yet to be seen it but we do you see that their optimism over all and the U.S economy is quite strong\nSo Jessica among the people who would like to buy a house what are they reporting or their biggest barriers\nSo their biggest barriers are typically saving for that down even but also being able to qualify for the mortgage and do it turns ... today twenty eight percent eight would be very difficult to qualify and thirty one say it would be somewhat difficult to qualify for a mortgage today\nGiven their current financial situation so that is going to be one of the big hurdle getting into a home it's just that qualification\nWell Jessica as we all know it's a pretty tough market out there with not enough homes for sale and rising prices and rising interest rates so it's kind of not surprising that fewer people think it's a great time to buy\nThat's true and just finding out right home is one of those big hurdle so if you watched a a friend or a co worker and go through that on search process and finding just that perfect starter home you may feel discouraged yourself\nFrom ... market because you may have heard about multiple contract and the bidding process and just getting and I say you may say you know I think I'm just going to try to track it and if I can wait us out of it\nSo Jessica did anything surprise you in your latest housing opportunities and market experience survey\nOne of the things that we do in a survey it's we ask a few questions and we switch out on a quarterly basis just to get different take on the housing market and we actually did ask a question about the amount of homes that are available in their\nCommunity twenty three percent are saying that they have more than usual homes on the market right now and maybe some new belt that although maybe some infantry starting to increase but really I think that could be inflict community\nThat would be really good news of inventory crunch started to let up a little bit Jessica what are people across the country saying or their main considerations when they're selecting a neighborhood to buy a home and\nSo I think that's really interesting we've seen in other surveys as well at least on its proximity to have friends and family is very important and it really doesn't matter the age of that housing can humor that is the most important factor\nProclamation job and start commute actually falls after that which is fascinating to me as a researcher and\nHow about the importance of schools I mean will people really pleased that way up on their list of priorities when they're looking for a home\nAbsolutely if you have kids under the age of Eighteen schools are very important to you but of course we've seen birth rate that thirty year lows so perhaps not as important as we used to in the past for some consumers who don't have kids it's not going to be at the top there left\nI see well Jessica I really appreciate you coming on

you thanks bill\nNow with our very special program for life all about taking a big jump by investing in real estate when you're just a few years out of college or maybe you still\nIn college and right now we're going to talk about saving time and money which are both precious commodities especially when you're an investor\nBut this approach involves just getting really simple let's talk about it now with Laura Adams host of the top rated money girl pod cast more is also the author of several books on personal finance including money girls smart moves to grow rich Laura welcome to real estate today\nThank you so much for having me\nWe are so glad you're here more as you know I follow you on Twitter and recently I saw an interview retweet called seven lower for ways simplifying your life can save time and money I'd love to talk to you about that\nFrom acorns dot com that highlights some great ways to simplify it I'm all about like ...\n... and the first is declaring and this is something that I think we have to battle on a ongoing basis you know I'm sort of all that you build a nice statements and getting rid of paper so if you can convert all up your finances\nTo the digital realm and stop getting papers dot filing paper how really helped the clutter your life and it also will help you said a lot of time yeah you can even keep the record that you need for taxes Keith and digital late so that's the very first thing\nYou know that it's just such great advice more uh because uh [laughter] the tools are all there they are that you don't have to have piles and shoe boxes full of receipts anymore\nThat is true I mean going paperless is really is the most accounts in an institution they like that too because they have that money go ahead and requests paperless bills and make the switch over I Know it can be intimidating but if you do it slowly and just sort of start converting everything over to digital\nYou'll feel great and I also believe that automation is the key to a couple of vacation so if you can automate you're saving maybe you're working out for a home campaign that claim that on auto pilot maybe just moving money from your checking account on a regular basis to a savings account\nI mean that sort of working in the background of your life you don't have to think about it that the trick\nI've heard you say that many many times more than if you make it automatic you'd never see the money you're not tempted by the money and your savings will grow\nThat's so true and you know we have to trick ourselves we have to really sort of\nSet up barriers that prevent us from sabotaging our financial success the automation is one of those ways and also looking at your dad you know the ... talks about consolidating or refinancing student debt that this may be something that you should take a look at depending on what type of debt you had it can also\nWorked for credit card debt just trying to simplify\nThat you know taking five loans and and consolidating them down to one low rate loan means that you just have one paint that that makes your life a lot easier it also saves you money on interest\nExcellent and then re think your housing situation that's interesting\nYeah you know housing is probably the largest\nExpense that we have from most of us are house\nOr even at the end of the mortgage payment other rent payment is really our biggest one so if we can look at downsize thing that is one way to save more money so maybe you have to take a step backwards in order to save up and and get that home that you really want are making a new that you want\nAnd you know it may be that you're looking for\nIt's a different city maybe you want to relocate into a place that is more expensive so if you can down sides now and save up when you make that big news you'll have more money in the bank to do it\nThat is wonderful and more the next one if you actually sit down and count up all your memberships and your subscriptions and your services that you pay for every month you might be amazed at how much money is going out every month\nIt's so true we're all paying for the thing that we really don't need a we're not using the gym memberships magazine subscriptions when you're not reading them they're all kinds of things that are smart and he said they're moving over to subscription models because they know we tend to forget\nThat we're paying for these services or even what we're not using them to\nReevaluate what you're paying for cut back on the things that you're not using\nWonderful and the last one on the list plan your meals\nYeah this may sound kind of basic but we really can tend to overpay for not only food dining out when we just don't have a plan for our meals and so I'm a big believer in\nThinking about it on a weekly basis making sure that you've got enough to make multiple meal so it will save time if you make a lot at once and then maybe put it in the freezer and make lunches ahead of time anything that you can prepare ahead of time is probably going to have you money and definitely going to take your time so it just went one way to\nSimplify your life so that you can focus on the big things big wins in your life\nGreat advice Lauren you know following you on Twitter is a great experience because sometimes you are presenting articles that you have written but if you see something interesting that has to do with personal finance you pulled out right into so if one of our listeners would like to join in its", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Real Estate Today",
