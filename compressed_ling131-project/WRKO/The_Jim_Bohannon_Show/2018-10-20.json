George Soros or their money is behind this a try and encourage it but\nI think a number of people say wait a minute we we want to have it we want to immigrate hey but you you don't get to walk over here and walk across a hearing thousands and just walk in and we have to take you\nWell you know the the the real point here is that there's a difference between the legal immigration and illegal immigration and so when when you say that you like a robust immigration system I'll say I agree with that but I Would like to think that we're not going to tolerate one ounce\nOf ... within ten of illegal immigration\nThen obviously some happens but you do all you can to stop it in its tracks as a nation and reform the system to allow for a legitimate form of illegal immigration of lush sees me illegal immigration would you agree with that\nRight right and and what this looks like ... and ... you have a certain sympathy for people who are fleeing violence\nThis looks like a mob feel entitled to be able to come here and get and get a legal legal entry and maybe even finish it ship and I think you'll find a lotta people pushing back at that notion\nWell when you know look we can take that to an extreme a ... there's violence uh in in the in the Arab and Islamic countries are there are Christians are there are a moslems for that matter a there are Jews there are there are people who are being a violently attacked\nBy John honest and Islamic fundamentalists does that mean we should just bring all those people here um that does that mean for example that people in Africa or in South Africa where the forms of white people are being taken away\nFrom white farmers given the black farmers or should we have all those white farmers who lose their farms come over here I mean you could you could ... I can show you three billion people on this planet who would like to come over here because they're facing violence of one form or another\nAt least three big and I suspect no my my only point was we've had refugee uh laws and other things which allow certain people going under certain persecution and so forth\nUh to to come here and I think Americans typically support that what I think they aren't going forward is the notion that a group of thousands of people can cross can come with thousand miles and say you have to take a\nA ... and if you don't we're got to Russia borders\nAnd that's why if if Trump asked to pull out the military to put on the border I Would I Would support that\nWhile I was a fair enough and I would too and I I'm Glad he brought it up because it's it's the borders you don't have a country um and and that if you come into this country looked as another element of this when you have this sort of thing happening or the people have a couple of months ago when the pictures showed people climbing the fence trying to get across we don't know who they are\nAre we already have a lot of them is Thirteen people in this country now they have brutalized and raped the mutilated young ladies on Long Island particularly where they have settled in\nA there's the ... cartels has a big prisons in Charlotte North Carolina we're talking about a catastrophic\nUh situation ever great proportion if we don't take control of the border if we continue what we're going to become a just a cesspool of crime no different than the uh the uh ... the city of across from um El Paso a suit on whereas\nI mean then that's that's just not even run by the government anymore\n... enclaves in this country where we won't be able to control it because we won't have the system and in the middle of this that the Democrats are saying get rid of ice what do you make of that\nIt it's a ... it's an interesting campaign\nA ... you have to wonder if they want to do that if if the script struck coming across in math but if the Democrats have been very open this because they like these are likely democratic voters if they can get him in the country\nUm and so a Democrat or looking for ways to boost their numbers but uh\nI I think the public's going to be upset over it is kind of demand that somebody has to come into the country um because they want\nNow I'm going to ask you a question that is not about your own political opinion because the organization doesn't get involved in that\nBut the ... the question I have\nIs based on your observation as an analyst you'd take the cabinet case you take the pictures we're seeing now and I and I would say even a couple of months ago and the people tried to climbed the fence and those other pictures I'm Wondering what impact if any of those two factors have on this election\nBut I feel pretty sure that they Kevin okay says has energized Republicans and created for their own what I call woke moment where people were looking at a at what was happening Kavanaugh said this is not right we cannot let these people get control over the country\nSo I think your face a lot more energy coming from a Republican and even independent voters and might have been the case otherwise\nAnd one of the house and the Senate may have I'm a strong increase\nAmong Republicans and and the very point that the the country has been made about the re asserting the authority to be the American people can help with center ether as sort of authority but giving Republicans sixty votes to blow away the filibuster problem and it goes away at that point\nGeneral thinking right now that the Senate could take two three four new a Republican seat so\nUh that would be a plus there for various reasons the house has got a bigger challenge\nBut you know when you look at the gate across the country there is a member of a place where Republicans are doing well they've got their got hit wins but they're doing fairly well a lot of places and it just might turn out that the Republicans Cape May not be a huge number but it wouldn't it wouldn't surprise me if they did\nWell I think I think I'm I'm just going to say that the Senate has a shot at getting the sixty votes because you've got\nA Heidi Heitkamp in deep trouble she's gone a customer in Montana as now even he was ahead he may be well gone with the president having gone there hello in Nevada is even a he's moving up in that case Blackburn is moving up as a ... point lead she was fired for actually\nDown on the last poll but she had been up for two or three or four points\nI think this is going to change that when they see the pictures of the immigration problem was my point so um I\nWell the public I think it's gonna be hard to defend that I think\nI'm excel in Arizona is going to win 'em and now that the the other one um I had the nerve to say in two thousand three that anybody wants to the Taliban it's okay\nYou know after nine eleven I mean I live in Missouri so he yeah she ...\nAnd that well she was exposed now to some video where she said she takes public positions to get elected but she agrees with Obama face so I think they have a shot but not a big I'd say twenty five percent shots at sixty votes soccer Matthew ... it's a pleasure thank you for spending a front part of your friday night with us we appreciate your time you\nHave a good

white Knight in shining armor you know the Lone Ranger sort of but\nThat isn't the case in fact it wasn't the case based on your book and your experience even before\nThe situation with Donald Trump ... am I correct about that exactly\nYes the book came out in twenty four team\nSo that we he well he wasn't even a Kennedy by that point exactly\nDid not write this to help the president on a road to spur criminal justice reform from a to Z because I realized in the process we need a lot of it\nWell now let's go through some of this I'm a woman let's start with ... the main point here the Mueller investigation um I I find that stunning\n... goes after Paul Manafort to try to get him to turn on the president and get some on crimes that are ten or twelve years before Donald Trump even decided to run for president so they're totally irrelevant crimes to Donald Trump\n'em they never went after Carter Page they got for Feisal warrants on Carter Page renewed three times at three months each\nAnd they've never even brought him under a microscope or or trying to intimidate him into getting even of perjury charge which was the FBI is familiar to do\nA nothing after a year of investigation and

it was really to help Trump leaving pay says you know at least a page told the truth\nAbout yeah we were intending to undermine Trump obviously um he could smell Trump supporters of Wal Mart or you know we know all of that I don't want to believe or the point about that except that it shows\nA virulent toxic bias right isn't isn't that of a criminal lack much less a violation of the rules that you're supposed to follow at the FBI\nYes I mean frankly I think that age and stroke and and those folks were up in a criminal conspiracy to undermine\nThe president I think they're wire fraud violations probably I mean obviously I haven't seen the evidence because everything is secret but just from what we know publicly\nThere are any number of crimes that could be charged against them and I imagine there are going to be at least ... statement prosecutions coming out of it because I'm stroke has already been fired\nI'm pretty sure he lied to different bodies Congress and federal agents and the inspector general course McCabe the former deputy director and acting director of the FBI is under a criminal investigation supposedly there's a grand jury working out that I don't know one heck he hadn't been indicted yet because the\nInspector general the the three counts of false statements in perjury against McCabe just in the report he did\nIt was a disappointing to you that Jeff Sessions hasn't moved as seemingly more quickly on these matters because that's not Russia collusion that's that's and undermining of the department of justice and the FBI\nExactly yes uh I and a lot of people in this country are extremely frustrated and annoyed that nothing has been done we feel like there's a double standard and the rule of law only applies to certain people and it doesn't apply

R. T. oh boy so Boston now [noise]\nSidney power of the farm and the justice for ten years prosecuting cases because doing appeals and we're going to have or whether I'm was also here we are\nA lot of stories lately the Kavanaugh story the immigration situation at the border with thousands of people marching ah and the news has been a slum mix with 'em\nAll of these stories we've heard little or nothing about the Mueller investigation lately is that because it's being a suppressed by other stories are because there's nothing to report what do you think\nI think it's multiple things right now I'm a first of all a department of justice kind of generally has a policy of not doing things\nClose to an election and of course that didn't a plot to Senator Ted Stevens they rushed to do that to make sure it was done before the election but aside from that of course he was a Republican I'm\nNow it's not the Muller is is\nYou know respecting that general principle but I also think that the witch hunts over because he hasn't found anything in fact I've got a piece in the Daily Caller saying\nMuller ... gets up not because he hadn't planned to drag this out as long as they could but because he couldn't couldn't walk the crime against Mr Trump or any member of his family and the ... up\nDo we know of anything going on right now are they doing any tangible substance to work and talking to witnesses or suspects are informants whatever go when we hear nothing about any of that\nWell Michael Cohen ... courses cooperating you know they put the pressure on him and ran the search on his house in his office\nAnd and then you know he finally caved in this cooperating because he was looking at the major Tom from southern district of New York which is literally just an arm of mall or in fact I think more used to work there to were a lot of his staff did\nAnd said there's a big connection there and then of course we haven't heard of people that have Giuliani which I found very interesting that to me\nSort of tell me that any notion of\nMr Trump sitting down with Bob Mueller is is now completely off the table and I think that's because the White House is saying a lot of the documents that have not been disclosed to the public and in the article in the Daily Caller also explain that you know just\nThe the which on the ending is not enough the public needs to see those documents they need to see some light that we know exactly what had happened\nWe need to know exactly who was responsible for it and those people need to be out in in every sense of the word publicly and out of office and inappropriate legal action taken against them because if they don't\nThey just won't be any respect for the rule of law and the in the country I mean we can't trust the F beyond that the OJ until it is all cleaned out and if that means going in there with or rocks and fire hoses that's what needs to be done\nWhile you as you know congressman pneumonia is congressman meadows congressman Corker all fears of committees\nAre have wanted the the information from the Justice Department um the warrants for example\nStalled at every turn they up beyond that the OJ have stalled and they've done over stuff was redacted than they have to fight to get it on redacted and when it's done redacted is\nThe only information that makes it worse for deejay and the FBI no national security interest at all in fact John Ratcliffe congressman reckless on ... on the other day thing you know he said the documents and and the only\nThe thing they're hiding or things that are bad for them\nWhy would I agree with that um what do we have enough right now it was ... let's say if you were going to bring a case I mean the hypothetical obviously that the department of justice and the FBI\nBeen ... spirit tours in supporting or the or the protecting Hillary Clinton and going after Donald Trump to undermine his campaign and then after the election to undermine his presidency or do we have a ... hour do we have beyond a reasonable doubt now that this took place I think we do\nI think between what we've seen on redacted in the page struck text messages but we've seen it applies to applications\nThere's also a decision by the by the court judge Rosemary Collyer who's the chief judge of the court that came out uh probably about Eighteen months ago it heavily redacted\nBut even in the parts that are not redacted you can see that companies the FBI gave unlimited access to raw NSA slash by intel\nTo three private contractors and the court excoriated the FBI for doing that and even mentioned in a footnote that ... the FBI lawyers were involved in it so that would have been James Baker and it's already been fired or resigned\nAnd she just you know she's obviously clearly unhappy with the FBI I'm just describes the fight the abuses and we're waiting for the reporter the inspector general from the department of justice on all the ... the abuses to\nExpect that report to be even more stunning than the one was on the Clinton email investigation\nWhich of course was actually in a text and the taxes that were cited a scathing indictment of the FBI and uh the deejay for protecting Hillary\nHow in the world the issue a warrant based on um a ... that came from one can be opposing candidate in this case\nWill mean that the FBI didn't exactly tell the court that that that\nDidn't they put it in a footnote we hear that they put it in a footnote\nNo they were not that specific in the foot note um it was it was very ... they did not say that the DNC and Hillary Clinton had paid for that [laughter] the gay\nUm I don't remember the exact language but it was not specific enough to be full some what the court and it's not a statement I Would have ever put in something like that I mean to me it was the live by a mission and I think any reasonable judge would feel that way too\nSo that court must feel like it was ... at this point all foreigners\nYeah if I were any one of those four judges that'd be live at but at the same time you know and and wants to see a lot more than the fights applications when they were initially unwritten pact that I don't know
