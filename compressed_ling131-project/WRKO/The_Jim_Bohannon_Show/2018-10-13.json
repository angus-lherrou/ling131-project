{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Now had it been legal in my in my and it was within my capabilities what I've had that discussion with her about providing some type of medicine that would help her to be able to enter life believe it or not I would say no why because she was demanded she wouldn't didn't have that capacity to do so\nIf she was not demented than I absolutely would offer it had that discussion whether it be pancreatic cancer currently especially in the stage that she was diagnosed as not curable it's very painful and it's a very short life expectancy so why wouldn't they be able to offer that option now when you mentioned about the legality of suicide\nAgain personally I don't disagree but that's not where my pervious come in if someone's talking about suicide\nAnd I think we have to have more funding for mental health to help figure out why that's the case 'cause he does you mentioned earlier so and may want to have some type of tomorrow maybe a different day and that changes things suicide for other forms of other reasons not from a terminal illness is now with this would be getting at\nBut what what what does your resolution say anything about the procedure by which these the the physician's assistants and all cause physician assisted suicide because to me that's what it is I Know you're calling it something else ... um is is that\nUh in your recommendation the specifics of it I mean one of the elements of this is going to be look one doctor could look at somebody and say you know their wacko\nAnd I don't want to like you just said and I'm with all due respect to the one that I'm sure she was had dimension couldn't make an intelligent decisions about another physician a could pick a person look we have not guilty by reason of insanity a temporary insanity\nAnd somebody could make the case for that moment I blacked out and I committed the murder a in a condition of being blacked out and not even remembering what I did\n... um uh so uh and then the next day they can be perfectly normal\nAnd say to him to answer your question though we might ... this is this resolution and in New York state we don't have that any specifics because that'd be something that we would actually work with a legislator to to develop this if so\nDesired but we wanted it more have a position of our academy so they gave us that liberty to be able to have those discussions with our legislators so they gave us the leeway to to speak with folks with the backing of the academy\nSo and again our position is engaged neutrality meaning that if someone asked the question we don't just stays silent as we don't have a position but that we do know that position saying that we think it should be available but it shouldn't be a requirement and it shouldn't it would change would be something that is\nAn individual decision with the with each individual patient physician now that's the New York state resolution the one that went to the national organization just states that they're going to happen this rally as well but they're not going to interfere with the state dishes in one way or the other\nWhere's where's the aim may have their pace position post so they would actively oppose it we will not\nYou know the so the I mean would oppose physician assisted suicide correct\nCorrect and that's what they currently caught\nAnd then your group would say we want to be neutral on that and I'm only saying to you that if somebody who is is despondent and I'm In a condition where they want to commit suicide one doctor it's a very it's still subjective and that's why and that's why there has to be a very objective clinical\nPanel I think in Washington Oregon there were panels of doctors the review this to approve it and I and I\nI agree there definitely has to be a lot of regulations around to make sure it's not used in a in a way that you in that example you outlined a minute ago it shouldn't be have very specific parameters and how it went and how it could be used absolutely without question\nAll right so and if that's the case\nUm I you know I I I think you're and by the way up the religious groups because I'm a huge political influence when when in in New York and I'm a native of New York I'm I was on the air in New York at the time Mario Cuomo was governor and he refused to sign a bill for capital punishment and he said\nI suppose to his credit he was very honest about it or his Catholic upbringing will not allow him to sign a bill authorizing capital punishment in that case it was for people were killed police officers I think it's passed since then\nUm but he wouldn't sign it and ... and it was the Catholic Church influence on him and obviously the Catholic Church in New York has huge influence on the legislature as well so that even though I you're right we have a separation of church and state but would you agree that religious institutions have huge political influence on issues such as this\nAbsolutely but whether whether they they absolutely do but it ... should they not necessarily that human individual decision and that should play in the role that the patient has with their own and their own wrestling and whether that this is something that's something they want to pursue but you're right it does yes however should it now asking that question\nI I don't know I mean here's the way I Want to answer it any group\nHas every right to petition with redress some grievance to its elected officials ah I'm not trying to cop out an answer but I I I think they have the same right to oppose as you have to support your group supports the Catholic Church opposes each group has the right to do that\nI happen to agree with the with the freedom of the individual to make the decision but I don't want to but but see I don't want to put a physician I mean I look a physician's could look at somebody and said I Need to do this for them\nAnd um and if it becomes the physicians discretion then you get into a situation where if the family members say that that person really wasn't oh it would they were working on getting alternative treatments they were going to go to Mexico where they were going to go to Europe or whatever the case may be\nAll of a sudden now that physicians facing lawsuits from the family of the person they helped to commit suicide what happens then\nWhatever happened to the right or the patient decide and and I mean the family if the if it must have family out of power attorney or they know they're at and it's not their choice\nWell I mean a a spouse could say the last ... I'm stretching it a little about it or a spouse could say loss of consortium\n... you know and then the doctor shouldn't have done this or these these happen all the time I'm not defending the right but if you're if you're going to do this that's why I'm saying the best way to do it is for every one of the fifty safe to say a person is has the legal right to commit suicide we're not going to make it illegal\nAnd then the second step would be whether they get physician's assistants look there can be passive euthanasia two numbers the physician can give you a there's something to take that will quietly enjoy your life or or the ... for the physician can do it themselves active euthanasia was I mean there's two ways to do that to correct\nYou there is this is specifically on the passive as you mentioned that given the option of how to end their life with a specific medication I mean it is right now patients who are terminal how they have the choice to refuse food and beverage was put in during the day they don't have to take anything they'll die within two or three days\nRight because of the fact they're not to and that's their choice so why not make it a choice it's easier for them is that the pond to swallow [laughter] you know make it\nSo they don't have to put themselves that extra pain and suffering I'm not eating and not drawn at\nNight I there's no question about as good and then went to a woman should have\nBeen around since the dawn of time and and we're just trying to make it a more humane way of doing this for men and maintain their dignity [laughter] [noise] so that this is part again I Know we talked about\nIs what I got I got a close up the show but are there will be ongoing debate forever socks are off for a long time Dr price thank you for being with us if you had a great the conversation to appreciate it thank you\nBags under the eyes crow speed fine lines in wrinkles are things adults complained about it as they age now there's instantly age was ... works in minutes and it's great for men and women\nHave probably know that in the ... year that my I gained a lot of fine lines wrinkles make healthy have gotten cheaper well something for five years but I think let my bank ten years ago\nReally come a long long time [laughter] he just on your finger and go I just wanted more down here because I can still see when we go back in the U.S now I ...

L.\nVoice of Boston\nYou working about one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA HD to Boston and my heart radio station [noise]\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News on the resume welcome was cheers in a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio\nOf course they drink out of favor one\nExactly so they put this in place and really and that was it really just the transfer of wealth so to speak and I don't mean well from the billions I just mean wealth or funds going from let's say probably the the big focus in passing Obamacare was the premise that young people\nWould be required to pay premiums for health insurance\nAnd because they need health care for less than people as they age that the premiums they pay can be used by the insurance companies to take care of the cost for for taking care of the poor under medicate wasn't that part of the premise of Obamacare\nI I think it was a part of it I think it was a healthy place\nThe second that will pay for the for the wealthy pay for the poor and you're still with the younger people are healthier so they're not going to use the care and your people are going to use care\nBut you know when they passed a law that they made it so that the the the young people had to pay more for insurance and you know prayed Obamacare OK because there's a long time you know a a twenty five twenty six twenty seven year old\nWho get a catastrophic plan for like a book and that was a tougher sell out there because eighty dollars a month and a lot of money for a young person so so now that plan is three twenty five\nSo if they didn't buy it eighty dollars are not going to buy it at three twenty five\nYeah no that that makes him in a sense\nUm and and the idea of what I'm really trying to get to is that it was social engineering of people's lives it was taking money out of the pockets of those who could pay\nAnd putting it in effect into the pockets of those who couldn't pay in order to get to those who couldn't pay the health insurance that they need because we have a lot of people who did not have coverage isn't that what really there's in theory was so\nI so what's your forcing people to buy insurance which ... against Justice Roberts decided\nThat it was a tax and not a penalty and therefore he went along with it which to me was bully us he was just trying to find a way for the for the court not to take it away he figured I think that we've done at the ballot box if somebody wanted to get rid of Obamacare they vote for people who opposed it\nAnd that would be that but um but the the fact is better than it really look let's get to the bottom line when Clinton in Nineteen Ninety three trying to try to do the same thing\nI'm going around the country wanting a health care with single payer or this is not about the health care this is about control of about Fifteen to Eighteen percent of our economy and the medical field which is about Fifteen to Eighteen percent\nOr by the government isn't that really what it's about power and control over a vast amount of money\nYes every day but you look at most socialist ... countries that are out there they got health care first that left everything else into people's health control everything kind of called her life\nAnd that's kind of work starts and that's where that's where the hell are you the health care thing where that for Obamacare was trying to go and still try to go I think\nOh there's no question about it and uh I guess when my point would be is that um the the free market place can be made to work\nIn order for people to be able to get what they need for example um instead of having Medicaid where a lot of doctors don't even treat patients thunder medicate they can't afford to because they lose money on the amount they get\nA versus the amount of overhead costs them to even treat the patient so isn't it true there are a lot of doctors won't treat people under medicate\nYeah yeah the la Dodgers won't wash that barricade now there's a lot of doctors up there are accepting Obamacare\nThere was All right John thanks very similar crisis so we went to a single payer type system guess what there is no doctor the courier\nAnd then there's thirty two trillion dollars of cost of the American people according to the\nThe worst of a bunch of an office but ah which is a and I'm thinking of all amount of money on top of what we already oh but right now ... what about the idea of getting rid of 'em are Medicaid altogether as a\nProcess and just say that the federal government will issue vouchers to people who qualify under Medicaid\nAnd they get the voucher which they can give to any one to any insurance companies that are certified as legitimate health policy offering companies\nAnd you're given the voucher to that company and then the government pays you premium\nWhen there's no overhead there's no bureaucracy wouldn't it be a lot cheaper and we'll be able to dig into the to the poor people have health insurance like everybody else\nOh for sure you know and and the other thing that that that Obamacare they expanded Medicaid out a lot of stuff you know that I mean I I think you know you got to help people need but we do with with with the with the Medicaid expansion\nYou were able able bodied working Americans del Medicaid as well which is you know the system is already under funded and so now you've got people that that could\nCould qualify or or parts of the regular health insurance or working\nIn Medicaid to Pearl getting he got down to write carrier\nYeah and that's the best because they've expanded the definition of Medicaid and you actually is I think a hundred and twenty five or a hundred and fifty percent [noise] ah over the poverty level can qualify for Medicaid that's been part of the problem will come right back and

who are trying to bring the conversation back to normal issues which is not very many of them but some of them\nAnd or what they're trying to do\nIs to talk about health care somehow that we have a problem or the Republicans never repealed Obamacare are all they got done was repealing the individual mandate so it's that's how they are out there in limbo\nAnd we've never really confronted dealt with any options are changes in that regard\nI guess what I'm saying is that the Congress of the United states has indicated his responsibility to the American people\nAnd people are concerned about how they get their health care and I'm of course obviously healthcare is different than health insurance but the question is if you don't have proper insurance are proper policies in place how do you wind up\nGetting the health care\nBecause if you don't have the funds you don't get the care in many cases unless you're perhaps an illegal alien who goes to the emergency room and then they have to treat you anyway\nI'm Eric Wilson and Wilson associates says here Mr Wilson let me get into the point you made earlier and amplify it\nThe one of the problems there were many but one problem with Obamacare was the fact that and and the by the way another problem we did mention if you have over fifty employees you would have to buy insurance for people if they worked over thirty hours a week under Obamacare and of course what happened was\nA restaurant chains and uh uh businesses such as that food fast food places what people were twenty eight twenty nine hours a week so they wouldn't have to buy health insurance so and it did it change the way they had the function as well but it is isn't it also correct and you saw the policies I assume\nThat you said earlier they required for example a man's policy might require pregnancy coverage which shifts\n... yes ... made no sense I have to cover as psychological therapeutic sessions I'm apt to cover things that that somebody might never use and what the companies had to do is raise the premiums in order to cover that\nAnd when the premiums got to the point\nOf being a absurd or many of the companies just said look we can't do this anymore so that's part of why they left\nBecause what they would have to cover in every policy was way more than what was justified for that policy and the individual had no option to get lesser coverage if they chose to do that was that correct\nThat that is correct on a plane and said you know what what what they call it a sexual health benefits and ... and ... and man there that if that's a tray being on that the well being on\nA trip to the big ones that were you know typically show and you know prior to buy you know every every every benefit that you're require everything has a price tag doing so yeah that the more you're putting the policies the march got a call ... or you know they fell off the bat you can do I want to buy a\nCheese pizza you have to buy a true topping pizza don't pay for that so yeah exactly yeah no\nThat's a good point or the other guys are like oh you know I actually uh ... that's a good analogy because\nYou could go to a I've done this I Can't remember where when I'm done and are getting a pizza and um they have a sales with the two topping pizza but let's just say it might have been five Ninety nine\nBut to buy a and I remember this happening to buy just the cheese pizza of the same size wasn't on sale so that would be seven Ninety nine so he actually got the two topping pizza cheaper even though you only one is\nA cheese pizza and what you said don't put the toppings on charges seven Ninety nine right and so that's what then then that's a good analogy to what's happening here\nUh is that you're getting embellished with all this coverage and it's never going to be used in some of the cases\n... and you know I go to Tim attorney thing I mean\nYou know he has a certain age you know fifty eight fifty nine sixty man or woman you know you probably don't need to benefit but you know you're you're paying for that and you know you can you could argue that you know childbearing years younger people okay if you put it in public policy the man and a woman\nIs going to offset each other in the end and\nYou know I think that was where they were trying to make but at some point that's got to go with me I think it would actually have to buy it either but you make that argument okay but at some point you know back that stuff out and say okay you know\nWe're going to assume that most people over age fifty aren't going to have children or let's let's let's back two hundred dollars a month out of the ... because that's about what\nYou do it adds to it\nAnd so you wind up having I'm really I'm In an uncontrolled system because the government's imposing the system on the families and on the companies and it was really in I'm In my you know go back to my point so people understand is the real intent was to basically take\nA in a health insurance and make it a national single or single payer policy being the U.S government because the left wing or as a and the Democrats want the government to control health care and the the the a huge amount of the economy than it is so we we have\nThose requirements in those premiums and that's why the the premiums went way up people couldn't afford them and people were being dropped and then there were companies giving notice as the people they were dropping them and then the people that are scamper around to try to find on the coverage is um if I recall correctly is that right\nThat is ... ... it really happens every year right about now people are getting their their letters day and your plan is being canceled a your world you know either if difficulties leaving the block and you're just flat out canceled a or what's what's common knowledge most companies are not too many companies still leaving the marketplace that's that that's kind of we do we need it self out\nBut you know even like you know well what what are carrying Europe players so you're ... we're going to move your from this plan plan plan might have you know they might have\nMore benefit to bail either way it costs you more it also you're seeing people leave their policies cancelled they go a similar plan with higher costs and not only the higher cost of higher deductible higher out of pocket limits have last year to the facts you know I got I got less covered in a higher premium and already talked about\nSo you ... and that's what's happening in now the new for Obamacare begins November first correct\nWell they beat the enrollment begins November forsberg January one start date the rates have already been filed with the carrier the plan designs are already out or so people are now getting a letter to the people were getting cancer again as the occasion now ah but yeah and about two weeks we open up there for the actual what role but you're",
