the employees said that in November last year just over half the staff said they felt they could balance their work and home commitments and the founder of the company said he came up with the idea

mentioned Pittsburgh this one's been sitting in my show prep for a few weeks now it's like one of those stories not really a top of\nMind not really the most important but I was an interesting detail yeah Pittsburgh according to the hill dot com or and this was published the twenty seventh of August so it's about a month old a Pittsburgh will hold the distinction of being the largest city in the United states\nUh within I imagine it's top fifty I mean Pittsburgh's not is not a ... top twenty maybe a without a daily print newspaper after the city's Post Gazette informed readers it will cut its production schedule from seven days a week to five beginning this week at\nThe post is that what you lost two hundred and thirty two years ago and it's one of the oldest newspapers in the country had originally indicated in June the cut back would eventually be happening while noting the digital edition of the paper will continue\nQuote it's the year two thousand Eighteen and with the way people review and expect to review information and news\nWe think we're doing the right thing Keith Kowalski vice president of legal and government affairs for block communications incorporated the company based in Ohio that owns the post cars that set on June twenty seventh to trip alive dot com which is also based in Pittsburgh sounds like they're competitor\nQuote we'll be publishing a digital newspaper seven days a week and frankly we reach more people via online than through the print publication I originally meant a lot of the\n... yeah I remember when you told me that the post 'cause that was stopping seven days right Pittsburgh was not going to have a daily I said what about this tribute and yourself apparently they've been all digital for several years yeah uh and I actually found the rankings of cities\nBased on twenty Seventeen population estimate okay and Pittsburgh is smaller than I thought a Pittsburgh proper has three hundred and two thousand people\nSixty fifth largest oh I'm not even top fifty right now they do have a very sizeable metro\nYeah but the city of Pittsburgh itself is very tiny\nIcy well it still may be you know the canary in the mind it may be a harbinger of of things to come for the larger markets which do still have daily papers\nBecause Pittsburgh isn't the first hour this paper in particular the post cars that isn't the first paper to cut back their print schedule I mean obviously we've seen papers go completely digital but then I go to the ... rights but the midpoint is to go from we've seen some go from seven days to three\nRight so you know you get like\nTuesday Thursday and then a weekend edition or something like that you know that way it's still I mean what's the difference if the news is out of date by two days or one day still still out of date you know yesterday's news today is the sort of the ... for for newspapers\nAnd uh the union that represents the hundred and fifty posts cars that employees in the newsroom the

in the case of our caller who just called in Vernon in New Orleans he pointed out there's actually a media company\nA print media company that expanded at the same time that the times Picayune\nThe longest daily paper or what was the daily paper they stopped that and ... twelve\nUh the times Picayune cutting back to three days a week from seven\nAt the same time another company came in and started printing a seven day a week paper than it already existed in Baton Rouge they started printing invasion for New Orleans and apparently that same company I was just looking for updates on that like uh trying to find an article like\nRight how do they do it you know because the times Picayune a the one that cut back there was an article from last year in December so just recently um\nLess than a year ago that they were moving into smaller offices in fact I also have another story here are from just I think yesterday\nThat the Boston Herald is now moving into smaller offices\nAre still a lot of these papers are downsizing they're cutting staff they're moving into a cheaper places I think just I think they're actually moving out of Boston in into a suburb where they can get cheaper rent that's not a bad idea smaller facility yeah I mean you got to do what you got to do but they're like these guys are waking up here are thinking they\nThe problem with being an old business are learning to compete as years do you get comfortable right if you didn't get these newspaper some of them have been around for hundreds of years\nThey are comfortable doing things the way they've always done because the way they've always done it as always worked and then all of a sudden the rules start to change and before you know you wake up you've got new competition nibbling at you from the Internet um now apparently New Orleans you got new competition coming into town or your product which I any one\nThing that's interesting I I also was reading up on that a advocate based out of Baton Rouge apparently they're the largest paper in the entire state of Louisiana now that they have New Orleans service thing not only Baton Rouge and New Orleans but also Lafayette\nThe same company just purchased a uh this is new as of earlier this year in April\nA the company that owns the advocate purchased a local free weekly one of those alternative weekly right just snapped it up and the owners says the purchase is in line with his vision of preserving iconic Louisiana brands so they're they're doing it sounds like they're doing great if they got enough money to just go around and buy up\nAll these other operations and expand\nSo that's why I'm more interested in like what did they do how did they change their business you know fundamentally to make it so they're expanding\nIn a time when it seems like everything else is contracting right and and the media ... voted and everything in a different that's that's what I Want to know they're doing something right is it I don't know what ... what is the thing that has different but it's doing something different yeah that sometimes that's it exactly what it is it's just do something different and did say they don't have a\nWall right and I'm Wondering if that helping them because there are some people that are ... and you know whatever local newspaper there's pay well well I can\nJust pay a dollar a month and read everything on line or I can pay a dollar a week to get\nDelivered to my out why why should I pay more to get some thing that winds up creating trash right when I can just read it on line for cheaper but do you know anybody who actually buys an online newspaper subscription\nOr I Know a couple of people that are not surprise me if they had a news paper subscription online for say like God the New York times or the LA Times or one of the big huge yard newspapers\nJust because there are certain content that will get published there that doesn't get published elsewhere\nDoes anybody out there are actually pay for these on line newspapers I mean there are people who are doing it the New York times having like a you know after many hundreds of night and I remember we've ... not too long ago about how much money they brought in from\nTheir online revenue you know I have to wonder if they're not doing something like really obvious for example um there's a there's a huge percentage of the population apparently is using I blockers nowadays and\nI Wonder if they are tweaking their ads to get their average at advertisements through the ad blockers so they have a greater percentage of advertising than anybody else yeah and there's I Wonder what percentage of them I was eating it blocked well it's it's it's something like I don't know something over scissors and I think it ... the something insane yeah\nWow I and and you guys ... you can double check the ... that could be wrong but I Believe that's what it is it something like really really high now\nAnd it's interesting because most of these companies I've noticed are just putting up ... like they're trying to prevent you from ... in the fight if you have an locker that locker but what's interesting is if your ads are not a noxious and abuses basically to the ... you don't have that problem\nAnd so I have to wonder if me either you simply a creative getting creative and you know ... basically not being abusive to their\nYou know customers or veal or maybe we ought to actually go to their website and see what other thing to do it differently here um in fact I can compare it so I just found the website for the parent company okay or the patio help any\nOf the advocate it's George's media group and when you click on our team\nIs in the named George not Georgia, Georgia or drive a ... so you have to work George ... with an ass of George's oh gosh yeah the apparently the order John George's is listed first under our table so it sounds like it's just a small family company\nIs making it work more efficient I Love a good way to work and I love a good success story in a down time like this uh it's really interesting\nWhere he also sponsor lemonade day Louisiana\nWhereas a hearing keen this
