dollars a year at the time kneels way into Bennett the answer really is this\nIf you want to do um something about the problems in the African American community\nYou have you can say that have ten percent of your income if you really serious about it as a tithing to those problems churches talk about uh ten percent tithing so why not do ten percent to some organizations fighting for civil rights fighting for equal justice whatever it is that you want to support\nGo up there and use your big massive amount of money for some good why not instead of kneeling and insulting the American flag well\nMany people felt the way I just described it across this country\nAnd the ratings guide shattered\nThe interest reduced\nAnd I've lost my interest\nI still occasionally um if there was a good game put one on but I no longer have the football package that you pay separately for I just don't have the the interest in football because of the way they've treated\nThe American flag patriotism and the national anthem and so that's another factor that's hurt\nThe national football I don't know the ratings are back up\nBut this is all cyclical and I think what we're going to see is a more and more of that harm so baseball becomes for me the national pastime I think there are a couple of things in baseball when the playoffs going on right now\nThat are harmful to baseball's future one of them is the cause of balls and strikes by umpires\nThey are wrong six to eight percent of the time\nAnd they are wrong at times one that is crucial to a game\nAnd making bad calls and we know they're bad calls because for those who watch baseball at all we have the pitch tracks the square the box that shows the strike zone and they show where the pitch goes as to whether it's within that strikes on on the line or inside the box\nWe can see that one um fires make calls they're making too many calls that are wrong now they probably have the same percentage of wrong calls thirty or forty years ago\nBut we didn't have the technology today there's the technology that could correct that and I think baseball wants to maintain its integrity is gonna have to implement the pitch tracks to call the balls and strikes it doesn't mean you don't have the home plate umpire he still has to be there or do you do then is just use the\nSo he sold makes the call but he looks at the little eye pad arrived pod whatever it is that he has with the screen on it showing that box and showing where the ...\nTakes a split second to look at it and then he makes his call\nAnd then he's accurate instead of the human error that creates problems where the winner of the game maybe should not have been the winner of the game\nOr creates a situation where had the correct call been made the whole inning would have changed but then there's another matter it's now gotten scandal is and or is out there in the press pretty heavily\nThe Houston Astros\nMajor league been there in the playoffs right now as we speak against Boston but the major league baseball has now decided\nThat will be no league discipline\nRelated to any of these accusations against the Astros\nOf postseason spying members Spygate with the bill bill a check on the patriots when he had people go with cameras shooting the practice sessions of the teams they were going to face\nAttention bad press and huge fines\nAnd loss of some recruits and all of that\nBut the baseball they using them do anything about it\nBelieve put out a statement major league baseball did\nAnd they say a number of teams express concern about science stealing\nAnd inappropriate use of video equipment during this postseason which is exactly what bell check done for the New England patriots the statement from baseball goes on to say that the investigation found the Astros\nWere making sure other teams were not cheating\nBully now has warned\nAll of the postseason themes not to do this any more that the matter is closed\nAnd here's what um\nBaseball said they said before in the postseason big gun began number of clubs called the commissioner's office about science Delia ... inappropriate use of Bill Clinton and\nThe concerns expressed related to a number of clubs not one specific club in response the commissioner's office reinforced the existing rules with all playoff clubs undertook proactive measures including Institute in a new prohibition on the use of certain in stadium cameras\nIncreasing the presence of all races and security personnel for major league baseball at all postseason games and then instituting a program monitoring monitoring clump video rooms\nSo they basically whitewash the whole thing\nBut\nI realize this doesn't rise to the level of a of an issue dealing with the international relations or illegal immigration or veterans a fair treatment or the ... matters in the middle east\nBut it is important because\nKids across this country\nDepend on their professional sports idols and their teams\nTo give them some joy and pleasure adults do the same\nAnd if he got this stuff going on that's unacceptable against the rules of major league baseball\nAnd then you have a ... a compound that as I said by the fact that the umpires calling\nBalls and strikes badly\nAnd they are influencing games by bad calls when they should not be\nThe pitch is a ball or a strike based on words goes in or out of the ... of the strike zone not based on a wrong interpretation buying up\nAnd that's why they need to pitch tracks but with regard to\nSign stealing and all of that\nThey had to be very careful some commentators are making the point earlier that you could wind up having an erosion of confidence in the sport people will start looking at it\nThe way to look at the world wrestling federation of Vince McMahon\nWhose wife I'd always doing a great job is director of the small business administration the administrator there but uh but we know that wrestling is entertainment period\nWe believe that baseball football basketball and hockey as a professional level and soccer are being done correctly within the rules and as you start having this espionage inspiring and all of that is going to deteriorate for the\nSport it's going to reduce the support of people across the country and it's going to be a loss of a major um\nEconomic force of eleven billion dollars a year and baseball

inside of a top Saudi diplomats house\nIt it would be um because they're dealing primarily from an emotional perspective\nIs dead of really thinking about ... you know the solution orientated and how can we actually come together and solve problems as a society or community\nAnd um when you're coming from a low emotional quota quotient what other\nThan you know you're it's it's more about fear and people get into a lot of fear because they don't feel that they have control um and they act out based on that fear and that's and that's what we're seeing and we haven't seen for for quite a few years\nOr so let me put it in another way because see I don't have any problem\nWith the emotion I don't happen to agree with them on their point of view but that's the relevant and we all have different points of view where within the constitution protects every ...\nAnd if you but I I have a concern about the fact that they ought to take the point of view as extreme as it may be\nAnd harness it sort of the systems of government that they're offered which are varies and open and fruitful or that if you can get more people vote a year away than voting the other way you're going to get your results that you want 'em ... without using brute force\nOr the ... or verbal abuse so people or harassment of people uh does that make sense that in other words have the emotion but it's how you use the emotion\nAnd how you go after getting your emotional goals that's the real issue\nI absolutely agree a hundred percent the uh I think you have to chew issues going on I think you have a group of individuals including groups of people in politics that understand that they get more press with fear\nUm and they're going to get their point across to more people using fear that if they're coming from a place of logical conclusion which does not necessarily makes 'em make the media\nAnd because of that you have people all over that are using a fear so to speak as a way to get their message across to a large group of individuals that he'd have individuals that are ignorant and I don't see that in demeaning anyway\nA state that I get from my perspective they just don't know and the\nThe people use fear is actually scaring them and they're literally in a real fear because they do not understand what's taking place they buy everything that the media puts out whether it's right or wrong or indifferent from an emotional perspective and then they act out on that\nUm so they don't they don't really understand that uh we can form as groups of individuals and handle it from an intellectual perspective and yes put a motion behind that like many other great leaders of our past have done\nUm to to you know as a force of good in the world instead of a forcing something down somebody else's throat just because you're afraid of that\n[noise] you know hidden example of what and that's a great way to describe I'll give you an example of what I mean when when I was on the air in Seattle we had a Tom Foley as speaker of the house\nAnd he was obnoxious to many people are because of his positions on issues and because of the way he um abused the power of his authority I'm doing things that benefited him personally but\nMore fundamentally beyond the office having his bikes\nPete his wife's bikes are transferred by airplane over to Europe and things like that that he didn't pay for um let's put it in a marble floor and his elevator to the speaker's office all of that so people got passionate upset they wanted a fellow named George never cut to win\nNever before has there been a speaker of the house defeated so when a lot of our listeners from Seattle go across the mountains to eastern Washington in Spokane where he was a his ... his district was and we call them seagulls soldiers and they want and knocked on doors and talk to people\nBlanketed the district and now they're cutting won a novice\nBeat the incumbent sitting speaker of the house\nI'm now look at it could've been what's happening in this crowd today were involved in this and they were angry at a at a at a speaker of the house let's say they would go to his home they would harass them they might arrest his wife\nThey might arrest them at dinner or an honor goes I Would suggest what we did then was taking the passion and carrying it out in a responsible way with success\nAnd what's happening today is totally irresponsible and frankly it was scary to me is the breakdown of law and order and the possible anarchy that we're talking about here from people who have no parameters about what's right and wrong in terms of behavior\nI agree um you know it it's very interesting because we've seen as\nWe've seen this kind of vague you're in\nA cask for years the we've seen it in America's pass and other countries have where you know you take your like you said the rule of law\nYou kind of throw it out the window become strictly for fear that you get people to do things out of fear even if they don't necessarily believe that they're going along with it just because there's so much fear that's his being induced\nQuote on my back on that point will will pick it up right there

emotional coach or to if you will lower income coach or whatever however you describe it\nI think the point though is that improving a person's emotional maturity has a direct relationship to success in personal relationships as well as in business for relationships am I correct\nAbsolutely correct yeah I think one of the things that people have to understand is that our our emotions or subconsciously programs and attached to different stories as we grow up as children\nPrior to the age of seven we don't really have the ability to reject most of what we're supposed to because our conscious mind is not fully developed so the ability to reject I'm Asian comes from a conscious by\nSo whatever works posed to prior to the age of seven is going right in a chore subconscious by their subconscious might operate like the hard drive of the computer where it's programmed with information and it all each job is to do is to carry out that information\nIf we if we walk the ability to critically thing go work for that to\nSome critical and thinking about things as we get older we don't have the ability to evaluate how we want to respond emotionally to whatever it is we're experiencing\nSo those people are given very limited options as to how they want to respond so in other words if they have a parent a teacher I'm anybody conditional with forty [noise] there's a lot that does not help them critically think\nAnd teach them how to cook and respond around things that caused a motion\nAt us as we are growing up that we're operating from a juvenile response in our emotion\nAlso today what were what you were talking about the beginning of the show is that um we're experiencing a lot of fear and we're hearing a lot of your world wide and people don't know how to process that fear what's real about real what should they be afraid of what should they be afraid of\nAnd even more importantly how do we empower ourselves so we're now living in fear\nAnd we don't come from a place of emotionally responding in here and that's with such people free doesn't matter whether you're a in business or you work for somebody else or your um uh you know you're a stay at home mom or dad did it doesn't matter it's about empowerment and not coming from a place to fear\nSo if you have a\nKnow it's a self confidence self assurance self worth and that's what it sounds like to me that if you have those things you're not going to be intimidated or you're not going to be living in my late ... actually I I I was just thinking uh there's no I meant I baseball's a big fan\n'em one do I want to call it past time a lot of great player but I Love\nThe sport I followed him my entire life and I'm paying the Dodger Braves a Dodger a British brewers playoff game a there was a lot of talk about the tension and the fear um the anxiety fear of failure if you will um\nAnd Clinton crush on the brilliant picture on the Dodgers ...\nHad today\nMaybe the biggest game of his career and people were building it up that way\nAnd then after was over when he was ... to ... billion game they talked about how relaxed they was well it would seem to me that he he took his emotional level is these are the most stable guy anyway but he took his emotional level to uh to hire staff and took control of what he was doing\nRecognizing his talent executing just talent and doing that in part I Would think based on what you just said\nBecause of the um cola maturity and being in a good emotional stable level of taking it in in context and not allowing it to control them that situation\nThat would be that would be very correct that your great that's a fantastic description\nAnd it's also about the story that he believes about himself\nAnd his abilities so the courage or the confidence that a person exhibits and the situation as a lot to do about the internal dialogue that's going on they called themselves or that's running through their mind\nI'm about what is that they're doing or what they're experiencing as she can they come from a column twice shut off the turtle noise that's going on and be able to execute in the game\nThe way that they do need to do especially when they're under a lot of pressure and there's a lot going on over the media about the game itself or or politically or whatever it might be\nAll right so it's all from there as well so actually you're not this is not so\nI'm I'm a skier as a concept emotional quotient it's actually if you describe it in real world terms and not as of what you call emotional quotient and he killed is very similar to uh doing therapy to build one self confidence uh to go through grow\nAnd and it's a very normal process in other words what you're talking about is not some obscure abnormal concept is very central to a person's growth to being successful\nAbsolutely it's not a skier at all and you know we teach children to be afraid of and what not to be afraid of it a very young age um what's really fascinating about about the subconscious mind no subconscious mind cannot tell the difference between what is the managing and while he was real\nShow if something gets placed into the subconscious mind that's just the managing here\nLike we've all experienced either getting a little child and afraid of the monster under the bed or seen a little child he was afraid of struggle with that but we know that there is no monster under the bed but if there are imagination starts to play on them\nA mom and dad can come in they could turn a light on showing that there's about ... like back off their imagination starts to run wild again they experience back here so\nIf we can as as we become more mature as adults whatever fears that were carry into our adult life if we can rewrite the story around that fear is fear and goes away because we start to experience different though where there is no basis for the fear\nThat could day what would experience thing is a lot of people are in fear about things that aren't even true", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "18"}
