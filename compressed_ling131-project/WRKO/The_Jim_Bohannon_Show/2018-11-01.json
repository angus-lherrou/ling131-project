{"month": "11", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Do you you do see that and you know the ... in terms of the cultural boycott campaign on in the ... that really kind of started and in Europe and it you know to not an indigenous campaign it was really kind of hatched by um\nYou know academics and\nAnd in the uh in in Europe so ... you know it is\nIt easier anathema for peace\nYou know you're not going to end it it it promote violence so it is absolutely\nUm fosters and and contributes to violence and and it plays out on social media where you know you see\nSome of the worst um vitriolic exchanges needed people go over the top and you know ... it's the cloak themselves as a\nA human rights movement and of course that's absurd there's no attempt to\nAh for promote reconciliation their goal is really to stir up conflict you know they're against any kind of cultural exchange they're really into censorship that they they don't want to educate people and it's not about getting the truth that and bringing people to the table\nIt sit down and intimidating people\nIt's always been that way is over specially in the Arab world are toward Israel with respect to a propaganda a misrepresentation of facts I mean all of that yeah but the question the question really of all that I was raising is whether this act on Saturday committed by this individual whether that\nCould be expected to be repeated or in other words are there are others out there with the same evil content that would allow them\nBut this individual that\nWell you know I don't have a crystal ball on that and I uh like everyone else I Hope we don't have that we've seen a rise of violence we ... and ... in our society than you know tremendously\nAh a stressful and it's being bad by the anger that you see a social media it's unbelievable what's going out on their\nYou know ugly Twitter wars a Facebook um conversations that raise the temperature\nOf everything and it's it's fine people one after the other trying to outdo each other in terms of provocation\nAnd all of that support 'em violent so you know I mean there's been a lot of criticism about and it's true about you know a a ... politicians in leadership that are ratcheting up\nYou know I'm a very aggressive and negative campaigns but it's also part of the public I mean the public is is diving in but you know the anyone's personal Facebook page can condemn it straight that\nThere's a couple of things on the way I Want to respond to one is just to amplify um the fact that Twitter and Facebook are perfectly happy I'm blocking conservatives even members of Congress who are conservative Republicans are they block them shadow block\nA shadow sensors is called yet the kind of thing you're describing is allowed to go on because it's only the Jews so what's the big deal like us or its free speech I mean even our college campuses you know this as well as I Do at Brandeis and other places the president will say well it's free speech when these this the kind of vitriol but you're talking about\nIs allowed to be tolerated because it's considered free speech a which is outrageous because it's advocating violence as you suggest than some might pick up the torch and carry out that binds the other thing is we've had an undercurrent of both public officials for example President Obama has been cozy with Louis Farrakhan\nWho has been visited Berlin an anti Semite as there is\nPhotos together meetings together twenty Thirteen when he was president um you have Bill Clinton sitting two seats away from ferret con you have Bernie Sanders hiring Linda source or the most virulent anti Israel anti Jewish\nWoman in the country who wants to liquidate Israel limits said so in many different ways\nSo um you know you've you've you've got these problems and nobody really talks about them they're the they're allowed to fester and then the the social media that you're talking about are allowed to fester when this stuff should be taken off shouldn't it\nWell ... well ... yes they you know ... that's like a a a broader question about how much censorship and I think there's been a lot of pressure on all of these social media platform for them to it to police\nTheir platforms and and and not allow them to be you know us sources of a of a hate and hate mongering\nLet me just say so people understand\nIf the Jewish defense league which I don't know if it exists anymore it done on there and said we ought to blow up a mosque that should be taken off to\nIt doesn't matter what group it is the matter of violence\nAbsolutely absolutely and yes the ... there's the call to violence which is not free speech under the law you cannot do that you can add call for an active violent and that's been long established but then there's also just this you know\nUgly near campaigns that are going on about huge groups of people\nIt's like a about the other and and Israel is one of the prime targets of that so yeah and that and when when you ... yeah that's always been kind of ... the way it leads up to\nA killing people is huge humanize them you make them out as evil 'cause that's the only way you can possibly justify trying to destroy an open liberal to\nSociety like Israel is that you have to lie about it and you have to um you know gave half chosen and misconception in order to vilify it because if you vilify then\nPeople are much more comfortable and you know tolerating is distraction\nSo that's how it goes and you're saying then on social media and by the way you see that on the pages of the celebrities not ... not coming from the celebrities I mean not I mean obviously there are statements that celebrities had said where they\nSupport the a BBS but they're few and far between you can read this stuff\nJust they get married in the comments section you know like you know they're supposed to be an innocuous posts about upcoming tours and buried in the comments that go back and forth enter scheme by the celebrities followers up is anti Israel rhetoric\nWhile we've got to watch but I've got to close the hours but we've got to watch for that if he wants to stand up

of last week\nYeah and that's a very powerful and I think the point you're making a and I think that's correct to say that the president understands where the American people are I mean this isn't a matter of fact though I I was having a conversation last night\nOn this program and and I have no conversation with the president you have to say the same thing today which is that you sent advance who's going to I'm a marine one then people are of reporters were asking him questions but when I was making that he made today was that\nWomen are very concerned about safety and security for their families that's number one I mean the women are the nurtures there the nest nesters if you will they want their home protected\nAnd when you send he made the point today when you see what's happening at the border he thinks he's going to get a lot of female votes for um the Republicans running for the house and Senate precisely because women are going to say I like the way this president thinks in terms of protecting the country as a priority what do you make of that\nOh look at say commonsense approach and the president or something that he showed me where I worked for the true\nBut we'll look out the window in terms of taking immigration\nAnd now they can get a threshold dish and get the public is why they can't just buy it was what it was on ... state issue in the very beginning\nBy we

coming here to take away jobs if they get them at the vast majority of money back that they are in fact for those country now going on too many\nAh let's see what happens in the mid term I have the same as bad as being\nAn issue where something where it or whether the job search bourbon let's say suburban Republican women back in the Republican Party and twenty degrees I really might go see them voting\nA voting for the Democrat ... the issue is whether or not they're going to get out and vote\nI Am telling you that\nThe um this house or that that how to replace there are still very close

way in\nWhich president when he made a statement our birthright citizenship\nYeah no that was um\nA that's a very interesting issue to a an Arizona uh they they talked about a bill to do exactly what the president saying he's going to do by executive order and um I interviewed or the Senate the Senate majority leader and he pointed out that they went through the\nConversations of the founders when

already voted of course the bottom\nLine is as you heard back the lumber on this program every week\nIs that these polls are not done accurately or correctly\nFact that many people will vote\nAs they did for Donald Trump twenty sixteen will not vote for Republicans and not really talk about it to the public don't want to talk to pollsters about it\nLeaves the pollster with the impression that the results are going to be something different than what they actually are going to be and when push comes to shove\nAside from the groups who simply don't want to talk to the pollsters or the groups who gave them wrong information about who they're going to vote for that they're going to vote for Democrats when they actually going to vote for Republicans\nThere's also the group in this country who are going to look at the salivating radical unacceptable behavior and rhetoric\nOf not only politicians on the left what the media on the left\nThere were ... they have their small core of supporters\nAt CNN or MSNBC or elsewhere\nThat small corps is all they have they're not growing\nAnd the more they have this village firing attacking\nMarginalizing\nAnd humiliating\nConservatives Republicans on the president but more of those groups of people are going to stand up and be counted what they've actually done us to harness the energy\nOf the Republican base\nAnd also by the way evangelicals there's a huge campaign\nTo get the vote out of um\nTens of millions of evangelicals I think it's about twenty seven million evangelicals in this country\nWho are being targeted to vote\nOn the conservative side\nAnd they've perfectly happy to vote for Donald Trump candidates in this election\nAnd the reason they're happy to do it is because number one is the Supreme Court\nIf madam Justice Ginsburg retires she's in her eighties at this point she claims she's going to stay until the end of the second term of Donald Trump\nI'm not sure that's going to happen at some point it becomes a question of frailty\nOr look if she makes a God Bless her but if she does and then she retires than the president's going to have another point but\nCertainly solidify the conservative side for extended period of time\nAnd even if a conservative where to retire\nDuring the Trump years\nHe would be able to put another conservative in who would move forward with that\nIdeology on the court\nWhole notion and by the way as part of that of course the Senate now just needs a majority and the Senate is going to have a majority Republican no matter what happens in the house\nAfter this election\nAnd sold any of these confirmations of judges and justices and the federal courts by the Senate will basically be a blueprint for the president\nAnd a a certainty that they'll get approved and this is very important\nBecause you have cases that go to the appeals courts\nWeather in San Francisco and New Orleans Washington DC Boston New York\nThere are federal courts think there are Thirteen and total\nThose are the appeals courts that the federal level\nThey have a huge influence on issues in the states that they cover each one of those federal appeals court has a very specific states\nUnder its jurisdiction and any decision made by the federal appeals court\nIn that jurisdiction applies to every state in that jurisdiction so they're powerful and the person is already had a ball over a hundred of those appointments than there were more coming and so that reason alone is going to give many people\nA comfort level to say we want this to continue\nThe other thing is who's going to ... take on the responsibility for electing Democrats and making Nancy Pelosi the speaker where she's going to block tax cuts\nAnd there's a tax cut that it's being proposed now in Congress that would be permanent\nFor the middle class\nWho's going to vote for her what she calls the tax cuts and the bonuses people got from the tax reform and cut bill crumbs I mean how when something is that to middle America\nIt's a disgrace on the part of below sea who wound up using a\nFederal airplanes for her family and our grandchildren and had no problem drinking a very expensive crown royal uh the going live at scotch and some of the other um adult beverages that are at the high end thanks to the taxpayer\nAnd having your family on that\nAirplane that was a big scandal at the time\nAnd so the bottom line is that when people go to the both\nThose who did not vote in advance by mail in ballot\nWhat are they going to think\nOf I ... I Believe they're going to think do I want to mess up what looks like a safety and security in this country a robust economy\nWas jobs more jobs than people to fill them\nA president who is willing to fight to keep the border under control without people coming in illegally want an ally and recklessly\nTo the degree that he's willing to put troops at the border\nAnd yes we want people coming in but we want them coming in legally as responsible people who will contribute to this society\nAnd that'll for said if if the Republicans when it's clearly going to force the allocation of funds for the wall and the immigration law reform that would give it a common sense and to change these absurd law", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Boston", "day": "01"}
