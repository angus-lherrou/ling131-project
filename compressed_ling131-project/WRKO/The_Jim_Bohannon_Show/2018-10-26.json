{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Is it an area where somebody could simply walk across the border\nOh they they just don't find three ...\nThree strands of barbed wire and climb over some Normandy fencing which is basically just you know log put in the next you know\nI'm On the other side of the barbed wire so it would take me a little less than a minute just to climb over the normative dancing in through the barbed wire and you know if I was like a goal I could be in Mexico that quickly\nHas never been any any responsible for many of the media you've contacted with you on any affirmation if it will be there\nThey're not that they're going to be there but I have a few um some of the Fox station is Fox does have called that they want to have me on ahead of time and then touch base took me probably Monday Sunday and Monday of next week\nUm I Will be on Lou Dobbs um with with with another angel family friday night to kind of go over what we're going to be doing and most of the few pictures out of the area that we're going to be um to kind of give a visual but\nI think um you know it it's just like when they talk about family separation and and we're able to show a visual of our loved ones gravesite\nIt really you know hits home with somebody this is what permanent that separation is about it's not about being separated from your child to UV legally tried to enter into another country with you know being separated from them for a few weeks I'm just as\nOh you know these liberal politicians Nancy policy at the big waste of money putting a wall on our southern border well we're going to show you why it's not a waste of money and why we need it and um our politicians all us\nProtection that they were elected into office to provide for us and they're total disregard for American safety and their their\nYou know fight and felt that energy that they put in to protecting them providing for them encouraging them to make this trip provided sanctuary on and all of these cities in states that have now become a sanctuary um you know cities the states for these these criminals\nCan you imagine what's going to happen to those places like\nOnce these people are successful in getting over this border how those cities and states are just going to be flooded with these people because they know that's where they need to go\nAnd this is just this is why it's very important to vote people into office who are against sanctuary policies because your city or state will become a haven for these people and they do not stimulate\nThey caught in the air their demand interested and they're demanding Mork and those are the only things that are important to them and they'll be spending all their money back over the border but they will not assimilate to our culture and\nTrust me we deal with that all the time here in Arizona they're bringing their culture to us and they're demanding that they are going to just say take over a certain areas of every state in every city that they're that they're in\nWell it's it's clearly what's happening there was clearly but this look and frankly none of the presidents have been um diligent about this I've been you you'd even George W. Bush\nUm Ronald Reagan when he was very disappointed he gave the amnesty to about two point seven million of the illegal aliens at the time I think it was Nineteen eighty six and then he was disappointed because he thought that the border security will be taken care of by that and it wasn't\nNo so here are just more [noise]\nYeah so I mean or even the ones who and then then when Bush was president they couldn't get a bill through um the there was much comfort than Obama but it's still wasn't good enough I mean this is the first time since ... an hour the boardroom force but his thinking poisons Trump\nRight I was when I was the last president to do it\nAnd you know all this all this stuff that's been happening up out the Portland also you know with the Portland police\nDown to antifa and there's a lot of illegal alien crime up in Oregon like a lot and um it's you know it's pretty much a sanctuary state but it's still liberal there in Portland\nAnd one thing that I Want to I Want to make sure that your listeners understand you know the sheriffs are elected by the people there they uphold the constitution allows that this country um\nThe police department and every city\nAre directed by the mayor and the city council of how they will conduct their how the police departments policies are and so the marathon Portland\nI'm ... wheeler and the one who is directing and eat off of the police commissioner on top of that is the one that is directing nice police officers of how they will and and ... and want um react to things that are going on how they will and won't handle illegal aliens and cooperate with the federal\nLaw that with ice and stuff out there in Oregon and Portland but\nUm when you have a police officer who's taken an oath to protect the citizens of their state and their cities\nAnd in their hands are tied by in there and the city council who have thanks very policies on their mind and that's the way they want to direct their police department to handle things [laughter]\nThink of the Quander these police officers around and think of them by a man and think of the the struggle that they go with every day when they when they put their uniform on and now they're walking out the door and they're going to have to deal with sanctuary policies that's completely one hundred percent against their beliefs I mean I cannot even believe the struggle that our police\nOfficers are facing on a daily basis\nYou know this is um the nearest sun\nNo live with it I mean he was one of the people who did as a police officer and the officers so they do it but now they want to get rid of vice of course which is another nightmare we could spend hours talking about that as well but the bottom line is I think what's happening with this migration is that\nIt's having the same effect\nI Believe as the fire hoses had when they were turned on Dr King and a doctor Abernathy and the leadership of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and all of the others\nAre in that movement who were marching when the American people saw that I mean sometimes things visuals people don't understand when when that was seen it it was the ultimate motivator to create civil rights laws\nThat have not existed and it seems to me that what's happening now with people watching thousands trying to enter our country illegally um the ... of that\nI think it's having perhaps the same effect and the selection will hopefully reflect that\nSo that we can get back to protecting the border and the president can get the support in Congress to build the wall\nYou know what is the national guard you know thirty seconds so real quickly please go ahead\nAnd fight because the national guards not going to be able to do anything and sending eight hundred active military men down there he has to have the approval of Congress to even out military action on our borders so um it's very scary and I think the liberals are setting them up to make a decision to protect the American citizens that will enable them to pull him out of office\nI mean um it's it's really a we're at the edge of a cliff right now and I just I'm pleading with my fellow Americans to vote the right way and vote your conscience and now they say that your life matters as much as my son's life matter to me and uh we need to get the right politicians in D.C to clean this mess up\nIt's

D. to Boston heart radio station\nFrom ABC News\nI'm based upon you know the postal service has changed his operations since the anthrax attacks in two thousand one I'm so we have some we have some knowledge of the rocks that somebody's traverse and show we know that some of them originally in Florida but yet somewhere hand delivered\nA in New York New York state you are at the at the sauce Manchin outside of the New York city area a or a write in search city with a CNN addressed the John Brennan so\nThere's a certain level of sophistication there um if it is in fact in tended\nNot to be active but to just walk active\nThan there's maybe some sophisticated thinking behind this as well in terms of I don't want to kill anybody on the stir things up politically before the election um so I think that we can't really answer that question at this point without knowing it operational or not um\nBut I Do think that will find a natural pretty quickly um whether\nBased upon what we know so far uh\nThere's a lot of evidence here when you think about it the more bombs you have more liquid who do you have a greater evidence you know the similarity one to another\nJust 'cause somebody's got to go out to a a you know hiking supply of plumbing supply ... pick this up and it was going to be an opportunity to start checking everywhere on the floor they are but there are these are all wrapped inside with a\nWith black Cape apparently a and then what you know the hacking the clear packing tape on the outside both of those kinds of tape you know as everybody knows that were done a package\nOr you know all sorts of stuff in here to them including Arabs fingerprints dust that brown material to the forensic labs for the postal inspection service for the secret service for the FBI they all that\nWhich sophistication of break it down and break it down pretty quickly so there's a there's a lot of evidence that we have that's not including external evidence um good police were looking at the video footage that you're going to have trust which city others that have ventured\nSo I think well you know some answers on that pretty quickly and the other piece to what you suggested to me and my though is ah what's the crime here\nAnd chat these weapons are inoperable and they were never intended to be operational but if you look at the definition of domestic terrorism as it was a little jaded post nine eleven uh it has to be apropos\nRemember that's where the anthrax and catch almost immediately after that when we had a copy cat uh kept using fake\n... different types of white powder that may or may not have looked like interest which scared the hell out of everybody just say I'm so there's no it was going on for domestic terrorism in the house to be operational\nOr it has to be a crime in the United states we have that that has to have the potential for violence that has to be within the United states no jurisdiction in the United states we have that and then last require ... has could be they can do to\nA a intimidated course just civilian population change of government policy Charlie ... or to change the effective of government\nBy mass destruction assassinate or assassination [noise] um those may not work if it was never intended striking they'll say of it has to change the conduct of government ... mass destruction\nOr these were intentionally inoperable and maybe get one does work with the they try to me about the ... devil and policy I think it does work\nAgain goes back to the level of sophistication these materials to hit it leaves out almost simultaneously to half sequentially boarded on which we do know loans so they've got a jihad or in tournaments for the you know before the election that reach for the election\nOn a show again I think it on so called domestic terrorism even if it's in a purple or and so a\nAs a result of that I Can't even give you a good answer about to reach a level of sophistication we're um because\nI I Can't tell you whether this was amateur hour and they tried to make an upper bowl weapon and just failed\nOr whether or not the ... one is scary um the population and they wanted to unfortunately perhaps divide the country which is already sort of divisive on politics right now\nI'm I'm a we're coming up to a break when I Want to go point by point over all of that but but the bottom line first of all would be and then I haven't looked at the domestic terrorism law per se but the question would be the men's railroads they're intend to commit harm\nAnd if if in fact just hypothetically if\nThere was absolutely no way that these could ignite [noise] they were just a moment like so to speak [noise] uh then you have the problem of ah really not at the end of a nation would be there\nAnd are the kind of act that terrorism implies would be there [noise] what's the harm could not have been there would be my point source pick it up on that and then also [noise] could've been professionals pretending to be amateurs to [noise] we don't even though we don't even know at this won't come right back on all of that will journal McDaniel stay with us [noise]\nThe

I'm going to be going through all those and sort of a shuttle on that so again the war that are so so much on just on the media we'd be better because there's more opportunities to plenty pieces of evidence or ... or send it comes\nTo the um the one interesting one of the many interesting aspects of this one is that defined that\nBlack tape you mentioned or any of the other type of that was put around the packages or or on the labels where they had the return addresses and the forwarding address is\nIf there are no fingerprints there one could surmise somebody might use gloves and therefore they might be more professional with doing this when wild if there are fingerprints there\nI mean I I to my mind a professional would never allow that to happen that they would never do it better handed uh because of a fingerprint problem right\nRight absolutely I'm used to love you know late ... ... ... years in the laboratory she makes it all up ... absolutely alone but again it's just a mature in light of slipped up somewhere between making twelve or Fifteen and that's the issue here again we don't do the actual number\n[noise] um so that's why I keep saying it and so there's always the possibility that they swept up in the greater possibility for a short term\nSort of code toss leak packages that can be tracked I'm so I'm I'm pretty\nI'm pretty ... they're going to be able to\n... to ...\nUh you know when you go off using my name is ... ... ... quite a period of time um it took until there was other bombings\nTo be able to track him down and do a comparison here we get all they know me with a loving the basis for a lot more loving we had in your case\nI Would assume in this case\nA let's say the numbers ten of these packages that and it may be more uh the FBI's warning to\nBe careful wanted to screen your packages but um if if we would these ten we don't know publicly but I I Would assume that the FBI knows right now ah and then the other the agencies involved\nAs to whether or not these were actually able to be made it wouldn't they know that answer already about those ten\nYou know really is\nAnd then so they won't obviously they're not going to tell us but\nThe reason I should get so ... ... ... make it a couple of days after all was lonely or again will however it was one report that the caps on the TV she was she able with so\nMany black one of those states maybe ... case ... that we can't be enough that would not be a shield ... or the explosion ridges leak out it was down near the ocean than there was some other sealed their", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "26"}
