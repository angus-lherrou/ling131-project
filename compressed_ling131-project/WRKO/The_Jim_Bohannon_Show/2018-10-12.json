{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Large business conflicts I had to speak in front of a five hundred or a top leaders right\nUm and when I first started doing their start talking to the press about something that really came natural to me so you just learn to do it and you push yourself and you do it again one step at a time and a and at some point it's just a or find your comfort zone\nAnd when you find your comfort zone you are actually performing much better but then when you're a bound by your own the fear and in business or when you're when somebody is getting doing an interview\nYou haven't ever done an interview or you're going to be judge or it can be nerve wracking\nAnd are you conscious John ... from zero to a hundred or you know from never having driven a car to driving at a a you know a ... a five hundred a few miles in Indianapolis east or are you just have to go step by step right um\nSo again it goes against that notion of unique to prepare yourself you need to get a pretty good time putting the effort to and uh and again the passion is going to drive you to ... to sustain that effort to over time\nYou also have to have the focus\nUh one of my problems over my life has been that I have a lot of interest I I enjoyed studying the law I'm enjoying that I've been a professor of communication the in training people in public speaking and various other subjects enjoy doing that love doing what I'm doing now with this over several decades um\nAnd so I think one of the things I've learned now\nAs it may be going back\nYou make one thing the central focus\nAnd you become ... at that and everything else becomes part of that then you can branch out from the center of the center of your strength um it reminds me of a some of my colleagues in this business where they get a notoriety through programs that they host\nAnd then they'll write a book and the ... becomes the New York times number one bestseller world that happens because of the work they did in the field\nMaking themself a household name in order to be able to market the book if they were an unknown person writing that book it would never get off or a space so to speak\nSo is it important to become excellent that the one thing\nThat you have the the the intent to be successful at have clear objectives and keep striving to those objectives and then once you get there to build out from there\nBut it sure absolutely um\nAnd ah and your case of getting a great example right because ultimately these are moving targets right or if we if we think what we want to do next year we'll say okay this is what I Want to do and I'll plans for it\nBut if you start taking longer ... you know it says what life is about it's about the long term right then or you don't know exactly what's going to happen is all you can do is to keep on preparing and hopefully\nA year doing it a while they enjoying a the process right uh because otherwise it's just a\nA ... it's just become senseless\n... to ... go ahead no one's going to ask the new continue please [laughter]\nSo so what you what you did write you a ... you had any interest uh you know when you were mentioning had an interesting the law and how you started using diet uh we're we're ah radio career and uh and every every step but that she did every time you put in again that effort because that the uh\nDriven by your passion eight major better or a major better commentator major a better speaker I'm and eventually you you start learning with time how to tie all these different aspects of your life together\nAnd you become a more complete video and I'm more successful individual and again make sure you know in a company people will notice a difference\nYou know as I remember I had the eye surgery and the surgeon who did it was considered Supreme she was from Boston at mass ion air that this was years ago about subsequently I saw on the news that she'd created\nA um some kind of a prescription drug that would alleviate any particular problem of the guy\nAnd I thought to myself she was already had the recognition as being the best in her field and now she goes out and does this and and it continues to build on that and I think it's that she never became content\nAnd and this is the correct that success is always re thinking no matter how good you are\nContinuing to try to find ways to improve even Ted Williams the grade maybe the greatest hitter of baseball history always said he was thinking about things and then bring working in training himself and the hours and hours that people put in to whatever career there in\nIn order to become the best at what they do um that doesn't end ever does it sure\nThat exactly I think once you feel you've arrived to the beginning of the end a excellent ... is a is to continue ... pursuit of improvement is odd you know a place you got there and you're done\nUm because again the world is moving everything is changing and uh you know what your competitors are also moving so as soon as you sit back and think oh you know now I'm here I'm a I'm going to talk of the world and so I don't have to do\nI don't have to challenge myself anymore um that's the beginning of the decline\nSo I absolutely a concern the rethinking I'm very good example to the doctor you mentioned uh\nI'm In my career uh I I was eating at a\nI T in the in systems and and I remember telling a former boss that I had a a ... you know my mission in cheese to find a way that my job becomes irrelevant a year from now\nAnd the Senate loved that that go through sort of like because the whole point of upbringing systems is to eliminate the jobs that are are humans are are are not as good as machines to do right so I'm\nAn actor in your mind that you were willing to challenge what you're doing constantly and thinking and a little bit of paranoid paranoia right thinking well\nThe next guy coming and uh you know they're going to win you know you mentioned earlier you know how dishes doing much better now a few years ago\nAnd you switched from a direct TV to dish so ah it it's a the classes are changing a lot you have to always question if\nIt's a pleasure to have you here and you've you've done that because not only are you a suburb success for sharing that with other people to give them insights to help them and for that

and my heart radio station [noise]\nAnd then as you said if you had the ability to put money in a way that was a great time to buy buy low sell high right but let's pose the average age of retirement in America is sixty three and let's suppose in January of two thousand eight you're exactly sixty three you decided to retire\nAnd you had a million dollars in your traditional a portfolio sixty percent stocks at forty percent bonds and you took a modest withdrawal will say it was even more modest and four percent but it's only three percent\nSo by march of two thousand nine here's here's the double whammy if you will but you only took out thirty thousand dollars for a million that's not much will all agree that's very modest\nThe market a hurricane if you will just ... percent so now that means the combination of lost and the combination of withdrawal is\nPercent sixty percent or six hundred thousand ... million leaves you with four hundred thousand and if you have to take a withdrawal ever again particularly the ... the very next year whether you need to or want to here's the question\nHow does by in whole help you get that four hundred thousand dollars Bactrim mail yet you need a gain of a hundred and fifty percent at I personally did not like those ...\nYeah that's a very good point uh because it's often said hang on don't worry about it uh and and things will come back well by the time it comes back and may not be to where it was that you may have lost that\nUh the principal the corpus permanently and uh and you could be stuck so you've got to have some options when when you do your analyses due to take into account for example things like uh the terrorists discussion that\nThe president is having using that as leverage to get better trade deals do you use a the trade deals themselves do you use what the fed does a ... do you use the the fact that the job market is much better\nWhich to me means and what the what the consumer confidence levels very high it means that consumers are more willing to spend money\nThese days are because they they feel confident about their jobs and confident about the economy of the country are those factors you take into account\nWell those are those are important factors but they're frankly factors that are completely out of our control and if we look at the highest income level that we talked about a just a week ago job numbers you know and and income level\nOkay there's sixty two thousand is the average household income twenty Eighteen but let's let's go back for a minute and and and then I'll come back to your question another way if you're earning fifty seven thousand and two thousand and eight here's the first thing that blows your mind and this is the kind of thing that people have kind of felt\nBut let's terrified and it and the verification is that seven thousand was the average household income in America two thousand eight whether it's one or two people working and then four years in a row that it is seven thousand average income dropped\nFor years in a row we didn't get back to these seven thousand until twenty seven tea\nReally so if we look at the average household income over the last ten years\nThat game has been a very modest point\nSix six percent you know what that means it's not one percent and it's a little more than one half of one percent per year\nAt the same time that inflation has average about one point six one percent of the last ten years so what does that mean if you're if if if ... if the amount was fifty seven thousand\nTwo thousand eight to account for inflation the income needs to be today somewhere in the neighborhood about sixty seven thousand almost ten thousand dollars more well rounded up to Seventy thousand so if you're if you're not at sixty seven or Seventy right ... and and you you're only back to sixty two that may be progress from ten years ago\nBut relative to inflation you're going back ... ...\nThat doesn't make you feel too good by the way it real estate for the same time period is averaging about three percent per year since two thousand eight every year at a tech okay and this all comes from the Census Bureau and did research and that's the kind of think we study but here's where to really answer your question here's what I'm saying let's suppose you or\nSomeone and I'm having the pleasure of working as and let's say you were in Hawaii because we just had this conversation last week and and we first use the technology that mean advisors have but\nDon't employ I I don't understand that but that's what we do or don't do and we had them identify\nIn language that they could understand answering the question what kind of lost could you live with with your retirement dollars and you know we didn't tell them oh you're conservative moderate aggressive which they\n... ... most of us don't really understand those are nice words but we don't really get it no Mike let's sit down and look at you to tell me\nWhat kind of lost you can withstand\nSo let's give you some scenarios and eventually you kind of\nI listen to you work your way through the math for states to gain the loss than percentages in dollars and then this couples the example they said look we expect to be fully retired at about five years and we could withstand eight twenty percent last okay threats deaf one step\nTo let let me get them to
