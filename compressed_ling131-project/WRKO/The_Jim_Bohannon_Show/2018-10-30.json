{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "While it's wrong I I think the numbers are wrong right now my forecast bottled minimum two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans\nAnd its highest two hundred and twenty eight feet the Republican but even in the worst case to twenty five that gives them more than the two Eighteen necessary to maintain control the house\nAnd that would make it to twenty five to ten right\nSo yeah I ... a year\nFairly ... how how will I put this your your print to predict production based on the model then is a two twenty five for the Republicans as a minimal\nRight and the part of the thing that that causing my numbers to be different I mean I I look at polls mostly for their models underneath them founder span how they're generating their numbers and get some sense of where they're coming from\nAnd really the problem is that due to the way they're modeling currently that's a funny thing than a I feel their underlying model is messed counting the electorate in a number of special way which my forecast models or\nDon't do in other words mine I think a more accurate and and what it is is there believing that certain\nWhat we call blue bubbled district are going to stay low\nBut they're actually going to lose some of those districts that they're just in Washington DC if he went and talked to a bunch of funding pollsters they would say oh these are blue blue districts do question and they're just\nSaying they're blue even without falling result because some of the districts aren't poll they don't even bother to follow up and they're saying it's blue okay well guess what it's gonna be rat and they're not counting them in their in their a\nNumber you know they they assume that that you know they're not counting them as they're kind of a blue automatically and that's a terrible mistake I\nThey have you taken into account the fact of the forty five retirees on the Republican side\nOh sure absolutely\nAnd when I was there that's important too so we have\nA and and how much\nOf this seemed to me with a retirees particularly because if somebody has been an incumbent and people like their own the old story is that everybody wants Congress replaced except for their own Congress men around because you know they're they're good\nUm but it would seemed to me that was forty five retiring that what's happened in the country and the Trump agenda being fulfilled based on the promises of the campaign has got to be a major part\nOf what those people are voting on or am I missing something\nYou know this is the first president of the first major politician in quite a long time that has made such an effort to fulfill his promise that people are not used to this people are surprised by it but they like it\nAnd and that's a bit back and by the way it's really no longer the Republican Party you remember I said that the Republican Party is evolving right some of it's going to break off that's gonna continue to happen past the selection and that may be and my next book coming out next spring\nA you know how this continues to evolve but this party is more like the Trump party at the moment and it it's certainly a lot more conservative and a lot more populous than it used to be\nSo and and the bottom line then is that we're going to see um\nMaybe maybe you're calling it something different than what the president Republican Party is but isn't it in effect just the transformation of the Republican Party aisle and let me say it this way where over the last two decades\nMy callers to my programs Gore conservative had been imminently frustrated by the Republicans they said they were more so\nThan the Democrats because the Democrats are who they are the Republicans are the ones that are supposed to be in the safety valve and they have not been so is it correct to say that it's not that the Republican Party is changing\nBut it's merely transforming from the Freedom Caucus for example being uh the big minority but still the minority and the ah rhinos being the majority now it's gonna be the other way around\nAnd those would be the minority and the Freedom Caucus types will be the majority\nThat is true for now but in the longer run\n... a year two three four years from now I think the party of all further because that's what happened in American history\nAnd I think that what's gonna happen is that the Republican Party well ultimately split out more liberal component and create a new party that'll take the place of the Democratic party which I still believe will shut down in the city\nAnd the Republican Party may keep it name or it may call itself something to make America great again party or recall itself but conservative party or make it all fell out called bell for the party\nAnd water and it wouldn't have to change I mean I'm just trying to follow this through it wouldn't have to change its name from what you're saying\nIt's a branding issue whether it changes its name is more like what do we need and our brand sell more presidential elections in the future\nAnd the answer would be more to the gym Jordan types yeah yeah\nLike I say oh All right so then so then really it would be the point I just made that that they would it would reverse uh the the the dominant force of the Republican Party\nI let me put it this way you got the crowd on the on the left and the Republican Party right now the John McCain's of the world right love us ... the U.S chamber of commerce or put up about eighty million dollars in off year elections like this one\nUh in order to get ... for Republicans who are moderates to keep the illegal aliens coming in so they get cheap labor for their corporate members are now now that that now that crowd of rhinos\nIs going to be under your theory suppressed and the Jim Jordan crowd the Freedom Caucus I'm a is going to be increased and the and and they're going to become the dominant force so they wouldn't need to change the name of the party what you're saying is would be more like the Ronald Reagan Republican Party or the Barry Goldwater Republican Party I could\nSee them because of the if you will the bad reputation of rhinos you know a lot of people thought that was rhinos over the years you know right they they were conservatives they get the Washington they both like Democrats right and so for purposes of branding I think there's a high probability\nBut I don't have specific numbers on this kind of variable that they'll change today\nBecause okay you know what what what I described\nI have no way to quantify why they would change the name exactly\nBut I put the window we're wrapping up here so the kind of content wise um what my point would be well taken that in that oh that is perfectly correct\nOkay that sounds so the content would be\nWhat people wanted for years and the name may or may not change we'll see how that goes um well you might lose forest will see it Monday don't forget sick about Tuesday and let let me knowing that when I checked the calendar flipped for Tuesday fantastic so we'll have all your as as we as we get the numbers so that'd be\nWhen you want me to be on this again we're\nRight at the beginning of the show that we have this hour okay okay that\nHas unleashed a green gold rush

I'm using ridiculous numbers here but let's say a state uses a hundred megawatts of power a year\nAnd they charge or the utility company gives that hundred megawatts to the state and the charges ten dollars a megawatt so that's a thousand dollars a hundred times ten thousand dollars so then if the public if there's incentive to reduce the number of megawatts let's say it goes down to fifty half half a production\nWell now at fifty times ten they're getting five hundred dollars instead of the thousand so the only way they can that the utility company can make up for that is to increase the rate rather than the number of megawatts of power right\nAbsolutely so therefore they increased the rate and they're getting the same money out of the public living at home so it really doesn't help uh those because they're going to have to make a certain amount of money to function so that that would be why I I think that's why you say you don't want incentives for low carbon users is that correct\nYeah I'm just thinking like um\n[noise] you know I I don't even know like that to solar panels right I'm certain states they um incentivize people to uh build solar panels on\nFor so they used to have a ... you know they make their own energy and and then they sell back their assets energy to the company or to the utilities are but they sell it to like a retail rate and sort of like a wholesale rate and I'm so I'm actually cost the\nUtilities more a year or even though they're\nCreating their own a lecture the cost more to service the customers and it's essentially um\nYou know with the solar panels so expensive it's essentially by incentivizing people or to buy them a bit actually like a like a\nUpper middle class you know a welfare program essentially\nSo I I wouldn't yeah I wouldn't want to in front of eyes and they sort of ah anything like that\nAll right on point number two I sixteen thirty one does not have a specific plan for reducing greenhouse gases\nHowever failure to meet the unspecified goals will result in increasing fees over the years we want to reduce carbon in lower greenhouse gases but we need a plan of action first or the money collective will likely be used frivolously what about that\n[noise] yeah uh that's a interesting so um the funding decisions at this past would be made five Fifteen member board and Washington and only one voting member of the board which the trash republic plants would be elected by the public\nAll the other members including age when he had a\nMember of the environmental community and they have a place for a representative of a you know quote unquote vulnerable population a all the others the appointed by the governor when piano like that and then this board would make all the decisions on how the carbon dioxide tax money would be spent", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "30"}
