Bush um Ronald Reagan when he was very disappointed the game\nThe amnesty to about two point seven million of the illegal aliens at the time I think was Nineteen eighty six and then he was disappointed because he thought that the border security will be taken care of by that and it wasn't you\nKnow so he urges more yeah\nSo I mean or even the ones who and then then when Bush was president they couldn't get a bill through um the there was much tougher than Obama but it still wasn't good enough I mean this is the first time since ... an hour the boardroom for someone who's taking place on the Trump\nRight ours when I was the last president to do it\nAnd you know all this all this stuff that's been happening up up in Portland also you know what the Portland police standing down to antifa there's a lot of illegal alien crime up in Oregon\nLike a lot and um it's you know it's pretty much just thinks way state but it's still liberal there in Portland and one thing that I Want to I Want to make sure that your listeners understand you know the share of our elected by the people there they uphold the constitution allows that this country um\nThe police department and every city\nAre directed by the mayor and the city council of how they will conduct their how the police departments policies are and so the marathon Portland\nI'm ... wheeler and the one who is directing and he's also the police commissioner on top of that is the one that is directed nice police officers have how they will and will and won't react to things that are going on how they will and won't handle illegal alien to cooperate with federal\nYou know laws and with ice and stuff out there in Oregon and Portland but\nUm when you have a police officer has taken an oath to protect the citizens of their state and there are studies\nAnd then their hands are tied by in there and the city council who have sanctuary policies on their mind and that's the way they want to direct their police department to handle things\nThink of the Quander these police officers around and think at the environment and think of the the struggle that they go with every day when they when they put their uniform on and now they're walking out the door and they're going to have to deal with\nSanctuary policies that's completely one hundred percent against their beliefs I mean I cannot even believe the struggle that our police officers are facing on a daily basis\nYou know this is um the nearest sun no live with it I mean he was one of the people who did as a police officer and the officers did they do it but now they want to get rid of vice of course which is another nightmare we could we spend hours talking about that as well but the bottom line is\nThink what's happening with this migration is that\nIt's having the same effect\nI Believe as the fire hoses had when they were turned on Dr King and a doctor Abernathy and the the leadership\nOf the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and all of the others are in that movement who were marching when the American people saw that I mean sometimes things visuals people don't understand or when that was seen it it was the ultimate motivator to create civil rights laws\nThat have not existed and it seems to me that what's happening now with people watching thousands trying to enter our country illegally um the audacity of that\nI think it's having perhaps the same effect and the selection will hopefully reflect that\nSo that we can get back to protecting the border and the president can get the support in Congress to\nBuild the wall you know what is the national guard you know thirty seconds so go quickly please go ahead\nOn friday because the national guards not going to be able to do anything and sent me an eight hundred active military men down there he has to have the approval of Congress to even out military action on our borders so um it's very scary and I think the liberals are studying them up to make a decision to protect the American citizens that will enable them to pulling out of office\nI mean um it's it's really a a where at the edge of a cliff right now and I just I'm pleading with my fellow Americans to both the right way and vote your conscience and now they say that your life matters as much as my son's life matter to me and uh we need to get the right politicians in D.C to clean this mess\nIt's always a pleasure Mary Ann thank you for being with us so Godspeed and have a great press conference to appreciate your time\nThinking like for having me on you think could care Mike Segal here thanks for listening more\nTop ... much talk about down home values late in the U.S they bloom dreams\nLike you wore as a kid I remember\nThere's ways now saying\nWe moved\n\nHere in the way they\nVoted down and cry\nWhere you needed\nI'm In a\nLittle buzz you comfort getting dime a dozen genes every students guaranteed in order to vendor motorcycle dream comes to lower reinforced see them a G.

some of the orange Nate in Florida but yet somewhere and delivered\nA in New York New York state either a the the ... outside of the New York city area or or a write in her city with a CNN addressed\nThe John Brennan so there's a certain level of sophistication there or if it is in fact intended\nNot to be active but to just look active there's maybe some sophisticated thinking behind this as well in terms of I don't want to kill anybody on the stir things up politically before the election\nUm so I think that we can't really answer that question at this point without knowing if it's operational or not um but I Do think that will find an answer pretty quickly um whether\nBased on what we know so far uh\nThere's a lot of evidence chair when you think about it the more bombs you have [noise] more likely they have a greater evidence you know the ...\nOn to another subject because somebody's got to go out to a a no piping supply of plumbing supply it\n... it is up and he

the the friends that grabs for the postal inspection service for the secret service for the FBI they all of that which sophistication of break it down and break it down pretty quickly\nSo there's a there's a lot of evidence that we have that's not including external evidence\nUm some good police were looking at a video footage that you're going to have trust the city and others that I mentioned\nSo I think will have some answers on up pretty quickly\nOther piece to what you suggested to me though is uh what's the climate here at the uh weapons are inoperable and they were never intended to be operational but if you look at the definition stick tourism well is it was\nAlmost eighty post nine eleven or something to be a purple remember this with the anthrax detach almost immediately after that when we had a copycat attacks using fake\n... different types of white powder that may or may not look like interests which we're the hell out of everybody just saying\nI'm sure there's no clothing on for domestic terrorism at all to be operational\nAh it has to be a crime in the United states we have that it has to have the potential for violence that has to be within the

sophistication these materials it leaves out almost simultaneously tossed it consciously or more to come which we do know loan and so we've got a dig at any time it's really you know before the election that we've reach for the election\nAlso again I think one of them still called the ... or something even if it's an optical uh and so a\nAs a result of that I Can't even give you a good answer about to reach a level of sophistication here um because\nI I Can't tell you whether this was amateur hour they tried to make an upper ... and just failed\nOr whether or not the ... ... email ... one is scary um population or they want to be unfortunately perhaps divide the country which is already sort of divisive on politics right now\nI'm I'm a we're coming up to a break when I Want to go point by point over all of that but but the bottom line first of all would be and then I haven't looked at the domestic terrorism law per se but the question would be the men's railroads they're intend\nTo commit harm and if if in fact just hypothetically if there was absolutely no way that these could ignite\n[noise] they were just um [noise] all look alike so to speak [noise] uh then you have the problem\nAre really not at the ... nation would be there [noise] and ah the kind of act of terrorism implies would be there [noise] what's the harm could not have been there would be my point
