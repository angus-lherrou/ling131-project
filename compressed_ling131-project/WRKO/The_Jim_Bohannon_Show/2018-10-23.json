really believe ah that's one of the reasons the Democratic party is over it throughout effect that the American people\nWell the the\nWay in which the representative of of that out of touch they're\nThe ones and and that's that's a valid point is that there's no connection to reality for anybody's gotta sit there and shake their head and say what are you talking about a window but he won't talk about Obama as I said laying down for the king of Saudi Arabia are backing away from going after aside when he should have\nRight and this this guy is or has the intel and I I don't even know his intelligence maybe it's just simply his unwillingness\nOr to to see what's in front of them at least do acknowledge what's in front of the great way the country is going uh being productive and a vibrant the economy is great there's more reason to believe there'll be peace in the world today than there was before he took office\nA Obama's set on North Korea is going to be your biggest problem it's still not done but it's certainly better than it was then and it may wind up\nWith the denuclearization of North Korea wants Obama gonna say then by the way Obama says that this economy is simply a seamless continuation [laughter] kind of like the kind of like a a liberal on\nGetting a pass from a teammate in scoring a bucket and then the team made takes credit for it uh that\nI heard that I heard that about live and I thought that was all areas\nI didn't know anybody said it but that's where the that oh you mean you've heard the President Obama say momma\nYeah and he acts and well then you heard him say that he that this is just a continuation of his policies on the country was it a debacle there was not\nThere was never any one year of those eight years with three percent increase in gross domestic product he's the first president in history of the country never to have that he had the highest um deficits if you had his deficits together\nThere are more than the forty three presidents put together before him\nThat's right and and we can do a whole long list of others testing that show the economy is in bad shape when he handed over to Trump and he was telling people during the election season twenty sixteen that Americans had to get used to the one percent growth\nA range where we were in at the time and and what Trump said he was going to create a lot of jobs the said well ... what is the what is Trump have a magic wand that can't be done well\nTrump has created under his administration a four point two million new job and I I you know and the the list is the tests that are positive under Trump is just a mind boggling there's so many of them\nWell and we could go on for the rest of the show listing of benefit by black American unemployment is the lowest in history Asian American idol or at the lowest on and on and on and on wait for your your wonderful listeners\nIt well that's why a lot of that is that if they saw his speech he always says that they always brings of everything is done\nSo you just have to listen to the Trump telling himself\nBut I'm the reality is that the country is in way better shape than it was under Obama and the people believe that and understand that I think quite frankly a that it's very clear that the American people see past bronco bomber and he's not getting the crowds that everybody would think he should get if they were much support for him\n... by the way the final total and the Houston rally tonight or RSVP is to attend the rally that a hundred thousand right\nIt was over a hundred thousand a final numbers had been earlier today like Seventy eight thousand I think it holds Eighteen to twenty thousand but it went over a hundred thousand or is BP is back in West Virginia I remember that speech\nThat auditorium also held around Fifteen thousand bad RSVP for Ninety two thousand and wanted to hear the president live incredible\nYup they're busy always gets big numbers and that's by the way around it just said by a recent speech no but I got to ask you about something here\nUm people showed up\nFive hundred people in Florida wow and you know I assume he was there for the candidate for governor\nIn ... and for Bill Nelson probably running for Senate reelection or against actually I'm a Governor Scott Rick Scott the governor\nOf Florida running for the Senate on the Republican

Republicans in their private lives they just won't won't stop it\nSo why why wouldn't there be a response on the other side\n[noise] [noise] well they found some response that people are getting a one or the\nConservative or boating that's why the border and the off the charts for this election and thought I Would say this I think that Democrats are the spell waters I truly believe what they're saying is a way to vent their frustrations on fast the Donald Trump\nAnd the Republican but they're also totally out of it because the American people do not want to see in rats on\nWe thought the

Believe up\nA President Trump by hurt him in a ... a in a a rally today in Texas for Senator Ted Cruz talking about just radical Democrats that's that's the nickname he's come in the Democratic party of radical Democrats is is you're talking about violent imagery and in violent acts\nBut there is no longer a respectful debate on policy or political disagreements it's as Maxine Waters said again a senior elected Democrat not some\nNot some grass roots activist from a you know that picked off the street who knows who this person is you're talking about one of the longest serving members of the U.S house of representatives\nUh Maxine Waters saying if you see a senior member of the Trump Administration in a restaurant\nYou you go you go gather a crowd you know you go make a mob Hugo shout um do you go to intimidate them you say they're not welcome in this restaurant they're not welcome in this store that kind of of hostility\nIs a is devastating to a democracy\nAnd I got to tell you I think the American people in two weeks are going to show just how passionately they reject or that kind of scorched earth kind of politics or in a in the United states\nYou know what if this were happening on the other side and it happened to Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday in Florida where they use the F word and all of that a small group but you're rarely see it happening to the left I was just thinking in my own mind fantasizing about let's say if I owned a restaurant\nAnd she can under the circumstances of what she's done\nMy first response would be she came to my front door as a kindly leave madam you're not welcome here and I'm not in my restaurant ... what would happen then if if the right started doing what the left has been doing I mean these you'd see CNN all over the thing covering it like a glove where they just leave it alone as it is now\n... absolutely Mike and in fact suddenly all of a sudden I mean we've all heard of a four letter words a ... but all of a sudden there's a new three letter word you know the word mop\nYou're not allowed to say that on CNN you know if the same ... it's it's bizarre it's like there's some sort of centrally circulated talking points list because I saw journalist Matt Lewis mentioned you know this this mob going after Republicans and they cut them off that\nNo no no you can't say mob you can't say I never knew that Bob was like a controversial word that it was some sort of provocative term I\nTended to think of that is as kind of a neutral descriptive turned kind of like a you know it's partly cloudy out today\nAnd there's a mob in the street well evidently on CNN you know you can say the first half of that sentence but not the second half a and a and so not only is that coverage\nAre unbalanced not only would it be a hundred and eighty degrees different if the shoe bomber on the other foot is here as you're suggesting but they won't even allow a full fledged discussion\nOf what we're seeing from the far left because if you use words who's dictionary definitions would be would indicate that they are great words to use to describe this phenomenon a that they'll just cut you off mid sentence\nWell and and the reality there is that we're supposed to what you said at the very beginning everybody's speech assembly redress of grievance religious beliefs all of the elements of the first among people

joined by chemicals ... a Buddhist terrific\nWork in the area we got voting issues of course we have to get to but let me just wrap up on a Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton you know I Want to go back to when George Bush ran against Pat Buchanan in a primary\nAnd Pat Buchanan said some things that the left wing got all lather up about because they thought\nThings he said might conjure up people from the far right wacko radicals who would go out and take people out uh who were on the left\nAnd they were very upset about that well now you have both the the former attorney general again the number one law enforcement official in the country\nAnd the former president's candidate of the Democratic party she was secretary of state she was first lady she was first lady of Arkansas\nShe's an attorney and she says no civility until unless we win now if they don't win and you have these two people of hide Democrat stature\nWhat what's the message to the common folk on the left wing side so they have them be justified and carrying out even increased violence if that's the case\nWell of course Mike with Eric Holder or ... with the attorney general of the United states you're also talking about the chief civil rights\nOfficer of the U.S government there's a whole civil rights to fish in the in the department of justice with over seven hundred attorneys in it there's only like\nA political appointees or whatnot seven hundred career attorneys who are exclusively tasked with protecting the civil rights of Americans\nAnd so to help someone in that position of all positions sane when someone's doubt you kick up\nI mean that kind of violent imagery is ironically a court task of the department that he led\nSuch that billions of dollars are put into staffing and programs to ensure that that sort of civil rights violation does not occur in this country so the hypocrisy here is absolutely it is astounding I'm trying to use a word stronger than shameful\nBecause the idea is that someone on such an elevated part I mean we think of\nThe attorney general like with Hillary Clinton secretary of state we think attorney general secretary of state secretary of the treasury secretary of defense I mean those are the big four staged apartments in the U.S government that we think of as these towering figures\nThat they are subordinate to the president white up there as as the four most leaders of this nation and they're supposed to have\nAn agenda and two in body of vision that transcends politics and that is non partisan and that is something that the entire nation can rally behind and I got to tell you Hillary really blew it there I mean if if there was one posting government you should have where you should be able to get a majority of Americans to rally to your side\nIf something like being secretary of state\nOr in the case of Eric Holder like being an attorney general yet not only is that not is that kind of ... what is\nNot considered a disc qualifier these days in the modern Democratic Party\nThey're doing it 'cause they think it gives them a competitive wake up it's going to help you get the nomination to be the president of the United states if you talk about kicking people when they're down I I just think it's it's it's like Lindsey Graham said during the capital confirmation hearings\nHe says I Hope you never get power begets might go to this is this what we have to look for to\nWell you know look ... can with all due respect to that point it's worse than that uh how 'bout despicable reprehensible as two words but yeah um but but the point is this in the hypothetical supposing somebody's literally takes what was said\nAnd goes to um\nI don't want to use the name because somebody might take it from listening to this radio show but goes to a prominent Republicans home\nPerson comes out of their car and their driveway uh some of the administration uh walks or or or\nGo to a restaurant or what our let's make it but it's about how someone without a security detail yeah let's make Mitch McConnell\nAnd he ... I had I think security with them but it you know they're not standing on top of him he's ... he and his wife for having dinner in a restaurant by the way it wasn't a fancy restaurant was a nice restaurant but the you know he wasn't a above it all so to speak he was at a place where many people go so then they're walking out and then a guy comes along and trips them\nAnd then he uses his boot smashes is on ah the majority leader's knee\nAnd then maybe he can't walk a health belief for the rest of his life he has a limb now and then he says Well Eric holder said do what he was the attorney general\nWhat's your response to that sir\nWell I'll tell you I I think that it's it's the kind of it's like I mean to put this in the real\nBig I mean I'm just want to say that could happen that some wacko mind would take the attorney General Eric holder literally\n... and it's been happening for for not just centuries but but even even millennia I mean St ... uh in his in his famous book you perhaps the most famous Christian theologians from the first millennium of Christianity in city of God a guest and noted that\nThat ... the pagan would look\nTo their Roman gods they would see how Jupiter orange juice was his name and the great system how he would go cheat on his wife he was a serial adult truck and uh and and they said\nIf we set up these men told federal rate the gods and the gods engage in such conduct camp they look to them and said look if that might have to set the might be Jupiter does this man that then then then how bad can it be if I'm doing it now is so ... and making the point that two thousand years later\nPolitics works the same way if we take people that we put on the exalted pedestals and they embody a certain type of behavior\nAnd then they say in that they essentially established themselves as the as as the moral norm as the ethical standard", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "23"}
