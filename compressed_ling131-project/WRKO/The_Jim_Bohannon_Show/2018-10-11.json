out loud anarchy\nNot acceptance of the reality\nAnd you even have the department of justice and the FBI leadership\nTrying to undermine this president\nWhere this country is going and then all the years that I've been watching politics\nIn this country I've never seen it like this ever\nThis is a level of the base in the system by the Democrats\nThat we've never seen before\nYou hear about in the nineteenth century and the Congress where a on occasion there'd be fisticuffs between two legislators\nYou'd have a strong disagreement see ... you would hear about these things\nWhen you wouldn't see is a complete\nRejection of the system\nHillary Clinton was the one who said\nDuring the debates that everyone should accept the results of the election you remember that\nWas perceived to be the loser and they distribute he should accept the results\nBut when it became inconvenient for Hillary\nWhen she lost the election herself she couldn't live up to her own standard that she had said she said the standard\nExcept they lost when it happens\nExcept the results of the election she didn't accept it\nShe still to this day fighting it\nAnd if you look at the Democratic party who are the major players for the presidency\nAs presidential candidate\nKamala Harris\nWho doesn't have the qualifications to be president Rand Newark into the ground\nHas done nothing as a senator what's he ever done as a senator what's he ever accomplished as a senator\nNothing zero\nWhat does is he had passed none zero he just obstruct the way Kamala Harris just obstruct\nAnd what about Bernie Bernie put out this populist message board will pay for everything\nAnd then Jim Carey says we might as well college socialism that we support\nThe problem is the Jim Carrey doesn't know anything about socialism and what it does\nWhereas it worked it didn't work in Cuba\nPeople live in poverty in Cuba didn't work in Venezuela\nDidn't work in the Soviet Union did and that and the Soviet Union broke up because it was broke\nIt doesn't work\nLike you can say it's working in the Scandinavian countries Norway Sweden and Denmark\nBut they've had problems as well and they've had to move to more of a

work\nChina's basically running its own version\nThe capital as the economy\nWith the Chinese controlling that the economy\nOf the country's companies want to come into China so they're willing to cut deals with the Chinese government where the government takes half ownership of the company\nThat South China does business\nSo the government of China's becoming affect the capitals partner with companies coming in for most where to bring their grave the research that expertise products and services that the Chinese have not been able to do themselves and the government brilliantly takes part of the profits\nAnd yet these people continue along that path so who would in and majority numbers would vote for Kamala Harris\nOr Elizabeth Warren who despise us corporations\nWho lives and the aristocratic life even though she pretends to support the common folk\nAnd the reality is the guess what's happening is this administration that's created an enormously successful economy now today the market collapsed over eight hundred point drop what eight hundred and thirty one point drop\nIt's a major correction basically\nAnd it's just rates going up\nInvestors are getting concerned\nAnd

country is doing very well\nAnd this president is functioning now very well the tweets or fewer the serious nature of of what happened with that hurricane again today\nFortunately a hit areas that were not highly populated\nAnd the Kavanaugh hearing which the president handled for the most part brilliantly\nHe left the Senate do what does\nHe didn't try to interfere we didn't use bombastic rhetoric he didn't use a vulgar language\nHe respected the process and I think that's going to\nGo a long way towards the American people as we come up to election day realizing that the maybe as a little rough around the edges but maybe that's what he was needed for to be elected and then he leaves a Congress that will be supportive\nThat we want a wall bill we want illegal immigration stuff

I don't I don't I don't expect it getting any easier at least for a while because you can imagine the twenty twenty campaign presidential campaign a slew of Democrats are going to come out of no they're going to try to out\nA criticize the president among each other and you can imagine with with someone like my body and and make a go live with Warren Cory Booker and others like that\nIt's going to be a I'm just going to be a tough thing I I it's it's hard to know two years out I suspect it generally you want to favor incumbents um things set aside you tend to favor in combat you just from historical standpoint\nUh but that's it they'll they'll do everything they can to try to win the presidency so I expect they hit the rhetoric and the attacks even greater over the next two years\nWell the American people will do you think you know the we buy into that negative type of campaign that's been a question for many years do the American people buy into negative campaigning does it work\nYou know I think the general Sanchez negative campaigns do work up to a point when your party when you're pointing out a real criticisms of your opponent\nBut when it gets over the top as I think that this this movement over Kavanaugh was I think you find people some kind of pushing back and saying this shit is crazy and I I I Can't support that and I suspect we'll see a lot of ads from Republicans saying\nThis is this is your Democratic Party is that what you want to support\nI think that'll happen even in the next one is twenty seven days\nOh yeah yeah I think we'll be saying that the next few days as a highlight the er I ... and that's why the the people who think that uh Democrats overplay their hand on this I think that's probably right\nWell let me turn now to the substantive issues that you deal with that they used to policy innovation um let's start with NAFTA and the fact that it's no longer and existence is now the American or Canadian Mexican agreement when ...\nTaylor heads still in existence they have to uh they have to override because it was it was a law that was passed\nAnd there's been a debate as to whether or not it could be a band in without Congress but generally speaking the Congress needs to\nDo something to change it so that's what they'll be trying to do it it it still exists but in trade I mean generally speaking um there are very few terrorists between the U.S and Canada and Mexico there were some high terrifies in Canada as a\nI'm a dairy products but for the most part that still going on\nRight now but it's worth a look and see if that person can get his new here reformed and after NAFTA approved\nWell with the fact that Mexico uprooted and Canada proved that um that would seem to be no reason\nI I don't think they've actually I think the government has essentially pretty bad I don't know the fact we passed the legislature there yet\nWell uh in those countries is probably a rubber stamp on it and then the United states maybe depends on how this\nUh this election goes really cause the president's going to present at the beginning of the year but I mean I think it's on track to get there even guys like Bernie probably agree with it because he agreed with the removal of these treaties and this one is more fair to the United states was Seventy five percent of cars\nAre being built but in this in this area in this country um with the hourly wage rate a for a certain percentage of the cars being built the being up I think I actually I think it was one forty five percent of the cars or something but there's a percentage of the car that has to be built\nManufactured here not not elsewhere and then also there's a salary limit so that only in the United states would people get the jobs because they don't pay that much I'm In Mexico or for that matter even in Canada so I think it's going to benefit us a great deal to have this done now wouldn't ...\nRace from six to point five percent Seventy five percent okay forty five percent\nThat you're talking about was the content of a pickup truck conform sand and\nLight trucks and those of those have to be at forty percent of those parts and and the car had made by people making sixteen dollars an hour which Mexico initially a push back on and said no way but eventually he signed off on on this with a bit of a reduced percentage but yes\nI I think was nobody knows what the future holds but I think this is going to have the momentum to go through and if if it does what's what's your sense of this deal isn't it a lot better for the United states the NAFTA was\n[noise] I think it does sound banks ... certainly be updated on the on the um [noise] a\nTechnology transfer and intellectual property protection\nA it is it is doing that so that that was when there are some of these other things that they've changed our I think more weeks then you have\nHuge new change it and and it but there are a few things in there that are that race in my eyebrows as to whether or not that good or bad a ... if you're going to go into a major agreeing with China\nI'm the one of the other countries and in this in the U.S and see\nA agreement can drop out if one country decides to go into a major agreement with China and some other things that we don't know how that's going to play out um Canada was was pressed hard for an arbitration\nA provision in there they were able to get that President Trump press hard have more access to the dairy market he got that so uh I I think most analysts see this as", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The
