of American but I don't even think that the accurate\nThat I Love numbers by the way that to the tenth power that made ten generation\nAre right it was the one back they said six to ten generations\nRight well suited to ten hours ten twenty four so that they bought only\nWho knows I might have I'm a Native American someplace I probably not 'cause my grandparents came from Europe but I'm listening about somebody who's been there a ... since the Mayflower came over yeah um you know people in that of\nLineage or could have Native American blood going back before that uh the some well X number of generations\nThere's other another little subtle point I Want to mention and that I have a learn from ... or ... or been in that area you're in a kind of testing people that the scientific or at least\nAnd I have no way to verify them you know I mean they're in that business I guess\nIt based that bad but you know pool or the people that are tested\nA ... and I'm In North America they don't have enough Native American and that that what they do is they're they're actually I'm reaching down to a South America\nAnd using a genes\nFrom that team pulled down there but when they say someone or might have Native American they don't actually know that because they don't have enough Native American data in the sample but it could be that her one\nOne thousand twenty fourth part of her DNA is actually Colombian or parochial and fat so\nBut even even though even he can't even say it's really Native American from what I understand\nThat it would be ridiculous to try to argue that ah she claims she did not use\nOur so called minority background or because she is at that time people as you might have one eighth which wouldn't be enough\nBut she didn't use it she said a minority background or getting the job at Harvard so I'm a you know she claims that that had nothing to do with it and she's not claiming to be a Native American or what she did claim that\nAnd at least in terms of lineage but if somebody is don't just say she's one thousand one one thousand Native American and any scale anywhere does that mean anything to anybody\nI don't think so tense generation bat maybe she did it in order to do the book the power ... book that she brown participated in\nWell I suppose but I my simple point would be I had a few hours that I mean anybody can find them\nThe house and going back generations even if it's accurate um and and ... and have a beehive the ultimate audacity if they try to claim that lineage whenever that lineage maybe\nYeah you I mean I one one thousand Swedish or one one thousand or a Icelandic who knows\nMean that could be if I could be one one thousand black and I'm like I say I'm a black person I mean that's a short one one thousand would be ridiculous one month thousands Hispanic Hispanic it was\nWhen she when she was hired by the way a Harvard said that she was the first woman of color that they had a place in that kind of position\nYeah the so they go so for her to say that they didn't use it is absolutely absurd and violates the accuracy because of those statements that Harvard made us the time which I Do recollect that they implied that that was part of what made her part of the multi cultural backgrounds of Harvard or ride\nTotally outrageous well here's what the Cherokee Nation so they put out a statement of the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck ... junior\nHe set a DNA test is useless determined tribal citizenship current DNA test and not even distinguish whether a person whose ancestors were indigenous to North of South America the point you made sovereign tribal nations sent their own legal requirements for citizenship\nAnd DNA test can be used to determine lineage but as such as paternity to an individual but it is not evidence for travel affiliation using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation Romney tribal nation even vaguely isn't appropriate long so they slapped down Elizabeth Warren of the Cherokee Nation\nThat say I think she's come out of this looking much worse I think people not believing before sounded better than that because they thought maybe she was one thirty second which is the fifth generation back\nAnd and now to get this but it may actually be ten generation and then it may not even be any Native American DNA or jeans they might actually be Colombian or Peruvian or some other uh country down in Latin America\nThat makes us look like a just a game that is ridiculous so I think on balance the last ... points here in terms of people and her credibility\nIncidentally a turning switching gears a there's a report that came out that ISIS last year attempted an assassination of Donald Trump when he was um in the in manila in the Philippines and the secret service stopped that its estimation attempt\nSo wondering what he thinks ISIS is a out the window think again\nWell I think that they have a foul
