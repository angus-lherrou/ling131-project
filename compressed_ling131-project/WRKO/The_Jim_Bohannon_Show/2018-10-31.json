{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "I you know I used to think that this was something that was something that somebody was talking about for fifty sixty a hundred years from now\nBut we've said or the last twenty Thirty years acceleration of this\nAnd I think that's why my group led the charge because there is I Try to stop you TPP because it was a it was like a massive\nA plank that would've been extraordinarily difficult over come from this person for us sovereignty perspective and ultimately when we come from is the U.S constitution is\nGuiding document in this country is one of the greatest documents that were created the concepts of those rights and individual liberties would that come from God himself not from each other not granted like our from God is a is a singular concept that makes America great\nYou know they don't blind God\nYes it was to provide Sambo did opportunity because they worship government they worship power we worship in fear of God that's the difference\nWell it's an it's an important difference but you know the point you make about globalism let's face it uh it's not just them\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush talked about a new world order he'd precisely men that they would be a breakdown of sovereignty the corporations will be multi nationals that would be able to go from country to country without any interference from governments um he meant that\nAnd then not the only one I mean John Kennedy or had the first round of the gas the general agreement on tariffs and train\n'em which was basically the predecessor to the world Trade Organization\nAnd so you can go back to all of those routes and certainly I'm Bill Clinton brought the brought out on stage all the former presidents to force\nThat Congress before it became Republican in mind before this was in Ninety three Ninety four and before it became a Republican in Ninety five or to get their NAFTA past which he did\nAnd now the president's made it a better deal for America somewhat I don't understand is it's a better deal for America NAFTA or the new one us some\nCa I guess for us today on all the time doesn't\nThat doesn't that then we can go through all of them I mean but a China he's working on now and it's going to take a little longer but that will happen um chorus the Korean us agreement we have more cars going into Korea thanks to the new ... version of that deal\nI'm more cars we build the United states has a certain percentage is going to be required to be ... by people earning at least sixteen dollars an hour well obviously in Mexico that's not going to happen so it's going to happen here\nUm and and all the other stuff I mean the opening up for the call to access pipeline the excel pipeline opening up of Anwar for God's sake I mean you know talking about God I mean and all and it's God's Country up there I mean all of that\nUh and and this is a hundred other items so how can the American people even blink about this other than the left wing socialists and communists who will vote for left wing radicals like I'm Cory Booker and people like that although he's not running this time what ... to me there's no choice\nWe've had a fabulous two years there\nAnd and that's what it can be so interesting about this election because um I personally believe that came here as I told you that uh that the Republicans are going to do well not because of the Republicans but because of Donald Trump ... sack of late because the Democrat show you they were they scare the hell out of everybody but the\n... where you get down to it you know\n... is not nobody is going to go off it's not just doesn't do politics for a living here doesn't think live and breathe that every single day of their life\nLike I Do like you do for your talk show you have to be totally immersed in it capable are not totally immersed it are going to say do I really need the trouble is going around wearing a log had really so\nAnd what he calls me on the phone and says she at one of your opinion on stuff am I going to tell them the truth\nThe fact is you're not white by trouble you know you're just trying to make a living you don't want to get in trouble you wanna go to war makes your money take care of your kids take care of family yeah go on vacation and have a good life that's what she wants and so why would you write why would you risk that by going up sticking your neck out\nI think you're going to go and you're gonna\nYou're gonna go get a vote because that's the one time it matters it doesn't matter what you tell somebody with a phone to do it for your vote and the fact that early voting for this election has been overwhelmingly\nSupportive of Republicans um is a is confounding all the all the smart people who sit there and say you know the Democrats are supposed to win\nBut tells me\nThat they are there there's a ... group of people out there saying I'm not talking about politics I'm just going to vote my interests and they're going to vote for ... for America being great they're going to vote for somebody to stand up for Americans not going to let these boys on the left pushed around\n[noise] so that's what I see it happening and or I might have had it confirmed but people are walking precincts around the country\nBut you know we'll see what happens for sex but it's a a ...\nYou know it it comes down to a determination by the American people you know who's going to be in charge or they're going to be in charge or they get these crazies who run around and then we saw in the cabin I hearing them did church they may wants them to be in charge of it gets lost touch with reality\nYou know by the way a justice Kevin uh when one of those fundraising websites are was six hundred thousand dollars believe it or not of course he's not accepting it\nIt's going to a charity or some other place he won't take the money but nobody in the course call is not going to broadcast that that is not taking the money you know but if it were rock bottom and they'd be all over it um but you're right I think you know and that there's a couple of things going on here with the polling number one\nThere are people who simply don't want to put themselves out there as voting for a Republicans because now Republicans have been put together when Donald Trump by the left\nAs all bad guys and women so therefore they want to just be quiet you send it right on point that they're not going to get involved and then there were others who I've talked to who say they intentionally said they're voting for the Democrat in order to screw up the pole\nSo um that that was one of our number because some of these races are close and that's gonna advantage the Republicans in those races where it's really close\nBecause the polls in those races are going to be skewed incorrectly because there were people who would simply not going to say and there were people who are gonna be misleading and that's typically going to be the Republicans who don't want to get harassed by the pollsters what about that we have forty seconds\nWiring per se correct or people\nThat polling is a messed up for two reasons number one people don't tell them the church and number two is almost impossible to get straight call sample take as people don't answer landlines and now they're having to go homeless all mobile mobile or on line and those are days I don't know how to how to do those samples\nSo its face a pulley practically has a problem for and the practical problems that we can tell the truth and asked why don't trust the polls go out and vote and when\nWhen the Republicans what what's your website real quick\nGet liberty dot org get liberty or give you can follow us on Twitter

she is a Republican and she is in the commonwealth of\nPennsylvania a state that um well not Arlen Specter a but it also had Wilson Goode and people who are on the far left and are typically Henri Bendel when that crowd so it's kind of a tough place to be if you're a conservative I guess but be that as it may\nUm as far as I just wanted to make a couple of points one is um I agree with you about people on the right who are anti Semitic or even a neo Nazi um what was I was in a New York studio when I was hosting the show a nightly show in New York\nOr Daily Show and I sat across the table from from um the head of the N. double ACP\nI'm an excuse me the is the end to the end the whole a WPN also uh uh the imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke um and he made no bones about what he thought about me as a Jew\nAnd ironically the end of the one hour interview we asked me to walk 'em downstairs to the corner in New York in midtown Manhattan\nOut of fear that he might get accosted by somebody want to be there to protect them after chastising me and the Jews and blacks and everybody else for an hour a return butler\nHad ovarian nations I interviewed him a dozen times and every time I asked them first question where would I be if you were president just about what he would tell me I'd be in Jerusalem because I didn't belong here because I'm Jewish so I've I've seen that on the right\nOr that radical right uh I guess they call the all right\nWhatever it may be but it's sick and then it's bigoted and it's disgusting but my point wasn't about\nLeft or right per se\nBecause you're absolutely correct and I just give you two examples of people I interviewed him from the right the but my point was the media yawn when Bernie Sanders hangs around with Linda source or a venomous bigot a gun anti Semitic and anti Israel person to once Israel destroyed\nThe the the mainstream media yawn when George Soros funds left wing or Democrats and Hillary Clinton's right there with him as the guy who\nWho has not see it in\nThe in a in a A N and funds all these violent groups today um is that and then we mentioned Farrakhan uh and so you can go on from there but my only point is that the politicians or public figures on the left who do have in fact\nA basis for being described as anti Semitic bigots of the highest or lowest order is the case may be\nThat they get a pass and the president has you eloquently described is nothing of the kind of gets pounded for it\nWas listening this beyond belief\nAbsolutely agree with you I Know you're absolutely correct and\n... and at that point it is very true that there's a double standard in the way that I'm liberal progressive Democrats or whatever you want to call them today it's sort of all male gather ahead because there used to be a great all Democrats I was a Democrat for many years um\nIf I Would either way\nI I I'm Nineteen Seventy nine when I turned Eighteen I registered Democrat um my family had been Democrats blue collar up sort of like Bob casey lawyer type Democrats and I have to remember him are farmers\nSo like governor of Pennsylvania and I realize that you can't be pro life any longer you can't be a social conservative any longer and be a Democrat so I was pushed out of the party but um you know there used to be some great deal\nBack then Daniel Patrick Moynihan kind of a even Harry Truman type Democrat um but today it's\nAll the time Kennedy John John Kennedy would be concerned today\nI absolutely and the old a Teddy Kennedy when he was first starting out he\nWas one of the fiercest defenders of the unborn life until he decided oh this is going to help me I have to you know I I Want a groove with the the cold guys and I want to get re elected because he came pro choice [laughter] but um but you know the Democratic party today has no place\nFor non extremist and that's unfortunate and it's funny how the geo peak it had actor tarred as the alt right or the extreme party when in point of fact\nThe Democrats are they have a very very narrow and had a and I still do longer fit into that but um you're absolutely right about that one gathered in a way that Democrats are or liberals are treated when they do\nA sort of like rub shoulders and uh and fatter nights with\nVery clear anti Semite to mainland us our store I was disgusted when I saw that on the the\nThe yeah the the founder or the movers and shakers behind\nThe women's march which is another reason\nWhy Irish use those heater identify with any movement that is called a ... or the feminist movement because the people who speak the loudest and the people who see the one who are\nGetting out there with a bullhorn like that uh we were talking about that at least during pastor\nEarlier in Pittsburgh people going out there making ...\nThey don't represent the vast majority rank and file of of the women out there who don't have Matt\n... don't hate Donald Trump clearly do are not necessarily uh uh what is it reflects badly knee jerk are in favor of abortion rights too can be social conservatives who are who are who do have educated\nOpinion is on a lot of things um but he doesn't believe ... drowned out by the so called of all\nThe grasses and ... and so I reject any label I I I refuse to call myself a feminist first of all I never had it when I was a Democrat I you know even the whole thing of evidence for life there's\nA lot of women who call themselves pro life feminist that you can't be a feminist and be pro life evidence or not allowed to stay they view are they support the um the rights of the unborn child so\nI it it you know all of this labeling and all of this enabling a and it's sort of like\nGiving a lot of the um\n[noise] I I Can't even think of the word I'm looking for basically allowing the last to do things and to trend grass and to say things that you would never ever", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city":
