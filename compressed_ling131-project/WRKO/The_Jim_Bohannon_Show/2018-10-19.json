Chinese products now that you know kind of like a unintended benefit of these trade deals\nOr you know but we make more good quality manufacturing or you know American manufactured products here but the terrorists are just designed to get the Chinese back to tell because they weren't\nBudging under previous administrations but right now what these terrorists have done to China's disproportionately affect them\nSo that if they tried it you know cold out or they're going to try to keep the staring contest this game of chicken\nAnd and this and they used a twenty five percent 'cause right now we're ... we're at ten percent terrorists um if we go up to twenty five percent come January one in China hasn't hasn't budge their economy is going to take a much much much much more significant hit\nAny kind of consumer a feeling that will have here because we've got that were confidence all time highest I've got great purchasing power here ah you know the economy's doing so well where whereas China is not doing as well um that this is really the long game that President Trump is playing and he's really ...\nYeah and the um ... basically what is doing is putting the pressure on them and it's creating a free and open marketplace because of the Chinese which is is going to cost twenty five percent more in January the costs now and all of a sudden\nHere comes I I don't know let's let's say Sweden would this would this twenty five percent less or we're going to buy the Swedish winter yeah and that's going to do yeah or the you know\nGoing to an ally that not stealing stuff\nWell exactly so uh so I Do you think that at some point China will fall in line because of the pressure from all the other deals the president will have made with other countries\nWell that's exactly what the credit and strategy is it's it's too it's to shore up first of all of the existing agreements like we just saw with NAFTA you know we've got the U. S. MCAA deal now a shoring those up revising those make sure that they that they work better for United States is going to turn his gaze towards the European Union\nJapan uh and of course the u._k. oh we're going to get those deals done and then ... is going to actually be\nPaying you know put a corner\nBecause they're reorient with President Trump is doing is United States companies now and companies all around the world are reorient their supply chain away from China\nAnd really toward North America you know this is why companies are all bring manufacturing plants here it got more manufacturing jobs here you've got all the time you know I think ah you know aren't jobs they're open than there are people to fill them in the United states\nAnd so the geopolitical you you think about\nAll the money that used to flow toward China no longer flowing toward China it puts a herd of their economy\nWell you know the ... that's one thing the other thing you I I thought of Iran where he put the sanctions back on and now the European companies have had to make a decision between the United states and Iran will\nUh that it's not even a choice yeah they're going to stick with us because if they did business with Iran or they lose our business so obviously runs losing that business\nAnd um and then then the European governments complain about it I don't get that because um you know we're we're we're accomplishing greatly economic uh the pressure on Iran which we should be should be overthrowing the government from the people within the country and there are movements to do that\nAnd then the other part of that is that um we're benefiting and these other companies coming to us being told you can't do business for both so ... this is working to a positive effect bulls geo politically and economically\nYeah no that's the beauty of being in a position of strength and and that's why it's so important and that's that's\nA perfect perfect example of why these pro growth pro business pro America policies that President Trump on them and they do the deregulation the tax cuts you know corporate and individual tax cuts\nAnd jobs to act right you've got the opportunity is done that stimulates investment in some of the more it popped parts of the nation talking about revitalizing America\nBut not just you know your your suburbs he's talking about revitalizing all of America\nUh you know your urban environments in a rural environments that put us at ... huge position of strength when we're renegotiating these these deals and were able to put these economic sanctions on countries like Iran\nWhere by your you know the European can you know a good friend of mine record down as the ambassador to Germany you know he's he's carry that message to a lot of these German companies said listen if you're doing business with Iran\nA you know you can expect a very serious response from the United states to choose between you know freedom of the United states and you know someone who respects human rights or Iran you know a frequent state\nSponsor of terror ah someone who use people kill people on a human rights violators\nUh and and that only change the shame of the Europeans but the economic sanctions or you know hurt the Iranian people out of the people with the government it puts them in a bind it literally suffocate and it crippled their entire economy\nI'll tell you what I noticed about the policy they've been a ... I Know that regime change is not the goal but we want behavior change you know we want them to cut off their their funding of a terrorist organization want to start acting like a like an adult and uh playing by the rules\nAre and so these tools these weapons that President Trump is effectively employed uh you know being this\nReal genius you know you only have this kind of mentality but frankly I I think it was respect when it comes to the private sector where you have to\nYou know you have to survive otherwise go bankrupt you know it uh you know he's taken this mentality into the oval office you know we're going to change the way that we interact with our trading allies with art fence allies and we're going to make sure we put the American people first about that he's done\nNow there's no question about that we're wrapping up got about a minute do you think uh this there was talk and I was the president loves would a ambassador granola was doing in Germany but do you think that would the some of the talk that he might wind up as UN ambassador\nWell I'll tell you I Know that uh you know he's been family favorite uh yeah we all we all love Rick and you know he's just a just a\nHeck of a guy I Know that it was a long time you know spokesperson it ran with Ambassador Bolton for some time you know now is national security advisor\nOr and so I think the president likes a president likes Rick uh it really does um but it's very likely that um you know there's a short list that uh you know you want to bring another star and somewhere but you know will be a UN ambassador someday I I I expected at some point you will\nWell that'd be a lot of fun to see 'em there is a as you said you know I'm I don't but I think he's a terrific a spokesperson what has been doing commentary on on the on the\nNews channels he there was a great job it's a pleasure are crisscrossing thank you very much for continued growth of this economy under the leadership of your ex boss secretary Ross then of course the president and a great to have you with us thanks for your time yeah my ... year takes to make it appear thank you Chris Christie a\nFormer deputy director of the Commerce Department\nAnd the other sector Wilbur Ross and we appreciate his time in this country is moving forward let's stay Republican folks and I\nWas ... much talk about down home values made in the usa blue jeans you wore as a kid I remember\nThere's ways now\nWait a minute\n\nHere and to you know the way they\nVoted down and cry\nNeeded\nThem any good\nNoodle version comfort dime a dozen genes every stitch guaranteed in order to vendor motorcycle drink unstable or reinforced see them a G.

with somebody who has a superior background and the analyzing this as if the factual\nInformation about the show me that is very troubling than most people have not known about and most of the media are not even talking about\nAs part of the backdrop of all of this now and make 'em out later but I'm at the bottom line is that we have to make a decision over the next few days the report is that an intel officer\nI think his name as Iraq Iran or something like that um is going to be given the blame for this but he did it and that's that hill and then ... you know I I'm not saying he did it I'm saying that's what they're going to he's the fall guy basically um so\nUh so what do we do um uh you know we've got we've got ... there's a complicated situation because Saudi Arabia is now getting along with Israel\nAnd a lot of the other uh Arab countries mostly Sunni yeah you got Egypt you got Jordan they've got the Gulf states\nAnd Saudi Arabia is right in the middle of that they've been meeting with Israel secret leave for a very long time now year or two so what's your sense of how this plays out because it's such a sensitive situation\nRight and we have to understand them again that it'd be\nOur relationship with Saudi Arabia is not based on shared values the way our relationship with Israel is where we look and Israeli nation where we think oh they're like oh gosh they believe in democracy pretty crash\nCapitalism you know the type of values that we have a Saudi Arabian intelligence and that's primarily military and it's been oil so\nTo put in that\nIn line we have to understand Saudi Arabia accounts for about Eighteen percent to us or an arms sales nine billions more more so frankly we're going to still need to be working with them when we go as we go forward we\nImport uh about eight hundred thousand barrels a day of Saudi crude oil um which is about half as what it was a decade ago but this is one point because we know the November or deadline when sanctions on Iran's oil comeback\nUh online we've asked Saudi Arabia to post production and they've agreed to it she got so oil markets remain stable these are all things we don't want to see upset\nThat going forward but I think we're likely going to say is\nTrump adopting what the bipartisan movement in Congress there's right now which is to er into as part of the global Magnitsky\nA human rights sanctions which was originally created a to deal with a Russia's violation button in which case we would end up putting sanctions\nOn a few individuals within the royal family they would have to be strong enough and ah they have to be put on people who are high enough in the family that they would send a signal and it would matter that way what we're doing is still tied it\nCan be a human rights but not tied to\nEverything else that would end up deeply harming our relationship and our frankly American interests at this point when it comes to dealing with the wrong in this region um\nThat's what I that's kind of what I see happening and in the meantime these\nDays right now are designed to come up with the fall guy or ... or ... maybe it was of course order and by the crown prince ... so who knows it's just a ... ...\nSo you know one of those reasons that didn't make one believe maybe the guy was an intelligence south of Saudi Arabia or the U.S probably destroyed the Saudis because it ... it makes little sense or Saudi Arabia\n... kill this guy on your enemies soda which is the shake\nTurkey and Saudi Arabia to not get along at all so it's just a weird\nPlace it can do this type of operation if they were meaning to kill him to be anyway\nBut yeah and you know and that's the other part of it Mr and since it\nIs and it's it's it's I'm really not much has been released to this point uh I'm not even sure the president has much more about this maybe palm pilot got more but you're right Turkey's another element of this because it was it was that the Saudi embassy in Turkey that this took place\nAnd of course that sovereign territory of Saudi Arabia so they have a right I guess to do what they want to do but it was in Turkey and there are no one gave it a president or the audio and that's why the president's now saying that it appears that he was killed\nA but then the but I I Want to focus on the complication if Saudi Arabia is it in one way or another working with Israel on a peace plan\nAnd a questionnaire and David Friedman the ambassador to Israel for the Trump Administration are putting together a group of Arab countries to come up with a peace plan that they presented the Palestinians say look\nYou but you better take this deal because nobody's with you anymore and the Arab countries of walking away\nFrom you if that were to happen\nA Saudi Arabia is a huge part of that and then of course there's the issue of Saudi Arabia versus Iran Saudi Arabia is fighting Iran in Yemen\nAnd um I don't know who these there and so a sigh of Saudi Arabia is playing an important role to to be to neutralize and affect Iran to some degree\nA and there are other factors in that part of the world regarding Saudi Arabia so we we can Ben Rhodes earlier in the day he said uh that the president's being too kind to them and that we should walk away as you pointed out earlier\nAnd what does he I'm saying what is he talking about I'm looking at TV screen are you nuts\nI mean we can't do that we can't just walk away there's there's huge complications involved here for open the stability and peace in the middle east isn't there at\nRight at the end what they want playing and it simply Ben Rhodes and the team Obama people have been so vocal and the media is just repeating ad nauseam all that garbage they're talking about what they wanted us to dump their relationship with Saudi Arabia and can go back to Iran\nTo you know get back into the deal\nThat was a disaster that they made it it\nIt's I mean ... obviously not going to happen at all but ... says", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Boston", "day": "19"}
