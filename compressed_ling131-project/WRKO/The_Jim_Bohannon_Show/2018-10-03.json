{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "When in fact the second amendment is very clear but it turns out\nA critic of Donald Trump\nBloomberg is now donating twenty million dollars\nTo help democratic candidates running for the U.S Senate\nWhy the Republicans think that the Democrats are a threat to taking majority control of the Senate is not clear to me because as I said earlier in the last segment\nThere were twenty five Democrats seats that are up in the Senate and only nine Republican seats that are up to the math that's nearly three to one which means by nearly three to one Democrats are in elections where they could lose\nFor every three Democrats for every one Republican so I don't know what the real problem is\nBut the twenty million is going to the Senate majority pac of the Democrats\nBloomberg also pledged ... million to Democratic House candidates this year eighty million for them twenty million for the Senate there's a hundred million dollars is given to Democrats as a former Republican\nHe became an independent after leaving the Republican Party and now of course he's donating this money I in large measure in my view because he's thinking about running for president in twenty twenty\nBy the way the amount of a hundred million dollars in the in the house and Senate races that he's pumped into these races is more than in prior races\nHe's paves giving money to liberal causes especially as I mentioned the pro gun restriction crowd\nThe Democrats need twenty three seats in the house to get the majority\nThat's a substantial number\nAnd uh they they need to get twenty three if they're going to take control we'll see if that happens\nIt is true though that there are some tight races for Republicans\nWe know about the Senate race in Texas Senator Ted Cruz in a dead heat where the Democrat Beto O'Rourke who said some nasty things about women by the way the scandal broke today so that might hurt him a lot there was a case of a Republican candidate for governor years ago and in Texas against Ann Richards\nAnd when they were debating at one point or on the same plot podium same stage in one of the campaign events he came up on the stage she went over to shake his hand and he refused to shake her hand\nHe lost the election and many argue that was that symbolic gesture of refusing to shake enriches hand the cost and the election because Texans are very protective\nOf treating women and they gentlemanly fashion and even if you disagree shaking hands as not supporting the other person's view that simply being courteous so many Texans arguably\nOpposed\nThat candidate because he wouldn't shake her hand that's I say that because this democratic candidate now has been out and today we're seeing some very nasty things about women\nBut that's that's been up to now a tight race we'll see how it goes Marsha Blackburn a member of the U.S house in Tennessee\nHas trailed in most polls behind Phil Bredesen who is a former governor of Tennessee\nAnd now they're dead he they're dead even she's been trailing but now they're dead even I think if the president goes back to ... Tennessee maybe two more times before the election or at least once he might give her that edge that she needs\nThat Bloomberg is giving the money to the twenty million for the Senate is controlled by people who are\nColleagues of Chuck Schumer the minority leader\nChuck Schumer of course has become radicalized because the left is pushing all these Democrats for this radicalizing on the left side of the aisle\nThe thing about the tax is that they can spend unlimited amounts of money on elections but can't coordinate with candidates so yeah they can spend all they want\nAnd raise all they want what they can only do that in parallel with candidates they can't ever talk to the candidates there been cases that I'm familiar with that went to court because of the Kennedy spoke with one of these packs\nAnd not that anything even happened from the conversations but you can't even talk to the pack\nAs a candidate you got to keep your your arms length distance from them that's the rule but the benefit for the pack is if you follow the rules is that you can spend unlimited amounts of money\nOn your agenda and nobody's going to stop you from doing that\nSo we'll see how uh how all this plays out but Bloomberg is out there betraying the party that he was once a part of and unfortunately betrayed uh\nRudy Giuliani who's endorsed them and frankly Bloomberg would have lost that election without Giuliani's endorsement for mayor of New York in two thousand one and that was that\nMany time and I want to repeat this so we all understand\nWhat's happening with the FBI investigation and what's going to happen in the Senate is that Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader said that every senator gets a copy of the FBI report on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee judge Kavanaugh\nThere'll be a report of there'll be a vote in the full Senate this week and\nMcConnell what's more to say with certainty\nThey'll get the FBI report this week and they will be a report this week those two facts according to Mitch McConnell\nOnly senators can look at it as I said earlier\nAnd McConnell said he's going to fight any Democrat tempted attempts to delay so\nHe's going to get it done and luckily as majority leader he has the power to do that um there were some questions myself included as to whether Mitch McConnell\nWould go to that extreme\nTo just simply uses full power when the Democrats tried to delay and of course they will as to whether or not he would overrule the Democrats trying to stop the boat\nAnd the answer is that he will that's what he says at least\n[noise] so we'll see how that of transpires [noise] well that's good news that the federal Connell his very focused he's ...\nHe's given a couple of speeches and the last two days on the floor of the Senate is talking about the Democrat reprehensible strategy and the good land judge Kavanaugh who's at a stellar records impeccable records\nAnd that he events that have the vote on the floor this week that'll be good news and he will win or if he gets ... stay with us\nThanks for listening this is George ... from coast to coast I Am in history channels and ... we are proud of promote amazing energy nutrition and skin care products from Jeanette ... passionate\nAbout redefining you through revolutionary products visit gee see in life dot com for\nProducts like luminous from Dr Nathan Newman the luminous anti aging skin Caroline restores youthful\nBy Taliban radius to your skin reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles which stem cell technology\nThere's also instantly ageless\nWhich works within two minutes reducing under our bags fine wines wrinkles in porch noble nominated doctor Vincent Jim ... medical advisor has designed several product's helping the body perform better through naturally occurring plant compounds joined us products of a thirty day money back guarantee they're available was up to twenty five percent preferred\nPrice discount see all of the amazing genetic product said gee C.

John fires up a crowd in South haven Mississippi and takes aim at\nBy this administration\n\nPeople in this country should be outraged at the platform of the Democrats and I don't even know what the platform is accept defeat Trump beat up Trump impeach Trump seems like that's what their entire Montrose is on the Democratic side\nAnd Donald Trump junior made that point they've got nothing to offer\n\nAnd so as much energy is there is on the Democratic side there's got to be that energy on the Republican side the worst case scenario folks as as I said I got a repeat it if the Democrats regain the house and Nancy Pelosi become speaker\nForget it\nNow the Republicans have a forty two seat advantage that could go away if people in the republic\nInside and also the independence I do not see the way clear to voting for Republicans that could all go away\n\nAs Donald Trump junior said think about giving the house Nancy Pelosi\nIt would be a disaster for this country he said\nThe answer for Donald Trump junior is we've got to turn out\nAnd we've got to bring our friends along with us and really there's no longer any excuse people who say well not a political activist I support the president but I'm not a political activist deal to answer that is yeah but you have friends you have relatives you have neighbors you have loved ones you can put up a sign on your yard\nYou could volunteer to make phone calls\nBut the simplest thing for everyone is emailing everybody you know send out a mass email to all of your email list about voting for the president's choices voting for Republicans in the house and Republicans in the Senate it's very\nSimple and it needs to be done\nI remember back in Nineteen Ninety four that happened we were doing I was hosting a program in Seattle and in that year Tom Foley was the speaker of the house from Spokane, Washington\nAnd a guy named George Nethercutt a newcomer ran against them\nAnd we mobilized even though I was in Seattle which is across the mountains from Spokane we mobilize the whole lot of people and not only for another cut but for other Republican candidates because Ninety four was a very powerful year\nIn the vote in November of Ninety four for Republicans across the country and in the state of Washington and it turned out that we had eight out of nine house seats controlled by Democrats going into that election\nAs a result of the grassroots people I mean we have people from Seattle driving four and five hours to Spokane to stay over there for days at a time knocking on doors for this fellow George Nethercutt\nTo go after the most powerful member of the house Tom Foley he was speaker no speaker never been voted out before\nI remember the speaker of the house is number three on the list to become president if anything happened to the president and vice president next person the speaker of the house to become president so it's a highly powerful position\nAnd you just don't lose\nWell it turns out that George Nethercutt created history and one\nAnd as I said seven to nine congressional seats to Republicans that year who would have thought in fact Newt Gingrich came out and did an interview on my show when he was in Seattle because he was thrilled about what happened in Washington state which has been and still is a very liberal state but it turned in that year\nAnd my message now would be very simple we've had a lot of success during the past year plus under Donald Trump year and a half whatever you're an eight months and to lose that\nWould be devastating\nIt'd be like being out on a desert finding a canteen of water to punch your first and then not finding any more water and your life becomes passe because you couldn't find any more water\nIn other words you're getting a taste of the good life and then is taken away from you that's what would happen if the Democrats were to win the house or the Senate or both\nAnd it can be done by people who were understand the value of this administration and Donald Trump's policies\nTo the American people [noise] by getting out [noise] not voting but also [noise] getting out there and helping other people understand the power of keeping the house and Senate in Republican hands [noise]\nIs your price of investment spending some time doing that no money just time [noise]\nAnd helping Republicans in your state and district

Boston my heart radio station [noise]\nWe aren't good to be in that Mike Segal with you as we\nKeep the conversation going there's plenty to\nTalk about [noise] seems like the news cycle never ends changes every twenty minutes\nAnd that is a very powerful\nIn terms of the way in which the Democrats have demeaned denigrated um destroyed insulted and derogatory misused our political system\nBy going into the gutter politics\nOf the\nKinds of personal destruction\nThe politics of personal destruction that's what they do and you know ironically it was Richard Gephardt who was the house minority leader for the Democrats back in the nineties when Newt Gingrich was a speaker\nVersion that part was the ... already leader and he was a you could say it was a liberal Democrat but he was reasonable he actually was against NAFTA and the same way the president is\nBecause of what it did to the American worker and he represented\nA whole lot of people working in factories and blue collar workers in St Louis\nAnd so it was ironic\nThat he wound up\nReally in many ways supporting what word than Reagan Democrats early on and they'll become Trump Democrats who switched to Republicans because Democrats left them or get parts stayed with him\nAnd he was one who said there was a Republican who was going to become speaker of the house from the south forget his name but he was somebody that wound up being a\nScandal but he had an affair and those days in the nineties I guess having an affair was a big deal except the fewer Bill Clinton and you could get away with the rape of Juanita Broderick and nobody hold you accountable\nBut others were held accountable if you if you were a Republican and this Republican from the south was going to become speaker\nWound up resigning\nBecause the Democrats ousted him for having had an affair of course if every member of Congress were outed because they had an affair and then have to had to leave Congress because of it you wouldn't have anybody left on either side\nAnd so at that point that part said we've got to stop this politics the personal destruction meaning that the answer for some was to go after the opponent personally find the scandal and go after that opponent\nInstead of\nDealing with the issues on the basis of the members of the issues have you can't be somebody on the issues than the answer is beat them personally knock 'em out completely and so that's what we got two in those days\nWell the president without referring to that period of time\nWhen he stopped a before getting on the marine one helicopter today\nTook some questions on the lawn at the White House from reporters and he was asked about the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh the president made an important point he said it's a scary time\nBut he said it was scary primarily for young men\nHe said men are now guilty until proven innocent which is the opposite of the tradition and history of this country\nIn totalitarian dictatorships yes you're guilty until proven innocent no question however\nWe have never believed that we've never behave that way and that's what the president met\nPresident said it's very scary situation when you're guilty until proven innocent you said it's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something you may not be guilty of\nMeaning simply that you can be alleged to have committed an act\nAnd that either makes you criminal or scandal lives as you the means your integrity the major character\nEven though there's no proof of just an allegation\nAnd although the president said it would not have to be a woman it could be anybody\nAlleging you did something wrong but pretty much it's about women having the power now and I am ... women need to listen to the horrific way in which we had this Hollywood and I'm political\nAnd um\nMedia scandal and you know the names Matt Lauer NBC Charlie Rose at CBS and PBS YOU had Harvey Weinstein in the film industry Kevin Spacey the actor\nTom Brokaw alleged to have grow up to a woman she said he did it she was very specific about what she said happened\nAnd the list goes on and on and on Les Moonves the most powerful guy in the media perhaps is God his professional life is over his reputation as God he may have great wealth\nBut as as a reputation\nAs an individual in terms of status he's diminished completely and so all the others I mentioned they're nowhere to be found anymore in the proper for them to stay quiet and silent and hidden\nBut that doesn't mean that you go forward with other cases and then it automatically means the person's telling the truth each case needs to be taken on its own merit or lack of merit and the cases I just mentioned clearly the women were abused", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "03"}
