Obamas and others\nHe used in the in the speech tonight if you've heard of these measured remarks to begin with\nThe public figures have a duty to tone down their rhetoric\nWe saw the opposition Democrats accused him of condoning violence and dividing Americans\nHe went on to say\nIn his speech tonight\nNo one should carelessly compare political opponents\nTo historical villains\nWhich has done all the time\nHe said we should not mind people in public places or destroyed public property\nThere is one way to settle our disagreements is called peacefully at the ballot box\nThe president said as part of a larger national effort to bridge or divides and bring people together the media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone\nAnd stop the endless hostility in constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories\nTo do it they've got to stop and quote those are the words of the president\nFortunately at least in this case\nOne of the reports that came out\nFrom a news wire service\nDidn't make the comment\nThat the CNN\nIs known for its robust coverage of the Trump Administration and for constantly provoking the eye or of the president\nSo at least that there were lounging that\nJeff Zucker the president of CNN\nSaid there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media\nHe said words matter but as far they've shown no comprehension of that ... year people were words matter how about the fact that nobody at CNN\nThat I have seen or heard reporting by anyone\nHas ever seen\nAt CNN Wolf Blitzer\nWith Morning Joe and his fiance and all the people there one has there ever any thing positively acknowledged about this president that doesn't happen\nAnd when Eric Holder the attorney general said when Republicans are down kick them\nThat's pretty violent thing to do when somebody's down on the ground and kick 'em holder or is that what you do\nMaybe you need to be shown how to be kicked holder\nIt is absolutely ludicrous\nBut these left wing media\nRefused to be fair\nRefused to weigh knowledge\nTwo sides of an issue\nNinety One or Ninety three percent somewhere in that range of CNN stories are negative about the president\nSomething like eighty eight percent of the New York times the numbers are way up there for all of those left wing radical media\nLast week for example\nAnd association\nRepresenting the White House correspondents\nCame out and accused the president of cheerleading violence against the media\nAnd at that time the president apply to an assault by a congressman on a reporter\nWell that's not the most advisable thing to do even and fun\nBasically the president was doing it sarcastically\nI think most people want to get that he wouldn't actually\nJustify physical armed or Puerto by a politician\nAnd then they make the claim that\nBecause he said it\nEven though he says it ingest\nTo arouse his fan base\nMaybe a wacko will take him seriously\nAnd create violence\nSo this thing has brought out\nAnd maybe the maybe in a sense the good thing that's come out from this\nIs that everybody will tone it down I don't agree with Jeff Flake very often the retiring US Senator\nWhat may be\nThe point that he made is that he was asked on CNN about the president's rhetoric\nBut he also pointed out that it's on all sides he didn't name Maxine Waters but somebody who says getting their face get on their back pocket\nHarass them rank them go to their homes go to their places of ... go to their restaurants where they're out to dinner and then the other night when McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao went out to dinner and they brought home a doggy bag somebody grabbed it and throw it in the street\nIf that's not violence what is now it's not violence against the person but it's certainly\nAnd just maybe\nThey should have a\nProsecutors in that case had his security arrest take the person to the local police station and filed charges because it's become a because these people think they can do whatever they want to do whenever they want to do it and get away with it and in large measure they do and they can for the simple reason\nThat they are protected on the left\nBy this sick or for the crowd of media on the left side of the aisle\nAnd it just continues and that goes on\n\nAnd it is frankly\nVery troubling to this country the median may say you should not call us the enemy of the people to the president but then they need to say we're going to do more reasonable coverage of the good things that are happening in this administration which are huge\nAnd that's the problem with these media\nThey don't cover all the great results that are happening\nCivil point most African American unemployment history lowest Hispanic unemployment is just that alone lowest female unemployment in history of record keeping and those cases in this country where is the\nFairness of black Obama had about forty

point seven to UCLA HD to Boston and my heart radio station [noise]\nOn the news\nYeah no that's exactly right Mike in ... and just if you think about the big picture right just historically how young\nThe United states is as a country as a nation we're we're you know or a couple of centuries old you know a few centuries old you know as opposed to it you know a hundred years sometimes thousands of years\nThat our competitors have tried different types of economic programs different types of economic structures\nNone of them to work this great experiment that we have here in the United states called freedom democracy the free market capitalist economy up you know allowing people to uh to to this to the side and determine their own faith you know that is what's made us\nThat enabling of the entrepreneurial spirit that ... of a of a business ideas creativity or an exchange of freak you know goods and services across the free market that is what has made us the strongest\nEconomy the strongest nation the world's leader in every respect there is a and so you just take a look at the end you have to ask why would we want to move\nToward a system that we know is tried and failed\nTo socialism when we have experienced under President says I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican you know it was JFK they cut taxes back during his tenure Everytime you cut taxes you get more money\nThey weren't you get more money into businesses to grow and expand is the economic expansion unlike anything else so that the President Trump did when he came into office at two major major thing\nNumber one deregulation regulation is probably the most under rated under rated thing but it did ah you know whereas President Obama added I Want to stay you know several hundred billion dollars but the regulations that hampered business growth\nA you know President Trump has actually got\nAbout a thirty billion dollars in a in regulations and so he's he's really done a great job to let it grow and expand and number two the second biggest thing was the tax cuts and JOBS Act that tax cut was the biggest tax cut in decades you have Republicans\nThat had been campaigning on tax cuts for decades never did it take credit Trump comes into office and I hear it\nIt cuts taxes and Ninety percent of Americans have more money in their paychecks because of the new withholding tables the iris so this this is the story of here we've got all time consumer confidence highs business optimism at all um I I mean manufacturing indexes are searching I mean this is this is the story of the year\nWell but the but don't forget I'm going to increase Garcia or on the deck is is the deputy director of the Commerce Department don't forget um when when you have to speak to the minority leader a say in the house he was speaker of the house\nReminding us that when everybody was only crumbs right I mean that the average folks got problems that there's a there's a ... and then she represents a party this the other major party in the country\nHow does how does anybody is stand and say that and then want to increase taxes is what she has said she wants to I mean that I bring it I'm not cause the elections a few days away\nAnd um people need to understand the consequences of their vote\nYou know that's and that's exactly it so you put this into perspective you know you have one party and and the Democrats and and I I Try to be is as fact based as I can but you have one party and the Democrats that is actively trying to concentrate power\nAnd and regulate and run your life\nAnd by doing that they have to actually forcibly cake more money out of your pocket to do it they have to control these programs government programs social welfare programs they want to be in control and I can tell you one thing for being an office uh yep\nWe inherited a bath from the Obama administration and and it's because of the blue and it's because of the size of government and it's because of\nFrankly the lack of oversight that you know everybody knows all the careers you know the political come in when the Republicans in office and all their careers you know they know oh boy we better get our act together we better\nYou know a way but we better but you know trying to clean up after I saw was for the Republicans come in you know we find things that just were\nVery very troubling you know and it happens that are Democrat administration they spend spend spend oh there's no accountability\nUh you know they all look out for each other ... you know kind of get in trouble and they may try to blame it on Republicans 'cause we're the bad guys that have to play the adults to clean up after them uh but you have a you know one party that wants to forcibly control more of your life and you have another party\nOr a distinct difference Republicans that say with the guys we don't believe that we should be the stewards of your life where you believe that you\nCan spend your buddy spend your money better than the government can't\nYou know this is what this is ... built that we're both on letting you spend more money and that that is really what creates an efficient economy what it creates a a a good free you know a ... you know when you have individual liberties people can pursue their own interests and you have a fish in\nA you know a fish that you know kind of is that way so I Can't you can't allow a government takeover by Democrats if you're really really think ah you know that you're going to be better\nOff under Democrats just take a look at where we were two years ago and look where we are today it's very very this because of President Trump's leadership in the White House because his energy is high energy is contagious whipped you know the house and Senate\nIndustry [noise] and it's actually gotten a pass legislation to actually get things done what you want to see this Trump print continue you want to see this dinosaur you want to see the

R. K. when Boston on our network and I remember in Massachusetts when the legislature\nPassed a resolution not to do business anymore with men more because Burma they were\nAbsolutely outrageously ah anti human carrying out these ferocious policies against many of their own citizens and the Massachusetts found out and was told well you can't do that because you don't have the authority to do it\nBecause the Congress abdicated its responsibility and interests now under enters an interstate commerce and the commerce clause internationally in the constitution by turning it over to the world Trade Organization\nThat to me was outrageous so we lose our sovereignty and only\nRight no I mean so this is what this is what the America First agenda that President Trump has implemented is all about\nYou know Mike He was elected\nTo return sovereignty and respect to the United states not just on the trade front but on every other friday you know we we we were not respect I'm under ... frankly a Nikki Haley did a great job with the un ah we're not bullied around by those folks\nA NATO getting getting more nations to contribute part of their GDP\nYou know toward the fat that was a major major get the president and and so to retrain trade this is really the uh the philosophy overall the president has implemented you know this America First you know we're we're parties in any kind of a deal any kind of an agreement\nTo put their people first you have to put your interests first and that is what allows for efficient agreements whether it's the private sector within a multinational multilateral deal\nSo with NAFTA you know we had a very nice um one very positive effect of NAFTA was that we had lowered surprised many many uh products were made with cheaper labor overseas\nWith north and south the border of course ah and then uh but what an unfortunately happen when China joined the world Trade Organization in two thousand and one all the things they had promised that would that would\nHappen after they joined us members never came to pass for example um you know this kind of a high level you know a a financial apple you know base of MasterCard American Express we're all promised it would have access to the Chinese market by two thousand and five\nUh that access never came and there's a Chinese painted process or the controls Ninety percent of the Chinese markets or something just to like the apple like that but you have shot subsidizing\nTheir industries unfairly having the government subsidize their goods to those industries that makes the products are a lot cheaper than us products that's obviously very non competitive for U.S companies if you can't really beat those the cheap rent they've got their finger on the scale\nAnd then with the with NAFTA China was shipping through Mexico and it's actually taking advantage of the NAFTA agreement by by gaming with Mexico\nOr in so uh you know these are all things that President Trump came adopt a stock um you know as trade advisors you know start with him you know Peter Navarro spent a fantastic job and advise can helping drive the president's agenda\nAs Jared Kushner or\nThis is what you saw any how in the world are we letting middle America\nLetting the real heart so America get hollowed out and these factories shipped overseas thousand factories shipped overseas these towns being hollowed out turn into ghost towns meanwhile we got Chinese spent now we've got you know a heroin epidemic you know the opioid epidemic of taking\nA take lives because people don't have meaning anymore they don't have jobs anymore and\nWe we call this free trade called third grade [noise] well I'll tell you what\nWith with President Trump\nIn office all that's out the window I mean this is this the snake\nEverything's on the table for this president he's delivering went after when whether it's with this new U.S MCAA deal or you know we've got the ... coming up and got Japan coming up and then once we get those deals done we're going to turn and face take a look at China in unison with our allies and I guarantee you heard her her until they change their practices\nYeah because it's basically actually I'd I'd make an analogy they're doing on trade by getting all of those deals done and then China's going to be put in the position of looking as though\nThey're fools if they don't go a long they're going to have to go along to get along because the world would have mood moved past them so they'll be pressured into that a ... I think that's important just in the same way as in the middle east\nAre now you've got to the Friedman and and Christian or working on the idea that the now that Israel talks to the Saudis putting aside cause shockey for a moment um you've got the Saudis the Egyptians the Jordanians\nAre you've got the um a cookie cutter or the United Arab Emirates but Ron I'm you've got the Gulf states as well all putting together a peace agreement and the Palestinians at some point when they see that their friends\nIn the Arab and Islamic countries are going along with the peace agreement that uh they they need to support\nThey're going to be in the same position of pressure politically as China will be economically does that make sense\nNow that that's a great point I mean it it it's all about building coalition building alliances with those that can put pressure on your common enemy if you will that was a a show or with an Australian anchor I think it was ABC Australia and uh and and you know some liberal commentator anchor said you know", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "25"}
