{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Then when they actually had the hearing a you know ... percent testified without virtually any evidence and and kept contradicting different story\nAnd people really were glued to their spat surprisingly a lot of people watch those hearing and uh they got a lot of ...\nAnd so there was a sense of the Democrats weren't very fair to start with with prom\nAnd then this is like oh for that\nAnd all the media is not being fair either\nAnd so it just sort of built ... what is it really did raise the intensity for maybe Seventy percent Ninety respect for the intensity rating went up among the base plus the base but the ones who are not in the base but are close enough to the faith that go with them\nAnd so basically what they did was a\nFire up are the folks who are might have stayed home but the election but now they're primary the vote counting you insidious hide\nAnd do you believe that that over the top behavior by the Democrats a cost them Kavanaugh is he going to get it anyway\nOh I think Kavanaugh was going to get it ah the things that are there over the top behavior day those costs them possibly their one chance of getting a house\nBy having enough or if you will pro Trump people stay home because they didn't think it was needed that they voted but now they saw the fact that the Democrat but really not that good they're really working gets from even more than they thought\nYou know they give the Trump at all are pretty well contained and everything was sort of going along you know ball even though I sessions wasn't doing a whole lot\nThey are most the base were sort of thing you know I think things are under control economy's doing good this election's not that part but this is the fired up the base and said you know what\nPrompted still fighting a but we'd better drought forward [noise]\nWhat about the Democrats who now for example the symbolic visual of the of the radical leftists probably living on food stamps and a welfare a smashing on the Supreme Court door to try to get in order to um make themselves obnoxious Lee heard\nTo stop Kavanaugh or at the Supreme Court building itself uh now that was after the election\nRight huh well the the vote there would there was an election in the Senate basically by the way I come from it and so yeah so\nUm so now there's there are ... that crowd is continuing that is the Democratic party party be merged with that image as the Democratic party mainstream now\nYeah that's what's contributing to the walk away with that you continue to have the walkway moving taking place even as we're discussing all these other matters but you have people walking away from the Democratic party and sometimes not even changing their affiliation but just plain not voting for them any more\nJust walking away literally not taking the time to even came the registration so\nLet me ask you this do you think that this phenomenon that I I agree with you but the U.S think that this over the top behavior before and after by these lunatics and they're nothing other than lunatics as a ... he'll bread route annoying\nDespicable all of that are bothering people in their private lives bothering Ted Cruz going out to dinner with his wife the think that um that crowd\nHas caused the demise of the Democratic party as responsible as a responsible party and that um the selection might be surprising with greater support for Republicans that he really realize at this point\n[noise] [noise] well that this whole phenomenon\nIf a longer term friend that just having all this has been happening in building\nAn aunt or an example\nOf one more advanced it's happening we can go back to Ferguson, Missouri we can go back to Baltimore, Maryland we can go back to all sorts of events that are in the psyche of the American voter and this is one war that's contributing to the ultimate demise of the Democratic party\nIt's also a flying towards strengthening Trump fan and and\nIt's it's becoming the Trump party and well\nThen how do you think of\nPopulist party that coming emerging out of\nThe things that the radical nature of what these people are doing has overtaken the uh um the the feeling of obnoxious this in Donald Trump in other words he was always the the the punching bag for the left\nHas that has this radical movement and the Democratic party on the far left now taken over\nAnd that will cause I don't hear anybody talking about Donald Trump's bad behavior anymore it's been very polite lately and actually very thoughtful um are they now the bad boys so to speak\nOh absolutely absolutely and in fact a lot of his orders tolerated his point because they thought they needed somebody tough at the top you know in other words they put up with a nasty tweets now and then to get the job that but now they're going to even think of that at all it's like these Democrats have got\nTo go you know politically so uh I I think we're going to see a bunch of little bubbles first they're going to be districts around the country that you think are guaranteed blue districts and they're gonna they're gonna do\nA rat and\nAll that so Schumer in Durban and Pelosi might look back at this and say we shouldn't have a cow town to the left wing crowded as part of our party we should have a modified or behavior against some of the extremism and said they they bought into it but Maxine Waters of the leader of that radical nature\nI think they're going to look back and say we had a terrible strategy we lost\nAnd and our strategy was wrong because I think their strategy was to brave the Soros for praise paid at the right\nPhrase but not as if you will because they thought all this emotion was going to fire up their base and come up with the you know think idea that there are Republicans are white supremacists who uh herbicides or this and that sort of thing it's sad it's sort of firing on\nSo that um look ... we know who he is but I think that must have been there probably were strings he probably told a Democrat leadership I'm going to do this stuff and you support them or you're not getting any more money for me I mean he might have done something like that to\nHer and they probably went along anyway along because you know what they don't have a vision\nThey don't have a vision you know any ... any organization any business has to have a vision for their going and you know when there is no vision usually the organization out there suffering from that right now the Democratic party they do not have a vision for anything other than\nYou know resist prompts vision when he died and resist Republicans we have we have twenty five seconds\nI'm and does the assistant attorney general Mr Rosenstein keep his job until after the

would seem to me at least that there is something that much I miss here especially since she's specifically said to the prosecutor at the end her hearing that she did not\nHelp anyone and using a lie detector\nWhen in fact now her ex boyfriends as he actually saw her helping another woman prepare for a lie detector test is it doesn't all of this and the travel of course he said well they say the network cast the attorney for her I said well she can't fly back to D.C she needs more time\nShe's afraid of flying and then we find out she's falling all over the world I think to Fiji or some other exotic islands among other places\nWhy are we not hearing more about that side of this story\n[noise] well it goes really loves group and uh they're all in one campus you know I'm not going to go the other side\nNo my was never about the truth but it was all about a bloody a cabin on delaying this nomination and then they\nPull that off so you know that's what it was about what was it about finding the truth from before they put their story show investigated and corroborated and uh it it fails every test and so you know we never even heard the story\nAnd and the Republicans out of fear for being called insensitive to women had to go through with this hearing and then had to extend it a week and then also used a woman to do the questioning instead of eleven white males so to speak um what about the President's Day I'm Sorry go ahead on that point\n[noise] well you know a Republican politicians in this country have never been known for their spines I mean that's why Donald Trump garlic or because they never did anything they promised they would do but you know all that my don't you\nKnow I've I've seen it and I grew up in New York\nWhere are you familiar with Donald Trump or in the old days and that he's no different now than he was then I mean you can say the certainly the consistency about a style but\nA very different than the others there's no question about it or I Can't imagine what would have happened if Jeb Bush were elected or John K sick or any of that crowd or would have been really in a Democrat and life so to speak\nUm yeah and then Republicans would have been fed up ah and then maybe not come out to vote this time I'm ... this year that you've done a lot of writing about abuse of power or senators prosecutors all that it would seem to me that as a committee\nIn the Senate Judiciary committee has performed abuse of power at a much higher level than we've ever seen 'em or much lower level depending on how you want to describe it in terms of the changing the whole nature\nOf the game of a nominating the justices or confirming nominations of justice is that the Supreme Court\nAnd and the ... just elimination of any rules at all about that prize the you agree with that and does it concern you\nAbsolutely I mean you know he is guilty until he ... he was in fact that [noise]\nHave accuser can come forward with something from a from thirty six years ago when he was in high school and then you know be on TV it in front of the full Senate hearing\nIt to tell her story is just shocking and just totally and Bertie tier system that we used to\nWhat's going to be on the long term impact of this because\nI'm look when Harry Reid who eliminated the requirement of sixty votes for federal district judges and federal appeals court judges that he said it's going to be majority from Iran and he got rid of the culture\nUm all all McConnell did was extended to the Supreme Court when I went when Reid had done in the first two levels I basically McCall just said we're going to the third level the Supreme Court and now every judge\nIs going to get confirmed by a majority and not by a super majority you know fifty one rather than sixty so when you when you have\nUm they seemed to me at least that number one and I think it makes it more equitable but now the rules are going to change again because now anything goes when it comes to dealing with the nomination process the Democrats have no show and he was anything you can use even the fact that the guy through a Cuba vice across the bar room\n[laughter] that's true I mean basically we're down to political jobs and that's really what you're going to say that's what you're watching in progress so it's a it's very alarming and very disturbing or you know\nIt keeps guys like me are employed because there's a lot of abuse of power going on in the country\nNow you've done a lot of work in that field do you anticipate have you done anything or do you anticipate doing anything on

defender dot com\nAnd you're ... you're near the ...\n...\n\nTalking\nWant to miss the gate and journalist\nOn matters involving abuse of power I'm sitting on a sort of wrap up on that prior case you have a female prosecutor is she goes after\nA I Believe to present a supervisor a presumably the supervisor in the priests that some of the things that are going on in Boston Bernard Cardinal Law for example who protected by the pedophiles which is worse than they've been being a pedophile since a pedophile is sick\nAnd these bishops and cardinals knew exactly what they were doing to protect the church from scandal at the expense of of the day that actually\nTrue and that's all in Philadelphia too\nRight and that happened in foreign recently so let me just ask you this prosecutor known that the guy recant that won the case was going on\nNo I don't think a ... ... ah some confusion as to whether he told me about that on um he he gave ... every ... every witness ... including\nMembers of the victim's family\nA collie story completely different from the ... the most telling\nSo no no more and more women I'm just asking whether she knew that the victim a legend victim recanted the victimization\nNo we don't know that she knew that part of the\nWhole case so therefore she may have acted in good faith is my point\n[noise] we all know the impact of doesn't think so because he kept telling her over and over again but look this catch stories some checking out in his own mother and his own brother and his own father are contradicting M N O L decrease some nuns and his classmate you conduct yeah\nSo uh she just kept saying I Believe the ... so uh you know it was a blind date\nBut the ... and which one do we know share even asked the question that the detective race to know why\nHe's not what I'm trying to get to the air for the audience the audience to understand is that the average folks look at this and think that the system operates the way it's supposed to\nWhich ideally happens but the question here is local prosecutor can get a person convicted a who's innocent\nAnd act in good faith doing it or we've seen for example a legend rapists who got away for ten Fifteen Twenty years and because now of DNA evidence being available we find out that they actually didn't commit the crime\nAnd that they're only least but the last ten or Fifteen or Twenty years of their lives\nSo but do but those prosecutors acting in good faith and because the evidence was led them in that direction so I'm just asking whether if somebody ... if you can determine that a prosecutor acts in bad faith then that prosecutors should no longer be a prosecutor probably should be barred from practicing law altogether\nYeah I agree\nSo at the mall we don't know what does she acted in good faith and whether you said there were other things she did\nYeah well I mean like I said\nShe took notes when she first interview oh the victim and this kid stories were all over the law\nAnd she took notes and then she told people that she didn't take notes when it came time to turn those over to the defense lawyers\nThey said what are your notes and she said there are no notes and uh she said this and she and her colleagues uh other D'Leisha this in three different courtroom you can find a traitor and judges and then eight years later little notes mysteriously\nReappear and that's after the trial is over though right\nWell yeah but we're going to really try to gauge the whole thing binary tried and but what I just brought up obey a central part of it and then early on in the case\nI'm a victim or when you called in to the archdiocese to file complaints\nHe basically told them that he didn't want to go to court he didn't want to press charges of any kind of all he wanted was money and he asked if uh I Would go about getting paid and that information but it's had on the fence as well and that will be another\nUm you know so that's that's that's the type of central argue that that was willful misconduct some part of the U.S\nWhile the if if in fact the next trial happens is is that\nProsecutors still prosecuting all these years later in the same ...\nShe left but she left the district attorney's office or\nAround the time that I'm getting to a grand jury report and found about funding mistakes of back and wrote about from a short while after that she was a a office and uh you know she said she resigned\nAnd maybe that's what happened but we never got an explanation for toning factual and mistakes on the ground you're close\nI think the better way to say that she was allowed to resign and that's what it sounds like [laughter] but I ... and that's good work on your part but now well let me ask this question if in fact she\nIs found to have lied about the notes where and in terms of when she was supposed to turn them over to the defense which is an absolute violation\nOf your a fiduciary requirement do whatever the legal requirement on the part of the prosecutor to turn over a skull matory evidence to the defense attorney\nIf it's found that she didn't do that is that there's anybody talking now when the straw goes back for a trial is anybody suggesting that she might be prosecuted for violating the law in that case\nCertainly in the defense lawyers would like to stay here just borrowed enough talked about that um but um you know since the change has been rained tried yet um all that will be you know a matter of dispute it is Dr ... district\nWe have a new district attorney he pledged to recharge the cage so I I don't think there's any doubt at this point but it will be re tried\nAll right so then that would probably be born as you said in the central evidence of the case and the result of that\nWill be that uh have they asked if that's if that's a finding in that case this former prosecutor\nOr could be vulnerable would be vulnerable to prosecution because that's a violation of law she did she intentionally perjured herself by by denying there was evidence that there actually was and the evidence might've might have um\nA rated the defendants correct that there are no might have been", "show_name": "The Jim
