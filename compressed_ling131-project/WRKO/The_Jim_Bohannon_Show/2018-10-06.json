that now and I mean certainly there and I'll find it I'll find you the crime they found the crime I mean if if he had done and I don't believe for one second he did it but if he had done the doctor for and what she says that's a crime\nWhile I'm Still\nAnd by the end of the other question was the under age at the time I mean uh it's not even worth discussing 'cause I didn't believe it happened but there are some legitimate questions about that but that's what we've come to hear now\nYou could make the case that he's a of a statute that he can defend themself he's got half the Senate defending them the basically the Republican side he's got half the American people pretty much defending them\nUh but when you get to people like I described in Wenatchee, Washington or basically apple pickers people the many cases were from Mexico and couldn't speak English very well or at all\nAnd couldn't hire fancy attorneys\nYou've got a real problem there and unfortunately in the end because of a planet attorney volunteering as time are turning rate stature and they've got turned around with their lives were basically screwed up for for those years and in some cases ruined because of this\nCrap so true and you say All right uh equal without it can be railroaded mind discovery in every court cases and throw it out it was that I've seen them while ... because ... there's only so much or or write a\nAnd a special or have the media and their side they can basically destroyed\nLet me look a judge Kavanaugh will never get his reputation guy whether they can call them tomorrow no\nWell then that that's true and he said they made that point um yeah but you know um and it's just\n... and ... there's no standard being used to I don't have any problem if you've got a person where there's there are reasonable evidence Senate doesn't have to be beyond a reasonable doubt because the Senate can make its decision on one of our grounds at once but at least those grounds to have to be justifiable in some fashion\nAnd now it's come out that her ex boyfriend and I talked to forge ex boyfriend is saying she did help a woman with a lie detector um she can fly\nA and she just she sat on the relatives she never help anybody ... as to how to use a ... a lie detector a polygraph test um and then now the foreign for instance he wants to do it\nI in other words we've got these\nI'm clear violations of any standard of justice and even though they're not you don't have to have the rules of evidence as you would in court\nIt would seem to me at least that you would have to have some standard of fairness before you tell somebody you can't have this job because you committed that that crime against Dr forward when we see that she has all these discrepancies in our in our presentation and there's nothing there to tangible you go on\n[noise] right well as you know like a white guy and I sat on this uh gauging all the time I mean the bottom line was they didn't want to investigate and they want a good ... like alive grand old\nAnd to the middle of the year and then the way the vote and they pull that off\nA to disagree but I think he's going to get confirmed\nIn the end I Can't imagine a and now that the reporters in and then then it's all done but the the the other question becomes what is going to happen in the future and the other question becomes I mentioned ... minute ago in the criminal justice system we have protections in safeguards for defendants when you just pointed out\nAnd I just pointed out defendants who are wrongfully convicted\nAnd the case in Philadelphia and the case in Washington state that these people were wrongfully convicted and how many more of those kinds of cases are there\nBy the thousands over the years\nThat the ... from from the system didn't work the way it was supposed to for people because somebody's short circuit the system\nAnd shouldn't we have been some kind of severe punishment that that that ... that a prosecutor knows if they do this they're going to lose their license to practice law and maybe even go to jail I mean shouldn't there be some clear guidelines about this even though there are laws they don't seem to get enforced\n[noise] well really merely across your ABS plastic shield it may be on my own job gets a lot of points of special investigator and uh you know they care and Oakland but other than that you guys get away with it you know that\nAnd they do and if they can show they acted in good faith which they probably protect themselves even if they're acting in bad faith these prosecutors know\nThat only after the show that they're acting in good faith and um then they have evidence of that\nAnd then they're going to be protected you right in fact in bad faith and you do something intentionally like uh like for example or denying the defense evidence and you knew that it was evidence that rascal paint the defendant or you've got a problem then 'cause that's criminal but I'm\nAlso from the back like it was you know against the criminal but it never lie to Ninety five percent of all federal indictment that under the plea bargain you know and then ... ... can you let her for her to even go to take the case to court\nOr like the ... I wrote about in the book of the\nUh they always ... percent of those cases are ones as well as you know most of the ... or ... years um [noise] you know when you up to the appeals courts you got like three or four percent chance of winning also some stacked against criminal defendant\nWhile the other part of it is that the prosecutor typically has I mean they've got a they've got deputy prosecutors on staff\nSo they can choose to go wherever you go after whatever defend that they want to go after and uh they're they're paying these people anyway so it's not as if there's a lot more than maybe more expense for travel are investigating or whatever else\nGoes on during the investigation but they've got the people on staff a defendant\nDoesn't have unlimited funds I'm right you know so that so and then the defendant can never stand up to a prosecutor if the prosecutor has it in for that defendants\nUnless the defendant has great wealth or the money to continue the case they're going to lose\n... Nicole about in the book that I've gotten um [noise] we had to defend it was well and um\nOh great store their goals but most of them are I don't know no no no I'm In the bottom line is that we're supposed to bet these were supposed to\nCall the costs of care is accountable and ugly and ... says especially the most more on journalism is Israel oldies accountable enjoying what\nDo you think will represent thirty seconds do you think that the Kevin our case in what you're describing slow lead to greater justice or are we going down the path of more power unless justice for prosecutors [noise]\n\nWell and how fast as hard and body extract work to improve blood circulation listen\nMy name is Alison I'm sixty six years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries had Seventy percent blockage in one larger lead into my heart they wanted me to go on ... but I refused to negative side effects\nTitled body extract of the unique balance synergy ... proportionate herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around Ninety five percent at the level\nWithin the first month I felt a dramatic difference happiness in my legs was reduced in a way too much I felt completely normal\nNatural organic herbal formula for heart health is hard and body extract\nPart of the body extract comes within one hundred percent ironclad night that guarantee detail that H.

Oregon a that was in the Seattle Boston Boston sanctuary\nCities Seattle's sanctuary city Portland is actually a sanctuary city\nUm but but but what we'll get to that but starting with California\nOr what has been the reaction I mean ... the only one case I mean I've interviewed a every year from front on this program I go to a DC for two days to the federation for American immigration reform even which is a hold their feet to the fire meaning public officials\nAnd we have um people on the program who are a think tank types from the center for Immigration Studies or fair uh people who are from numbers usa or various groups and then also survivor's loved ones of people killed by illegal aliens I must have had\nA and the two days I was there I interviewed probably six some of those people that's only a small number on one program\nA there are many hundreds and thousands more of those people who are survivors of murders by illegal aliens uh and in their lives coming in and killing their loved one case finally is the one example but it's got the most attention as you said\nBut I'm trying to understand here um with all of this happening is they're not the concern in California that ah the because Gavin Newsom is going to win the governorship he's off\nThis stuff oh where's the concern to bounce protection for people in California I don't get it\nWell I don't get it either and that's why a lot of other people are opposing this and then pushing back um you're right I mean some of the Sacramento politicians are just off on the fringes and I'm Sorry I missed you I was back at the hold their feet to the far conference as well but ah yeah you're talking about all the angel families\nWho have lost\nA lawsuit on me I I Know some of the people well it is is just shattering\nThe the idea that we have to put up with\nCrime by people who are here illegally in the first place and then a local officials won't cooperate in in terms of what we're supposed to get deported so it doesn't happen again I mean is just nonsensical\nUm man but I couldn't agree more\nI'm Glad to see that there is some pushback there have been like about twenty thirty a different communities around California that have gone on record as opposing what they're doing in Sacramento um\nIt's playing out in the courts that's a long haul unfortunately it seems like such a such a simple matter turning criminals over to get out of the country um\nI mean it could be what would make more sense than that I'm like you say there are a number of black holes in California and unfortunately not just California you mentioned a number of the other jurisdictions that have done things elsewhere [noise]\nHonest overly because this is the only way to stop this has to fight it\nYou've got to keep going after it's the only way to deal with this problem uh and and those people cannot win who want to bring illegals in who commit crimes harm Americans and legal residents and then are protected by public officials like Jerry Brown who should be put in jail for what he's doing who come right back stay with us\n\nI allowed skipping out later that no one ever had a litter robot it's an automatic self

S. federal agency had gone into federal court I'm asking that court throw out to California state sanctuary law the federal court said no no California court has said cities are not force it cannot be forced to comply with state law so it gets complicated you're right\nI Know I'm not ... but if we can understand that we just have to do it slowly so the federal state court apply the constitution\nOf California in saying that these are charter cities have the right to exempt themselves from sanctuary cities status so in other words those cities if they choose to do so or going to be able\nTo turn over let's say a good guy who brought the bank that those cities can turn that guy over to ice and the the the attorney general's California can do nothing about it because of this court decision is that correct yes or no\nYes that is correct [noise]\nOkay so now they can now they can do that how many cities bus far well do we know how many cities in California are sanctuary are are a charter cities\nOr a hundred and Twenty one and so most of all you're a good size cities are shorter cities\nAnd and how these\nHow many total cities are in California you know\nThat I I don't know but all that would include you know a hundred and Twenty one all the major cities so most of the population but you gotta realize I mean San Francisco and Los Angeles or or you know pro sang share it\nSanctuary to pass their own resolutions um for sanctuary so it's not like the state is going to turn around overnight because of this ruling\nRight in other words what the court said is a these hundred and Twenty one sanctuary cities are not required to the ... that exempt themselves for sanctuary cities status but they can if they choose to is that correct right\nAll right are the shorter cities and as I understand that I'm I'm ... I haven't read the ruling itself and then in fact I don't know the judge issued a written a really good at this point they don't they don't even have to pass anything to exempt themselves they can just\nGo back to honoring ice tea painters cooperating with ice and there's nothing the um\nUm the the the state attorney general can do about it um I mean I I Will say that I mean some city is dead exempt themselves by four I'm by\nNo resolution and others disagreed about filing an Amazon ... brief and another ... letters to the state\nBut as I understand it they don't have to do anything further they don't have to pass an ordinance resolution they can just cooperate with ice a at the county level it'd be up to the sheriff I'm at the local level of course it would be the I'm a police chief or maybe taking direction from the city council depending what their range but it is but that could just cooperate with ice\nAnd the state attorney general can do nothing about it 'cause it's like all\nRight so that's a good thing to victory what about what about counties ... counties exempt themselves under this really\nUm well you know as I understand that because they're not charter cities [noise] um now interestingly some of the sheriffs have pushed back by just I'm publishing the\nRelease date of everybody who is going to be released to making that information public putting it on our Web site so then I can check and see if there any names are looking for um you know as a way of getting around the the thing\nWe're a law and saying well here's the names um you know\nLet us know so there'll be there at the time they're released um so you know the the sheriffs are pushing back to I mean you are at the um oh their feet to the fire convert to allow share showed up from across the country to express their opposition to sanctuary policies into letting people come into the country illegally\nYeah no I understand that and the most Americans if they got the chance to vote directly on whether they want to illegals coming in", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Boston", "day": "06"}
