that this is actually apple trying to help the police\nAre and [laughter] hold on I'll explain because we know that apple has in the past said\nHey police if you have a valid war it and you've not or you know bricks the phone by trying to brute force into it too many times we will unlock the thing for you\nWhen did they say there and when did I have said that numerous times that's one of the things are in the San Bernardino situation they actually told the FBI we can't do anything because you brick the bull by trying to guess the pass code too many times\nAnd then it locked everything down yeah basically told the FBI had you not tried cracking into the fold\nWe would have gotten into the phone for you so by preventing police from trying to crack into the fold it set a roundabout way helping the police because that apple will crack until the ... for the la di di do recall this\nKnow what you're talking about there with a San Bernardino thing as far as I Know apple basically gave the FBI the finger the whole time because the FBI had already because I had the phone but because that was apples normal stands\nGo away so as I understand it or what apple said is if we create something to crack the encryption at this point than it would be able to on like every phone and we're not going to do that but how did that but it had you not bricks the phone we could have gotten\nInto it Mm yeah that second part I don't recall this at all yeah\nI I Do and one of you people out there has has been following this closely get a call if\nYou remember as I Do or maybe I missed remembering but I've heard other tech podcaster say the same thing uh eight fifty five\nFour fifty free that eight five five four or five zero three seven three three\nYou look back you had something to say um yeah\nI I think I think the way it was said may just be misconstrued or or miss misunderstood as opposed to because I think there was some excuse like given like that\nBut at the same time I don't necessarily know that their stance wasn't that they had no intention of helping them a unlocked the device um word or create a back door at least this is the way it was for his I think\nYeah so trying to find something on the apple website they do have a a government information request page on their website so I'll Try digging into this and see if it mentions complying with more it's a they're listening\nTo you haven't done a little bit different than than helping to write extract encrypted devices from the phone itself\nIf the war it says we want information from this device\nAnd apple says we will comply with valid more it's as long as you have it turn into the fold into a brick\nOr maybe I Would be able to find you know it would be a subpoena now to warn right or\nI'm trying to think what the difference was worn a subpoena is a war would be if you have to get access to\nThose that would be weird people are getting subpoenaed information and get a ... or simply formation sided ration gets the peanut from a company that ... if you if you're a witness in that case yeah they get a subpoena for Chris to appear in court to testify\nOkay ah to get information or you might be ratios I wore it saying this\nPart of the war in Iraq knew they weren't will be for something that already exists not too yes the iPhone exist information on an iPhone ...\nIs something that's within their control it exists I'm so ... the iPhone they can't make somebody do something like create a back door for the phone that was the whole point of those multiple

apparently some people in Austria are concerned that if they have their\nName on their door bell that they might be found in violation of the thing or maybe the landlords they that they might be found in violation of the law\nOr it's all really confusing and like I I don't think that the uh GDP are what and I forget exactly what it stands for but I don't think that it specifies you can't have a name on a doorbell it doesn't\nYeah I don't think it is either um it does seem like it's it might be extending it beyond what the the law requires but again I'm\nSomebody who's interpretation\nAnd more than one has interpreted as such and as we know broad laws you have these types of situations\nOr if you look at um ... so there's actually a the next that actually number next paragraph um some critics are saying that the push towards more privacy has gone too far several US News sites including the Chicago Tribune here in Los Angeles times came in ... in Europe after the new data\nA protection law was introduced earlier so it's not just this a government housing in Vienna which apparently might be as much as ... might be as much as half of the population a is being impacted by this and we gotta I'm based off of this this one interpretation\nThat that's assuming slightly over four people per apartment or house that's being affected right of the two hundred and twenty thousand or\n... just as employment under twenty miles and name badges or I don't think the average house has four people in it\nYou know it's probably like somewhere between three and four um I don't know exactly which we are and again this is Europe's within the it might even be lower than what I'm I'm I'm estimating but as I Believe are roughly around the statistics\nThat are usually the case um but if you want to look up go forward on that might have a some better information but it's still a huge number or whatever it is um two hundred twenty thousand people even ... millions a substantial number and they said last name so I I think it's probably pretty fair to assume that there's probably more than one\nA person I've rationally house it's\nDefinitely more than two hundred and twenty thousand people I don't think it's a million people that are being affected and what appears to be government housing here but again we don't know there were speculating a lot here because the washing your host isn't giving us a lot of details\nAnd again I I'm Still curious about you know\nYeah there's this whole thing is just strange to me\n[noise] um yeah so and this isn't just a Vienna though um and it's actually a changed in your in other European cities so but in Europe I Do about isn't just the doorbell or some countries including France Spain and borrow a bowl and introduced numbers and save names decades ago to make things easier Germany\nAnd some other countries upheld the doorbell named tradition ... are part of the buildings identity and build community everyone knows everyone because the names are right there at the front door\nSo yeah it's not just the enter where this was like a tradition it's it's a lot to\nPlaces in Europe but yeah it just seems strange\nTo me that every time a new tenant moves in the name of the uh apartment number you know like\nThe actual the the flat which is what they call them in Europe right oh yeah this is not unit three oh three of ... unit Chris and Chris is out and then it becomes unit Darrell [noise]\nYeah it's um I don't know if that's what's going on here um it might not even out sounds like you're describing is happening well that's the way it sounds like to me but I don't necessarily know because so one of the things we also don't know is just because he is in the u._k. that's common it doesn't necessarily mean that it's the same thing in the situation of\nChaos I also know that they do a sign unit numbers to the thing the the Ecuadorian embassy is flat three be of that\nApartment building so it it does that is true they do sometimes but they don't always it just depends and I've mailed to many of items to people in the u._k. over the years without any kind of number\nSo it's just the name\nWe've still got a postcard right but the house number's what we're talking right here at their offices in the state house in New Hampshire where\nIf you go to the state website and look up particular offices it doesn't provide a street number they're still a straight number for that building but it just says address it to office of ... department that doesn't mean that there's not a street address\nNow take it to the next level and to have this for some random person's house\nThat's not how ... works in the U.S it's not but that's how it works in the u._k.\nYour speculating that it was how it works I've addressed ... well not personally I have an address but people who have worked for me this is how they this is how it's been addressed and it's ... it it's not an issue getting through the mail\nSo there's no street name there there's\nThere's ... there's going to be a street name but they don't want to see there is no house number there is no building number\nThat seems very very strange to me is there for\nMe to um and I mean ... or is\nIt just sort of start repeating over itself\nYeah no I think that's I think I I think we covered it yes and\nSo I found something from the tell her report
