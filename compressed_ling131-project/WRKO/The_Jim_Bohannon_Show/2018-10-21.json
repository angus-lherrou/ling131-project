R. N. dot at them they can just set up a satellite dish and receiver and they don't have to have an Internet connection live at their uh their their radio station so it's used for that as well\nAnd it helps facilitate that so to me I think it's worth it it's a I think it's worth doing and we've been doing it since I think about twenty ten so almost most of the decade\nSo I got a question who regulates the FCC does technically I have some satellite re regulate and I'm just just curious like give evict covers North America and South America\nDoes the FCC just plain we're in charge of all those are the SP but who regulates the tell the ports so there's the uh you know the the ... the place where there's like a big ... sent a company\nThat ... that takes our show and or I read and then they mix it together and and what they call them ... which is a series loves her right which is a series of channels that's all broadcast to the satellite and then the satellite rebroadcast sit down across\nContinents or so since that's the transmission facility located in Pennsylvania it comes under FCC\nLicensed in that case but that doesn't mean we're prohibited doesn't mean that content as FCC regular are some things that I think that aren't allowed but it's not the same as like broadcast radio yes but anyway David does that answer your question for you\nYeah yeah and\nAt it I mean so let's since you're in an ...\nThe little person since you had a free to air satellite ... what was it that attracted you to it\nSo I you know there's a picnic and and then ... already a metal population a a you know it it's about ... what are the only Muslim majority city that better than that um you know or Michigan\nI'm you know it's a pretty common thing it right down you know ... ... ... ... you know they're bigger than like in the late ... you know it's like ... and you know a\nA quick like like you said it's not like that but you know I think Michael that up I got a dish for free but you know I I'm ... and under eight bucks I think there was even with like eight bucks an hour and they were network I recognize that I'm like\nOh my gosh you guys are up there I just thought that you\nKnow pool yeah I feel as though they affect I'll tell you another aspect of this that I thought was cool years ago I learned that some countries banned satellite dishes yeah\nAh so Cuba for instance yeah but not just Cuba there's also some Middle Eastern countries that also banned them and uh and so I thought you know I like subversive things and I love the idea that we're up on a delivery system satellite\nThat basically can't be Jim by any meaningful system that the only way they have to effectively stop people is to target people's dishes and take them out if you if you search Google for satellite dish or destruction or bans or whatever you'll find some horrifying picture\nOf just uh just I don't know thousands hundreds of satellite dishes that have been confiscated by authoritarian governments that are being crushed by bulldozers and things like that I mean so there really are people who are going to prison\nIn countries for smuggling in satellite dishes um I remember once crazy yeah I remember one story and I think it might have been Cuba where they smuggled them in as though they were like wave boards are boogie boards are saying like they painted them ... writing colored and\nAnd uh and and there was a years ago I read a story about Cuba where what the the way they set it up as one dish will be set up on like in a sort of a obscured location where they can point of the\nUh the satellite but it can't easily be seen from like the ground and then they'll feed that feed from that just a multiple of surrounding houses so one dish will feed multiple families in an area because they don't want to have more than one bishop 'cause it increases the likelihood that they're going to get caught\nA just a fascinating stuff and so I thought you know if we can be up on this satellite the most popular one galaxy Nineteen where it's at\nBecause there's a bunch of satellites up their only some of them are sort of the\nThe free to air satellites there's a bunch of 'em to deliver encrypted or scrambled channels\nOn other satellites and I thought you know if we can be there with pro liberty pro freedom programming\nAnd uh you know even quicker perhaps undermined the legitimacy of these ah these authoritarian states like that's worth you know five hundred bucks a month prior to me at least Hey David thanks for calling smack glad you found out there and I appreciate hearing from you want to learn more about our satellite view\nYou can go to ... dot L. already done ethane SAT sat dot L.
