{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Bloomberg is now donating twenty million dollars\nTo help democratic candidates running for the U.S Senate\nWhy the Republicans think that the Democrats are a threat\nTo taking majority control of the Senate is not clear to me because as I said earlier in the last segment\nThere were twenty five Democrats seats that are up in the Senate and only nine Republican seats that are up to the math is nearly three to one which means by nearly three to one Democrats are in elections where they could lose\nFor every three Democrats for every one Republican so I don't know what the real problem is\nBut the twenty million is going to the Senate majority pac of the Democrats\nBloomberg also pledged ... million to Democratic House candidates this year eighty million for them twenty million for the Senate there's a hundred million dollars is giving to Democrats as a former Republican\nHe became an independent after leaving the Republican Party\nAnd now of course his donating this money I in large measure in my view because he's thinking about running for president in twenty twenty\nBy the way the amount of a hundred million dollars in that in the house and Senate races that he's pumped into these races is more than in prior races\nHe's paves the given money to liberal causes especially as I mentioned the pro gun restrictions crowd\nThe Democrats need twenty three seats in the house to get the majority\nThat's a substantial number and\nAh they they need to get twenty three if they're going to take control we'll see if that happens\nIt is true though that there are some tight races for Republicans\nWe know about the Senate race in Texas Senator Ted Cruz\nIn a dead heat with the Democrat Peter O'Rourke who said some nasty things about women by the way the scandal broke today so that might hurt him a lot\nThere was a case of a Republican candidate for governor years ago and in Texas against Ann Richards\nAnd when they were debating at one point or on the same plot podium same stage in one of the campaign events he came up on the stage she went over to shake his hand and he refused to shake her hand\nHe lost the election and many argue that was that symbolic gesture of refusing to shake enriches hand the cost of the election because Texans are very protective of treating women and they gentlemanly fashion\nAnd even if you disagree shaking hands as not supporting the other person's view that simply being courteous so many Texans arguably\nOpposed\nThat candidate because he wouldn't shake her hand that's I say that because this democratic candidate now has been touted today who are seen as a very nasty things about women\nThat's that's been up to now a tight race we'll see how it goes Marsha Blackburn\nA member of the U.S house in Tennessee\nHas trailed in most polls behind Phil Bredesen who is a former governor of Tennessee\nAnd now they're dead he they're dead even she's been trailing but now they're dead even\nThey give the president goes back to some tendency maybe two more times before the election or at least once he might give her that edge that she needs\nThat Bloomberg is giving the money to the twenty million for the Senate\nIs controlled by people who are\nColleagues of Chuck Schumer the minority leader\nChuck Schumer of course has become radicalized because the left is pushing all these Democrats for this radicalizing on the left side of the aisle\nThe thing about the tax is that they can spend unlimited amounts of money on elections but can't coordinate with candidates so yeah they can spend all they want\nAnd raise all they want but they can only do that in parallel with candidates they can't ever talk to the Kennedy has there been cases that I'm familiar with that went to court because of the candidate spoke with one of these tax\nAnd not that anything even happened\nFrom the conversations but you can't even talk to the pack\nAs a candidate you got to keep your your arms length distance from them that's the rule but the benefit for the pack is if you follow the rules is that you can spend unlimited amounts of money on your agenda and nobody's going to stop you from doing that\nSo we'll see how uh how all this plays out but Bloomberg is out there betraying the party that he was once part of and unfortunately betrayed uh\nRudy Giuliani who's endorsed them and frankly Bloomberg would have lost that election without Giuliani's endorsement for mayor of New York in two thousand one and a that was that\nMany time and I want to repeat this so we all understand what's happening with the FBI investigation and what's going to happen in the Senate is that Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader said that every senator gets a copy of the FBI report\nOn the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee judge Kavanaugh\nThere'll be a report of there'll be a vote in the full Senate this week\nMcConnell is more to say with certainty\nThey'll get the FBI report this week and they will be a report this week\nThose two facts according to Mitch McConnell\nOnly senators can look at it as I said earlier\nAnd McConnell said he's going to fight any Democrat tempted attempts to delay so he's going to get it done and luckily as majority leader he has the power to do that uh there was some questions myself included as to whether Mitch McConnell\nWould go to that extreme\nTo just simply uses\nFull power when the Democrats tried to the laying of course they will as to whether or not\nHe would overrule the Democrats trying to stop the boat\nAnd the answer is that he will that's what he says at least\n[noise] so we'll see how that to try and fires [noise] well that's good news that's the that's the kind of his very focused [noise] he's referring to live in a couple of speeches in the last two days on the floor of the Senate talking about the Democrat reprehensible strategy and the good man's judge Kavanaugh was that a stellar records impeccable records\nAnd that he has ... on the floor this week that'll be good news and he will win a if you have to vote stay with us thanks for listening\nIt's been said any society is only three miss meals away from chaos those times may be near think about it\nOur country faces multiple terrorist threat to the Russians from Russia and North Korea social unrest and violence marches yet again vaguely diluting of stores in city shutdowns and crumbling infrastructure at least our power grid vulnerable to long term outages from a single cyberattack\nWhen they chaos for any one of these threats arises the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency\nThat's why you need your own plan for self reliance\nThat's where my

the mass governor's debate I bought that key thing to do anything more about Jay Gonzales tomorrow morning if I Do watch no let's stick with it with a baseball game I Want to talk about the debate [noise] starting about wanting to\nHim in vi V. weekday morning sake they've had\nA little boy so Boston\nU R K O five\nIt was hard radio invite you to see Fleetwood Mac lives\nWe've invited them\nHouse to strike\nSuccess on their own and then come way you're gonna\n... would max north Americans who are in\nLine to get that would match dot com\nSo boy so Boston can you walk walking over one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\nFrom Haiti painting\n... holding are dangerous storm surge and life threatening flash flooding expected as hurricane Michael moves toward the Florida coast forcing thousands\nAnd could kind of grind is down from within so we as a people would be different um because they knew that they would be willing to accept their their ideas so it's a but the idea specifically what happened to judge Kavanaugh I think a\nTheir first major experiment with that was with Senator Joseph McCarthy and you know most people even the hearing me say that\nProbably because they've been educated you know with liberal textbooks claim that McCarthyism was when he destroyed so many innocent live lives by making accurate accusations but of course the reality is McCarthyism was there the left first major experiment\nWith at all on character assassination of true false accusations against him because they knew he was getting ready to uncover how successful they infiltrated every level of uh\nFrom it and he had to be destroyed so they they really they did to him\nWhat they were accusing him of doing to everybody else so they only one in America that was destroyed by\nMcCarthy as it was Senator Joseph McCarthy and and uh uh thankfully people like him standing there have been to several years back six seven years\nResearching that all original source documents from the FBI and the congressional files he wrote a book called blacklisted by history where he shows McCarthy's accusations were right um but they knew what they stopped him\nUm then they wouldn't even look into the accusations he was ... which is true which was so that all the boxes that were hiding out in our government at different levels in different positions they were all able to stay and are there still stirring up trouble today\nWell I I agree with you about that point although for example a guy like Dalton tremble great screenwriter who have the right under a different name because he was blacklisted\nI think Charlie Chaplin had to go to Europe um you know there there are these um artistic types who are not overthrowing the government but the but you don't we don't have fought police who who decide the somebody can't believe\nIn communism I mean I I I rejected out of hand I think it's the testable hasn't worked but nevertheless somebody has a right to believe that don't they\nUh they do as long as they're not a ... others with those back then it was you are not allowed to subvert or\nOthers with those ... you could personally believe whatever you want but you cannot be I'm\nPromoting those are the ways but those those ... the thing is there's so many levels of it there but the Senate made him exposes list which he didn't want to do he wanted them all investigated um looked into it but they ... they just they have to tell us the list are not ready to tell them\nThat you have to you and they made him tell the list\nUm but here's the thing even in cultures that if anyone\nCan prove anyone was hurt by that she will give them a hundred thousand bucks and do it every day she said that about Fifteen Years ago about a hundred dollars a hundred thousand dollars to anyone that can prove someone was destroyed about McCarthyism and a lot of those people as you begin to see some of the ones you mentioned\nA later you realized they were tied in to more than what is it appear to be as the the note of files and the different things that came out in the nineties often the KGB and stuff we realize a lot of those people um they had more bad things going then it appeared on the surface\nBut the point of the\nApproach they use it that's what they've done and\nJudge Kavanaugh if they try to do of course the\nClarence Thomas in in the list goes on they are when I was represented they tried to do that that that their their protocol to less ... if you just destroys demand and no one will listen to his message and it'll discredit them and then you don't have to worry about debating the message 'cause that's what they don't want to do 'cause they know they will not win the debate\nThat is what ... said\nYou know it's over ...\n... that's something that I've sent for years here but it's going to what you're saying now is it it goes back\nHistorically to the left\nSocialist communist\nUh there's no room for debate there's only room for the for a singular point of view is what you're saying\nRight and they and they ended their point of view and so that's why like you were saying before I came on\nOur side is willing to give us a little gracious there's two other people like of a presence elected and caters to people on the ... we don't like it there there are a little more gracious to go okay we need to\nBe respectful of that at least is they're not and they never will be and they never have been because they they have an agenda that was my neighbor right field is called the gender grinding America down and that's the whole thing I go to your show what has happened to our country\nIs part of an agenda it's not an accident it's not just the way things go it's purposeful it's premeditated um and it's been going on in the Eighteen eighties strongly [noise]\nUm but it it is a long history not a new thing it's got them oh there why are they doing this all of a sudden they just got much more bold in it\nUm ever since the Obama years because they know they're getting so close to accomplishing their plan\nIf they can't [laughter] I I think it's a big they are so shocked trumpet in their cars and ...\nMismatched they right they will come right back [noise]\n\nCan line down\nAisle labs skipping out later said no one ever and not\nHave a little robot medics

and this radical ideology\nAnd what it would do to accomplish that\nI think this is the point would be anybody has a right to try to get their point of view heard\nBut there were certain ground rules or parameters to that in a free society and the far left doesn't seem to want to follow those rules so how do you deal with that how does how does this society to deal with that reality\nOf it all sort of free society the right to speak because as soon I mean everyone is speaking truthfully I mean it's assumed that is one of the foundation stones or purses the ideas is\nIs the foundation for an honesty and see if you're going to have a debate you got to be talking back she can't\nTroll facts out and then just said no we're just doing this or that so we need to always make sure one we have our facts where we do we're going to talk about environmental ... we have our facts on that so that we can\nWhen we were engaged in a debate argument we we force the debate to always go in the direction of facts paint and give them time to yes please tell me the facts\nLead you to believe this is the way it does work and that we present our Congress for me do need to do much better job when there's any better debating the Mandy first facts\nNot emotion this not you know a passion not yelling not\nBelittling the person that is speaking of which is not supposed to be happening there any way just rules etiquette you're never exposed to to cut down anyone that is in that chamber for any reason personally but they didn't they just start just terror people to shreds and the threats that stuff and that's only defied all\nOf our ... the way those those systems have been set up so that only fact we'll be talking about well never deal with individual people personally your eye drops each other by name\nEric and so you you're just ... keep it simple it's to keep it focused\nAnd we ... we need to encourage our representatives that are in there and we as individuals just in our communities\nTo always again be civil and where we are talking that demand that we we deal with facts and we talk about the issues we discuss them because if we do it that way to truthful always went out and that's what we what I think\nMy definition of his conservative is someone that loves to fans and speak the truth that's it and if it goes even against something they thought they were wrong now I realize the truth is that there's probably off in this area we always want to pursue the true\nWell the only problem with that is um the truth on the part of\nA liberal who's going to be different than the truth on a part of a conservative uh there's there's not an absolute truth in human events there are certain absolute truth two plus two is always for in based ten\nUm water boils at two hundred and twelve degrees except I guess if you're in Denver but uh [noise] the the uh the the notion of human interaction doesn't is not susceptible to what you're describing is as truth or a fact\nBecause you can present different kinds of facts for example you can talk about health care and Obama would argue and I don't agree with him Obamacare but he he might argue that ah let's let me just use a number it's not the correct number let me just use a number of let's say ten million more poor people\nAre now on Medicaid or now have insurance who didn't before the other side of the coin would be there were so I think six and a half million people who can't by individual policies because those are the people that got burned by Obamacare\nSo it depends who's ... who's actually wanna Gore if you were on one side to use one set of statistics and leave the other's out\nIf you're on the other side you leave the other set of statistics and then leave those out\nBut you need to force them to debate is wearing the constitution is our duty to get everybody else short\nOnly I I agree with you that's ... yeah but that they had ... question at\nYet but all the things they always said bleeding heart they they sound great but you have to then ask here that are jurisdiction do we have the authority to do that based on our own that we took to the constitution\nAnd and Ninety percent of the time they realize oh we don't and it sounds like a good day so maybe we can encourage the free enterprise system do we encourage the insurance companies hey is there a way you can get something back but we can't do it because we don't have the jurisdictions that have and if we do do it we're breaking the oath of office\nAnd we can't do that because they were liars I'm at so we so again it's it's not letting them\nThrow numbers out like that it's you show me and it cuts the true story of the forty to do this that\nRespect it's not a matter of what I agree with you about the constitutionality but then I looked at the I'd come back and say and again I agree with you but then I come back and say the system has to allow\nFor a legislature the Congress let's say to vote in Obamacare which they did\nThen you can tested in the courts while we did tested in the courts and miss the justice chief justice John Roberts decided that it was a tax penalty so it was five to four that they saved Obamacare on what I consider to be false grounds but the point was that went through the system\nAnd the highest arbiter in the country the Supreme Court\nWhich has you know interpreting the constitution basically said rightly or wrongly that Obamacare was okay they also said in roe v Wade that there's a number of rights in the first time members of the constitution one of those rights of privacy well there's no right to privacy written in the first time in months at all\nBut but uh but but it's but that's what the court said you so if the court says that\nYou don't go any further but I think a legislature has the right to pass a law and then expect that if some people think it's unconstitutional let them tested in the Supreme Court\nAnd the Supreme Court is not the ridge also supposed to be the final sale or one of three equal thing\nAnd they can be over to where we go thank you for your opinion that's why it's called ... and yet but we're doing it anyway because people have agreed to it and I mean so there\nThere's so much there but but again when they do something that's wrong like the rover your way and you say privacy has nothing to do with you know killing your child that that is totally different we we can't do that we have to stand up like Dred Scott when slaves were allowed when we have a constitution that", "show_name": "The Jim
