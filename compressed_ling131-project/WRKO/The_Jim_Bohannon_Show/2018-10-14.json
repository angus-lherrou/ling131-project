{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Regarding the legal cannabis industry they still have banking problems all the time and so I experienced this ... problems you mean they can't open a bag I found out All right right and I've experienced this firsthand drive is a dispensary and California recently\nAnd you go up to the top of the stairs and there's a couple of armed guards there one of them right to demand your ID\nThe other one swipes ... we we we have to see if it'll detector to see and then they let you in the dispensaries they've got a vote with cash and the ... yes and then I and then they let you in the dispensary at which point you go round of these him right there in the ... and then you get the ... the cash out and you can go to the counter and actually pay and it's ... it's\nI I was lucky they're doing their best but it's if it's the problem and so I understand when they say cash handling fees are Fifteen to thirty percent for the cannabis industry it's like\nI say it is insane I thought so um but you have to see why where the money go away money goes to this security otherwise you'd just rocket so\nBut then I realized I started looking at some CBD um some CBD sellers on line and I noticed that a lot of them they just I didn't even ... target for there's a lot of them\nExcept their currencies and a lot of her actually offer discounts like and of course I'm just always on the Internet looking for stuff always looking at ... accepting business is always trying to get more and this kind of struck me I'm like why why would\nI thought a CBD is legal in the U.S and hadn't doesn't have these problems well it turns out as an other problems associated with the fee at a banking system\nCharge backs right huh this industry the fitness supplement industry has a huge problem will charge backs are among buys diet pills it didn't work yeah they and then they take it and they just they wake up next day I'm Still fat I'm One of his own thing\nAnd then there's this ... it's automatic back in March and can't do anything and that is a giant chunk of business so they're willing to subsidize\nPeople's pay hanging crypto currency buys you can actually reverse yeah they look like insurance he'd rather pay a certain amount of money to reduce the risk of that giant chunk of money going away and said he realized okay\nHere's another whether it's actually ... money saved is not well maybe this or censorship that are all but what about cypress in the hair cut and all those you know forget all that stuff let's talk about every single day not taught not worst case scenario at work today and the answer is overwhelmingly yes\nAnd um we we are business did that almost from day one it was a little bit in but we quickly realized that you know we would rather have people pay were crypto than anything else\nSo yeah let's do five percent discount you've come in our store anything you buy any ... and ... percent off of any crypto um which means I've sometimes accepted some\nLess than desirable crypto but that was my ... you'll see that you really will take anything I Will say can I get paid them does go on and I've got paid and we're going to take those those are All right I don't know if I'm going to take the the stuff I've never heard of a trade and raven going yet ... yes he did last night ... bam there we go I did I got fired\nI when I'm not even I don't know you and say what you sold because it might not that might be admitting to something you don't want to tell my gosh yes [laughter]\nI Can't do that can't do that [laughter]\nSo you and after that meant something very insignificant yeah sold for a good amount of raven coin yes that I likely violated several federal laws in doing so so oh oh well I wouldn't go that far I don't know what you're talking about but I still would rather not far ... you'll be surprised when you hear that and you at home we'll never know\nAnd people don't also understand the verification process or other things and another ...\nWhen you start thinking things through the crypto lens of criminals better the banking system the payments industry is not as good when they're thinking that let me start seeing things like one more time in California I Am going outside of a brew I Love craft fairs at a brewery went outside there's a next door and can we get a bird that takes dash now that's what I hear you know you can't keep me away\nSo I there was a Mexican taco truck there uh and with with\nThey'd like seafood tacos and ... a big sign their cash you know non ... cash or credit card or a five percent up charts oh you're in a lot just well sometimes under a certain amount ... period you know why because they have to then pay people\nPay their employees many of whom probably don't have legal status I mean I guess ... maybe you took a or suppliers who don't necessarily have bank access to the financial system because they don't have official documentation to prove that they are for them to have ... just as much easier for them to have cash than to\nTake us take a swipe and then withdraw or to a bank transfer they just want to do their accounting straight in cash and brother actually willing to do that now if they took that crypto currency\nThey would probably I Would say if I got the convince them I could probably get them to five percent discount and crypto currency\nBecause they have all the ... thing right to have those tears it a bit yeah like you do cash for cash prize five percent off or crypto and if you only thing with a credit card five percent more\nYeah that school all the benefits of credit cards none of the problems of credit card right except for you know you need a machine to work as opposed to just given out\nPaper we had something happen or sort of related to this in Keene October first a little ... pizza which you know if you've been to the ... festival they haven't taken crypto for a couple of years and they decided to stop taking credit cards entirely they made an announcement on there or Instagram and their social media\nPicture of hey we're done where you know this October first were quitting and you know right below that there was an immediate conversation about we are accepting cash and crypto currency and there were a couple of customers who immediately posted like I guess someone have to learn about\nCrypto currency now or whatever so that's a cool yes which so far I mean there's a bunch of ways of getting crypto currency\nProbably if you're in New Hampshire more so than yeah right the easiest one stop shop sort of thing is getting account with uphold and then just buy and sell easily and pretty easy to get on you know it's the it's the easiest one thing I can recommend has a personal account business account was a little bit more ... on ...\nI've had a customer service is basically nonexistent so that I wasn't real happy with\nA but regardless it's been working fine as a personal and I think you said there are limits were like ten thousand dollars per some period day or whatever and it went up in like that it was very high much higher out of it yeah and\nUm it it one thing you should should know about up well first off they do give favor I Believe the lowest\nUm the lowest charged for kept a currency conversion would be big coined BTU one point of as you're going nine filed point nine five when nine five dash is the second is at one point two five okay going cash Lakeland bunch of others or one point for still very very for your time you heard it was hard yes if you wanted to compare\n... the actual currency transaction fees therefore that is the best deal also\nThere are some rumors that apple will be directly integrated into several dash wallets so that someone can just download a dash ... and ... from the exact same ap\nWell that'll be cool so there's all kinds of things happening would dash or Venezuela is hot uh we're definitely keeping\nAn eye on that situation down there and I hope to we're going to have you back on at some point John with uh with my race in a little while back as co host and hopefully we might put it in another dashed proposal this month so we'll see we'll keep outlandish drives me up there and how that goes ah Joel things are coming back on TALK live from ... news yeah thanks yeah\nWe're coming up here it's
