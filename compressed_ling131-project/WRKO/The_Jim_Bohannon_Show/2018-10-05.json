{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "When in fact the second amendment is very clear but it turns out\nAs a critic of Donald Trump\nBloomberg is now donating twenty million dollars\nTo help democratic candidates running for the U.S Senate\nWhy the Republicans think\nThat the Democrats are a threat\nTo taking majority control of the Senate is not clear to me because as I said earlier in the last segment\nThere were twenty five Democrats seats that are up in the Senate and only nine Republican seats that are up to the math that's nearly three to one which means by nearly three to one Democrats are in elections where they could lose\nFor every three Democrats for every one Republican so I don't know what the real problem is\nWhat the twenty million is going to the Senate majority pac of the Democrats\nBloomberg also pledged ... million to Democratic House candidates this year eighty million for them twenty million for the Senate there is a hundred million dollars is giving the Democrats as a former Republican\nHe became an independent after leaving the Republican Party and now of course his donating this money I in large measure in my view because he's thinking about running for president\nIn twenty twenty\nBy the way the amount of a hundred million dollars in the in the house and Senate races that he's pumped into these races is more than in prior races\nHe's paves the given money to liberal causes especially as I mentioned the pro gun restrictions crowd\nThe Democrats need twenty three seats in the house to get the majority\nThat's a substantial number\nAnd uh they they need to get twenty three if they're going to take control we'll see if that happens\nIt is true though that there are some tight races for Republicans\nWe know about the Senate race in Texas Senator Ted Cruz in a dead heat with the Democrat Beto O'Rourke who said some nasty things about women by the way the scandal broke today so that might hurt him a lot there was a case of a Republican candidate for governor years ago and in Texas against Ann Richards\nAnd when they were debating at one point or on the same plot podium same stage\nIn one of the campaign events he came up on the stage she went over to shake his hand and he refused to shake her hand\nHe lost the election and many argue that was that symbolic gesture of refusing to shake enriches hand the costs in the election because Texans\nAre very protective of treating women\nGentlemanly fashion\nAnd even if you disagree shaking hands as not supporting the other person's views that simply being courteous so many Texans arguably\nThat candidate because he wouldn't shake her hand that's I say that because this democratic candidate now has been outed today for seeing some very nasty things about women\nBut that's that's been up to now a tight race we'll see how it goes Marsha Blackburn a member of the U.S house in Tennessee\nHas trailed in most polls behind Phil Bredesen who is a former governor of Tennessee\nOr did he they're dead even she's been trailing but now they're dead even I think if the president goes back to some kind of see maybe two more times before the election or at least once he might give her that edge that she needs\nThat Bloomberg is giving the money to the twenty million for the Senate\nIs controlled by people who are\nColleagues of Chuck Schumer the minority leader\nChuck Schumer of course has become radicalized because the left is pushing all these Democrats for this radicalizing on the left side of the aisle\nThe thing about the tax is that they can spend unlimited amounts of money on elections but can't coordinate with candidate so yeah they can spend all they want and raise all they want but they can only do that in parallel\nWith candidates they can't ever talk to the cameras there been cases that I'm familiar with that went to court because of the Kennedy spoke with one of these packs and not that anything even happened\nFrom the conversations but you can't even talk to the pack\nYou've got to keep your your arms length distance from the that's the rule but the benefit for the pack is if you follow the rules is that you can spend unlimited amounts of money\nOn your agenda and nobody's going to stop you from doing that\nSo we'll see how uh how all this plays out but Bloomberg is out there betraying the party that he was once a part of\nAnd unfortunately betrayed I'm Rudy Giuliani who's endorsed them and frankly Bloomberg would have lost that election without Giuliani's endorsement for mayor of New York in two thousand one and a that was that\nMe time and I want to repeat this so we all understand\nWhat's happening with the FBI investigation and what's gonna happen in the Senate\nIs that\nMitch McConnell the Senate majority leader said that every senator gets a copy of the FBI report on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee judge Kavanaugh\nThere'll be a report of there'll be a vote in the full Senate this week\nMcConnell wants more to say with certainty\nThey'll get the FBI report this week and they will be a report this week those two facts according to Mitch McConnell\nOnly senators can look at it as I said earlier\nAnd McConnell said he's going to fight any Democrat times to attempt to delay so he's going to get it done and luckily as majority leader he has the power to do that or there was some questions myself included as to whether Mitch McConnell\nWould go to that extreme\nTo just simply uses\nFull power when the Democrats tried to delay and of course they will\nAs to whether or not\nHe would overrule the Democrats trying to stop the boat\nAnd the answer is that he will that's what he says at least\n[noise] so we'll see how that the transpires [noise] well that's good news is that the McConnell his very focused [noise] he's were phrase these good when a couple of speeches in the last two days on the floor of the Senate talking about the Democrat reprehensible strategy and the good man's judge Kavanaugh was that a stellar records impeccable records\nAnd that he events that have the vote on the floor this week so that'll be good news and he will win\nOr if it gets to stay with us thanks for listening\nLong distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body\nGet relief for your neck or

just as he has been during his career is not the only one speaking out on the eve of the key procedure alone in the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForget it\nRight now the Republicans have a forty two seat advantage\nThat could go away if people in the Republican side and also the independence I do not see the way clear to voting for Republicans that could all go away\n\nAs Donald Trump junior said think about giving the house Nancy Pelosi\n\nIt would be a disaster for this country he said\nThe answer for Donald Trump junior as we've got to turn out and we've got to bring our friends along with us and really there's no longer any excuse people to say well I'm not a political activist I support the president but I'm not a political activist you know the answer that is yeah but you have friends you have relatives you have neighbors you have loved ones\nYou could put up a sign on your yard you could volunteer to make phone calls but the simplest thing for everyone is emailing everybody you know send out a mass email to all of your email list\nAbout voting for the president's choices voting for Republicans in the house and Republicans in the Senate it's very simple\nAnd it needs to be done\nI remember back in Nineteen Ninety four that happened who are doing I was hosting a program in Seattle and in that year Tom Foley was the speaker of the house from Spokane, Washington and a guy named George another cut\nA newcomer ran against him and we mobilized\nEven though I was in Seattle which is across the mountains from Spokane we mobilize the whole lot of people and not only for another cut but for other Republican candidates because Ninety four was a very powerful year\nAnd the vote in November of Ninety four for Republicans across the country and in the state of Washington and it turned out that we had eight out of nine house seats controlled by Democrats going into that election\nAs a result of the grassroots people I mean we have people from Seattle driving foreign five hours to Spokane to stay over there for days at a time knocking on doors for this fellow George Nethercutt\nTo go after the most powerful member of the house Tom Foley he was speaker no speaker never been voted out before\nI remember the speaker of the house is number three on the list to become president if anything happened to the president and vice president next person the speaker of the house to become president so it's a highly powerful position\n\nAnd you just don't lose\nWell it turns out that George Nethercutt\nCreated history and one and as I said seven out of nine congressional seats went to Republicans that you would have thought in fact Newt Gingrich came out and did an interview on my show when he was in Seattle because he was thrilled about what happened in Washington state which has been and still is a very liberal\nState but it turned in that year and my message now would be very simple we've had a lot of\nSuccess during the past\nYear plus under Donald Trump year and a half whatever you're an eight months\nAnd to lose that would be devastating\nIt'd be like being out on a desert finding a canteen of water to punch your first and then not finding any more water and your life becomes\nPasse because you couldn't find any more water\nIn other words you're getting a taste of the good life\nAnd then is taken away from you that's what would happen if the Democrats were to win the house or the Senate or both and it can be done by people who understand the value of this administration and Donald Trump's policies to the American people [noise]\nBy getting out [noise] not voting but also [noise]\nGetting out there and helping other people understand the power of keeping the house and Senate in\nIs your price of investment

[noise] it seems like the news cycle never ends the changes every twenty minutes\nAnd it is a very powerful in terms of the way in which the Democrats have demeaned denigrated um destroyed insulted and derogatory misused our political system\nBy going into the gutter politics\nOf the\nKinds of personal destruction the politics of personal destruction\nThat's what they do and you know ironically and was Richard Gephardt who was the house minority leader for the Democrats back in the nineties when Newt Gingrich was a speaker\nRichard Gephardt was the ... leader and he was a you could say it was a liberal Democrat but he was reasonable he actually was against NAFTA and the same way the president is because of what it did to the American worker\nAnd he represented a whole lot of people working in factories and blue collar workers in St Louis and so it was ironic\nThat he wound up\nReally in many ways supporting what word than Reagan Democrats early on and they'll become Trump\nDemocrats who switched to Republicans because Democrats left them or get parts stayed with him\nAnd he was one who said there was a Republican who was going to become speaker of the house\nFrom the south forget his name but he was somebody that wound up being a scandal that he had an affair in those days in the nineties I guess having an affair was a big deal except if you were both Clinton and you can get away with the rape of Juanita Broderick nobody hold you accountable\nBut others were held accountable if you if you were a Republican in this Republican from the south was going to become speaker\nWound up resigning\nBecause the Democrats out at him for having had an affair of course if every member of Congress were outed because they had an affair and then after I had to leave Congress because of it you wouldn't have anybody left on either side\nAnd so at that point ... said we've got to stop this politics of personal destruction meaning that\nThe answer for some was to go after the opponent personally find a scandal and go after that opponent\nInstead of\nWith the issues on the basis of the members of the issues if you can't be somebody on the issues than the answer is beat them personally knock 'em out completely and so that's what we got two in those days\nWell the president without referring to that period of time when he stopped a before getting on the marine one helicopter today took some\nQuestions on the lawn at the White House from reporters and he was asked about the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh the president made an important point he said it's a scary time\nBut he said it was scary primarily for young men\nHe said men are now guilty until proven innocent which is the opposite of the tradition and history of this country in totalitarian dictatorships yes you are guilty\nUntil proven innocent no question\n\nWe have never believed that\nWe've never behave that way\nAnd that's what the president met\nPresident said it's very scary situation when you're guilty until proven innocent he said it's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something you may not be guilty of\nMeaning simply that you can be alleged to have committed an act and that\nEither makes you criminal or scandal lives as you the means your integrity the means your character\nEven though there's no proof for just an allegation\nAnd although the president said it would not have to be a woman it could be anybody\nAlleging has did something wrong but pretty much it's about women having the power now and I am ... women need to listen to the horrific way in which we had this Hollywood and I'm a political\nAnd um\nMedia scandal and you know the names Matt Lauer NBC Charlie Rose at CBS and PBS YOU had Harvey Weinstein in in the film industry Kevin Spacey the actor\nTom Brokaw alleged to have groped a woman she said he did it she was very specific about what she said happened\nAnd the list goes on and on and on Les Moonves the most powerful guy in the media perhaps is God his professional life is over his reputation as God he may have great wealth\nBut as as a reputation\nAs an individual in terms of status he's diminished completely and so all the others I mentioned they're nowhere to be found anymore in the proper for them to stay quiet and silent and hidden\nBut that doesn't mean that you go forward with other cases and then it automatically means the person's telling the truth each case needs to be taken on its own merit or lack of merit and the cases I just mentioned clearly the women
