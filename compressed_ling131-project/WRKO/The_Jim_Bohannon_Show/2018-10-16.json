{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Because they've already been prepared for that so in other words if I'm a ... for example that Bill Clinton is only going to get to the Hillary and bill but um and he would have been to a forthcoming about Monica Lewinsky from the get go\nIt would be the fused he would have ... to people because people say well he admitted it so it's over and done with is that there was ... it was consensual by both parties what's the big deal [noise] same thing with Trump by the way\nStormy Daniels would have gone away and five seconds of he admitted and I don't know if he had the affair with her or the one night stand but\nIf he had said that if he did\nAnd admitted it if he if he actually if it actually happened it would have gone away it's an occupation that eliminates because what what's left for ... to say it from says yeah I did that and yeah he was my own funds to make a deal hush money deal\nWhat do you what do you do then\nYeah what you're basically disarming your opponent\nExactly that's what he's doing exactly\nAnd he's doing this at if you look at it almost every topic\nUm he says that you know for example go back to the Paris climate\nAccord that remember he said we're going to look into the Paris and we're going to look into it we're going to think about it and everybody said oh he's backing off of climate change that agreement but then what does he do it comes in\nAnd that falls out of it right up but he was letting people sort of think he's thinking about it and it's not really showing their than he basically kind of giving people hand but not real but you have to watch when you listen to 'em or where he is in his uh ultimate\nStrategy is he is he trying to get in on board to have a discussion is that an opening negotiations a boy or something else and that and then he he marches or whatever is real objective at about\n... I think in many ways is very clever\nWell that's what I that's why I raise that because it's it's it's still fulfills the theory of an occupation in persuasion theory where a\n... or your communication back or\nAnd and well and they ah we used to teach that I mean it's still they still do it's it's it's just the basic premise the premise of persuasion theory that you would not killing people in advance and has less impact a I and then when it when somebody tries to come up against you later\nOr when you admit something you've defused it completely let me turn to um\nOur good friend Hilary whose father all over the place a very interesting that she says that it was not an abuse of power by bill even though you have an intern with the president of the United states if that's not a a dichotomy or a complete separation of power\nEither there's no equality there I mean the scale will be to completely down or up depending on which one it is yes he says there's no abuse of power\nAnd uh he should not have ah resigned the when he was she was asked if he should resign she said no um what is it would just first that part of it what does that do in terms of the public image in the discussion is now taking place\nI think it makes her look hypocritical I think a lot of people in the uh the problems with her position\nAnd you know basically supporting her husband despite its bad behavior and certainly in lieu of me to move and current thinking or what is it would be less supportive of anyone who um goes over the limit their uh it just makes her look ah less credible and that\nAnd uh but it also seems to me at least is very damaging they're now going on a tour apparently a stadium tour to raise money I'm ... I had a fellow on this program Joel Joel Gilbert the aim of film producer right those sort of a conservative documentary\nIs he said he thinks he's running\nAnd now they're going on in the stadium tour\nA and I presume if they raise money maybe it'll use that for a campaign or she's been out there publicly she certainly isn't hiding the ... the ... thinks that she's going to be out there trying to campaign for president\nOh I think he is but let me uh make up production you know I like my ... from the data and that is a using that data on her a capability of bringing people for it or\nAre they kind of activities I think it's going to stop I doubt if she'll get passed for you to be ... I think they're going to have such low attendance that they're going to be losing too much ... limit\nBecause I don't think she can get a crowd out any more I don't think people just willing to you know do what they do with Trump they're not wanting to circle building or stadium or a you know some type of large arena ah with people who are going to just sit there and St\n... Obama audiences or or going to be all extremely enthusiastic like Trump audience so I I think it's an attempt\nA to run for president I think she is running for president I don't think she'll get the first base I don't think she'll get the nomination and I think this particular chore is going to end or in another step back and frustration for both\nWell yeah if if they don't get enough people up there you better believe that that's what's gonna happen uh that'll be the nail in the coffin politically for sure uh yeah for a fellow wrote a piece\nI'm In the week and he wrote this about Hillary\nPossibly running so the real Hillary as sarcasm here the real Hillary's the moderate New York senator who inherited her seat from Daniel Patrick Moynihan\nThe woman who ran a vicious race baiting primary campaign against Brock Obama the unwavering supporter of the Iraq War the architects of our ill fated Libyan excursion the Osama hunter wouldn't be Assad destroy your the welfare queen shame or the tough on crime denounce or of super predators\nAnd quote\nI think [laughter] I mean if somebody should take that paragraph of and then the Democratic primary and just use that against ... really the bottom line she is she and he had become have gone from the from the Pentagon to the basement I mean they're they're kinda like Richard Nixon in that respect aren't they\n[noise] yeah well I think even worse than that I I think Nixon was smart enough to do and it was time to go home so to speak and that I don't think they know it's time to wait I think they want to pick up where they left off a\nTrump was the diversion a a beat them but now they want to go back go back to the power the center of power\nAnd running a party I I don't think they're going to get the first ... I really don't think they have or within the party\nAnd with the ... well yeah that was that was my question about it because we're running out of time the ... the party ... numbers\nThe Democratic party would reject them that doesn't have to be is the American people\nJust the party itself well yeah I I think there's no question the party over ... maybe maybe her uh Arab parent is across the aisle Cortez what do you make of that I don't think he'll go first [laughter] young who runs at least at least Hilary knows a little more\nPolitics that's a lot of them are there then Ocasio Cortez fact for Merrill is a pleasure rebel ourselves out of that technical problem thank you so great to talk to you ... do\nThey care if you owe any money to the IRS you need to call this toll free number right now eight hundred five one one to zero wait for that eight hundred five one one to zero eight for Uncle Sam has the power to make your life miserable\nYou could stop the collection process right now by calling eight hundred five one one to zero aid for that eight hundred five one one to zero eight for when you called the tech support group\nYou'll get free information on how you can reduce your back taxes including penalties and interest you could also be helped if you have an found returns attacks lean wage garnishment bank levy or if you have entered into a payment plan and can't make the payments\nStop Uncle Sam right now make the free called that could help you and the worry today eight hundred five one one to zero eight for that's eight hundred five one one to zero eight for eight hundred five one one to zero eight for eight hundred five one one to zero aid for\n[noise] alright V. be a trip to another hurricane ravaged area\nAnd ... going to Saudi Arabia we got some stuff going on we're not even talking about the DNA does anymore [laughter] well we may be though 'cause we don't know how this they'll shake out I'm predicting the president's eventually ways and we'll talk about it all begins tomorrow morning six AM\nHim in vi V. weekday mornings sake they've had a follow voice of Boston\nSuddenly you R K oh\nThis\nIs Joel Johnson from the program money wisdom right here on W.

O. do voice of Boston money wisdom we talk about your money investments\nRetirement estate planning taxes all of the things that go into you having a successful financial future whether you're already retired or getting close to retirement tune in Sunday Morning seven AM W. R. Cale the voice the\nVoice of Boston you walk walking around in one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and my heart radio station [noise]\nFrom Haiti is\nOntario holding or at the U.S is working with Saudi Arabia and turkey to\nToday is valid and worthy of being in existence\nThe founding fathers by the way never intended for that it'd be a national vote\nOr national plebiscite or national determination on the popular vote to elect presidents they actually want it to preserve federalism\nThey want to integrate the best is the majority rule and also a necessary protection of minority but the majority would rule in fact\nAnd so these people don't even understand why the Senate exists and why the electoral college exists\nLeft wing is now talking about the Senate as a dark Republican conspiracy I mean the Senate how horrified I didn't hear them saying that when the low life the graded a trash by the name of Harry Reid was Senate majority leader he's nothing but political trash\nIs garbage Harry Reid's lied about Mitt Romney not paying taxes and then he said so what\nYou didn't win the election he didn't care that he lied out now wide\nAnd then then defended the lying\nBecause the one that's the kind of crap you want from of somebody's supposed to be in a leadership position Harry Reid is nothing but the lowest of the low but none of the people on the left complained about him with is the greatest way of running the Senate and it was degraded\nHe was above bully he never gave the Republicans any kind of a dignity any kind\nOf position any kind of legitimacy and they kind of input even protect the minority in that case that all well\nThe founders realize\nThat the representatives in the smaller states worried about the interests of the larger states for obvious reasons that they would be overwhelmed by the larger states if you had a popular vote because California New York Illinois\nAnd a few other states could decide the election\nAnd says the urban centers are mostly left wing radicals these days\nWhy even bother\nWhy not create a system\nThat game every state some input into the presidential election that's what the founders did for that reason so this was a compromise and preserving the concept of federalism in the states have the power\nThat the federal government does not\nNow the founders gave\nThe Senate very specific powers\nAnd in regard to executive branch nominees the Senate would advise and consent\nAnd that means that they would in fact\nGive the okay\nOr thumbs down to nominees of the president of the United states\nAnd in the house would control spending because all bills have to emigrate from the house ways and Means Committee and so they try to create this dispersion of power which they did beautifully and creating our constitutional federalist system\nSo the house represents democracy\nAnd the Senate represents the equal power of the states within the federal system\nAnd of course the set up some more tempered branch of government because it's a six year term and a smaller number it's an elite fraternity with six year terms in the house of course turns over every two years that's just the way it happens\nAnd so we have the\nReally rode the well designed and well engineered political structure that creates what we have today now when this left wing radical crowd says well wait a minute we don't have\nFairness in the Senate\nThe point is when the when if these people knew anything there illiteracy in political history\nAnd philosophy on a scale of one to ten is about minus six they're illiterate\nPure prone purely illiterate they just want what they want to fit their own needs they don't want something that's a fair system you couldn't have a fair system the Senate gives every state equal representation in the upper body of the Congress the Senate\nEvery state has two senators that means every state is equal in the Senate\nAnd it's a smaller number and therefore it gives every state\nEqual representation they wanted to keep the state's having a federal control\nAnd federal ability\nTo have input into what happens in terms of\nThe operation of government between the states and the federal government and then the house is worth a democracy is\nI think it's approximately five hundred thousand people per\nHer congressional district in the house there's four hundred and thirty five members of the house only a hundred members of the Senate which means the four hundred and thirty five members of the house all presumed equal in terms of the numbers\nEach of those districts having one representative [noise] to go to the house of representatives [noise] ... that's where there is the Democratic\nProcess because that's where California might have and I'm not sure of the number they might have fifty members of the house and my only might have two members of the house because of the difference of population so population applies to the house but not to the Senate that give us balance the state's get control and the popular vote also gets can stay\nHere\nLab skipping out later\nThat no one ever ... have a literal Don I'm an addict self cleaning live on
