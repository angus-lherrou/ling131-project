{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "But then in addition from what I've read\nAnd I'm not an expert investigator of a lot of these type of hairs but from what I hear a she's been accused of making false accusations\nAnd uh he's been involved in a lot of a strain that affects role I at ...\nBy the way uh I think that's going to disintegrate I Will do you believe that that will disintegrate because she said I Can't\nI don't think that's going to go anywhere with five look at who are lawyer who am I haven't had a yeah that's the other thing but his reputation as sort of questionable\nAnd she uh I I think I'm without anything more tangible or it's just going to go away there's there's nothing to it then they bring out today and the New York times\nAs an undergraduate student at Yale Brett Kavanaugh was involved in an altered ... and the local bar during when she was accused of throwing ice on another patron according to a police report\nGamma through a through I sent a guy I guess that it was glass maybe did took some ... vice if he did it\nAnd that's what they're saying\nAnd uh he was he was interviewed by the police that will no charges against anybody the whole thing was dropped and that was the end of that I mean ... do you want to go through everybody's a microscopic series of events in their lives that maybe wasn't kosher\nUh I I don't get this I don't I don't get this\nWell once again it's it's not it's not the actual events if the ideology they do not want to lose the Supreme Court because let's face it\nOr the left has lost the house they lost the Senate they've lost the White House they've lost all sorts of the state governorship all sorts of state legislative bodies all sorts of other states around the country are at their worst state of affairs Nineteen twenties and almost a hundred years\nOr they're on their way out of business basically if you look at all the different variables that I look at it constitute a successful political party and I look back\nUh every one of them is is hurting and uh you know this is like a last ditch attempt to try to keep their cells in power is to keep that Supreme Court because then they can overturn every bag\nSo now you may you know they also have now is as we learn today the court is going back to work and has eight members as it did before um right after Justice Scalia\nPassed away and justice Gorsuch or was was finally the night's vote tear 'em but now of course Kennedy's gone so somebody has to replace him\nAnd um they've got they've got\nNobody there to to break the tie and maybe if they just accomplish that the Democrats they figure they've won because it'll be gridlock at the Supreme Court for another term\nWell that's what I'd like to think they'd like to think they'll get than at that like to think they're going to get the White House the twenty twenty but I'll tell you what the odds on both of those are pretty slim\nAnd nevertheless that this is for most Americans this was holding up the legitimate process of the work the Supreme Court does\nAnd I think that um then the the\nJustify the means on the part of the Democrats which they've always done which is frankly immoral or a moral a means that we don't care that the court can't do its business in fact we're delighted that over a conservative president\nPresented conservative positions on issues said he would appoint conservatives to the Supreme Court the people elected him on that basis maybe the most important issue of everything and that was run on\nAnd then the Democrats turn around and try to up and that in other words insulting the populous who voted for this president for that very reason\nRight but I Do think um you know on a positive note even though that's the way it is right now I Do think that the Trump will say that the FBI does and it says to everything you can do it in seven days\nAnd I think soon after I think Mitch McConnell's tuned up\nAnd ready to hold a vote I think Brett Kavanaugh is going to be on it all V. it lightly behind schedule but I think there'll be a Supreme Court very soon I think what's interesting is try to anticipate what's gonna happen when Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nWere tires or resign and a year or so\nWhile she claims as I thought it was kind of cute she said I'm going to be here the through the next five years till the end of the second term of bottles from\nWhich is what I'm kicking Ninety [laughter] I don't know you can work that way why well see I don't know what it's going to be a battle if you do leave [laughter]\nOh my gosh well it'll be easier I think because I think I mentioned before the break then we got into the break\nThere was a woman Amy Baron I Believe her name is she's a conservative on the yeah sure on the seventh circuit I Believe a federal appeals court and she's a conservative a woman and uh you you watch what happens to the Democrats if they try to help and her and this this whole thing\nI have a nice person very great jobs\nYeah and I think she'll be the one who pick and that would have that would avoid that kind of touched that with a ten foot pole to try to stop her because uh the the women would with the rest of the women would be more than the Democrats can handle\nA that would report came out the majority leader Mitch McConnell says the Senate will hold a vote on Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination this week\nHe said the time for analysts delaying obstruction has come to a close judge Kavanaugh's nomination is out of committee were considering it here on the floor and will be voting this week and quote period case closed how about that\nRight what I think it's going to fall through I think he's really tuned up I think he really\nWants to get a lot of the people put on the Koran bench and especially the Supreme Court justices when there is an opening so I think he's going to move ahead quickly I think he's also going to move ahead of the mother ship was well various or ... or\nBy the way um the other point I Would make is that I don't think the next ... judge would be as difficult because once they get this one that becomes the majority and uh so going from five to six is not the same thing is going from four to five\nAnd the other thing is that ah when Ruth Bader Ginsburg probably retire but whatever uh it's got to be much work for the better\nAnd that which are which are from your lips to God's Ears I keep telling me that was my mother used to say so let's hope or if that happens in this country is going to be recover itself\nYeah it's going to be much easier and we are going that way remember what I always liked the fate\nOf friends as far as the trends are France and the trends are that way\nWell that's that's what I like to hear we will talk to you next week Merrill I'm a I feel better now that we've had a conversation about what's happening in November and we'll keep you are right on top of that with us and we appreciate your being here always look forward to talking to a next month they have a great we paint on with you\nYou take good care to thank you like to drive a Marilyn

pro W arcane yo came envy me I have no idea why you passionately label means you're going to get some more is now Jeff coon hound I miss something how we are the new boss same as the old boss\nLet's talk about me okay because he's the voice of Boston\nW.

I. F. Y. on demand gum user code Boston to say twenty five dollars on your first job ... the whole maintenance without the hassle\nSo voice of Boston you walk walking around in one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\nSo he risks his entire fortunate on that film and it paid off big time it became a very very popular film and or the ... but because of the\nHarrowing story that it was about a guy who led his people out of tried to leave his people out of bondage out of slavery and as I said they weren't successful uh but they came pretty close\nHe would be in the same category as in my opinion Mahatma Gandhi who basically free to India from Great Britain he led that peaceful protest\nHe'd be the same to the slaves in Rome\nAs ... was to freeing in the ... and the Hindus from Great Britain and not being enslaved by Great Britain Dr Martin Luther king who had numerous civil rights laws passed or African Americans to get equality in America would be in the same category Moses\nFrankly who did the same thing by freeing the Jews from Egypt would be in the same category\nThose four together Moses Mahatma Gandhi Spartacus and Dr Martin Luther king junior would be of that magnitude as role models as inspirational figures\nNow if you're going to tell me that senator Cory Booker\nHad a Spartacus moment belongs in that group you'd be left out of the city out of the country out of the nation out of the world\nIt's absurd the guy doesn't come close in fact he's not even on the same page as those kinds of inspirational leaders\nHe's at an amorphous sees it he's trans parent you can see right through Cory Booker and when he tries to do he's cowardly and he's a coward because he called judge Kavanaugh\nEvil part of that even move but\nWhen he wouldn't say it to his face at the Senate hearing I was hoping that judge Kevin I Would say to him 'cause just Kevin uh brought up the fact that a senator he didn't use his name you set a senator for it to me is evil\nI would've loved judge Kavanaugh to say the Senate a book or when he came to ask questions settled a book or how about\nSaying to my face would set in the media about me that I'm evil as I just mentioned here and my statement and see what he says if he has the guts to call into his face what he called them behind his back but that's Cory Booker\n\nHe's simply patronizing to those things that he wants to use\nTo improve his political fortunes and there's no doubt that the sexual problems he hadn't touching women in places he should never touched them without their permission which he admitted to doing\nThat the only reason he admitted it was because he wanted to have it out on the table and clear it up because he was no doubt at the time and he he made it public he wanted to a cleanse himself of that\nTrade or characteristic of improperly touching women because it was going to run for political office which obviously did\nSo he's not he couldn't have Spartacus moment thousands of people in the film and then reality would have stood up\nAnd said I Am Spartacus no I Am Spartacus no I Am Spartacus\nAnd they would have died for Spartacus gladly but it is also the case that\nCory Booker couldn't get two people\nTo stand up and and and die for him and say I'm Cory Booker or if if something had happened where we're tired wanted Cory Booker outed\nHe couldn't get anybody to do that he didn't have a Spartacus moment because it wouldn't have the people who would be so inspired by him as to be willing to give their lives for him\nI have no doubt people who are in the African American community some would have given their lives with Dr Martin Luther king if they could have saved ... life\nI have no doubt that in the spring of the people from Egypt the Jewish people that some people would have died in place of Moses and that people would have died from ... mackenzie\nBut if anyone fixing their right mind that Cory Booker would have anyone die for him\nAs was depicted in the film and that's what he meant by this particular moment is what everybody else stood up when the when the when the Roman dictator played by Laurence Olivier said who Spartacus he started to stand up\nAnd then all these other slaves his followers said I Am Spartacus and they went on from there everybody says the same thing [noise]\nAh Cory Booker is living in his own delusional dream world will be thinks he's of that magnitude\nHe's simply a back room politician he doesn't have the moral high ground\nHe is a absolutely I'm\nPolitically expedient in using judge Kavanaugh to make is a problem for his own benefit [noise]\nWe'll be right back Mike Segal here stay with us\nHere\nI allowed skipping out later\nThat no one ever ... had a

[noise]\nWell I'm asking false above [noise] tenor\nOf this country the mood\nOf the culture\nThe backdrop where we are\nAnd\nHow we are now going through and unbelievably anger wishing situation with judge Kavanaugh\nQuestions being raised about things that never getting raised nobody ever has had questions raised about going back to high school or the one out drinking on a friday night with your friends\nWe did it graduation I from high school we were certainly one out\nI mean that's what happens only going to the nice somebody a Supreme Court seat because they went out and had a few drinks\nAnd the allegation\nWhatever the case is Dr Ford certainly presented with sincerity and credibility her view her description of what happened\nBut there's no core operation there's no date there's no place there's no time\nThe people who she claimed would confirm it did not\nAnd so just unfounded allegations he looked you could easily have it I'm not saying that she didn't have a problem with something well does she believes she was attacked whether she was attacked\nBut there's nothing beyond the allegation that judge Kavanaugh did anything and frankly that's not enough and the reason is simple it's not because\nShe's not believe all it's because in order to bring somebody down\nFrom consideration for Supreme Court seat or for any other nomination than any other seat\nEven though we know that the\nStandards of a criminal trial do not apply it's not that standard frankly it's a political process and we know that the Senate of the the Senate is going to the side\nUp or down whether in fact judge Kavanaugh becomes a member of the United States Supreme court and that's a political decision subtle legal decision\nThere's no rules of evidence there's no constitutional protection that gives you absolute rights when it comes to the Supreme Court but certainly the concept of fairness the notice of the issue and the opportunity to be heard\nAre vital and having at least something tangible to go on because anybody I could I could get a hold of a woman\nWho went to high school with a Richard Blumenthal the liar from Connecticut on the United States Senate Judiciary Committee\nAnd she could just say\nWhen we were in high school Richard Blumenthal came after me the he grabbed me when nobody was looking took me into the ladies' room and took me into one of the stalls and raped me\nNow how in the world and even ...\nBlumenthal I Would give him the benefit of the doubt if nobody else could confirmed that just saying it doesn't mean that happened she could say it because he didn't like him but that's not the case with\nDr Ford I realize I apparently they hardly knew each other facts are as a judge Kavanaugh said he did he didn't know a doctor for it at all\nBut\nTo have any one just throw out an allegation and have it stick is what we should be concerned about in this country\nBecause men are getting accused wrongfully how many guys that we've seen\nAnd there have been a number I mean they've been in the dozens that I've read reports about where the DNA test Fifteen or Twenty years later now the DNA testing exists demonstrated\nThat that person did not commit that rape because they would have saved from the rape kit they would have saved the seeming\nOf the races and and there are these cases that have happened where guys were behind bars for ten Fifteen Twenty years and never committed the crime\nAnd then the innate testing show that in fact they didn't commit the crime and they were released but what happens is that ten or Fifteen or Twenty years of their life in the meantime\n\nIt's it's just very troubling and it shouldn't exist in the way that it does and Donald Trump junior is chimes in on this\n\nHe basically said was the he said she said allegation wives can be ruined\nAnd um the president's son made a great point he said he fears more for his son's than for his daughters in this case has five kids by the way\n\nHe said it's got boys and he's got girls he says when he sees what's going on and it's scary and it was with his girlfriend the Kimberley go for it we used to be on Fox News channel doing this interview\n\nWith Donald Trump junior set is what I think anybody believes who's fair somebody who's fair\nThat Americans should give sexual assault accusers a fair hearing if you accuse somebody of sexual assault by all means the typically it's women who do that yeah let's hear from you but the other side of that coin is\nThere has to be that same ability for the accused to be heard as well\nAnd because of the political backdrop\nOf this case which is obvious because it's Democrats", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Boston", "day": "02"}
