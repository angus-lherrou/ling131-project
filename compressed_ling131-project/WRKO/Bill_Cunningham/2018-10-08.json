Michael Evan ... boy he did a great job for the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous\nAntithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact the cast light away from away from a a from a doctor forward and Debbie ... and put it on sweating nobody believed\nIn fact here's a quote from Senator Collins on Saturday quote\nSome of the allegations Lebanon against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important\nI'm thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor forward but at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls and use their weaken stayed to facilitate gang rape this outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence\nAnd simply parrot it public statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process\nIs a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote\nSo said a Senator Susan Collins and that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael ... is doing a great job representing the Democratic party and needs to keep doing it\nPlus uh as far as supporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin all\nBut I read some way of a expert from the independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on ... spent on my show many times wrote a column a sudden this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kavanaugh she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe the survivors of sexual assault it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kavanaugh was lying and you must have poses confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury\nSitting in a rape matter my sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late a DNA testing\nRape rape is to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory towns and Van Dyke Perry who's spending combine thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime\nAnd the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from ... sure their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow students and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it got an innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate\nIn other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock\nOf American Jurisprudence this goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process in fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor crocheting afford that completely falling apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement and we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator her own uh of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports\nShe could not say that as wrongful activity she couldn't say

made this point with her about two weeks ago then I'm of course a man and you may be a woman but if you're a woman you're probably married to a man or was married to a man or want to be married to a man\nYour father was a man what kind of feeling step towards your husband and your dad your brothers are male what kind of feeling stabbed toward them and you may have male children or grandchildren you want to live in a world where because of your gender your automatically just believed or believed\nIn other words every now and then a woman lies and every now and then the man is not guilty of rape or sexual assault happens all the time\nSo you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because a man is charged he's got to shut up there was a line to be murdered merged between the me too movement on one hand and what ... percent acceptance on the other\nThe fact you want to believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do is a criminal defense attorney a take off my hat and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen or a person says my house was burglar eyes or victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault naturally want to believe that person\nBut then if a person is charged I Want to live with\nWorld that says that person is due process rights because that is the rigorous reaction of substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor forward through a any rigorous process\nThat determined to but she was saying was accurate now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people got attacked or what had happened how it happened ... how old she was\nThe timeframe that happened in the two front door was the kind of hard the fearing to fly was ridiculous and her boyfriend came out in fact she was a safe\nAnd some of these other factors come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally is not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News after she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself now hold up on that car let's find out\nWhat Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says to save it's accurate\nThe two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight\nNot twenty twelve and it went in not because she needed an extra way out but because a small business owner a therapist want it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door that had nothing to do it costs for phobia\nAnd the boyfriend follows the affidavit saying wait for little planes all over French Polynesia and ... and uh Hawaii\nWe also went on trips to Central America South America and Europe she had no fear of flying it was a lie\nIn fact there was nothing she said factually that turned out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about finding the truth they had a ball face mitigated allegation\nThat could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you want to get into the veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said\nShe has mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and the person with the Y chromosomes that's a liar\nBut then the troops came out and it's like well don't don't bother me with the facts that's what caused a writer for the Kobe or CBS late night show to say quote aerial doom is said quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as

in Wisconsin welcome to the bill Cunningham show Mike how are you\nA great really how are you good really I think we need to learn from experience and you had an earlier caller I think it was prior maybe yet it that was an inspiring phone call because he like he was a traditional Democrat and he's now come over to our side\nHow are we going to get more people to come over our side I think there are three ways number three I think there are people like Brian saw\nOn only dishonest they are downright evil they will do nothing to get a power\nNumber two that Democrats looks socialist progress is incapable of analyzing back whether it be about climate change whether it be the lives that that Dr Ford presented in front of the Senate tradition\nProvable lies that still are ignored by the mainstream media provable lie\nI Want to be ... say they're misconceptions but damn it they were alive because she lied about flying\nShe lied about that second front door she lied about them for boys became one she lied about or late teens now it's Fifteen she lied about the fact that was the mid Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty two because Greg Kevin ... in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nAnd and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to like that is by\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yeah I talked to Collins hats off to Lindsey Graham about political forces the only way that we are going to be cut and we can avoid a civil war as your last guest said how can we do that by Bruce winning forced by beating them at the ballot\nGotta when you got to vote you gotta you know Schumer said one thing Saturday that was correct you got to vote but then if you take away the Democratic party from the coast and about seven or eight major cities\nThere is no Democrats hardly anywhere there's this sea of red from seed a shining city it say irrelevant minimalist party but the problem is the mainstream media is there a megaphone\nAnd the major media will not cover objectively this president nor any Republican president they didn't cover Alito correctly that didn't cover Roberts and look what they did a cabin all look what's next to Amy Coney Barrett ought to be the next Supreme Court justice\nAnd from Notre Dame and when that happens all hell is going to break loose and Barbie gene ... meets her maker you watch that fight\n[noise] really didn't need to thank you today Eric Holder who still contempt of Congress to say that now we have to call into question the legitimacy of this of the Supreme Court let me see Billy for the last forty years since Nineteen thirty seven says conservatives had a majority on the Supreme Court we never questioned malignancy of a prominent\nBut now all of a sudden when we go through a legitimate process of confirmation all of a sudden they stand up and say we've got to question the whole legitimacy a process do you recall outrageous\nDo recall in the third debate that Trump made a Trump was asked whether or not if he lost the election if he would accept it\nAnd the media has a meltdown one Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept the results in November elections if he felt it was rigged against him and the media Hillary Clinton the New York times jumped on top of Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone thought a course sailor was going to win\nMen Trump won and up to this point\nHillary and the major media has not accepted the outcome of the election and so they'd be came with big criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said I may not accept the outcome of the election because it looked like it it's ranked however\nThe media went after him Hillary one after him Hillary said let's be clear about what are you saying and that means he's talking down in American democracy and I'm appalled that someone is the nominee of one of the two major parties would take that position quote unquote Mallory Clinton\nBut then Trump won and Hillary never considered the election she never accepted the ballot box\nNew York times never accepted the fact that Trump won\nSo they became what they criticize it was nothing but nothing short of a ... and thank you for your call let's continue now with a Joe and New Hampshire it's been there for about an hour show in New Hampshire welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joe go ahead\nI could Mr Cunningham thanks for taking my call um I agree with everything that's been said prior to ... and your summation of everything so there's no need for me to repeat any of that but what I'm calling you about tonight is so important to have you ever heard of John and\nSimon and his book code red about a ... vote and Russia encouraged in America actually in the cities\nYeah I I think that there is\nA bind up him example in the city of Cleveland there were more votes cast for Obama than citizens registered in certain words and and it's because the\nBecause Cleveland's in an important state my home state of Ohio I'm sure there's massive voter fraud and Chicago New York and whatever but Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there was hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast\nBecause of the tabulation system and there's no check and balance 'cause there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're ... code red China concern would be an excellent guess for your show before the terms but here's for thing\nThe way it works with the algorithms and the machine and the companies that are going to say that I think it's only three or four for the entire country and it's done in the cities\nAnd what you would have is a situation where the machine as program where the Democrat as a thousand actual votes cast Republican has an actual votes cast the machine's gonna say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance\nAnd the person that runs the city that Democrats in most cases they're the ones that oversee the installation of the ballots for the term who's on the ballot what have you know and the machine can be corrupted and the algorithm would a\nWaiver from Republican to add to the Democrats\nOr give me the name of the guy in the book again I'm going to talk to my producer\nJonathan Simon and the book is code red and he was a guest on coast to coast a month ago when I ... it was on three hours and it was really riveting and it's been happening for a decade\nLibel I Believe that and I believe in major
