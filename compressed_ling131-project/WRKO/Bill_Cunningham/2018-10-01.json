I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kind of look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and ah after a doctor forwarded testified the the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace said\nForge testimony is extremely emotional extremely Raul extremely credible no uh no one could listen to our delivery delivery of those words and talk about the is sold in the impact it at our life and not have your heart go out there this is a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon\nJudge ended up ... generally I respect said I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible Karl Rove the great political theorist said forward as a credible unbelievable so when when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's\nTestimony and the silliness the Democrats showed toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flipped completely ... but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have an Android Apollo Tono and Karl Rove saying that a woman is credible\nWho provide as witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all\nWhen you have ah Christine Ford straight up lying about her in capability of flying which you flew everywhere but every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering and the woman who once the anonymity to testify\nTurn down the opportunity to be questioned in private and then we find out her lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all\nSo every time I tried to test her credibility\nMegan bart that turns out to be great grossly lacking so when conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't it we completely lost our way\n[laughter] right I think my ... to Colorado yeah you know completely lost our way because when I sat down Trump never had a chance of winning\nThe people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to laugh at your testimony that the ... I found Brett Kavanaugh to people even though there was such a notion from both the accused\nIn a man who in a in a court of public opinion and they aren't they I mean not that I'm hearing a life with completely turned upside down his wife with getting that threat\nAnd his career with looking to be entirely sabotage and destroyed as well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I do believe that something happened to her\nI she obviously has been in therapy for that age I she sat her so she has two front doors you know anybody that has to climb doorbell no there's no snow obviously she had an issue\nNow it just because she had something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of it\nAnd all that or that it just because she sounds Brett Kavanaugh raped or maybe not but all the evidence that she for that so far all started being additives\nIn fact if you presented us in a court of law in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in God's or\nWho have no motivation on line or a light all who said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh\nAll of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did now they'll get discount Marts judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did then wheeling Kaiser her best girlfriend\nSaid they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know I don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that well I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the President's Day in twenty sixteen but the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't happen till November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about Brett Kavanaugh getting the Supreme Court what his name one on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Chris Rock Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know because I\n... exactly what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case it fell short of being an assault case [laughter] however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility to order a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had a beat the post let me tell you something\nI wasn't given lawyers from the defensive side that tripped me with kid gloves no okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing solved it talks about equal right on gender equality what are you know what\nI was treated not as a woman that as a mad at eight percent and bringing bringing forward charges against another person to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as though she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily how cold and the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly us that we find out she lives all over the world\nAnd also just the whole story said thank thank God for people thank God for Brett Kavanaugh and thank God for Lindsey Graham", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "01"}
