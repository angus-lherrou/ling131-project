hundred point seven to use the uh like eight feet to Boston and I are radio station\nFrom ABC News\nDario holding our he wants to seek the death penalty that from the U.S attorney in Pittsburgh about the suspect in yesterday's deadly synagogue shooting ABC's Pierre Thomas says Robert Ballard had hate filled rant on his social media accounts but now he managed to fly under the radar\nAnd the two nurses who first arrived at the scene to save the rotten filthy life for Robert Bowers are Jewish\nHow serendipitous the Jews save the life of Robert Bowers and if I was in charge I Would a\nDeal with all the other ones first to deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor\nMy God and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months that I like to know where are the people he communicated with\nWas he a friend that was ... who else knew what he was saying the things you were saying and and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great\nFriend of Israel and Bowers also added Trump because Trump is the only American president in history that Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka has become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner is a uh\nUh or the docks Jews the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish religious functions as I have\nAnd so this guy who ah hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past\nHis neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly and went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews\nWhen Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit to attack President Trump\nThe evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump\nIs an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel so oh one headline Saturday yesterday in the Washington Post said bomb suspect\nFound an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump to put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans\nSo that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post\nThat are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not in fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help\nIt's unbelievable on that day\nAnd in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News\nHad a play in Central Park that simulated this stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama\nI Want to know the immediate reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt at the masses says a nation of Republican members of Congress resulting in a motor wounds to Stephen skill lease\nThe Washington Post the next day\nRan a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders\nAnd also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow so instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the Capitol tape the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio\nOver the last several weeks much like the ah the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people there have been at least twenty examples\nOf left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder for many many Republicans in fact all Republicans\nPeople like secretary defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and\nIn fact the the the rice and like substance was sent to the home of Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it because all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there is a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson\nAnnoy they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an ID cruise chased out of restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant a Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor Brett Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote an word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence but win\nLargely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist\nAnd some on the right committing acts of violence that has covered it completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion is Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up as Trump stabbed to death and people plug\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam on big at the end I semi settled a large rally that Jews are termites in thousands in attendance applauded and cheered calling juice termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and Brock Hussein Obama stood next to had pictures taken with\nAt the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the president saying oh wait not to allow the public to know that it was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago\nAnd ... that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically so this whole thing disgusts me\nI Hope soon very soon\nBut a powers is killed either a by lethal injection ... heading electric chair shooting whatever it takes powers has got to go the way Timothy McVeigh for violence and Bowers\nWas a Trump hater but the Washington Post has somehow implicitly tied Trump to the murder\nOf God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh the whole thing is disgusting when you get your reaction plus we're going to have later on David re a fair to talk about what's happening on the ...\nSouthern border is anyone thought about the public health crisis caused\nLaw\nAnd ...

tragedies the tragedies this week and the one that happened on Saturday ah joining me now is Thomas ... former NYPD investigator and a very knowledgeable about the situation is whether that attempted mass murder or whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this\nUh on Saturday today a has been along the lines that this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy the uh NBC News this morning at on a neighbor lived next door to him a\nVery sad woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that the same Thomas rescuing former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas rushed getting welcome again in the bill Cunningham shown Thomas are you\nGoing to be very tough situation an awful um well when I watch some of the morning\nAnd afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all\nAnd I hit menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet to kind of shy and he said oh goodbye no difficulties\nHe had posted online for quite a while and I met him ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president because he thought Trump was two uh two nights on Israel\nDidn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren are Jewish and ah he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless\nUh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's responsible\nThe Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon it today did ugly reporting saying that uh that uh in fact the Syrian Sanders put out something a few hours ago that said is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit\nDo attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump is such a on a public defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective ... said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying the Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should've known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nNot as of yet I've seen\nIs you know I said is always twenty twenty especially in the law enforcement or the investigative world when I Can't believe that no one else was honoring his tweets his social media\nAnd there's other things that he was posting couldn't have alerted only went one way you know when you say is if you see something say something\n[laughter] this case you know someone had this scene\nAnd could've alerted the police on the police if we find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about Bowers and do something or didn't look to see if this guy does have guns or potentially follow him and then we can criticized the police but until that time\nPolice and law enforcement agencies and even intelligence agencies\nDon't have the manpower the bandwidth to be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting in Broward County there was one in her call FBI numerous people had called about an Eighteen year old punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even though call in or an FBI people cold and it wasn't following up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nThere's no perfection on horse but you're only as good as shifts today and wish I could go on for civilians very easy to do after the same law enforcement is tough on itself I Know from my experience with the NYPD we always look back we always did\nA review of what had happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing with the case and the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back in figuring out what could we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a Bowers said a posted just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media somebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating\nAnd I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said\nBecause I'm sure there's several thousand individuals sadly in the country like ... hours\nWaiting for a trigger moment that social media exacerbates highlight these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate\nBefore social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people\nOr other like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against ah against Jews and against African Americans there were several hundred did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump\nHe he he'd previously wrote I never voted for Trump nor have I ever owned Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\n... but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so well when you were in NYPD you go back right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nYes I totally agree and take what you said even further this president has a son in law who is the orthodox and a very religious Jewish guy he has a daughter who converted to Judaism\nAnd as you said his grandchildren or Jewish so you know I I don't think it's a matter of\nYou know what it said it's a matter of how we're saying it doesn't matter for law enforcement standpoint of it has to be held back because you're pressing police departments and agree right they have to be ready\nTo respond to a ... guy goes into Times Square but no one of the reason that he wants to kill innocent people going to the theater in New York City on may ... years ago and thank God he had failed terrorism school\nAnd couldn't blow up his own car because he would have killed if not injured hundreds if not thousands of people but they're on knots like this around the country is what keeps law enforcement people up at night worrying about this lone wolf the guy who's not really talking to someone the guy who is\nSort of a loner a guy who's pretty well thought of in this neighborhood who is capable of grabbing his guns\nAnd go into a place in killing innocent people for no other reason than his ideology or his private jeeze\nThomas is out there all the way but Thomas ... former NPD NYPD officer thanks for coming in the bill Cunningham show and all of us need to lower the red or just a little

you\nGo let me share with the American people something you've uh put forth in one of your ...\nAnd that is what's going on and with all this stuff going on with the mailing bombs and all that stuff going on in the victims and\nThen the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in this article\nThe caravan of an estimated seven thousand some say it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point of Central American migrants is now you know well into Mexico what the Claritin ten of reaching us border where the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately described by the wall Street Journal and organize stunt by political agitator is an activist who are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add to the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of a sudden seven to ten thousand a Honduran just showed up together in one place and said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that\nSo what happened with the political agitator isn't the activist who got this together explained that the mainstream media will deal with\nWell you know Bill thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of a you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill a Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize\nAnd disrupt a you know competing country and once again we have here where we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress\nA who's a\nAccording to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states\nWho has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many Thirteen thousand people some of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a\nGang members deportees there's also a\nMan of working age from Asia and from a a East Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they try to stay out of this you know people are just are coming along and doing it on their\nMeals are suddenly appearing pets are suddenly appearing medical care is suddenly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me why don't you take your wife and kids and try walk in Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up\nTo who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the free hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this they're trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here\nIs that a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election and your in my lifetime you know I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone to the Democratic party explain why now here we are getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands among door and show up at the same place the same time with precision began marching together ... along with food and I'm an army marches on his belly along with water intensive medical care all of these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's too many events happening with the media will cover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate uh\nCaravans that are formed the largest one that we're talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that hasn't even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of up panning the crowd and showing the visual\nAnd I've seen pictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed obscene medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift are not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably\nTo a Jimmy Carter's a election down fall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by leftist government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city": "Boston", "day": "29"}
