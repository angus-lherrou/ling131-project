Peterson and Colin Powell and Benjamin Carson in Congolese arise and others for being disloyal to the Democratic party when the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them practically every chance they have\n... ... it's incredible to watch what's going on\nBack for the past half century Ninety percent of black voters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest the Democrats have consistently opposed school choice trapping kids and failing public schools\nFor generations they've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which has destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's pro NAFTA policies which have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities\nThey've also Democrats who crippled a black families by embracing welfare writes the penalize married couples who get married it goes on and on and on\nAnd this was all said in a sense of CNN's Don Lemon\nWho laughed with venomous Lee and what these other African Americans were saying\nCan you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they would it be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such Scully and you know when you think back in history\nWith CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south had control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners head to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan\nAs a terrorist arm of the Democratic party\nTo intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy any political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard\nLater on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats\nCodify into law the idea of literacy test\nAnd other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats\nBecause the sample shouldn't media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control\nWay of what I watch free thinking African American men and women be partially destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media Democratic Party and so\nThen I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low\nCriminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter of black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity and so what happened and Kanye West is the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas\nTo Jesse ... Peterson the Congolese are rise to any black who steps out of line they're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill\nBy Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed\nAgainst a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints that's why CNN working with the Democratic party much destroy Kanye West and and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks\nWe'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party has done to them and not for them the truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore\nChicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee the schools are completely dysfunctional that black families completely broken there's no job creation\nThe average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West steps out of line and begins to express support for a different political outlook he has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book\nBecause it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in law and they want to dissuade other African American men from thinking an acting independently of the Democratic party that is cause such harm can you think a worst cities to live in\nOne control by crime and poverty single mothers academic failure racial inequality that is the result whether whatever black city it is controlled by Democrats what occurs\nDon't know better than me a chance to identity to win a thousand dollars all you've got to do is to listen to win every hour after the news from six AM to nine PM welcome you're on the great [noise]\nW.

garbage everything's on what's going to happen with it making a housing development oh okay good but it was great for us we fixed it\nAnd sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city let's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was due to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it as like just seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for notes and to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got him back and he's going to be safe very shortly he's in the air just he literally

human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and an South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the trade deal\nAnd we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd or Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nomination so what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they would say so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making our refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in then what happened and they made a deal made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now

two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea are so\nMany jobs and talking to my Everytime I cannot Mexico are we talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people

thought was ridiculous about our hats\nAnd or a jacket that she wore and a fashion statement she was making it's just ridiculous how the media coverage that you know media Research Center and my friend Brent ... says that Ninety three percent of the media coverage of Trump is negative I think it's higher than that I I don't recall\nAll these great things happening the media objectively covering the Trump Administration gimme fifty fifty somebody's talking the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC\nOr the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper Hollywood movies too late night comics are all one way and and I said I I guess it's group think because they all live in either Hollywood or New York\nBut but can you imagine if CBS or ABC would say you know what we're going to go a different direction we're going to start covering the news objectively we're going to have conservatives from top to bottom in America is a conservative country right thirty two states are controlled by ... a Republican governors\nHouse the Senate scream court we are basically a moderate to right wing or conservative\nWhat if CBS would say from top to bottom organ or is that what we're going to reflect conservative values\nAnd cover the news objectively\nI think those of us who are normal would flock to CBS News and then an ABC NBC and CNN would take one alibi hit the only one that is conservative more or less right now is Fox you know him near leaning left quite often were Shepard Smith and people like that\nAnd you see what the ratings have Hannity are every night John draws about four million viewers every night so those kinds of interviews I just conducted was their regular event on CBS Evening news or ABC I give up any hope for NBC those ratings would double and triple\nAnd it would become the dominant evening newscast if somehow one of the other ones would say you know what from top to bottom we're going to reflect the values of people in this country that that are pro God pro family pro military pro police and we're going to reflect that\nAll you got to do is look at Newsmax TV or a one American network and you'll find conservative

had swept in with my father a long time ago and we uh we did a good job we fixed it up we uh eleven hundred and sixty four you underserved remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers sick of it by a garden that's right right by since I don't even know if it's still there no\nAnd knocked down about six months ago all really yellow and gone the whole thing is loading the garbage and everything's going what's gonna happen with the making of housing development\nOh okay good but it was great for us we fixed it and sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen setting\nLet's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious later and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it as like just seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got him back and he's going to be safe very shortly he's in the air just eat literally just took off\nAnd he'll be at the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted a back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure is very happy right now\nAbout your wife ... to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal and what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty a it was very sad and beautiful and one way and very sad and I know the kids were beautiful\nThey loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue\nTo give a lot of money because they need it it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just such or the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I look at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat is that why what did you do with the\nDeal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come and then Rob and uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada that just wouldn't make a deal\nIt was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nomination so what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and its works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in then what happened and they made a deal made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea\nSo how many jobs and talking to my every time I can or Mexico we're talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which have absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed\nHow can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they are they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can sell into their into into their countries\nThey have tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and onions and we charge him essentially no tax to sort of ... percent but for the most part they don't even not elected", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year":
