{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "\n\nBut I live in if you're not getting all three hours that came commando show and joined Kim's club that's right head over to get\nKim Dotcom and for just a few bucks a month you can watch the show you can get the pod cast chat with all the great folks in the chat room because they're fabulous by the way\nAnd then we have contests you can come see the show and the list goes on and on the on the head over to get Kim Dotcom once again that's get Kim Dotcom it all three hours of the show it's great for when you're walking exercising driving because after all knowledge is power\nA time in Scottsdale, Arizona a low there Tom\nBlow their Kemp what's going on well I have a\nQuestion uh uh I'm just give it a little set up here I'm a dentist and ah have ah a website that I have one son mind right now what I'm trying to put together for another part of my practice and I've been toying with the idea of putting a check a function not sure what you call it\nA in the website to where people could ask questions before they came in\nAnd the question I Would have for you is it is a beneficial or that you all you would do is just so easy to do and of course what kind of back up to I Need to have as far as the employment of people to support that are the questions and whatever you\nYou know all of us all yeah all really good questions by the way Tom I'm you know we read deployed shop dot commando dot com\nAnd uh you know we put a chat function in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing you know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being there it really will help with your return on your investment\nAre you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\nWell obviously I have to have someone to play so I just recently was approached by a company that said they would do is they would have a\nThey employ individuals to support the uh the ... function somehow that would work as they would give me thirty quit or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a perspective of clients would ask them then those are three questions so I Would give them the interest as well so\nAs I as a person would call him they would get a hold of this company and they would have to ask the question though but she they had the the canned answer that I've already given\nBut of course I don't know as soon as you look for those dirty question\nYeah and I got here's the reason why I'm hesitating my fact is that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor I'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our businesses that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extended that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself for my oral history and my real hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the website she will kind of volume that you get and you you are able to turn it off\nYou can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office that you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in\nFact to getting the same question time and time again of which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the Web site\nBut the more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on\nBut I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you'll engage will be people that you can convert to a a paying client\nBecause they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your side from scratch they have names like then desk chat is free uh there's also live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the side or somebody building it for you\nAh yes although the we do a ... been billed than we have another company building or another website ... originally but but when we have a third tempting though is calling me about that in the ... function\nAnd I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't let the third party do it yet I Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters do kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also listen to those questions under ... choose as a part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening in ... and things like that\nOr is it you're able to say you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you so much for your call come right back we're going to

Joe Rogan\nNow your favorite radio beaver fought cast out download her over the ... in ... I have\nTo start exploring so boy so Boston do you walk working about one hundred point seven till UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station\nOn ABC News\nI'm Dario holding our terror then of thousands of Central American\nIs made an end run this afternoon around Mexican agents who briefly stopped them the numbers have swelled to about ten thousand and every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them they talk about a gentleman by talking about what Trump wants you to do and the F. word all these things are shouted against our president\nThey're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn offer them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop the let them clamor aboard to go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals from the most violent place\nOn Mother Earth make their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically the media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy blow\nSo you said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice\nSouth American Central Americans and Mexicans something like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million what would that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million when it come here\nAnd because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they will permit that because if you're from other than Mexico to him the other words from Central America and you may go to America\nThere's a magic car that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins legal process it will take years\nIn the meantime you're inside of America waiting for hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled to have enough camps\nThey have enough judicial officers do you have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who not been heard yet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats is extremely serious\nIf you're from Mexico here illegally you're going to take it right back immediately if you're from Central America you have the right to hearing that goes on and on and on and never stops so ah I I'm interested to see\nWhen and if the media will change their coverage to provide objective information\nThe damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminals societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals and the rest there's no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California\nTaxes to New Mexico through legal migration ... there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders the rapes et cetera it does not exist\nRemember that nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border\nSixteen of the twenty most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI sat in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration\nFederal judges and the economy right now\nWith Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable\nTrump has everyone from North Korea\nTo Russia believing we're about to bust up every new trading necessary to keep to get America back on the even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip he has an economy exceeding five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers so not just the ... the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head the terrorists are on the run\nISIS is destroyed Iran is on notice and marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise\nThis guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut a Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individual is here with a third grade education\nEighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them according to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways\nThat the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe\nBecause according to CNN this is the issue of unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan their vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way\nThrough the magic wand\nThat we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have we're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through ... says he's we take in legally one point one million\nForeigners to come into America take the oath of office and become an American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together we already do that one point one million\nBut I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here\nAnd watch hordes of young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five or ten years from now that will never happen\nThis has fundamentally changed our country that's far and it's going to be much worse\nIf in twenty Eighteen what in two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the do we have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion or the hospital is ready to go or other bridges the roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming\nHow is this possible that the most violent places on earth and sending us largely young males\nTo come into America I got a Kevin jacks and coming up later an African American leader of great note there is no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males\nThey figured out that this is not benefit\nThem at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit American public education does it benefit the hospital systems that we have the benefit of any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that\nWe are a nation of immigrants but there are legal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join the country come in and walk into a country which you don't belong to and not a citizen up men demand rights are you kidding me\nOh last year the question tonight is that the issue that's going to cause millions of Americans in two weeks in two days to vote for Democrats do you believe that\nOne eight six six six or seven seven three three seven we continue we

you today\nDoing well you know about a week ago I spent some time with the president a privately it was wonderful you spent like hundreds or thousands of hours with the guy and I said on the air the other day that uh\nThere there's a differential between what I see in the media sometimes with the president and how he truly is before we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that kind of stuff you know the American people a measure of the man himself\nWell you know I've spent so much time with a then candidate Trump but now President Trump and a truly cares about other people he's extremely\nMagnanimous and private he is funny he's gracious he's always asking about how my family is doing and what he can do to me that you actually is and if you listen to the media they tell you he's the worst human being on the planet help but the truth is he's exceptionally\nGracious I've seen in so many times helping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help when every cat and\nWhy is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong media worst Research Center ... well ... one of my buddies\n... every few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough that good\nThey only report the bad in this administration the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more American working any other time\nIn our nation's history it conflated to see Trump agenda isn't that what the mainstream media wants to talk about I here's a great example just last week I think it was a President Trump did an interview with Leslie stall for sixty minutes she interrupted him the five times during that interview\nThat in comparison when sixty minutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him four times and they have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad not to give him the credit that he deserves for the successes that he's had because they're no longer in the business of\nReporting the news now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night in Montana framed it as mobs versus jobs the only difference is the immune to Jay and I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh\nAlong about a trucks that ever trumps sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at a Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with pen\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose him there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kicked in the head of the the calls to violence [laughter] by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's\nA Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break you know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember\nRepublicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with Sarah Huckabee Sanders sleeping with secretary Nielsen ... we've seen with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life because the mob violence say antifa\nIs so out of control and go on their desire is destruction it's not going to make our country better\nThis president has created I think\nOver for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want this president\nIf he didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences that Democrats I hate to say this hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally acceptable didn't mean to fame and to make fun of and dismay or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper then I Will watch nonetheless I stone and TMZ\nAnd I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump was stripping nude in the oval office performing sex acts in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure you might sell a lot of\nLot of his songs and records not can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad depicted Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office in performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\nIt would be front page news for a week on and that wrap that the the country artist would have had his life\nProbably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back and just again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her\nI mean do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was no it was appropriate because she was an adult [noise] even if the president of the United states\nAnd leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the the converse of Donald Trump\nThe last election from Bernie Sanders right we'll put those back in place she ring a system just like she did it last time and she'll lose worse\nShe did a great job great job by Corey Lewandowski will do it again give me your production and about two weeks house in the Senate give me your production\nUh I think in the Senate Republicans gained four or five seats are increasing the majority in the house I'm going to say that it's a bold prediction the Republicans are going to hang on by two or three seats to retain the majority and keep the Trump Pence agenda moving forward\nGod Bless America Corey Lewandowski

going to his party's extending its virtues that awards dinners and so on while enabling\nHim to do exactly what he's been doing for women for a decade dating back decades and and all the the trail of women who did exactly what Harvey ask them to do getting their butts ...\nOut and then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but then what's interesting to me to a ends up being a bill ends up being part of a\nWell being used against Kavanaugh being used against a high powered CEOs of companies [noise] this movement is born a the lectures activities of left us in Hollywood that and and and the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy\nAnd suddenly a guy like Kavanaugh they want to make him the\nPoster child I mean it just it bores me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters on summer in terms of physicians would somebody\nA Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama is elected Harvey Weinstein\nTo to take their daughters ended the Hollywood scene when they knew or should have known exactly what was going on from all of their connections but they couldn't care less Harvey Weinstein was a star Harvey Weinstein had access Harvey Weinstein was are making millions of dollars and giving millions the Democratic party including the Obamas\nSo they set their own daughters end of the carrot custody in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nKnow they didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are untouchable but you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people there that daughter that you don't that you got to be concerned about cars Harvey will take advantage of them but the ... the what the what rock Obama's selling us\nI have so much power I Know that this guy that led to his left is who will take advantage of women and every time but I can put my daughters with them but don't you dare put yours\nThat's exactly how the left stacks up I can do it you can't because I'm covered but you're not\nAnd and look at it it's a lesson it as a precautionary tale for many many boys I said

he's not even going to remember it\nHe is not going to be insignificant to him and her but because something may be important in life she decide I'll take him down for what\nWell you know it it was hanging by a thread two weeks ago and now he's on the court and I think the other issue I Want to get your perspective on this Kevin Jackson and the black sphere which is the what's happening now with the Honduran migrants\nComing through a Guatemala into Mexico there right now is three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward the Texas border this is a terrible event for the Democrats\nOver the next two weeks before the election they have the video and the pictures of thousands of migrants\nWhenever I watch MSNBC all I hear about is women and children then I see the video of these migrants coming to urban areas in America and they're almost always young males and the young women tend to be raped or sexually molested the men are drug meals and I'm sure there's good family members among them\nAnd Kevin Jackson of you and your wife and your children were in a\nOr in Honduras and the bill Cunningham and my wife and kids were in\nAnd we're in Honduras living the horrors of socialistic left wing military hunter regime the first thing I Would want to do would be to get to America I understand that completely\nBut along the process it gives billions of dollars damage Thirteen other gang bangers to provide a pass each every time you go through some other drug infested area Mexico you got to pay\nHomage you've got to pay either sex or money to even pass through and and live by the time you get to the northern part of Mexico according to sixty minutes about two months ago there's hundreds of dead bodies because some men did not want to participate and
