R. C. dot\nOrg it's Tony Perkins Tony how are you good you're going to be back with you\nThat's always a pleasure to have you on man we just went through a month I think that's going to a bit we'll probably go down in the annals of history in this country as some of the most contentious stuff we've ever seen by the end of the day we got Brett Kavanaugh on the court your thoughts about him getting there\nWell I think it is a very significant day I think it's a significant day for the constitution I think it's a significant day for the American people what we see now I think for the first time in probably fifty maybe sixty years we've seen the court and moving back\nToward the boundaries of the constitution a court that is not going to use the bans to ah to shape activists policies but rather they're going to interpret the laws enacted by the duly represented and elected representatives of the people on the court which is they're all so I think it's an exciting day\nBut it was always supposed to be that way bound by the constitution and not just those words have so much drinking so much power to them as Supreme Court was never supposed to be this thing but it's morphed into how did we get here\nWhile I took a number of years I I but you know we go back at least from a standpoint of the way that conservatives have been so engaged on\nAnd what we saw a play out over the last three weeks where I mean where it came down to the people you know scratching and calling out the doors of the Supreme clearly yeah you know they ... the wailing and the gnashing of teeth that took place shows\nHow the court has gotten so far out of its boundaries in terms of what it's supposed to do in this country and the left is desperate because the laugh knows that the American people overwhelmingly rejected their\nPolicy they don't want them they can't do it through the people they can't do it through the state legislatures that can't do it through the Congress by large so they had to rely on the court right like when they rattle off a few things for you ... what legislative body voted prayer out of our schools and took the Bible out of the school but um I don't think there was one was it a ...\nWho was it that imposed abortion on demand on the major was that the Congress don't know who took the ten commandments out of our courthouses\nUh wasn't a legislative body so I mean I can go on and on and finally we're at a point where we can see the court shipped back to its proper boundaries it's going to have a significant impact upon our culture about our country and upon the way we make laws in this country\nHe's the president of the family Research Council F. R. C. dot org ... do you just made some great points there is no abortion in the constitution should not have been decided by the court there is no separation\nOf church and state and the constitution should not have been decided by the court the court has gone well beyond each room for a long time now is that the resulting in your opinion why did this was such a hard to get to get Kevin on the court Kavanaugh has got almost Thirty years of experience\nHe's got an impeccable record by all accounts he's a really good man a really good husband a really good dead and one heck of a\nGreat jurists they had to pretend he was a gang rape is Tony to try to stop them from getting on the court and that's the desperation you're talking about I guess\nYes absolutely Joe ... they look they they have to have the court to accomplish their mission to impose this new that there's a gender that the American people have rejected repeatedly\nSo they have to have the court they lost the court I are there I should say they're losing the court and they look that you had the Anthony Kennedy who was you know Fifteen Percent of the time he was with the conservative element of the court fifty percent of the liberal now you have a judge based upon his judicial philosophy\nIs he is going to be with the other conservatives on the court that see\nA see it from a a a strict constitutional list viewpoint so this is a big shift in our country now what we've seen and I think what what played out this division we hear all of this country so divided well you know in large part Joe it was a court\nThat divided us right it was the court that impose these views on Americans that we never arrived at consensus over the way our republic works\nIs that we have these elected representatives at work through these issues they arrive at consensus is not what one side wants totally nor the other side but it's a consensus but when the court steps in and short circuits that process like it did on abortion like it did on marriage\nAnd you do not reach can sit consensus and there's division in the culture I've never seen it more intense than it is right now and until the court moved back to its proper boundaries and they elected representatives shape the policies for this country it will continue\nFound them I was comfortable socks and the history of the tanker bound dot com slash W.

I don't know that I've ever seen to people who are more devoid of intelligence and knowledge\nOn actual policy than they used to like they don't know why she voted against this violence against women act\nAnd um I don't I'm not sure I understand why don't you have a brain just go and read why she rejected the left with a bunch of garbage in there that had nothing to do with women nor violence against women it was about trends this and and gay that\nAnd it was stuff it was special special interest garbage that had no place in the violence against women act and by the way it still exists there was this law in this room where the Trump somehow ended it on September thirtieth he didn't and in fact has been extended\nTo December and it says action that Congress has to take the president has nothing to do with it so there's a lot of confusion a lot of confusion on the left right now and I got to be honest with you I think it's pretty okay I'm okay with there being confusion on the political left you just saw they treated Kavanaugh using that this guy who is like the the\nThe the heir apparent this O'Rourke\nShutting Obama who was the hope and change guy Taylor Swift who were smart enough not to say anything now has says something and what she said was incredibly intelligent about late night writers on the Late Show talking about how great it was that at least they ruined\nKavanaugh's life I listen and I think the left I think the Democrats have jumped the shark\nAnd it's kind of weird to watch they normally in circling the wagons at least have a message there not nothing it's weird it eight nine for one pack a day to day nine four one Seventy four seven Joe packs dot coms there [noise]\nW.
