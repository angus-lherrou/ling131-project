thinks watching Rosina was far less but have you seen anybody on Twitter or Facebook founder anywhere anywhere say allowed it right job they did not\nKnow the only time was a ... they let some critics watching some of the critics thought this was a really great way to go um but as far as the mainstream people I haven't seen any anything good about it\n\nDo they try to be funny at all and they did yeah\nAnd it was a little than it had been a little sad and then they try to pick up and there were some joke and then it got sat again I'm Better when everything is now this is like we are a couple of weeks after\nThe funeral that's an end to place so there were like I Can't believe she died [noise] uh pretty much yeah\nAnd at first they thought it would have got art attack a no from any Twitter jokes\nBuildings are smart enough to go at Twitter\nI I don't I don't think I ... and ... do the ratings in front of you\nI'm not have the story and let's see it's a cause I Know\n... it was with a seven point seven out of Thirteen and metered marketing ratings airlines syndication as it's certainly not going to be the same are easy ABC has some breathing room at least for now a\nIt was down thirty five percent from the Roseanne opener or the day the of the ... just four percent better than the mothership series' finale and metered market numbers\nSo there you go a\nThirty five dollars a gallon from the Roseanne\nBats are during the government or somebody who does what I saw it was almost fifty percent of those old Raul okay that the original series opened\nHer job and and again next year you did very very well bill re runs last year we're doing monsters very good numbers millions and millions of viewers are and of course that do you want to see what Rosanne tweeter should I say\nNo you go ahead and say that what let me get it exactly as she said it because I don't wanna mess it up mhm news radio station be bad if I say\nAnd they may yeah be careful\nIt's got a hundred and twenty nine thousand likes [laughter] and thirty thousand re tweets and fourteen thousand responses wow\n\nI did the words they don't want to say that we are now and go but I don't want to and it was a that's an old capitals it was hilarious it was hilarious it was exactly what it should have been and are you know what's weird about it\nAs much as she's dead on the show everybody but everybody an earth though she's not really did\nIt doesn't make any sense it was kinda dumb to do that ... yeah but they killed band at the end of the the original series he'll only back alive yeah suddenly

suddenly very is alive so and we bought into an adult you buy into it you do you think what ABC said a few days ago where they said we acted too hastily maybe we should have thought about it more\nDo you think that like somebody tweeted me and said they think that's a result\nOf them doing a test with a focus group mhm and the focus group said visiting ran over here well yeah\nI couldn't be\nOr was that them hedging their ... their their bets in case this completely look you watched it because you had more of an interest I get it Robert just wrote me he said I had to watch is just as you'll be able to do my curiosity got the best of me I can get it\nYou're not going back he's not going to rest majority those who watched the first one aren't going to go back the next week I predict the numbers will be about half of what they were this week\nI got ... yeah I think it's very long bad yeah I don't think there's anything it's going to last about\nSo the question becomes they were making money hand over fist last last year last season when this came back is that another dream sequence does she come back again\nI think there is going to let this one go and see how far they get to the season and they're going to cancel it and you know what that's going to be the end of it I don't think they would bring her back\nThey killed them yeah how many years ago researcher yeah I now live in well\nBut don't tell many people though ticked off much like that woman um if they brought her back\nI'm going to say this and I truly believe there's so many people will say well by a citizen of politics in my whatever I'm stupid shows\nUm I think\nI think more people are angry that they got rid of her\n... there are happy that they got rid of her ... I think that the loudest voices were listening to the knee jerk reaction happened\nAnd they pulled the trigger ... should have should have handled it differently and I think that many people today as much as it's agreed that she should've sent out this week but many people believe you don't ruin somebody's entire life because of one symptoms on on a on a website\nAnd it's something that we've talked about before habit addressed on the show not quite ready for not killer on bad habit addressed on shall we talk about maybe not just for one episode maybe a couple introduced him at work or because of all this you know when\nBolton goes for those are juice or would have watched that show mhm but I also just what they did I didn't even watch it and get my rating and they didn't get a lot of people's ratings obviously\nDo they how do you have the roses you're without Roseanne it's stupid it's actually and it didn't where I think they could have done something better you address it on the show you talk about it on the show you punish her publicly she apologizes sold and so forth and then you continue to get the audience that wants to be entertained ... it's it's that simple been really really\n... it's a it eight nine four one package editing nine four one Seventy four seven did you watch it will you watch your second time no what's gauge it that way of course it's it's not appear to go to either do but uh let's see what the listeners say will they watch again did they tune in like Gary ... to see I have to see how they handle it I get that are you a tune back in\nEighty nine for one pack Joe pegs dot com come go right back there\n[noise] ... shells fall shale civil you\n[noise]\nThere is nobody on the planet like use so why would you\nWithout gas service in the ... valley could have a tough night trying to stay warm with wind chills into twenty nine people from the bay state of Malcolm down with the multi drug resistant strain of salmonella hearing Red Sox age ... will not be starting game five of the A.

there and get wherever it is very very nice and it was a really nice gathering you know what was different about this that and I don't do a lot you know me I I live in ... where do ... miles and ... ... ... exactly right it zero zero zero zero zero leave me alone [laughter] and I'm\nJust going there you know and and I'd already had a day you know that I had a day we had to do and we did yeah and you have no idea what the day was before the day we had on the air mhm so um yeah I was like an hour and go down here and I got there and it just snapped me out of it it was really nice\nAnd it was nice to be in a gathering where I knew\nI wasn't going to be attacked because they dared believe in traditional American values or I was going to be attacked because\nI support Ted Cruz I was going to be a to you know what I mean you almost walk around with eyes behind your head knowing that people here what we say on the radio and see and you know we do and and if you dare where a make America great again hat or something you might have been a soda throwing your face and have it stolen or something\nUm it was nice to walk around and not have that thought you know what I mean\n... that's nice that's good so early and go\nI didn't know you were going I wasn't invited how not far at\nDid I not talk about it yesterday in the air that I was going to go no\nI'd probably did but like I had all of the night before you guys do listen to what I say oh well I ... down a couple of times and\nYou may have yeah he did his math okay I I said I was going to go to they didn't they pose some actually it was ... he said and that was going on but obviously you can do it 'cause you know in the show but then as soon as it was over you can go to like the after saying that\nI couldn't do the debate because of the debate was actually happening in the hour after the show and and hermit ville it's a good thirty thirty five minutes away from where the after thing was happening but I got there it was great we hung out with Ted I met Heidi and the girls that had not met\nThem before so that was nice I'm ... and again people were just they they they were filled with passion about what was going to happen so what I I'm pretty sure of the nation saw at least bits and pieces of the old war cruised debate did you watch it and you need the art and watch it or did you watch it live\nI had to be the art and I did not like him I\nSaid did you watch it afterwards or no yes\nSo ... did you walk away thinking that you're you're the journalist or right down the middle you're unbiased that you walk away thinking somebody won or lost\nAnd I will tell you it was different than the first only because I think I'll Rourke is behind and he's really trying to win this thing so he went a little different angle that sense and cruise last night than usual\nAnd I'll help you know where you're looking for he ... he went negative I got a F yeah well he did on it and it's I mean yeah I mean he actually brought a lion techno here's the weird part today and I think this is why he did it the left media is reporting that\nBeto O'Rourke savages Ted Cruz by bringing up what Trump called on the campaign trail\nUm ... and he did he called them lying in bed and he actually said this is the way this night is going to go he's going to lie to you he's on truthful he's a liar he actually said these things\nAnd when he was responding to was Ted Cruz saying that Robert Francis O'Rourke actually was pushing for a ten dollar per barrel\nSurcharge or tax on every barrel of oil produced here in the state of Texas Carrie did did O'Rourke do that or did you not do that in ...\nHe didn't do that and yeah I'm ... and after Ted said this is what he voted for this is what he wanted he wanted to add ten dollars per barrel to every barrel produced in Texas\nAnd when I was a ... turn he said\nThat's a lie he's a lawyer he's long about the positions I've taken these lion Ted\nTrump called on line had sold and so forth and what the left media is ignoring today I mean the down in the middle and and the right media are reporting it correctly today what they what they refuse to report was had had a rebuttal and would Cruz said afterward\nWas okay we'll put the actual legislation and your actual vote on my website Ted Cruz dot org so people can go there and see that's I think that's exactly what your status is that's exactly what your position is\nAnd that's exactly what you voted for\nHe was also a rock was also given a chance to to say he regretted voting against tax breaks for businesses horribly affected by Harvey he voted against that he was one of only four Democrats in the state of Texas in the house who voted against it\nI mean that's nuts that was a bipartisan move and of course it passed because the Republicans have the dominate the dominant position in the house and Senate but ... voted against relief for small businesses after Hurricane Harvey and I and I think the most agree just moment\nFor Robert Francis O'Rourke who were really exposed last night and it's a simple he was expose I look I don't have to be on the writer Ted Cruz supporter to know the the exposing he took on this one issue\nHe was talking about border security and he was asked the question about what will you do to secure the border and his answer was this I Am from El Paso what he said I'm not he is I'm from El Paso El Paso we had what was it three or four murders last year\nAcross the border in war as they had three thousand\nAnd then he talked about communities in I Believe in the police there in ... he started giving these weird reasons and then of course one of those cruises turn ... workers basically throwing him a big fat watermelon softball\nBecause crews that it out of the park as my nine year old daughter could have\nThe simple answer is there's a wall there there's a fence there as a work was saying we don't need a wall or a fence he was giving an example of how ... works it works very well Kerry where in Texas is there a wall or a fence yeah one of the border in El Paso finance\nAnd there's a big bridge you can go there and come back or they can come here and go back\nVia a ... a bridge otherwise the community of El Paso is protected by a barrier how is he possibly going to use that example of how a wall or a bridge would or a wall or a fence wouldn't work it was nothing to me\nAnd then you walk away and I think those who are being honest said wow I mean that wasn't even close and those who are dishonest\nAre reporting that he somehow savaged Ted Cruz which makes no sense because he brought up lie in bed you know the guy who called them lion Ted and Ted had buried the hatch it so much that he's coming next Monday and he's going to be campaigning for Ted Cruz\nSo I'm not really sure what the whole\nModus operandi was yesterday except to say he's a big fat lie lie or how do I know because Donald Trump says so owned by the way I'm the candidate O'Rourke who wants to impeach Donald Trump the guy who was words for twenty sixteen I'm using it against my competitor now it doesn't make sense the guy's floundering\nAnd there's a story out there that he's raised thirty million dollars that's the true number I'd\nCertainly like some\nMore than any senatorial candidate ever in us history thirty eight million\nWhen the Democrats asked him to spread the wealth around a little bit will he be sharing that money with some other Democrats the answer reportedly I didn't hear him say this reportedly is no they here's a guy who's running for Senate as a a modern neo socialist\nWho just said no to the ability to be a socialist with his earnings or his campaign dollars\nCome home and what are we talking about here\nAnd it's actually getting a little bit nutty so last night was a slam dunk for Ted Cruz he took it seriously he did amazingly and and that the war actually looked like a an amateur and I think that he probably walked away thinking that\nUm eight eight eight nine four one packs editing nine four one Seventy four seven did you see the debate have you seen in the reporting of the debate today do you think

J Street money that's a big political action committee\nA you've got money coming from Hollywood you've got you know these the darling of the labs Eli loves them in the Late Show loves them and and this is what he does\nAnd but when he debates he he kind of makes up for himself I thank you\nIt's a little bit ... looks a little bit immature may maybe you'll get better as he gets older but I'm now it turns out he he was long about his vote about the ten dollar a barrel\nOf oil surcharge ... just because I'm lying about who is mother was politically all these years I knew she voted for ... ... not the case I'm ... and ... and he's calling the sitting senator the lawyer\nWho's actually telling the truth about this guy's own record very strange to me oh and he used to having the praises of El Paso that has a ... I think that'd be the all that clear right here I'm In you know you have to listen to what I saw last night\nI just found curiosity where are you 'cause I heard a lot of the mainstream media today talking about that six second pies that Senator Ted Cruz had last night and hunting and posted going nuts over this after that question that you know send out and it's such a softball question and how can they pick I'm Still in line to answer at\nWhat ... I'll be honest with you I don't know a question that was when did he ever since I was answering them I had to jump in the car and I had a good case where I might have missed the\nQuestion was tell us something you've done in the last year that's nothing to do with politics that against Texans scientist who you are as the earth than\nWell actually that turned out to be a very funny moment the after party I'm Glad you brought that up mhm um I didn't know that he that he paused for six seconds\nI'm ... and his aides or I thought it was appropriate which is well got to be honest with you and I think that the the Congress little agree this is all we've done for the past year and and he talked about how he couldn't go to his daughter ... on the game or something yeah right so I mean I I don't know why are you worried about how long you pause it and it wasn't really six seconds\nAnd that's what the hunting and posted saying I've seen several times and they thought ... Aurora Gwen this one and I thought I didn't know what they were talking about Iraq but I mean are saying\nThat wasn't the funniest part of the answer\nBecause 'cause cruise actually said this last night the after partying and got a really big rousing laugh out of the crowd he was talking about the blind squirrel I'm\nMegan wide yeah bad though his daughter was is there something back to health at blight score yeah go ahead what a blind squirrel isn't that just isn't much of a joke you know he's not every once in a while I was like it was behind that was going thing\nNo last night that yes this really did happen and it's it's out there on the Internet somewhere I don't I don't have it we don't have video of it but there is video that somebody took and they posted it the first thing I said was my name is Joe ... Joe ... ruler but you can call me back into and that that's it [laughter] the crowd was I had him in the\nBottom of my ... had to do and I'm Renee ... and and I won't\nElaborate much but Ted Cruz did make reference to a ... stone last night in your party\nUh-huh okay\nThat ...

Saudi tire tyranny but none so eagerly as the Obama administration to forty fourth president literally bowed to the Saudi king to show the U.S was prepared to adopt than a sequel yes posture toward the Islamic world\nTrump's friendship with the Saudi regime is at least sensibly ground that in a strategy to fight the Iranian regime which is actively seeking nuclear weapons and poses a direct threat to the U.S and our allies\nBut here's here's the key of what the Breitbart says in the in the wake of the collapse of the Russia conspiracy theory the media are trying to make Saudi Arabia the new Russia\nI eat a foreign power that supposedly exerts undue influence over President Trump perhaps journalists hope because of some ... to one discovered financial interest\nInvolving the Trump family actually there's a quote from a there's a there's a cut of here with the we have from a a Swalwell the or the ski a Democrat from California who was who's you know Adam Schiff co conspirator\nOr cut number twelve state\nSo I thought that just a couple of days ago that the president was parity in what the Saudis wanted him to say as to what happened and now it seems more like the Saudis are parenting what the president wants them to say as he is in a really empowering on them to use it denies deny deny approach that he always use and seems to get away with\nAs far as you can tell why empires that President Trump and the Saudi Government are working together essentially to cut her off what happened here\nWell since the pattern of Everytime Donald Trump is presented with overwhelming evidence that he thinks that he can just deny his way out of it\nSo what exactly is in it for Trump now but here's here's the Russia cut cut Thirteen\nKind of fall back on my work as a prosecutor where if it takes this long to\nCome up with us explanation as to what happened while we kind of already know that the Saudis are responsible and now they're speaking to mitigate or just you know who knew at the highest\nLevels and actually this is very similar to many of the witnesses we had in our Trump Russia investigation a number of times we're after witness a question and they would take a timeout consult with their lawyers for five or ten minutes and then come back and we figured you know what we already know the answer because there was a pretty simple one and\nI was so

there's a town in Minnesota called ... reader so\nYeah a lot of people have been telling me on Twitter I I didn't know that but I Do know that's that's cool\nYeah I had an old girlfriend from there but uh\nAnd and what happened what happened in relationship to hold on what happened [laughter]\nAnd just physical by by did\nYou ever did she break up or did you break up and ... what was the problem\nYou know what if he didn't quite a while and I don't remember Kerry don't let her know that I'm In ... when the ... who doesn't want to know we want to know what happened with the new Ron\nProbably something stupid I did so\nThat's what she told us that I knew I just wonder if you're going on I was doing she told us what happened now we know there's too many things that I Can't remember exactly right that's what she said she said it was numerous stuff yeah [laughter] [laughter] exactly that are going to be about his beliefs clash\nOkay I think that is an incredible idea because um I moved back to Minnesota from another state in which I had taken a concealed carry class right and in in the class they had told us that um\nWhen the officer pulls up your plate and pulls you over they are shown that you're a concealed carry weapon license to write and uh\nSo they come up a little on edge already so just knowing that and I mean in the class they taught us you know put your hands up there like you said it right too and and physicians\nAnd but they didn't say you know put your window all the way down which I like that idea that go ahead right and also put your light on inside which\nWhich they didn't say and also it's a it's even bigger point right now with everybody with ten and windows and a lot of them with illegally tenant window right you know and actually the back seat\nBeing especially dark you know you can have darker levels on the back seat frightening to see in\nSo I Would suggest people even put those down so the officer hasn't view there\nAnd I yeah I I went to I I'm also an OTC guy would you license to carry in Texas they used to be your job and now it's L. D. C. and what I Do and what they instruct you to do when you take the classes he used to hand your\nDriver's license injure handgun license with you or to the police officer down to let him or her know that uh that in fact they weren't happy with carries a gun and again if you're ... you're in plain sight I've never had a cop say well gee Bebe gun I mean that's never happened what they said it was like where is it and I was right here in my right side or ... or whatever and then there and then there are cool you understand\nRight and that's what I said you know it I Do have a concealed carry I've got the a pistol loaded and then my glove box or something like that you know and then I leave that to them for the next\nStatement or the next order but um I don't know if you remember there was a couple of high profile cases here in Minnesota\nUh where people got shot and killed\nAnd ah one of them was this ... ...\nRight now those are big national level right\nYeah and whether the cop was acting properly or not or within his training or not which they said he was and there weren't charter right quick for the top you know if I hadn't done what we're talking about here it'd probably be\nA line never would have happened he was fumbling around there was something in his lap I mean it again if you if you go through a specific protocol I'm going to make contact with police\nI have a handgun license I have a gun on me I mean my his room playing side how's it going officer I don't know why people have to be so on edge all the time I appreciate you turn around here um but the ...
