American running against Senator Ted Cruz is um he found another reason not to do it so he could have done it so I certainly Miller posting about this over on Twitter and I said you know once you get on the programs we could explain to people exactly what's going on and people do it why is what he focused so much attention on the Texas Senate race pegs\nWhat do we care about that ... actually Yeh called smart enough to know why they care about it but uh some some people will say what we we don't really care it's not our place because this actually has national attention he's on the Ellen show he's on late night with a Colbert\nAnd all this other stuff they're active is is the cult of personality and this is not that dissimilar Kerry told you agree this is not that dissimilar\nTo um to what

Ted\nCruz campaign the reelection campaign of our senator you're in the state of Texas it's Emily Miller Emily how are you I'm Glad to be here thank you\nYou you know a blood routes what are the other day and I like to be up on stuff and I was really really busy this weekend I was like I I have to go check out that Robert Francis old Rourke um and and Senator Ted Cruz debate and I couldn't find anything\nAnd then I see you you and I follow each other on on Twitter and I see you're talking about how the debate was canceled my immediately thought oh yeah it was a really crappy weak in the Senate and he's on the Judiciary Committee so\nThe jet probably couldn't do it maybe they postponed it but then I see that after the the well we could do it because she wasn't letting this go\nShort of letter right sure did let them go and Cruz was able to debate\nAnd almost immediately the the is it be Joe age which I just said Robert phrases Robert ... almost as our right congressman ... generation Irish but I Love Irish people nothing wrong with that um she could not do it what was the reason given why you couldn't do the debate did they were planning on doing the day before\nEither a tale very odd reasons one when she had a very important that he couldn't reschedule guys and then the second one was that his dad and support team had already made their airline flight and travel\nAnd credit regulate this Friday anyhow you they ... the last night Sunday night on friday night we all live in Texas yeah it's not the way it always or find them all at the southwest yeah\nYou can ... you know you can always find a bad outcome for having yeah that that that's hurting here right so we thought we had some data that Sunday Oct back into big rally\nSo that we got we all here waiting on Saturday Night last night where I\nThink the clock Congress and he's out of the big thing that we get a now we hear that his campaign a big announcement that there were I think ...\nI have to face on or anything like that on sweater he's going to be announcing an exploratory rent for twenty twenty [laughter]\nWhich is which is what he's really doing it you know the ... and it was a good but before that you continue ... I have to use the word that they used used campaign said that the Congress would is already booked booked\nThey use the word book there in ... I'm In broadcasting when I'm booked I we bought this interview today there's a specific time you're doing a specific thing that's so important you can't change the schedule I just to debate the guy whose job you're going to take it from there\nSo then it's six o'clock last night we're oh I must say our campaign really wants to do with the ... an ounce it was a big debate that he couldn't speak by the event that he couldn't come to the debate and she has standard totally blocked and returning and he's an empty kitchen\nRight now is they're going to be a fire\nIs he going to if you're going to cooking with gray a cookie what they do I don't know if there's some big announcement coming to have a race hundred million dollars what's coming nothing it was nothing\nAt a gym and just talking with ...\nAnd like I I Would have at least on my wife and kids in there or something I don't have\nThe reasoning that he had to be in the kitchen at six o'clock on Sunday night and said debating in front of millions for millions of tax is talking about I mean that's the real part of that if he had we had a debate within the Santa Cruz had a debate at their work\nLike the one we had in Dallas on really stepped substantive issues that are excellent care about the election is getting closer you know coming out of them are a sex\nPeople really need to get through these topics so this was that he had this big thing he had to do and apparently it listed in an empty kitchen during a Facebook Live interview for three thousand people many of whom were telling them how much they love him in New York and they love him in Hollywood and they love him all over the east coast west coast yeah\nAnd then it was hard to actually Texan on issues of Texas care about\nOur so you're just so that people know what's he by the way do we know where he was was you know Paso\nVery question I don't know who is catching it was\n...\nIt looked kind of take them out there and we'll tell us where that didn't kick ass on that kicks in\n... when he was he was a state\nAs huge as you said earlier southwest as one all day every day from El Paso to Houston from San Antonio to use the ... from Dallas to use that for most of the Latin watching across the nation right now we don't know that specifically about Texas you can get there from here every single day so there was no reason why he couldn't changes planes again and go\nDo you believe that if\nThere's something in that kitchen that was going up at six o'clock I was ready for something to blow it fix the roads can exploded sexy had maybe had a twenty four hours to fly in their messaging brisket and he had to be there to open Nebraska I'm not sure but we're all in what's happening\nIs the bottom line is he was a book to do anything at this was some campaign ad on Facebook Live is Emily Miller from the from the uh to a group skipping Ted Cruz done or Ted Cruz that or go there right now I'm a ... exactly I saw that uh the first debate\nDo

Clinton on the choice you made with respect to what happened in the White House we just didn't believe I didn't believe a mistake for myself that it was an impeachable offense\nThat's the issue and and uh what about Ted Kennedy\nOf this similarly people have been critical for the areas where he was critical of himself he stood up and own\nMoments where he knew he stepped over the line so I think that that and it wasn't about to be nominated to a lifetime physician in fact he said that the people of Massachusetts if you think I should say here then you know and they took those returns and then he was elected another six times\nJust what you forget how hideous John ... life shut Garry was he comes out with stuff like that and I got a\nWho is ... ... ... ... what is obstruction of justice a

I asked him I don't know that all the time\nIsn't it the first question that that that you you have to think now I look I got to you guys love the country your father to his sacrificed so much\nFor for the better of the of the country but maybe you guys had everything you could possibly ever want to use that question easy to ...\nThe reality is ... ... we all and especially you know he loves this country a he's a guy that scene it he's seen it all he understand how the game was played he he delivered the American dream I mean that you know his family of the American dream you know my my grandfather was it was a great success I mean he became a man of the house and I think he was Thirteen Years old\nWhen his father died and guess what he went to work because he was the man of the house at Thirteen\nAnd so you know you you see all of that you see the nonsense platform to the left is putting up you start pushing back and my father was kind of guy he's been very vocal about it for by the way this way into the Bush administration is ridiculous and history but I mean there's the clip on Oprah from eighty four he's talking about you know stupid trade deals I mean finally he just had enough\nAnd he's the kind of guy that doesn't just talk smack he actually will get in the fight and he's the kind of guy says okay you know I I've said enough now it's time to to actually step up and do it and when he puts his mind or something he does a good job of it\nWhen he suggested to you and it's Donald Trump junior really glad to have the time when he suggested to you and your and your siblings I'm probably going to really do this you're initial reaction was well of course you should do it or no way\nNo listen I I wanted them to do it I you know he had been so Bogle he'd been so you know tough on at ... and it was time you know you you see the nonsense that is going on you say that the ... the reality is that there's no one that could have accomplished what he's been able to do that no one that you know there's so few that ever signed the front of a paycheck\nSo few that had ever you know in our whole political system that has ever had\nIt there someone family some of the livelihood their safety and wellbeing of their kids and grandkids dependent on their success he'd actually done it I mean that was the big laugh I had last week when you know Obama's running around claiming ... you know\nI remember when Obama say hey you didn't build that it's like now now now he owns it right because\nHis policies of oppressive taxation insane regulation they general hatred of towards business we went oh you didn't do that I mean Obama himself when my father is like I don't know why we couldn't have three three and a half four percent even even better right GDP Growth Obama goes and I quote there is no magic wand for that\nRight we have to New York times back them up no no no because you know of course he can do no wrong no no this is the new normal well Africa Deborah yeah of course we expect Obama to be able to fix anything you've never done anything\nIt it turns out you know as far as ... are you\nDone anything he'd never had any experience there was no way and we should expect him to be able to fix anything economically guess what my father has done that he has built businesses he didn't build that\nAnd so it shouldn't be a shock to people that were able to turn that around and now the Democrats won a reversal of that they want to take everything into one eighty why because we have an all time historic lows for blacks and unemployment for Hispanics\nFor women you you want to reverse all that I mean if the Democrats the ... sorry Donald Trump came out today in favor of oxygen\nDemocrats would be against it I mean that's their policy it's just hate\nBut we have to show up we have to stay in the fight because people's they've done I Love your dad doing it's so great it's amazing it's you know\nBut as I say well how are you voting for who your congressman they are voting for November what do you mean what November right they're not they want to vote and twenty twenty but they don't realize that it can all go away in twenty Eighteen they don't realize that Donald Trump is on the ticket in twenty Eighteen Donald Trump is on the ticket in six weeks\nSo we got to get out we got to mobilize if you like what's going on\nMake sure the fight for it because the other side I don't know what they're motivated by I don't even know what their platform there's other than you'll hate and outrage I mean you know what their outrage or they should be outraged about their platform and their failures over the last few decades but they are outraged about something else but they are turning up\nWe got to turn up I said all the time they're like no no no the same fake news media that said Donald Trump can't win and saying that he's going to lose now\nBelieve it I see the numbers you got to get out you gotta stay we can't just be fat how being lazy and expect this stuff to continue he needs he needs guys like Ted Cruz he needs guys like ... to all of the congressional people in Texas that are up he need those guys helping him he can't do it by himself and I didn't giving the house Nancy Pelosi\nHave you taken my advice telling you for a long time to get started on relief factor at least give the three week
