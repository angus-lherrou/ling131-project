need to let them go where we're we're we're done with that there you go boom have a nice one or just going to go there you go good All right see semi I did that if you were calling and I wasn't saying don't blame her okay\nUm I Want to talk about taxation because this seems to be some sort of a crazy stumping point for um\nFor the left it's weird to me so let's talk about taxation\nYou work and you make a dollar depending on your tax bracket on that dollar\nAnd he says after you get to the tax level in the brackets which they make a complicated on purpose um let's say you know the top tax bracket under Obama you are giving almost forty cents of that dollar to the government just because and and what you say well why why are you taking forty cents of my dollar\nAnd the answer will be because that's what it costs to do business if you want to do business in work in this country and you dared make that kind of money that successful you have to give us\nYou have to pay us off to allow you to keep on working thinking about that that's what the taxes yeah with the taxes taken it it's ... it's used for good things bags you're not really saying that right that's really not true I disagree that the government shouldn't be so involved in as much as it is\nFree housing free food free healthcare mean free lunch for the kids at school\n... we we never ever was supposed to have a a government that was like a charity that was never supposed to be involved in charity that should've been faith based organizations\nWorking with communities you know the ... soup kitchens and and homeless shelters and and food banks we did that as a community weren't good people we've always done that for some reason the government sneaked in and started doing it and they said well would you want to continue doing that lets you don't like the less you hate the children [noise]\nAnd if you're a poor people in the homeless [noise] what about our veterans\nIf you are at lunch you hate all those people you'll give us more money in taxes\nWell I don't buy that game I don't play it that way\nSo when I see in Andrew Gillum like they're so last night go on and on about how the state is supported President Trump giving a bunch of corporations billions of dollars in tax breaks I went All right if I Lived in Florida My vote before the safest because that's a good thing\nI had a good thing it's horrible the rich are getting richer the poor and getting poorer you're taking for the poor and giving you the rates hey taxation is not taking from the poor and giving it to the rich me giving somebody a tax break isn't giving the money is actually telling them we're not gonna take as much\nDay and see when corporations get tax breaks from I don't know let's be crazy and safe from thirty five down at Twenty one which just happened in the last year or so\nWhat did they do they took that money that was now there's ... didn't get stolen by the government didn't get confiscated inflict didn't get put into some government do what it did was it stayed the corporations hands and instead of putting it under the mattress or giving to the shareholders they give it to the employees\nThree and four million people\nGot big bonuses huge bonuses because these companies got got more of their money\nA lot of companies that were moving back dude man you just lowered taxes to the point to where we can do business in the United states of America Again we're going to start manufacturing there again\nWe're gonna we're gonna expand where do you get more people more jobs\nBut you got a guy like Gillum or somebody like Obama or somebody like Clinton or somebody like polo so you're somebody like read or somebody like Sanders even further in Aurora cause you a protest\nThey're going to say we need to raise taxes it's unfair what kind of tax breaks these rich horrible people got is disgusting way handed them all this money unit hitting them anything\nThey just got to keep more what they earn\nThey got to spend it in their local community ... whether it be their business their actual neighborhood their city their state doing good looking all the good things that have happened\nMillions and millions of Americans have gone back to work millions and millions of Americans have gotten raises millions and millions of Americans got bonuses the otherwise wouldn't get\nThat only happened because the government stop stealing so much of their money\nOn the left actually is doing its level best to convince especially the young generation of Americans the taxation is somehow good\nTaxation is bad taxation is making government bigger regulation higher and it's legitimately it's literally stealing money out of your out of your hard earned your hard work\nYou have a dollar that you earned and the government says if you're evil enough to make too much money we're taking thirty five cents or forty cents\nNow there are some people that nobody gets taken from them and some people actually have no taxes taken out and then they get a check at the end of the year that they didn't earn that doesn't make any sense either\n'cause that's coming from people who actually earned it is being stolen from these people and given to those people and still people like Andrew Gillum horrible for Florida is complaining or complaining\nThat corporations aren't paying their fair share\nThat's ridiculous if you actually look at it the corporation is the top one percent the top ten percent are\nPaying so much for the top ten percent in this country pay Seventy percent of the tax is thinking about that Seventy percent Ninety percent pays the under thirty\nYou think that's fair you up more of that you want the government to take more of their money
