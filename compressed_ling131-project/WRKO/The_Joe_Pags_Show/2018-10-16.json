George Bush like I was talking with them\nOver basketball player who I think there's a great guy I consider him a casual friend I mean I don't know what he called me a friendly knows me and I know him and um we're just having a conversation\nAnd heat after talking about the president for a bit he said to me I just want him to be presidential mhm and I got to be honest I I don't mean nobody meant but I don't know what he means and here's what I mean\nPresident Trump is who people hold up on our President Obama I should say is who people hold up on high as how to be presidential you've heard that right you know he carried himself\nHow he greeted the world and the people loved him and they found over him and what an amazing president said he was like a rock star\nAnd and this guy is like a bowl and they're trying to shop and then I think that President Trump would actually appreciate me saying that he's like a bowling a China shop but he doesn't he doesn't mind\nNow I could also say wow was President Obama was he also sucked does a president\nAnd I go down the list about all the things that I disagree with it but I think were bad for our freedoms our liberties are our country our standing in the world I Would have a list of what I think he did wrong so with a gun to my head you ask me do I want somebody who appears presidential and sucks of the job\nOr somebody who doesn't care if he knocks over your your favorite vase which would suck I don't like that but does it knocks it over as long as he's on the way to go you know bring riches and more freedoms are more liberties are more\nTax freedom and better trade deals I'll take the second guy does that make any sense it does it does not people from that family it and yes he comes off as as somebody who is rough around the edges and and sometimes\nKindergarten like what the name calling but I think that he also does it for a purpose\nThat is what does he have a friend in the past two days he's got Pocahontas and horse race trend in the past two days as he makes yet another great deal portrayed as he makes another great or you go through the tourist the storm ravaged areas and and does for the people there when he can and his capacity but\nI think that he purposely since people often as wild goose chases and the legacy media is dumb enough to jump on it and say horse race out there you know but those who don't know what we're talking about he referred to Stephanie Clifford Stormy Daniels as horse race\nAnd what did he say her third rate lawyer and yeah I Believe them\nSo you you know and and I did I asked her son I said ... we have to talk about horse race and just started laughing at me you know ... what do you say because you're right the President Obama probably would never said that\nBut he also a lot about Benghazi also a lot of fast and furious you also get a hundred fifty billion dollars to her on I mean we could go on and on about what I disagreed with him on so the fact that he seemed more presidential appeared his presence was more presidential did that make people feel good yeah hell yeah did\nDid it make me feel good no 'cause my job is to actually see what he's doing\nAnd when you see what he's doing you realize that that I Would prefer this guy\nWho actually made promises he's doing it somebody to actually be taxed back sometimes the attacks beforehand\nUm and I think you take the good with the bad when you take the good with the battled Obama I think the bad outweigh the good his first job performance when it comes to Trump\nThe good outweighs the bad as far as job performance for me and for any taxpayer in the United states it's eight eight nine four one paths ended eight nine four one Seventy four seven Joe ... dot com definitely want to hear from you on that horse races people you were talking with a horse\nRaces now that I Know that I Am in Switzerland they stopped touring it's it's ... it's what's happening also throw this out and I'm Talking about this more interest as we go forward\nUm the Connors is airing tonight\nAnd I'm not telling anybody to watch the counters that's not why I'm telling you that it's on in fact I'm telling you I'm not going to watch it\nI I I DVR Roseanne Barr I Would never DVR the counters I don't think that ABC should be rewarded for its knee jak isn't it's knee jerk reaction he said to what Rosanne said in that tweet should she treated that out no she admits she should have treated better\nActually admits it but should it be called racist and she was she lose her entire job her income her creation the Roseanne show I don't think so so I won't be watching that tonight and I'm urging ABC before it airs is that aired yet\nBefore airs you still have time\nPulled the plug on that dumb idea don't air the Congress put in a half an hour or something else does air that show and just like a few days ago ABC said I think that we probably made a hasty decision and maybe we should have thought
