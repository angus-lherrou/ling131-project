somebody will will be punching me and I'm not going to go to my good at being pumped action really good at avoiding it so we'll see alright ... does mccaskey said why she is saying no Disney ... cabin on or what do you have\n... yeah and actually a CBS thing um\nShe wanted to vote against Kevin I'm In the Senate floor that she'd been leaning toward confirming cabin on but she said quote\nI take this obligation we have in the role of advice and consent as seriously as anything I'm obligated and privileged to be able to vote on she read from the jury additional conduct Kelly about how I judge should avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety Israeli hide that a giant she'll act all times and not just sometimes when you're wearing your road\nAnd the judge that act all times in a matter of that promotes public confidence she sat\nMurkowski than she did nothing Kavanaugh would vote and wrote the way she also said she did not think he wouldn't be a vote to and health care or in danger Alaskan natives\n[laughter]\nI didn't I didn't have a really good she was leaning towards confirming him or changed your mind and\nI realized that I take this obligation we have the wrong advice and consent as seriously as anything I'm obligated and privileged to be able to vote on\n\nBut she never says why she's saying no\nNo and then she went over that conduct kind of like about hijacked shoveling impropriety any parents than impropriety\n... he hasn't had any appearances of impropriety\n...\nShould I just want to make sure that I understand what I'm asking you for an opinion but on the facts Lisa Murkowski the senator from the great state of Alaska has said I was leaning towards confirming him but I decided not to because a judge shouldn't have any\nAny either a acts of impropriety or any parents have the appearance of impropriety\nInvention who say and in fact it was inappropriate there was impropriety what he did this she didn't say\nHe tried to find something else this is just CBS but that's all they had at the moment when they're trying to get something else for yeah\nI mean what am I going to get along here that the U.S Senate or one of a hundred who's voting against this guy should actually go valid reason for why she would vote against the guy\nAt my asking too much and now I don't think so\n[laughter] it's uh eighty nine for one pack a day to day nine for one Seventy two four seven ... let me go to the phone lines and let's go to Alaska let's go to grant twos we've got a comment on this talk to me\nHello Joe hey I just want to comment about Lisa or she is probably\nOne of the most liberal a Republican senator that we've ever had and I really think that she has been influenced by a very vocal liberal minority\nBut I can tell you that there is a very large conservative bloc here outspoken independent conservative bloc here in Alaska and we have been sending\nScores of messages to her phone and I for one had sent one gave my name and address so she knows who it was and I believe that she was just influenced by the liberal people but I don't think she really realized that the out of the conservative bloc\nWho is outraged here in the state by by what she has done and I believe she has a filter political fate\nWell I think I think that she has is well I mean it was it was she wasn't a shoe in which she wanted me she almost lost right why would you take this treated all\nShe wasn't right in and I'm really surprised that she wanted and you know folks like myself we're a little bit scared of Joe Miller because he is a\nSo right to the right that ah you know we voted for Lisa but uh I heard a and as far as your comment on Sarah Palin it could very well beyond her that contact you because\nI read on Fox News I think she made the comment\nOn some social media to uh Lisa that said something\nTo the effect of hey Lisa I can see twenty twenty two from my window\nA [laughter] I was on his arm or a lawyer and running in ... is a great\nLine I loved that are actually Lisa Murkowski's up and twenty twenty two so she's going to be around for a bit longer but but but I Would love for several people to run it gives her she would win hands down right\nShe I I think so because of some of the things that have happened I'm no great fan of Sarah Palin but I Would vote for her in a heartbeat and I'm sure everybody else would as well and that just a lesson I Love your show I haven't listened to it very much I just want to tell you that though we in Alaska\nWe are definitely taking this seriously and we're going to go to the polls and the last thing I Want to say to your lighten up on carry a little bit\nOf mine and rarely I cannot believe you just went there and here in Studio ... even when you're having a bad day I got

the the the motive behind it it's kind of what I Do\nYeah no I think I I think we have to have discussions you know this country's going through a series division right now so if we don't we just state or narrative and then\nBlock someone or stop the discussion at the end of the discussion and so that's kind of Ben doing what a lot of the other side has been doing do you have to keep the

then she ended up you know attacking the president the president is and the president bat a cabin on this and Kevin of that and and then at the end of it you don't she says oh by the way I'm a Republican I don't believe you are I don't believe you weren't let you don't know the Republican actually believes\nCertainly innocent till proven guilty certainly corroborate the story certainly if it's been refuted you don't have to just keep on believing that had happened\nYou're going to do is actually I think harms the ability of true victims to come forward and be believed\nEspecially the Ramirez and and the sweating to allegations me those are ridiculous now the first one I Do believe that Christie for something happened to where we should figure it out she she figured out and get some justice in ...\nI've had nothing in my opinion to do with Brett Kavanaugh and my opinion is based on the facts by the FBI by the seven FBI background checks and buddy the Senate Judiciary committee I don't understand why anybody believes the left on that committee and fix that they're telling the truth\nAnd the argument that if you believe cabinet over Ford you don't care about victims of sexual assault is a species argument at best in fact it's an educated even though I deliver liquor sister All right if you don't mind a carry give us the nuts and bolts from today we'll take a
