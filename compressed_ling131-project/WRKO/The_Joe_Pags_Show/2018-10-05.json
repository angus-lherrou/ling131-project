you walk working in one hundred and twenty seven to ... like eighty to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\nFrom ABC News on the recent in about twenty four hours senators will vote on Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination and so far it looks like he could be confirmed Mr\nThe big one is usually the presidential election the general election for the president's or ... big one and actually doing with the one that people get geared up for the midterms the local races there's a lot of people ignore that stuff and I do believe that what's happening here\nIf\nKennedy this step down and cabinet isn't nominated\nOr anybody trust me anybody would have been about what you would have been nominated would have been assaulted attacked verbally and an accusation wise just as as Brett Kavanaugh was this is not unique to Brett Kavanaugh they didn't care who it was and that was actually you know shown to be true\nThat night that he was nominated when they were actually Sharpie pending in the name because they weren't sure to the poor people who were the front runners who the person was going to be they had made up science already they just didn't have any amount and yet\nThey had emails that went out immediately um some of them actually just said\nSpace space for blank blank for the name of the judge 'cause they didn't feel it in there is that stupid they were\nSo this was going to happen no matter who the nomination went to if Kennedy the Kennedy those to step down before the midterms I think there's a really good chance that the house in the Senate both go to the Democrats I really do believe that\nI really do believe that because Republicans or conservatives were just busy enjoying the lower taxes higher pay the higher pay checks the ability to go out to eat and go shopping some more\nUm there were enjoying the fact that where they didn't have any jobs available during the Obama there are plenty of jobs now and people are going back to work in fact there are more jobs than workers available to fill them\nWe've economically we're doing incredibly so when you get sort of fat like that and and\nThings start getting better free economically your bank account you don't pay as much attention to politics because things are going well happy days are here again\nThen this happens Kennedy steps down and cabin on now is the guy who's nominated again keep in mind and I stand affirmed by this he doesn't matter who was nominated they were going to try to do this to whoever it was\n\nSo he's nominated and suddenly we start paying into it was kind of a guy and then we hear you know he's he's he's answering the questions right he's got this great history people in the left or suggesting that he that he be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nAnd the Democrats who all ... or guaranteeing themselves that they were going to win the house and Senate back\nAll winter um what's going on here\nIs guys look a little bit too squeaky clean\nWhat's the story here we're we're in deep trouble it will stop this I mean I'm Talking about you're going to have a traditional American values Supreme Court for the next thirty forty years it will do something to stop this guy\nSo yes it was about abortion\nYes it was about a socialist looking America yes it was about legislating from the bench you know they they like Kagan they'll like sort of my or they like a bitter Ginsburg bail like people who see a very liberal very left to sort of view of our constitution\nAnd our our rights and our freedoms the right doesn't\nGorsuch in ... and all you do when Roberts generally Robert so not all the time and if this guy gets on there they see it as here is the framework here is in stone the way this country is constituted\nVisitors are foundation like a foundation in the building and it's not movable you can't move the foundation wants his laid I guess you can but not much\n\nSo if if it says this that's how we should rule that says that that's how we should rule the left says well it says that we should probably think that maybe abortions a privacy issue what it says this we should probably say well although marriages it in there which you just say\nEverybody can get married gay straight whatever\nSo you're you're you're looking in a court that scares the hell out of them because it will be based in the actual truth that our founding fathers put in this document that was meant to restrict\nAn overwhelming overpowering over wielding government\nThey don't like that they want the government to have the control now they've got their millions and the indoctrinated masses who think of government has the control I somehow benefit socialism my benefit you'll take for the rich guy the evil rich guy and give it to me\nWhereas wealth has never been a zero sum game that in this country no freedom celebrities capitalism and free enterprise is not a zero sum game if you've got a million dollars that doesn't mean I Can't have some but I won't have some of yours but I can go out and work for and get it myself\nIf you have a really nice car I could work really hard and go get a really nice car too I don't need you to give me your car\nI don't need you to downsize your house and get one that's the same size a mind to make me feel better it's not a zero sum game in a capitalistic free enterprise society we all have the ability through guaranteed equal opportunity\nThat has to be guaranteed um it's not equal then you can but at the equal opportunity is really available and it is because it's a lot in this country\nThen you have the ability to go in and do for yourself and your family and and your friends in your neighborhood\nYou have that ability I don't need the government and believe me I used to be ...
