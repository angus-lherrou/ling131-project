I I Do people there actually I used to work with him and I don't get it\nJust report the story correctly and the idea that I I think where their parents actually who said this is unbelievable and inappropriate I Can't believe they would ever do this this is all it just seemed to be the ... that this Jessica man was was just responding that some children said I'm gay and they made fun of me thank you so much are so great mhm [noise]\nYeah 'cause I guess it's more of a natural German out bullying and when a positive message that Jessica brought kidding middle school\nI'm against drag queens reading to our kids are ... or ... or directing or teaching our kids in school if you're a\nTolerant person you'll tolerate my angle on this but no tolerance and acceptance only means you tolerate and you accept what it is we're telling you you have to\nTolerate or accept and if you don't tolerate or accepted you're somehow the hater\nUm and it's dumb it's dumb look if you want to be a drag queen I'm a freedom of liberty guy if you want to put on a dress and you're a dude and put on some make up and go dance around her singing a club and make money is as a female impersonator fine\nI don't have a problem with you quite literally I Will not go out of my way to go see the show it doesn't interest me\nBut some people think that's incredible go do it man have added make it out but\nBut the idea that we now somehow have to invite that person in to redo the kids are have a career day why what percentage of society would you imagine carry are grown asked men who are are are\nLiving their lives and making their living being drag queens how honor now less than one percent\nWay less than one needs miniscule\nSo are we actually telling kids we don't have enough drag queens we need more\nOriginally kids if you're gay they knew therefore are a drag queen doesn't give the example that we heard of the story was that some kids that I Am gay and people treat me like crap it's only met you and everything's great so I'm not sure I get it\nWhat is it that we're trying to promote other than exactly what it is but I don't like the it is what it is saying\nIt is because I think you could say something more than it is what it is but in this case a drag queen is a drag queen\nFor career David drag queen comes in to talk about being a drag queen or his career he's going to talk about being a drag queen so it was the objective by that school and that district and that area about ways Denver so it might all be high it could be\n[laughter]\nI said that directly to teach kids\n[laughter] it's got to be what happened right now\nLook ... object comes home mom that is so great had a drag queen teachers how to how to dress up like women today how you how you doing what's her dinner and they know about that you're good and now a day the sun moms ... up at the school and the next morning yeah I mean\nYou might actually why because if a school's reaction having been caught because I guess they were hoping it wouldn't be caught but at the school's reaction is if you have a ... where to send out a list of all of our future guess if you have a problem let us know\nThey're actually saying that the parents are the ones that have to decide what is and what does it offensive and simple wouldn't lose or what is inappropriate have\nAre still going to invite the drag queens that your kid doesn't have to be in that class\nAnd we got here I don't or next week if you've got a problem with a convicted murderer let us know what do you what do you what's the matter with you oh drag queens or convicted murderers do I'm saying you can't just decide on anybody you feel like deciding to come in and redo the class and teach about the career you can't just do that\nWe actually do expect that you'll have some common sense rationale and some and some logic\nAnd your decisions for our kids this is why I continue to say\nPublic education is in dire straits we need vouchers we need school of choice we need competition so these schools will stop this overwhelming indoctrination there is no reason for middle school kids to learn about the life of a of a

loose or an hour\nTwo thirty in the voice of Boston Denver you our\nVoices Boston New York about one hundred and twenty seven till you see like eighty to Boston and I heart radio station\nOn the scene is\nTo be the attorney general of the great state of Minnesota what's interesting as well is that um ward lowest no leading by seven points\nThat's a big deal Minnesota is not the most ... leading state you're going to find although geographically most of Minnesota is right leading I'm politically speaking because of the large blocks of blue in the big cities it's a it's also generally speaking a Democrat or a blue state\nHaving said that he's up by seven which is a massively for Republican in that state and the less distorting to freak out a little bit so we've got all that going on we got all that to get to and then some\nAnd um but we also have this news that if you pay attention to news this has been a big deal all day right Jerry ...\nYes it is the package is being spent in the mail and ... it's very interesting how they were trying to get them from this person to that person they're all um high profile Democrats that are receiving these packages the media some of it all ready already alleging\nThat Trump's fault somehow the rights fault and we'll talk about that certainly but if you can give us the nuts and bolts of the latest on what's going on with the investigation into what these packages are from\nFox News packages containing suspected explosive devices were intercepted en route to some of the most prominent political figures in the country including\nA former president bronco Obama and Hillary Clinton putting law enforcement on high alert Wednesday and prompting evacuations in sweeps and several facilities CNN's New York office was among those evacuated due to the discovery of an inherent explosive device\nOn forcing officers to the incident appear related and the devices appear to be pipe bombs and law enforcement official directly involved in the U.S to gauge until Fox News the devices have similar packaging labeling and postage leading investigators to believe that one person or group is responsible\nAnd the first public remarks and the packages which largely targeting democratic figures President Trump said Wednesday afternoon at a knife is being inspected and a major federal investigation is now under way we have to unify we have to come together and Trump said in the bill signing for opioid legislation\nActs are threats of political violence in any kind have no place in the United states of America\nIf in the Democratic leader Charles Schumer and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi issued a joint statement when the afternoon saying that Trump's words ring hollow until he reversed in his statement that condoning acts of violence\nTime and time again the president's condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and actions and Schumer and Pelosi\nExpressing support for the Congress men who body slammed a reporter and neo Nazis and killed a young woman in Charlottesville has reporters at rallies or getting violent protesters\nThey cater is around the world who murdered their own citizens and referring to the free press as the enemy and the people in the last incident a law enforcement source film Fox News the Capitol police investigating a suspicious package\nAddress the Democratic California representative Maxine Waters\nAnd packages at the Capitol Hill screening facility in Maryland rapidly evolving security scare went public when the secret service confirmed Wednesday morning at the officers in ... king suspicious packages identified as potential explosive devices sent to Obama and Clinton\nSo it didn't take long for Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to lie about it didn't take long at all I mean blaming the president really doesn't make any sense Maxine Waters has been urging above violence and harassment by people on the left for a long time um I don't remember\nI don't remember I'm\nAnybody who was a mainstream Republican or conservative\nBlaming the left for the guy that showed up shooting people at the congressional baseball practice where Steve police almost died I don't remember people saying because that was a far left wing Bernie guy he he was a far left wing socially too actually showed up to kill Republicans\nBut it doesn't take people on the left Chuck Schumer I'm Nancy Pelosi some media factions on the left to immediately blame the president and those are the right for the acts of clearly evil people\nNow yes all of these packages allegedly we're going to to Democrats the way they were doing it and carry correct me if I'm wrong but there were doing it on some of them\nIs they would send it to a bogus address but the return address would be like Deborah Debbie Wasserman Schultz ... yes center and so they figured okay they couldn't deliver to the address on the package there would return it\nTo veto this made up return address so they'll find out all the packages I saw a very similar all of the alleged explosives really even know if they're real explosive shut\n'em look similar to me it is not okay\nIf you're somebody who believes in traditional conservative American values that's a good thing um but it it doesn't mean you try to scare or intimidate or kill the other side\nAnd frankly the other side is what's made known through the through the annals of history\nIn this country as the side of violence and and terrorism and so on I mean again Democrats or the party of the KKK of Jim Crow lynchings of slavery those are all Democrats constructs they're all mechanisms of the Democratic party they haven't changed much\nJust where the plantation is this change so the idea that somehow the Republicans with the conservatives are the ones that do things like this we're not\nSo if you're out there contemplating violence hey get help and be that's not how you when um when it comes to elections do I think that it could be a set up by somebody on the left trying to make it look like the writers doing this while the game as possible\nI don't know anything that would point to that being a fact but I also don't know anything that would point to a Republican or conservative being the one who did this generally speaking when bad people do bad things they're just bad people\nNo matter what their brain told them would make sense you don't show up with\nWith a rifle or or gun of any short to a congressional baseball practice looking to kill people but certain party you don't send packages looking to intimidate or hurt people of the opposite party that's not how you when\nWhen it comes to a political system to value system in the governmental system in the United states of America so I

to say\nBut the uh SAP always said that\nThat but at the top brass told them not to do to go to any polling places or not to do this and that and it's being reported by other stations and whatever I got it from the police chief that no the police don't play a role in politics and there really is no reason for them to to go patrol in a parking lot of the polling place will be like a drive by one on the street or something\nBut um but they will certainly\nGo to a polling place should recall bitter by a suicide who needs their assistance\nSo I mean that made it pretty clear to me but Joaquin Castro shows his deep hatred\nFor men and women in blue with their lives in line for all of us with his community in every community across this country every day he shows this hatred for them once he sends out a ... a tweet like that's suggesting that they somehow already today to voters it's actually disgusting\nAnd the guy that goes isn't smart I think as a lawyer too you gotta be pretty smart to be a lawyer but he's not smart enough to know how to ... it was but he said that out\nWell I've got people who are on the line who want to talk about that I'm going to tell you right now to go very fast because of the top of every hour\nAnd same I should've been forms you of is that we're gonna move on past is but I'm not gonna hang up on you know top of every hour we try to sort of reset things\nSo I had to reiterate what we were talking about last there will be very quickly take a couple of phone calls were getting to the Caribbean and stuff bottom of the hour we'll be lieutenant colonel Jeffrey ... he's the director of the center for tourism all say marriage university also has a book out called radical Islam why we talk about the caravan who's in it\nWe also talked extensively about the bomb scare the bomb threat and exactly what it is that um that investigators are probably doing right now let me go to the phone lines quickly it's Murphy and Michigan Murphy what's up\n[noise] hey Joel I'm I'm a retired police officer and I don't know what's going on now but when I was working on election day\nI work this assignment several times I was given a big list of ... re election laws regarding the polling places were in my particular job for that and I was to go to all the polling places and make sure that these laws were like ... not obstructing the entrance\nNo demonstrations with so many ... of the polling place ... that was my job for that night\nWell then actually it would make sense to me that there would be a police officer stationed up the door but if you listen to what this congressman says allegedly if there is a policeman policewoman they police presence whatsoever at a polling place that means that you're intimidating voters this is how stupid this guy is\nWhat I was sent there to make sure that people get intimidated I don't know what's the one\nIn fact when we saw in Philadelphia in two thousand eight that they're actually weren't Black Panther party members intimidating voters telling them to vote for Obama it was the police that had to come in to remove them so the police in my opinion or a positive presidents but the allegation that they were patrolling the parking lot and giving people dirty looks\nAnd intimidating them somehow is an allegation even this guy who so far left wing but he doesn't even know it even he should be embarrassed by it but he's not because he's just that guy\nUh I don't know what to tell you that Joe but I'm telling you I Know a lot of hard work and cops and why would we intimidated everybody into voting or not voting I mean\nWhy there's no reason to do very well we'll be allegation is that something Murphy I appreciate you and thank you for your years of service in the community um the reason that a guy like walking Castro sent something out like that whether he got a call or not I have no proof that he was contacted but he says he was\nUm the reason why he says that I was 'cause he wants to allege that the police\nAre somehow evil and the Republicans and he is a strong fervent supporter of of of democracy and the Democrats in your right to vote it it's just ... the guy is a sham ... every every twenty puts out a puts his intelligence in question even more from me\nLet me go back to Vic allegedly knows Joaquin Castro used to work with him or something that I cannot prove that and I told my daughter basically I wasn't going to take you on the air and we're we're really we're we're skating on very thin ice\nWhen it when it comes to somebody alleging that they know somebody or what is that you worked with him in the campaign I don't know that to be a fact and they want people to know that right up front what's on your mind however\nNo no roe Joe uh yeah I actually\nWas part of walking Castro staff when he was a state representative\nIntact then I'm I've known walking for a long time uh I don't think either do fit uh I Do obviously like you said he's a very well educated guy went to Stanford and Harvard I think so and the climate that we have the um where\nRight now we're in the middle of this hot hot\nTime in America it's so easy for us to appeal the boat bay is either one left or right and well I certainly\nWould hope that if I was a member of walking that right now to advise them not to be putting that language out against the the cops I can assure you that walking is a very very\nEven articulate man he cares a lot about it that you and I know for certain that he cares a lot about cops and the members of the San Antonio police\nDepartment I Want to stop you of it either way it is it are just defend the guy with the guys afraid to come on the show and defend themselves but let me ask you very directly when he was on CNN the other day and he made that disgusting allegation about Jared Kushner did that make him look intelligent to you\nI I I did not see the common ...\nWell what about you and you're listening to my show and you know that I'm at a liar so I'm going to tell you in context what he said he said that Jared because there are reports out there that I've seen this is what he said that we're Jared Kushner gave apolitical hit list\nTo the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who obviously acted on it was ... that's what this guy said even poppy what's her face over on CNN had to say we're not reporting that what reports are you talking about ...\nOkay there you go ... she's she says we are not reporting that we certainly haven't reported that he said well I've seen reports just just suffice it to say I've seen reports and then later he had to take to Twitter and tried to explain his way out of it he actually alleged that the son in law the president of the United states\nGave the crown prince of Saudi Arabia hit list on which ... name was and clearly the crown prince acted on it that's what a walking Castro said on live television Vic\nSo as much as you and I I look I admit I have a personal conversations with little young holy and and I don't agree on much but at least the guy had a set big enough to come on my show and break it down and get it done and we're always very nice to each other when we saw each other Joaquin seems to be a little bit out of his mind\nWhen you go on live television allege something like that if you don't have concrete proof that that happened\nI think the euro dumb guy I mean that would that would lead somebody to believe he's not very smart right\nCertainly\nGo and you know what after I get off the phone with you right now I'm personally going to call walking in and tell him that I was defending him on the job pack Joe and encourage him to come on your show\nWell I Would appreciate that but we do yourself a favor also before you make that phone call\nGo and look on the Internet and find that piece of information that clip with with poppy Harlow\nAnd go watch what he says and then see how we got to try to backtrack and then he takes to Twitter as you I'm sure you've seen and he does allege that there's something inherently wrong with a police officer\nPatrolling narrow polling place and many signs that walking is if you've got a call him if you see this kind of information now I don't think that you're a lawyer Vic I think that you're telling the truth that he's a nice guy he's smart he likes police but when you put something out there that says the exact opposite about police why shouldn't I Believe his tweet\nHis tweet is alleging that police are intimidating people at polls you'd agree with that right\nYeah so I mean what are you all about that that\nI think what what what is happening right now Joe and I I heard your interview the other day I was explaining that your daughter she is the one who is\nThat is I have my daughter and cell phone yet\nI appreciate it I Know Nicola I'm a good friend and Nicola ... good guy was a freshman at Central Catholic you know and he was that when he was a senior coke and I think what what what is interesting Joe is Nico touched upon something because guys like me and Nico there is no longer a\nPart of the blue dog Democrat within our party\nThere is no place for you at all there is no place for you whatsoever on the left any more there just isn't\nAnd and Joe I think what ended up happening is that guy like Joaquin who I work or who I Believe is actually more centrist then he left on I think a guy like walking has to push so far to the left in order to appease the bay\nBy throwing out innuendos and get things that seem completely out of left field\nI got to tell you that I I got to tell you I don't know what team because he's afraid to talk to me I've never met the guy I met his brother and I know his brother but if I only know him from his Twitter feed\nFrom where he shows up on local television only supporting illegal aliens and so on I have to make a decision about who the guy is so if I invite you to come on and you show me that you are so many different I'm Down with that and it's not about me it's about the reach I have but he doesn't want to do that because I think you're right I think that he'll he'll make the overlords on the far left in ...\nFocused on the

aren't ...\nThere's not enough ... enough postage on them to get anywhere um and then the devices are taking pictures in showing the devices\nWhich I find to be extremely abnormal I don't remember

we've got cameras of course is the same day or error with ...\nYeah it was you know left wing extremists that was killing people when the boss the battle was around and of course uh you know if you do make a bomb you practice and you know you said these things off somewhere somebody does this guy and a girl\nI'm but this person is watching the news as well and uh so we'll see what happens I'm confident though that a way to save a little bit here and the next day if not sooner about who this really is\nIt's a ... percent returns wants the marriage university Jeff we get DNA and we get out of it is we get fingerprints off of exploded bombs these haven't exploded so you've got to be just an absolute plethora of information available on there I mean you can't be so careful that there's nothing left when you make a bomb right\nYeah it's not just that but also you've got to there's cameras there's cameras up everywhere in New York so someone if it's a career you know something can be traced back and that's why I think we have a very good chance of finding out who this is but I Would also you\nKnow make an appeal to the public if you do what do you think about something with us and
