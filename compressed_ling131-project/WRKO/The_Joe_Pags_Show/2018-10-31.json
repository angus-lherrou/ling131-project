I Would\nI Would like to drill down there and what representative deal said uh the the fundraising while the vote was being taken on the cover and did you did you not do that and\nActually I don't know and I don't know what the\nHell out of it as an editor in ethics committee that and I think ... might have been filed about a hundred and and I will I Will check into that I don't know\nIf you could see the whole room\nYou could see the whole room was like whoa even the Boston Globe reporter and they've officially endorsed her so that's really fair you've got three liberals as the moderator and one of them works for a paper that endorsed Warren but that go even the Boston Globe reporter was you don't know\nNow just left it at that I Would have really pounce\nIf it was when you don't know excuse me you don't know no senator you do know you broke the law and you're lying but anyway he got a really good shot in the second one used when she's asked point blank\nAre you in it for six years in the Senate or can you tell\nUs right now you are not going to run for the White House you're going to remain a senator and serve out your full term if you win reelection listen there were answer it was very telling roll it Britain\nThat Senator Warren question too will you serve you a full term if he were elected next Tuesday\nSo I've already said that I Will take a walk at running for president after the election but I guarantee that no matter what I Do I work for the people of the commonwealth of Massachusetts\nOr the full term as you say [laughter] representative deal so yes the answer for me is yes but since she got a few afterwards and ironically my opponent and President Trump do have something in common either wants to be senator for Massachusetts but it's always want to be president represented [laughter]\nI Know and people laugh even not even her supporters in the room were laughing now I'm so basically she's not interested in the job she doesn't want the job she wants to run for the White House everybody knows that she's using the state and the voters as a stepping stone now [noise]\nJust so that you know um my spies my sources who were at the debate\nWas told me two things number one she loaded up the audience with her supporters Lawrence mayor Dan Rivera Marty Meehan I mean you\nCould run down the whole line Marty Walsh was there a though who's who of the Democratic machine were in the crowd tonight the second thing and I hope the media has the guts to look into this story they won't they are going to cover up for but I Hope somebody has some integrity\nDid you notice how strange her eyes were throughout the entire debate\nDid you notice how she kept looking away looking away looking away the reason was she was getting signals\nI Know this for a fact\nI had sources they're they're saying Jeff you could see the signaling that was taking place\nSo they were telling her what answers to give when to give them how to give them and I guess they're worried that she had a meltdown essentially in the first debate\nWhere she just lost her head she was absolutely rabid so I think they're trying to tell her easy little passion no two passionate go down go you're sounding rabbit go down down lower and lower the tone lowered the dome but whatever it was they were clearly coaching her and they were clearly sending her signals\nNow [noise] the one that shocked me the one that truck written the one that shocked a jar and I think what everybody's going to be talking about tomorrow\nYou remember Trump's infamous comments said in private at the White House and a meeting with Republicans and Democrats about certain countries being I Can't say the word crop whole country's she actually said the word on the air\nIt wasn't dumped it wasn't filtered there was no bleep\nSo listen now to the woman who says that her worst curse word\nIs poop well I'll tell you this what she said live on the air today at seven o'clock or whatever seven o'clock issue which children watching was a hell of a lot worse than poop roll it Brittany\n... has said he's going to have Donald Trump's back a hundred percent of the time\nAnd I just want to remind people in this context what that means\nWhen Donald Trump said that Mexican immigrants were rapists and drug dealers Mr Dale stood by when Access Hollywood tapes came out Mr Dale stood by [laughter] when Donald Trump Muslim ban in place Mr deal stood by in Charlottesville occurred and and Donald Trump called the white nationalist\nFind people what's your deal actually agreed [laughter] when Donald Trump referred to coal country like Haiti in El Salvador and Africa district Dale stood by\n... well now we believed the you know that that word out guy I let me just called the crap that I we bleep out the crop ... the crop word\nWell yeah I don't know I mean we had an audience so I don't know if she was looking to people in the audience for closer signals I couldn't tell you that from where I was standing because my view\nIs of the three moderators and looking over to my right Senator Warren herself so all I was doing was basically focusing on the issues that were asked to me listening to what she was saying and in responding in a way that clarified exactly where she stood whether it's\nYou know exploiting loopholes for herself or whether it's doing nothing for our state you know that's all I was focused on I don't know if she was getting any tips or or hand signals or whatever\nJeff ... was there anything tonight that surprised you that you know that you didn't expect that you were a little bit trucks are surprised by\nThat I got to be honest with you I\nWould have thought that she would have known that she had broken or she had violated a campaign ethics behind violations because of a illegally fundraising before she took a a confirmation vote and the fact that she said she didn't know that ah\nHow could she US Senator went breaks all over the news today and she doesn't know that at the debate this evening unbelievable\nOh no Jeff ... you're too nice guy to say it she's white she knows she knows she broke the law she knows she engages any legal fundraising she's just lying\nAnd I think she was surprised that you brought it up and I've got to give a with a moderator or a credit when he followed up and said well because you remember she was trying to basically spin her way out of it\nYou know she's trying to tie you to Trump she's going on about you when Trump you're just like Trump blah blah blah blah and she's obviously filibustering and you know to the moderators credit he said whoa whoa whoa no he just charge you with the legal fundraising\nDo you like do you want to comment and then when she said I don't know Jeff on television the way it came across was that the three moderators were shocked that she said I don't know and that even the audience you can almost hear like a blue like\nThere was the entire audience knows that the people she invited and my my people that were\nThere so everybody so everybody in the audience was surprised that her answer was I don't know\nYet from somebody I Know from the news from I guess where the media hangs out to watch the debate a there was a shock to the newsroom as well that does she\nBasically was not in this case probably honest that she didn't know she had violated that are that law and so again this is a race about integrity\nVersus hypocrisy and clearly with Elizabeth Warren she is benefiting from the ... system everywhere she can she doesn't want to admit it it's unbelievable I look I I think this\nMade it extremely clear of what people's choices on November six and I'm hoping everybody listening to your show right now I'm helps us out whether it's coming out to events whether it's making a donation to a deal for Senate dot com we need every last chance of helped to make sure we crossed the finish line and went on Tuesday because that's what I'm doing I'm spend the next\nSix seven days camping everywhere I Can't I'm leaving tomorrow morning at six thirty in the morning in the RV and we're not going to stop until we\nWin that race on Tuesday\nJeff I've got to say what does come across it really came across tonight but what came across in all three debates was how much you know about Massachusetts how much you know about local state issues Massachusetts issues\nAnd she looks very disconnected she honestly she looks obsessed with Trump She looks obsessed with running for the White House in twenty twenty it came across she hasn't really been in the state very much for a very long time\nOr your grasp of the issues your knowledge especially of local state issues ah came across very strong a Jeff if you want it to come across as a viable alternative you did it\n[noise] well thanks Geoff and look I'm just a guy from Whitman you know my wife and I\nWe uh we're like everybody else we're just trying to make it we're trying to get our kids to best future we can provide for them and I've been fortunate enough to be able to represent three towns and try to provide those families a better future now I get a chance to go to Washington and wake them up and say you know what Massachusetts needs a seat at the table we don't have right now with Elizabeth Warren I Can't wait\nTo get six years of working in Washington to put everybody in Massachusetts for so the fact that I've been around talking to people listening to them unlike Elizabeth Warren who just lectures them all the time about what she knows and what she thinks is good for them it was clear and I can't wait to be the next senator it's going to be amazing when we get that seat for the next six years\nThe Jeff I Know there's a lot of people who want to talk to you or it was an incredible night tonight but I've got to ask you this now you know you're my friend you know I Love you you know I'd go to the gates of hell and back for you I'm going to do everything in my power and the next six days to get you all acted\nBut I've got to ask you this question and pleased Jeff do me a favor I I don't want to go to the talking points from the gods from the heart\nYou have three debates to go after her on the phony Indian DNA test issue you really didn't do it you see it or a little bit but you really didn't pounce all over her why\n[noise] I'll tell you a jets she made national News International news when she released that video two weeks ago\nUm created an and forced air for herself and I got to tell you Jeff one of the things that when you're in a serving in office if your opponent basically shooting themselves in the foot you step away and you let them keep doing that she shot herself in the foot in a huge way and I like I said\nEverybody knows it we don't care about her ancestry the only reason we say that is because\nIt shows that she's abuse the system what I care about is the integrity and I did Colorado on that and I showed time and time again where she uses the system to take advantage of it everybody knew about the DNA now we just need to make sure that I use all that time especially to get every other loopholes exploits out there and I get\nA Jeff that three hundred and forty thousand dollar property deduction loophole that she'd talk\nAre ya ya you just look I don't want to put words in your mouth I Know you called they're out on it today but there's only two possibilities either she's been lying if you look at her tax returns either she's been lying to the IRS\nWar she's been taking one hell of a mother a deduction\nAnd this from a woman who wants to everybody else to pay higher taxes Jeff how can she stand there and you know in a ball face way talk about what's going on and claim of three hundred and forty thousand dollar property deduction and act like it's no big deal\nWell look I mean Jeff I'm I don't know if you live in the neighborhood or a city or a town where you can take three hundred and fifty thousand dollars off your property tax but she does and she uses that and she's meanwhile telling everybody else they've got to pay higher taxes\nSo it's a total hypocrisy but the fact of the matter is that um ... you know first opened up her taxes to everybody because she wants to run for president that's what you do you say I'm putting my taxes that they are because I Want to run for president\nWe've both filed ethics wanting to get everybody how much a you know we're making what where investments are all that sort of thing she did it on purpose and it turned out to buy her too because when she went\nThey called her out in the fifty thousand dollars worth of clothing deductions she said well yeah that it was an air an entry or which by the way is basically falsifying the taxes but she called it in a tree or so let that go right and then the next thing she did was say oh by the way they may be some other areas in my taxes to well we found them we found them and she explained it\n[noise] go to deal for Senate dot com D.

I wrote down his polished he's knowledgeable worn doesn't know Massachusetts She could care less about Massachusetts\nBut the problem is this is ... and I predict I think that if she wins our governor when he gets re elected\nIs going to switch parties and if by chance she went to a presidency he's going to nominate a democratic replacement\nInteresting interesting I don't think he's a Republican at all no one even a door still\nHold on a bill you're completely right but let me ask you this did you notice in that one of these lightning round questions they asked about how to you know what what grade would you give Baker and she gave him a C and Jeff right even though Baker one new door some even do Baker stabbed him in the back\nYeah you know deal classy guy because they had a private arrangement I support you if you when you support me if I when he said be and hopefully it will be an a and the next term or so we've had when he couldn't really take a shot back at at a bakery didn't do it\nDo you remember when Biden debated rhino Ryan yes Biden\nTore Ryan to cases just by his comments Ryan was all nuts and bolts gotta have all the figures lined up and fighting just harmed appealing\nLike an attack dog [noise] absolutely absolutely that's what I what I what I Want to go into the state not her she had a phony she couldn't care less but uh that's what I heard that that's what I protect\nOur interests there haven't there's going to switch parties so I'll get off a lesson day at a mile you got a great choice and the everyday\nThank you thank you very much bill and that is a very interesting theory a you know what I mean he is a rhino he's a ... he really is a Republican in name only you know I really wouldn't be surprised\nI mean doesn't it make sense\nThe way he's so close with Bob to Leo the Democratic legislator a legislature forgive me how close he is with so many Democrats held the Boston Globe has endorsed him again\nHow the global loves him I could easily see him just in time for the twenty twenty election to make a big splash saying I Can't take being a Republican in the party of Trump I just I Can't do it so I'm ... I'm I'm a changing affiliation I'm switching to a Democrat\nAnd if it was it before and managers to win the Democratic nomination or or whatever ends up being president God Forbid so were placed or with a Democrat\nI could easily see Charlie fake or do something like that six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight okay\nUh let's go to Washington in Mount Vernon Europe next go ahead Washington\nI noticed that cool now um high Washington ...\n... ... should win Tuesday let me tell you why in this in the state of Massachusetts fifty percent of our independence so that tonight\nI Know you upset with them I'm not going after Iraq but that who he has to appeal to yes to peel coming across as a U.S senator but if you noticed over the weekend the Boston Globe\nIs a big puff piece on Jeff\nAnd they went after it was a war and yes the Boston law and that was\nThe boss said oh and they went after warrant for not being in the state and running around the country lumber to if you notice in the last couple of days who came out and now that she might uh probably will run for president\nHillary Clinton now that in fact ... is that they see the that independent watch group\nFrom Washington DC they filed\nThe ethics charges against not only it was a warrant Kamala Harris ...\nHarris so now you've got to him and they went after and in the way it thinks it keeps the you know keeps going after Warren\nOn doesn't go after the jet and he noticed tonight massive very political state and the media and when those channel five\nReporting that they're very liberal\nBut for whatever reason tonight they didn't go after these yeah they could they gave him some nice questions to come back\nAt ... ... if they notice that Heidi ... he went after he didn't have to he went after an asteroid wait a minute and then their ethics column and the other woman unnecessary I brought it up to\nNow that is that we're every political think they do a channel five for ABC\nNews on that unless they get the green light yet wash and all that and I know that\nWashington that is very perceptive that is very perceptive and thank you for that call look I got to say I got to give head or you know I don't look honestly I used to watch what's that show called the used to watch it all the time at first couple of years when I was in Massachusetts\nI'm at Harding and and Janet ... who I call her Janet who or what is it the fourth quarter to fifth lost on the record on the record that's what it's called ... on the record\nAnd they always ask the silly lightning round kinds of questions what's your favorite color what book are you reading you know he did some of that tonight\nBut they're big lips head Harding is a big lip Janet movies a form and she's a full fledged moon bat and I got to give them both credit especially at Harding on the illegal fundraising he wouldn't let him go\nIf you notice he kept coming back to war and saying no no no no you're not let's drill down here you're not really answering the question did you send out a new legal fundraising letter and did you know it was illegal and that's when you got the uh uh uh I I ...\nI Would I Would like to drill down there and what representative deal said uh the the fundraising while the vote was being taken on the cover and did you did you not to the\nMain [noise]\nLook I don't know if the order has been given that Hillary is going to run and twenty twenty\nAnd you know the godmother does not like any competition\nSo you got into the Clinton line\nAnd all of a sudden now they're going after illegal fundraising for Kamala Harris for Elizabeth Warren basically trying to knock him off twenty twenties saw the clear to you know clear to decks for a Hillary Clinton of another shot at Trump I don't know but what I can just tell you is this tonight\nThat liberal media at least those two moderators did not do oh Elizabeth Warren any favors six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight who do you think one who do you think lost and the mother of all questions\nThe deal do enough to win on Tuesday next week more with your calls\nThat was incredible that that was huge because you know living I born and raised here and it's like it's like ... all the bullshit\n[laughter] ever end and and I miss Warren says it like what's what's going on here but don't lately with Elizabeth\nI'm Sorry I mean they've been told you like that but I mean you remember when she said the F word you know what I just\nI'm like you that's that's live TV that's that's at seven o'clock [laughter]\nEverybody gets you see the S. word then I you know please I think a ... and we're going to say for me were closed it's usually from ten I think to six AM\nYou can actually say words like that and not get penalize but we're pretty close to ... an hour away so don't worry about it but please if you can use crap they just say bull crap or B.

I'm Sorry can you repeat that John\nAh apparently they rented a house right there at the entrance to the Japanese TV just as she did in Springfield where she writes at the two parking lot around that area so that\nThe gas or the spent use it but you write that this house and use that as a base for all these people to come and get signed on union people get off the bus they went right to this house so it was pre planned and got all their hand signs and was standing in front of people and doing whatever they could they were respectful I give them credit\nBut nobody can tell us where they were from nobody can tell us what jobs they had\nA it was the vicious rumor and again it's ... that they weren't even from Massachusetts because none of them had any union identification they just had fluorescent coach thought you could pick that up the walnut\nIncredible I mean even her support is they fail at the buses ... have you noticed that even her support is fake right\nEverything about her as a phony she's such a phony on every level they can find a link to busloads of people genuinely support this woman\nYeah I I was thinking that the U.S about it I you know and after speaking to them in any way to look if she's got a bus in union people to make this look like she's got lost that she's got she's scared\nYes a John I'm telling you is going to be very close a mark my words I think she's going to be shocked on election night and Democrats are going to be shocked how close it's going to be\nI'm telling you this right now bill is going to give her a war she did not see coming because they've ... they've underestimated him there overconfident she's already been looking at twenty twenty and she doesn't realize how he's been crisscrossing blitz thing across the state\nAnd his aunt came back and she was a ghost and she told me she basically told them that yeah that you had cracked the case\nAnd then it turned out that he'd been chasing the wrong guy and I I've always said that was the first time in human history that the ... the ghost have identified his or her wrong killer\nSo I mean there's a lot of BS going on eight for four or five hundred forty to forty two officer mark says the heat of why the rabble any change in the car mentioned last night you\nKnow again I think if anything Whitey would be hard but not me you know why would why db haunting me he tried to kill me why they should have been haunted by all the people he killed a you know be long before their time and for no no reason\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two fellows your next with highway cargo had fellas\nYeah Hi Hi I grew up in a haunted house and me and my sister made a midnight trip to the bathroom one night and there was a ghost in the room that in the bathroom but we had to walk by it and then when I was\nWas it I Know what did you call did you call it a ghost or heat\nIt was a ghost what ... what does it look like it was an old guy yeah did he say anything to you know what no no he ignored of and we ignored him [laughter]\nHow did you ever see him again I\nWell you know I I think I've seen them again outside the door one night but now he was gone quick\nThat's the way ghosts are you know they're yeah they're one minute they're one second they're there and the next second they're gone thanks Felice Jerry year next with our car do you believe in ghost Jerry\nOur we had our first house so we bought\nA category yeah and um\nThere was just when you came in and you came in through the kitchen and she died a people that we bought it from\nA it was her family she was living there by herself and her bed was still there and it was this iron bed so I took the bed out of that ... bedroom voted in the back bedroom and remodeled it ... my daughter was about two years old\nAnd she's glad something at night you know fill in the woodstove you shut down the hallway and you wouldn't know what it was all your door slam and then one night um we heard our daughter talking\nYeah you know and baby talk to somebody in the room and a um it was funny we ran into the couple that had a kind of broke out or is it a lot of spare still allow so I Believe and goes\nNow they hear hear anybody talking back to your daughter\nNo no no no no and I never really saw that\nAnd but then there's somebody something was going on and off the back bedroom door wide open

in Texas Mike what's going on high\nI'm not much Joe Hi Alden they live in a dream my friend talk to me\nWell you know I agree with you did I start off not going to be rude or anything like that they should be worried and the constitution or you know the way it should be worded is not to illegal immigrants it would've been easy to to include the\n... you know but take for instance you know a hypothetical situation that her mother and father traveling on a cruise ship and international water right and they give birth in international waters is that child now a citizen of the world know or is known of it but it doesn't [laughter]\nWell I I Know it sounds leader but that yeah that's the reason it's a hypothetical but uh\nI think it's a great hypothetical and ... and I I don't know the law on this but I'm going to take a guess I'm I'm guessing that I'm right that child would be a citizen of the country it's parents are citizens of\nAnd it's a great question but here's but here's why it's different there is no jurisdiction out there\nYou know you're not you're not a you know in some place that has I mean I guess you could say the voters the jurisdiction but not going to be a citizen of the boat so we know bad\nI mean could you make the case that that the child is is a citizen of where the boats port is maybe\nBut we're talking about actually being in the United states where there is a jurisdiction there are laws there there are mechanisms in place that if you were born here you're a citizen here it's a it's a great question but I think that it's an easy answer I

of mind for me and I know that you've destroyed him\nIn an interview one night to the point where he couldn't even handle it\nUm but he keeps saying stupid stuff I guess to keep them\nOh in the fray but now he says white men are the biggest terrorist threat in the country and there's no travel ban on them sure do you think this guy stupid or or did you just trying to keep themselves I'm a ... noticed and and in the forefront\nDon Lemon is lost his mind it come on in any feeling\nOn encumbered at the same time and I think that's okay because eventually what he's going to do is he still was download see what are you can get away with\nAnd the more crazier the better but he is basically going to say something where CNN it's going to be forced to do something\nAnd I'm not saying I'm going to take them off you're totally right they're gonna end by the collar and sell him and you're going to happen to a real some of this stuff back and you're getting crazy out there he says don't ... yeah it is out there calling other people racist but you know CNN is okay they're they're raised on\nA but you know nobody else can have a ... ... otherwise they're races\nThat's a great point a few women opposing viewpoint on any other network on my network on Fox anywhere\nAre you are racist according to them but they are actively employing people who will say things like white men are the biggest terrorist threat I mean when you said that you are you are actually taking a race of people\nAnd you're denigrating them to the point that it is racism and not only does he get away with it you know in a couple of months he's gonna be drunk on television on on New Year's eve again this is this guy is it's weird\nSure you remember back during this late they one of the things that the Democrats with pedal\nIs that a black males were a threat to white women you know that's what that sounds like it's very ugly as very distasteful and be like somebody today in modern times saying black man or the cause of violence in America you know some sweeping statement like that yeah\nAnd you get in big trouble or taken off the air you said that it used to be taken off the air ...

believe it so I wouldn't say it because of that but if I said something like a black men are the cause of violent crime in America that would be ridiculous thing to say and and my contract actually says because of the the morals clause or bringing a bad light to our our network I Would be gone\nBut but they trust that I Would never say something so stupid Don Lemon says something stupid and he was applauded for it and and it spread around as if it's somehow gospel\nDidn't the president just um pardon Joe Johnson 'em knowing what was it was it Jack johnson who is the boxer from the turn of the century\nOr the other was a it was Jack johnson\nJohnson yeah one of the fire\nRight so he was he was stripped of his title and he was excommunicated from society because he dared date white women that was the problem that's why he was charged with a crime and convicted of crimes so the idea that a hundred years later Don Lemon can say the exact opposite and I only get away with a B B applauded by the left makes me sick\nBut I heard a number ... ... a share of that I think is is showing that that Don lemons and the vast minority subtly this president has a forty percent approval rating with black folks what do you think of that\nYeah well you know people conceive of this nonsense I mean think about it that was certainly the climbers transporting a white woman across state lines or moral or rice you know that for this country came woman and a guy like Don Lemon returns us back to those things and he just flip the switch we're not saying that about black people but now\nCertain black people you notice I didn't say all black or or singing about white people no place in our lexicon for that sort of stuff I doubt that Don Lemon has a morals clause because uh CNN doesn't have any
