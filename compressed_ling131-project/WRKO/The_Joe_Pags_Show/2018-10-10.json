Graham told Fox News a shepherd Smith\nSince then the storm is pushed inland over Florida's panhandle in the eyes currently headed towards the extreme south eastern portion of Alabama\nAnd south western Georgia according to find peanut vines right from the NHCD with maximum sustained winds of one hundred twenty five miles per hour Michael's moving north north east at sixteen miles per hour in an age the said on the forecast track the core Michael move across south eastern Alabama in South western Georgia through this evening the by peanut advisory said\nI go well then the north east and across the southeastern United States do Thursday and then move off the mid Atlantic Coast away from the United states on Thursday night and friday when three hundred and Seventy five thousand people up and down the Gulf Coast were born to evacuate\nAnd hurricanes leading edge that storm surge in the neighborhoods as it approached as Michael near and heavy rains penny rent waves pounded the shoreline and Panama City beach which caused a building under construction to collapse and near my Appalachian coal last storm surge that water pouring ... city neighborhoods and covering roadways\nLogging county sheriff's office shared a photo and Twitter about ... getting rocked in the waves and urged extreme caution to residents warning them not to take any chances during the unforgiving hurricane Michael is upon us it's time to think refuge once you are sheltered stay put Florida governor Rick Scott tweeted Wednesday morning do not try to leave until the storm is past\nMultiple state and federal resources are staged and ready to respond as soon as it is safe\nSo we've got a couple of radio stations in that part of Florida we've got one in Pensacola WPN and uh we we were the that's got the great folks there and also we've got um a WFL laugh I think they say WFL lay on the actual air there but it's WFL F which is in Panama City and I reached out to our ah our fringe on there\nAnd um it have not heard back he he sort of gave an automatic answer one of those auto replies that just basically says recovering in watching the hurricane for getting out of harm's way so that size that Hurricane Maria but keep in mind in this day and age if you're Michael you want to be Maria that's actually okay you can't say no to\nNo but it is Michael so you're saying is Michael unions territory so um we're we're going to keep a close eye on that and of\nCourse we're thinking about everybody in there and that area and yes we're sending thoughts and prayers I'm a I guess we've been saying it's the strongest but I'm a ... is it actually a category five are not\nWell it came really close it made landfall one hundred and fifty five miles per hour and of course you can find is one hundred and fifty seven miles per hour so I took out one night depends on your hand edge it may change\nHas it changed that that number because I always thought it was one fifty five was a category five is one of the ones that the salmon that seems I I don't know I don't know when that by the way it doesn't matter what we call it between one fifty five to one fifty seven is\nNasty and no good and get the hell out of the way that if you think you're going to write something like that out I'm here to tell you don't\nDon't even consider it don't even try so again we're thinking about what's happening there this thing popped out of nowhere um and I guess not out of nowhere if you live in a part of the world you've been keeping an eye on it but normally we see it coming from the coast of Africa and it takes forever like all we can have two weeks and who are wondering where it's coming from but sometimes in the Gulf\nAll of a sudden something will turn up all of a sudden someone someone will get going and now we're looking at a major deal um as far as hurricane Michael is concerned so we'll keep an eye on it so this thing could be pretty brutal for the next twenty four to forty eight hours\nOr at least yeah right now in fact it's heading into Georgia is a category three hurricane salad Simon imagine the damage can the priest in the air\nSo get what you are very close eye on that keep in mind at the bottom of this hour it's gonna be governor Rick Perry before governor or the great state of Texas He knows the energy secretary we talk about about fracking did

Perry Rick how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much where I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so you know taxes but it's a it's what are called temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected with several people on your staff and I I can see their travel\nOn Facebook and on Twitter and so on you or your or a globe trotting now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa there'll be over in Europe the view over to Asia and they're back home base it on your back over Indonesia where did you know that that was gonna tell all of us\nAre not necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revelation runners off that occurred in the United states\nIt makes sense in hindsight it would be in all those markets because it's a you know we're now selling American a liquefied natural gas in the thirty different countries on five ... and uh there there's more to be done so I'm being there\nUh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being a regulator making sure that we're\nA you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and as\nA as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know a salesman for American energy whether it's a liquefied natural gas or the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuel whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world\nAnd the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIt's the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry\nAnd watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talked in the Lebanese that are that the president has in and he's putting it on me you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining he's no good he's putting terms is going to ruin trade and in no time flat\nYou stepped up and said we're making the deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade him in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas now are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing that we make this happen can we make a part of the deal how does that go down\nThere he he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet for the cause the secretary of treasury my notion and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross day all have a\nA a role to play in that and and uh so I absolutely there's a there's a good a correspondent back and forth a and a ... everybody's on the same team\nI Want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons that I you know ... and that is what it is right ah but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] that's true but it's true\nAnd and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator a person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen\nIf I trade you and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine\nUh and and that's exactly what he's doing with\nThese trade deals where he comes with some really hard stuff I mean you think about it with you and then a young and came back in here uh after they laid out some really tough uh a sanction or not sanctions but tariffs at retro\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese\n... again you know hedge blew up when they announced the tariffs are originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose\nA they know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese don't lose a trade war with us so if\nI were the biggest customers they don't want to screw with us that would be dumb [laughter]\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be right an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property rights of any good neighbor\nYeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you were in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming onto the great guidance of of great to have it now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before\nYou can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nAnd then you'll have it to save forever and to share with your family for good sounds amazing doesn't it it is and you get a great deal because you listen to my program legacy boxes off
