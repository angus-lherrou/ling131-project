I'm all about solution\nIt's about the media if I Would if I were to\nStep federal product that ... that said it had been a coconut oil and it didn't have coconut oil I'd be guilty of consumer fraud the media has a right to say anything they want to say but I don't believe they have the right to say it under the label of news if they want to pedal it and that and in journalism I think they have the right to say anything they want\nBut news implies truth so I Believe by statute they should be required to either tell the truth or a reliable and uh\nAnd and uh or otherwise pedal what they had the pedal under opinion journalism\n... it's really interesting to go and let me let me say this\nThe freedom of the press as expressed in the first amendment restricting the government from prosecuting of persecuting the press you know for going in covering the affairs of the state or the affairs local government whatever I Believe in it I made my living at it for a long time\nIt it basically says the government can't tell you know you can't cover this the government can't tell you know you have no right to give us information and then to smell it to other people\nI don't know that you're acting like the quote unquote press when you're making crop up where you have somebody sitting on your on your television networks saying this government is radicalized more people than ISIS you don't have the right\nYou know that's not a free press that's gathering information that people otherwise couldn't get that is saying the president is not at the hospital ... when he was\nOr you know ignoring vital facts like this bad guy on Saturday hates Donald Trump didn't vote for Donald Trump hates that Donald Trump visually Jews and as it was an industry that's just not being recorded oh I think they're blurring the lines as as far as what is and what isn't\nCovered in the first amendment when it comes to the press\nI really do believe that no I'm not here to see you prosecute burst unity members of the press\nI'm just saying that if if the president wants to respond to your lives that you're that you're presenting as news he's allowed here's the first amendment as well as you have and I have every right to go on my radio show or on my TV show and say the same thing I don't like that you lied about visiting here's my proof\nYou're the press wants to two ways they want it first of all we can covered events they didn't do anything and secondly we can tell you that you're not allowed to come and do what we said did which has just isn't true uh we we have no

Seventy year old man and the fifty five year old officer we're in critical condition a Pittsburgh public safety director window historic to the attack at tree of life was one of the worst crime scenes he never seen\nSo it's sick I mean nobody who's a a good person and most of us are the vast majority of us are very good people nobody watch this nobody hopes that this happens I'm ... and instead of coming over to ... any solutions from anybody\nNot since Parkland not since Columbine you were to go back even farther and we were further it doesn't make any sense why there's always this political slant there should be no politics involved would innocent people are going down driven over ... ...\nSo what he's doing bad things to people we as a society should come together and say here's what we have to do\nAnd you see I mean Twitter is just a microcosm but you see on on\nSocial media or it's not too soon to talk about gun control not too soon to talk about what reasonable a logical gun laws and then when you ask them a very simple question what exactly is the gun law\nThat you want to put in place that would have prevented the bad guy from doing bad things to good people\nAnd you never get a good answer because there is no good answer the the the answer is\nWe must protect ourselves at the point where the bad people think they can get away with it\nSays in politics this is lodging commonsense\nWhat's going to deter bad guys from going to a soft target you'll notice he didn't show up at you know a an army base you notice he didn't show up at a police station he showed up at a synagogue where\nYou would expect nobody's carrying guns they're worried about worship and worried about you know praying to God and having together you know togetherness with their community\nIt happened at the movie theater in Aurora it happens at every school that people go to it happens at at it happened in Sutherland Springs with the church there I mean that's the fact\nSo what solutions had been offered up by anybody well the president says we need armed security they should have been um security there and he's been lambasted of how dare you say that well because armed security may have stopped this guy from killing anybody\nNo it's not the the synagogues fold clearly and I'm not suggesting that it is\nBut at some point knowing that this has happens knowing that there is a even a remote possibility that it can happen it's time to say we must do something to protect to protect the innocence and what do you do well who stopped him\nThe police stopped him\nThat the numbers are what Carrie killed eleven for police officers injured yes six people total intern\nSo\nHow many more people were there do we know I don't know how many more ... died had the police not shown up and had a shootout with this guy the guy was injured by police I kinda wish they'd have killed him but he was injured by police and now the prosecutors will seek the death penalty on this piece of garbage good there should be a death penalty for a piece of garbage like this but having said all of that\n\nThe good guys with guns stopped the bad guy with a gun or several guns they stopped him it was the good guys they did it and we want to pretend like that isn't that is somehow a deterrent for people who know that there is a good guy with a gun there\nThat's why there should be marshals in churches are schools there should be marshals that as a synagogue or at the mall of course there should be an air marshals on planes ever since nine eleven we we had some before\nBut never really got them and it's a deterrent it's smart its hedging your your bets you know most police officers never even draw their guns\nOn the job well I wouldn't say that maybe they draw the gun but most don't ever shoot their firearm well on the job and it's good so the odds are they never will but when you have to it's been good you got it it doesn't make any sense to look at it from any other angle\nAnd I'm so sick and tired of you had some idiot on CNN who actually said the president has radicalized more people than ISIS she had to come back in the next segment on CNN and apologize for being so stupid\nI Want to apologize that wasn't factual I set it because I'm frustrated and I have a reason to be frustrated she attacked him store\nBut to say that and to put it out there and shut the TV off after the commercial break you know who who didn't hear her correct it it's just a matter of saying whatever you think will play right now\nAnd I'm not here to play I'm here to tell you we have to be smart about protecting ourselves do I want a society where we can keep our front doors unlocked yes do I want a society where you can keep the car running while you're at the convenience store to keep it you know warm in the winter recall in the summer Yup I want that\nBut the fact is if you leave your front door unlocked you you're inviting people if you leave your car running while you run in the store you're inviting people to do bad things it's still on the bad guy bad guy still shouldn't be a bad thing doesn't make you more alive doesn't major card you less stolen\nYour should you be able to carry money or get on your front car seat yeah and nobody should mess with it if it's not bears but chances are you're inviting somebody to do it twice when I go anywhere that I Do I take my expensive writer attacked her and I take it off the windshield\nAnd I put it somewhere where people can see it now would it be the bad guys fault if he stole it yes\nBut I just wanted to take an extra step of precaution to make sure he doesn't know what's in there is no reason to bother my car\nI don't like living like that but we do and when you say things like you know there should be armed security at churches synagogues mosques fill in the blank and people's reaction is I don't want to live like that what does a martial law what are we going to buy some martial law it's being smart\nThe bad guys are striking go through any number of these shootings that have happened the bad guys were striking where they know there's the path of least resistance that's what's happening I mourn for these people in Pittsburgh\nAnd to blame the president is sick on not sitting here blaming Brock Obama who is a serious gun control guy I'm not blaming him for this\nI could but I'm not so blaming President Trump makes no sense and by the way this guy was a Trump hater\nThat hasn't really come to fruition my I come to the for the to the fore very much in the news media this guy complained about Trump did not vote for Trump\nWould never go near a make America great again hat yeah he's\nBeing somehow reporter does some white supremacist guy who who was radicalized by Trump's language it's dumb it's irresponsible and it solves nothing it's like David hogging Emma Gonzalez and Cameron casts get all these people in in Parkland, Florida\nThey haven't solved anything they've done nothing since that shooting they've done nothing but but rallied people to go and vote a certain way they've done nothing to try to fix it they've done nothing to try to solve the problem they have a serious amount of influence now and they probably could do something if they want to do they're not\nSo let's stop the garbage about this person's fault that the person's follows the bad guy

goes to work right mhm and say yeah I Know is the president\nTrump pretty much says she's the reason why he want mhm what is what is he doing\nI don't know ... ... what if what if\nBarrio everyday good an op ed in like the local newspaper complaining about your news coverage\n[noise] and then we have some problems some really your mom's winter yeah\nYeah I mean why police show\nAnd just don't I don't know how to make sense between the two give me the story from hill\nA from a White House counselor Kellyanne Conway has been encouraged what another Twitter user described as a pile on over President Trump's attacks on the media\nHighway road George Conway egging on criticism of Trump's Monday tweet calling the media to true enemy of the people come on Monday blame the media for great anger in our country and a tweet falling a week of politically charged deadly violence and treat referred to\nFake news media and the true enemy and the people\nAnd that kind of life was one of Trump's top aides ... the president on Twitter I'm somebody criticizing him through a retreat in critical story comes to Monday three has garnered significant criticism particularly as it comes out the series of pipe bombs are now the prominent Democrats and CNN and after a shooting that might eleven that any Pittsburgh synagogue\nAnd condemned the mail bombs and shooting ... percent it on that has been getting calls to tone down his rhetoric\nI mean what does what does he do in\nMy mind it to be very odd and again look I don't know him I Know Kelly and I've known him for a long time but I don't know him I mean in ... in my aren't like personal friends were like hanging out and I know her professionally and I have for a long time since the CNN days\nAnd I just don't understand why I mean look he couldn't believe that of course he can he's American he can he can say that to his friends and in a circle and and you can certainly do what he's doing now he's allowed to but it does raise questions why would you want to and\nI don't think that it's an overstatement saying that either they're misleading on purpose the very smart people that are saying that he's just out of ... stop attacking the fake news media\nOr they're really really dumb that'll be killing and Conaway says it's dumb and again I don't know and but I have to imagine it's a pretty smart guy so is he purposely misleading people because there is no\nAttack on everybody in the media there is no attack on the news media\nAge the fake news media those that are making it up as they go and purposely misleading there's nothing wrong with the president going after them and saying stop it let's come together as Americans it's very strange that this guy did then I went and checked out his Twitter account and he's re tweeting all sorts of people complaining that the president\nI don't get it it would be a it'd be difficult honey I'm homemade let's talk about anything\nThat I go to great you know what I mean what are you saying I don't know it doesn't sound very happy\nIt's going to I I don't know it's a it eight nine four one pegs editing nine four one seven two four seven let's talk

away it was about ... or the second limit needs to go away because you don't need\nMore than two bullets to shoot it here in San about that it's about protecting our freedoms and liberties and the

up uh ten or Fifteen different issues on the candidate\nWell we know every single position so we're not trying to stay\nOr ... or opposing what we're trying to say that you care about light or marriage or religious liberty or the Supreme Court\nKavanaugh was a big issue this year no need to know where the center stand on it so we make these available Thirteen key Senate races we can talk about that in a second\nBut it you're exactly right Joe it is fraught it is a copyright violation it's actually a violation of criminal violation of the election now if it's tied to we don't know yet we're in the process of investigating yet but if it's tied to the ... campaign at an FCC violation as well well\nIt is or John graves his group is vision America dot org division America dot org I'm going to go ahead named to stage it's Texas Florida Montana Indiana of Missouri West Virginia Arizona Michigan Wisconsin Nevada Tennessee and North Dakota has happened in every one of those states reduced hearing about in Texas\nYou know we don't know we know for sure it's happened in several different city in Texas but today I got another a contact I just got out of a a group that I'm In another airport I talked to pastors all over the country or that will get engaged in there so we don't know how widespread it is we've got a over a million that these are going out to Florida\nFor example that are in paper that are going to church is all over the place so a in a in a lot every one of those states you just mentioned Thirteen fourteen states or in the margin of error or within just a matter of either the the the races up or down just by single digits\nYou know they're very very close and that's why they did it here but let me ask you this I mean how lazy why did they just come out with their own counter I'm black and white actually put the name of your organization on it because when people if they click on a bigger vision America dot org they're going to find the real positions aren't they\nWell they are and that's what we tell people that do go vision America dot org and you can enter into if if you're on Facebook you enter into the butanol faced with ... click your state and you'll ... you'll get a free voter got what that is going on\nBut what you touched on is the reason they didn't do their own voter guy is they're trying to deceive people they didn't just do it they carried it inside the church is they literally took me a packet and co mingled on what the real voter got inside churches were they were handing them out\nAnd then left in the way we found out about it is a husband and wife went out of one of the churches and different door she went to get the kids he went to get the car that get out to the car and they got different voter guys they looked at it might wait a minute they came back and talk to a pastor he called us we started alerting places and we found\nPeople were very\nI don't I don't want to say too much on air right now 'cause they on their best to gay short on but they literally would go from city to city and change clothes sane people change clothes when they went from one location to another location to another location\nBut yeah and it's so morally wrong I mean it's wrong when in any way and I think that you have reached the ending unfortunately the lectures one week you know a way that or I don't know if you look at all this done in the courts by then probably not we know how the court system works but what I suppose it like this I'm Glad that we're doing it\nBut I mean just to reiterate they went into churches worshipping to their God they're lord and there was ... much better information will guide and they were lying knowingly\nPeople who were there for you know for the for the good of their family their future their faith it's weird\nThat's right yeah they they not only that went into the house of guy to deceive the people that guy and they didn't just put their information if you if you want to support those positions of\nOf you know I'm a pro abortion and and and pro gay marriage and and you don't load cameo yeah you're allowed to do that you have free speech but to come inside someone else's facility and attempt to that these people\nAre using it it it breaks all kinds of laws which which really in some ways exposes what there was so so really in some way that works to our benefit because more and more people are finding out about this and and whereas a lot of people there's a lot of a voter apathy Seventy six percent of the people in a mentor\nDo not normally vote and one of my big passion is the reason we have some of the problems we have in this country is because three out of four people in the near term are both in the general election so if people will just go on our website you already decided that vision America dot org they can put the forward slash duck boat and it will take them straight in there and if you're one of those states that matter\nA it is huge in this election cycle because they're going to a point there is a hundred and fifty judges steal that Kavanaugh on hearing was here for people that was a hundred and fifty judicial appointments waiting to be decided that whoever takes control that than it is going to decide lifetime appointments for those people\nDo them in your John graves use flying around he's actually at an airport right now I have the time vision America dot org vision America\nDot org I mean really I just want to sort of back and what you just said it really does show how bad their positions are or how bad their messaging use if they have to lie to people by taking your idea I'm guessing you or somebody in your office came up with a ... designed the Web is yours\nI'm ... and and you're probably right 'cause it's not political\nPeople don't automatically or go to vision America dot org they're going to read what it says\nA lot of them are going to believe it\nCan you imagine if that event husband and wife hadn't noticed it and you might not be hearing about it yet we might not be able to expose these people\nAnd we have no idea that thousands or hundreds or how many different states or how many different churches this has happened in like I said I got another call today\nA so we may not know until well after the election but it just goes to show the links which they'll go to save and distort the truth and\nAnd really all we're trying to they were not make an endorsement or post on were given the information and most of the people who believe in these biblical issues you know if they get educated they tend to get involved and I can tell you how many pastors I've talked to even in this race that we're talking about in Texas\nOnce they find out oh wait a minute I I kinda like something I heard about a worker he kind of sound is moot when he's talking you know but he is good for with abortion all the way up until birth\nAnd it changes their opinions why don't we just cite the

was a lot going on in this fourteenth amendment stuff I've gotten kinda got started here because this thing it completely as people riled up they're excited on one side they're scared on the other side the fourteenth amendment seems to say what it says another gets poorly written\nAnd probably should be rewritten but let me start here because your phone away more of an expert on this kind of stuff that I'll ever be\nA does the president have the right via executive the auto or via\nSome sort of an executive order to make a change or halted amendment\nI\nDon't know and then that the complicated legal question what I what I can tell you the number one\nI agree with the president that the right policy and birthright citizenship very long but my position that the birthright citizenship is a policy that doesn't make any sense that the debt it\nRewards illegal immigration most of the countries on earth do good at first that isn't ship all people who were there it legally right and one of the things birthright citizenship causes\nIs is is a phenomenon known as birth tourism where women who are eight nine ...\nI'm pregnant get on a plane come to America just to have a child here to have that child uh granted US citizenship that doesn't make any sense we should have a legal system\nThat that that follows the law and we should be bringing people to this country who are going to generate jobs and generate economic productivity and and so I think is a policy matter ending birthright\nCitizenship it is it's common sense it's the right thing to do that ... what you ask your go ahead\nWhat you asked is it is the legal question the legal question of\nHow to do it there is a significant dispute among legal scholars there are some legal scholars\nWho argue the only way to end birthright citizenship is through a constitutional amendment do other legal scholars have argued that that Congress could do threat so through statute that whether the president can do so through an executive order I I I had not seen the legal analysis and the argument that his lawyers are putting forward I Want to wait and\nReview those legal arguments that assessment on the merits I had not seen an argument put forth\nPreviously that can be done on executive order but my view whatever means as years it will surely be challenging the courts and ultimately the dispute about whether it has to be a constitutional amendment are not\nWill be litigated may well make it all the way to the U.S Supreme Court regardless of the main the right policy is an birthright citizenship\nHis website is Ted Cruz dot org Ted Cruz dot org to get there and help him in the home stretch you've got to be watching a week from today just one last thing on this you and I both read the federalist papers we understand that you tend to the law was to ensure that former slaves were not denied their citizenship which is what the Democrats wanted to do the Republicans had to step\nUp and make sure that these folks were fully\nI'm a franchise in franchise citizens of the United states of America was never supposed to be for those coming across the border in fact they talked about frightening dignitaries and their children not getting birthright citizenship because the worst subject\nTo the jurisdiction of a different country a different nations state these children are being born in the second they're born they are subject to or jurisdiction our laws or regulations we must change\nHow badly written this was I think there was an assumption by the forefathers and I wonder if you agree that we would all of course we wouldn't just give citizenship anybody who was born here but the way it's written in plain English suggest that they are\nWell as as I said it is an open legal question
