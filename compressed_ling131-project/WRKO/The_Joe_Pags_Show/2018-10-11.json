you never really get an answer it would be the only thing is they sort of ratcheted up like Eric Holder like Hillary Clinton ratcheted up to being what's not be civilized about this let's either kick them or just be uncivilized you're never really good a good answer other than this is just\nTrying to keep the black man to be old person I'm Hispanic young person away from the polls were trying to somehow by we are mean evil white men like me I guess we're trying to make it so hard for the people named to to go and vote that we're trying to actually exclude them or disenfranchised them\nNo care you know people of all races up the city's backgrounds and so on so to ... percent so does everybody was sitting and watching right now\nHave you ever met a person who didn't have a state issued id

involved in law with law enforcement for a long time\nI have seen people who are driving without an ID I have seen people who have a suspended license so they have a a revolt license or a fill in the blank they've got\nBecause it's it's just been going to re vote that means that you can use it\nTo drive but you could still use it to identify yourself or you certainly still use it to go in and vote\nSo I don't understand the argument and I've always I've always push back this way if you're arguing that black people Hispanic people older young can't procure a free government issued id\nI reject that 'cause I don't agree with you you're saying that black people Hispanics young and old or too stupid to figure out how to go and get a state issued id especially one for free I disagree I don't think they're stupid at all in fact I think they're just as smart as white men are why [noise]\nI Know right why do you you're sitting here saying that I think everybody's equal and they can be

something that went over there than there are just I Can't believe you're doing more songs of all the songs and ... why is he talking about the issue is only sing the song a man I Know it's a long story\nShort as I always always\nHave actually thought that people no matter their color they're raised their background their ethnicity their gender their sexual orientation have the same ability in this country\nTo go and get a photo ID I Know that makes me a crazy person but I really have always thought that well now there's an issue at the same to the lawsuits happened in Texas over and over and over again recently finally records set of course they're going to have a photo ID law\nAnd North Carolina I'm not sure if they so that one yet but because Texas in North Carolina we're both southern states they both were under the this'll be voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five and they were unable to add these things whereas Indiana was able to edit and never got any scrutiny well North Dakota has been challenged I Believe by an American Indian tribe or several\nAbout its voter id law Cary what happened in that in that story\nFrom the ... the Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to toss out and appeals court order now allows North Dakota to enforce it voter id requirement during the two thousand Eighteen elections\nTheir class to toss out the order came from a group of Native American residents who are challenging a new state law that requires the urge to present identification that includes a current residential street address the challengers argue the new rule disenfranchise is a disproportionate share of the population like as many Native American voters live on reservations without standard addresses\nThe district court in green and temporarily blocked in North Dakota secretary of state and forcing the new requirements during the primary elections that the eighth U.S Circuit court of appeals block that court order last month\nThe challenges asked the Supreme Court in an urgent requests admitted justice Neil Gorsuch to toss out the eighth circuit stay are getting it has left thousands of Native American donors unable to cast ballots for the court denied the request without explanation\nThe Gore team member Brett Kavanaugh did not take part in the decision Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who filed a dissenting opinion which justice Elena Kagan joined\nGinsberg said she would have granted the challenges request she's at last minute court orders affecting elections especially conflicting orders can result in voter confusion and keep people from turning out to the polls the risk of the confusion appears in the air here because the injunction against requiring residential address identification was enforce\nDuring the primary election then because the secretary of state's website announce for months the id requirements as they existed under that injunction Ginsberg said reasonable motors and they will assume IDs allowing them to know their primary election would remain valid in the general election\nI mean I I don't I just don't understand\nI mean there are groups of people actually representing and ethnicity or race of people or\nTribe for lack of a better term and they actually are saying we don't know how to get IDs\nReally got plenty of\nNative American Indians listening to this program and watching the program\nYou guys don't advocate IDs and I get\nThe argument 'cause again I Try to always be fair and Terry ... from what I understand where you just read the argument as well because the lives of reservations ... address right\nWell I have an idea and make one\nYet the reservations are governed by the people who live there you know when I went in and help build the soaring eagle casino in Mount pleasant ah Michigan oh which by the way is run by the second uh um ... Indian tribe not the second oh triple a Native American tribes\nWhen I went and helped build that I knew that I was under the\nControl of the laws of that reservation\nI was on their land you told me they can't come up with some addresses really\nBut as usual some special interest group and probably just a small minority of the people claiming to represent all of the American Indians there they're saying well it's not fair to us because there's no you change the entire system I would I Do get some damn street addresses\n\nGet some seriously or everybody have the same street address one reservations right whatever you want to say it is and go and get your as a state issued id and then go vote small man this this isn't like Gary says brain surgery\nIt seems like a pretty simple solution actually ... actually govern themselves okay we would like to take part in the voting process go get an address\nYou know what I mean if you're totally male ... right really you can't get a FedEx delivery to the reservation in on a a a mirror the box is ... just goes to some dude I don't I don't know where to but there's there's no dresses pneumonia laugh at\nIt is a editor eight nine four one packs Joe ... dot com your thoughts on that we come back we'll be Joe Petro stay here\n[noise] [noise]\nThey think that you had yeah Mm\nItaly you R K O the voice of Boston\n\nThere is nobody on the planet like use so why would you buy a generic mattress built for everyone else you'll asleep built this lead quiz\nThat takes two minutes to complete and they use the answers to match your body type and sleep references to the perfect mattress whether you're aside sleeper hot sleeper like a plush or for bad with helix there's no more gassing or confusion\nJust go to helix sleep dot com slash bags\nTakes their two minutes sleep quiz they're going to match you into a mattress that will give you the best sleeve of your life your looks good even split the mattress down the middle providing individuals support needs and feel preferences for each side they have a ten year Warren G and you get to try it out for a hundred nights\nHurricane Michael barrels into the Florida Panhandle as a category for storm governor Nathan Deal we are not accustomed to the magnitude of the hurricane such as this massive\nSell off underway on Wall street ... hundreds of gas customers knocked off line by national grid should be back in business in ... new\nStress and whether I'm ... was a nice wash never stops\nListening on my heart radio [noise]\nDirect from Las Vegas\nA lot of the five or\nMore the dean leaves the new hits the trickle show Saturday October twenty and settling auditory\nAntony captures the charm and style of dean Martin like no one else can get your tickets now for dean live Lynn auditorium dot com\nHey it's Jeff corner experience is everything that's why if you're in need of a new kitchen or bathroom you have to go see the experienced professionals at the kitchen center a Framingham\nThey'd been designing magnificent kitchens in ... since Nineteen sixty seven the kitchen center Framingham uses designers with various accreditation actually listen to what you want\nMy friends the show Rome is breathtaking I Know I've been there see hundreds of cabinet door samples over five hundred ward and finished samples\nYou weren't designed possibilities are endless\nThere even recognized in the industry for their find furniture finish\nLimited lifetime warranties whether it's designing cabinet tree or looking for removing replace array full designed built project kitchen center a Framingham will exceed your expectations visit them it magnificent kitchens dot com today that's magnificent kitchens dot com kitchen center a Framingham\nWhere experience matters\nImagine if you could contribute much more to your four one K.

I mean he was ... feet or in my opinion but what are your thoughts on what went down to those three and a half four weeks\nWhere it was a continuation of what Democrats have done in terms of turning these confirmation hearings and just a total total partisan\nWe're trying to start with Robert Bork we got a verb working for a map you know split from Ed Kennedy and others and then of course Clarence Thomas and this just a continuation of that uh you know this is a blood sport for Democrats and I think probably the best word to describe this was a used by was Graham it just simply despicable don't do one thing that really sticks out my mind\nIn the testimony professor for it she said that other than the incident itself has been the worst two weeks of her life well\nI think about it as that wasn't those two worst two weeks or caused by Republicans we treated her with great humanity and respect that was brought to her by her Democrat a handlers yeah her attorneys who apparently didn't make her where the fact that she could have stayed right there in California and\nChuck Grassley would have sent investigators out there to take your testimony on California privately we would have held her name in confidence right we would've born or you're required to remain anonymous that was Democrat operatives did that so the American people really need to understand that not only do they try and destroy\nA really good man and his family Brett Kavanaugh they did great harm to their own star witness they couldn't care less about her ... and all this a concern but when it came right down to it they used and abused her it was really ugly\nWell it is true and we do that Dianne Feinstein the ranking member um had this role most two months this letter and in the letter Dr port says I don't want to be out there don't want to testify don't want to be known I Want to stay anonymous this was private but I thought that you should know something that I remember for I think I remember from thirty some odd years ago\nIt did get leaked but but what about dying and Feinstein not doing anything with it for a month and a half do you think that she thought\nThey would be able to defeat him on the merits but she wouldn't needed or do you think that she didn't figured it was real but why why hold your office would have received that wrong\nDid you have done with the letter well the way it normally would have been handled is I Would have gone to my either ranking member of eyes rank member to my chairman instead we got this information the person wants to remain anonymous we need to honor that request\nHow do we proceed forward me can we have the FBI again the the reason we can't reveal anything the FBI Files that that's Ron intelligence\nAnd it's just not fair to people these are unproven allegations so you would have gone probably the FBI they could have investigated that they could have you know start making increase or find if there's any cooperation to see that was something we should have pursued my gas and again I maybe shouldn't even do this my guess is Dianne Feinstein saw that and\nRealized there wasn't much in their you know but somehow somebody\nRealize this was just too good not to use against Brett Kavanaugh and they're in their quest to destroy him\nIt's Senator Ron Johnson Republican the great state of Wisconsin once that he is out there instead of the Feinstein teams saying let's get you some help and let's get a psychiatry psychologist to talk you through this figure out what happened she instead says here's a far left wing resist lawyer and this lady Deborah cats go and talk to her I mean I I don't think that's the right move either were you on that\nNo I mean let's face it the her attorneys wanted a show trial you know they wanted to make a spectacle of her\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh and that's what they got they they they they weren't really representing her interest as far as as far as she said what our interests were she wanted to remain anonymous she didn't want her life publicly exposed to sway but that's what her attorneys did to her\nYeah it's a center on John seriously right last question on Kavanaugh notable onto the on affordable healthcare act and and what you guys are doing a very positive way for the American people are but one last question he's now on the court and the left the screaming and yelling give us back the house will impeach him\nI mean again it's ridiculous and I'm not really sure why any voter even somebody who lean left would say well yeah I'm going to vote for impeachment for no reason um what do you make of that that sort of their Montreal we're not going to kick them off the court because we're so unhappy that he's on the court\nWell was there an angry mob and they they've been\nThey've had this primal screams since the day after the election when the wrong person according to them one you\nKnow I've never seen his like this job you know in my lifetime there's always some measure of honey room there's some\nYou know best wishes to any president who's taking on enormous task right hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous

to left right politics doctor how are you\nI Am very excited for the special reason but I'm On a book so\nYeah it's awesome why we've fight and it'd be the subtitle is defeating America's enemies with no apologies book just came out this week came out yesterday can go get it over all the usual places\nAnd it looks like an unbelievable read like all of your books are and what's interesting is in the forward that I got a it appeared as though you were talking about modern day politics and I'm guessing this is why it's such an appropriate book for now but you're not you're actually talking about the Cold War era right\nWell I I talk about the modern day threat to America or I Will do everything you need to know about China Russia ice is that what was going to do about them\nBut yes I have these historic in yet about great American heroes back to the Barbary all throughout the years ago or the Vietnam War Second World war but the law while it's from the Cold War and it's about a man called wicked chambers who was\nStuff that Kavanaugh before justice Kavanaugh was either or\nBetter so intriguing to reach Dr Sebastian Gorka the name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies which out now going get it um you know as you and I have talked about many times I'm not very smart\nSo I didn't know who would occur achievers was and I'm I'm intrigued to read about him in your book can you give a sort of a a a a quick overview of who this guy was and why should know him\nYeah after them at the same as wrote an incredible book called witness\nAnd he was the hero of the Cold War he started out about a modest background\nA working class family very eligible guy in college the night including he decides to become a coconut ... the the injustice around him or economic ... the man a lot of becoming a communist\nThey become an agent of the Soviet Union while you become\nCalled the with the messenger between the crab led a between the agents of the Soviet Union here in uh\nAnd he does that for several is until style and find something called the model of ribbon truck packed you actually get goes into a deal with Hitler to calm about Europe during World War two right that when it's on wakes up\nHe sees the light and he decides I'm no longer communist this is an evil ideology goes underground with his family goes into hiding but\nThen fine Jesus\nBecomes a Christian and after the war\nHe realizes that he knows where all the Soviet agents are the U.S that it's ... yeah and he says I to do the right thing I Need one cup of these ... that that I was working with it goes to the FBI FBI is an interest that\nHe goes to the White House to truly been especially not interested and finally Nineteen forty eight it gives the first ever televised\nA congressional testimony as a congressional stuff that you may have heard of Richard Nixon no guys yet\nReally um you know a stimulated get motivated by this testimony and he says\nI Know where the bad guys on one of them is former presidential adviser former State Department official shots you know the left a darling of the media called out ... yes right and he goes on record for the truth is that this man is a communist and he's a spy the laugh\nDecides to destroy him\nThey publicly accused him of being an alcoholic of being a closet homosexual they say that this man is responsible for the death of his own brother and all of it is and I saw off to lie but chambers never give us than he never surrenders and eventually long enough that he that\nWe have the ... the trip the Soviet signals intelligence intercept that prove that yes lo and behold out it was a Soviet agent at the top about government so if you're surprised\nAt what the Democrats did the justice Kavanaugh over the last month don't be they didn't they done it before and not just Clarence Thomas they did it back in Nineteen forty eight with this great American hero Whittaker Chambers\nThat is the ... voice of Dr Sebastian Gorka why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies that's an unbelievable story because I ... and again I'm you and I talk about it all the time and you know they're not as smart as you um but but I Know a little less reactive\nSo today the state's highest court the ashtray seat vacated thousands of drug convictions based on drug tests collect conducted at a state crime\nLab in Amherst in a sweeping ruling the condemn misconduct by a rogue states chemist in two former prosecutors\n... ordered the dismissal of every case every case that involved methamphetamine drug evidence during the nine years the former state chemists on your ... worked at the amorous lab in every case the analyzed at the lab for two thousand nine until her arrest the outside the courthouse where she was smoking crack\nIn January twenty Thirteen\nOr in April prosecutors across Massachusetts agree to dismiss all cases ... analyzed herself about eleven thousand and all but said it was unnecessary to make it any more\nNow the reason I wanted to bring this up is because uh should be an issue in the race for attorney general because the two prosecutors who were uh excoriated were uh basically total misconduct committing a fraught upon the court has a spear court judge ruled last year\nThey worked for ... the incumbent attorney general uh and uh and and the ... I noticed I I read the the decision very hardly at sixty pages but\nThe thing that really stuck out was that the Supreme judicial court the kind of covered for um\nFor for um ...\nUm I did\nThe misconduct by the office of the attorney general was limited to foster and ... these are the two assistant attorney general is both of whom by the way are making over a hundred thousand dollars a year now in a different state jobs so they're saying that it was the was the conduct was limited to these two people\nSo joining us now on the line is the Republican candidate for a attorney general of the commonwealth of Massachusetts Jay McMahon or Jay do you think do you think Mara Healy a should or should take some of the responsibility for the uh for the fraud upon the court that was a committed by two of her underlings\nYou're there Jay\nThank you for having me on and everyone in New England or how it goes like this\nEverybody knew this was a very serious\nCase yes very serious matter it had to be in on this jihad didn't know it it is incredible that say they got a huge problem and the state drug lab she doesn't know about it\nI mean they're getting him at some defense attorneys all over the place and and and even a district attorney said\nI'll watch what's going on tell us what we need to know\nTell us tell us how we can um uh what are we supposed to respond to this on discovery that was the main issue\nSo why would they ah I I mean this is a rhetorical question but I'll let you tread why would the uh the ashtray seek cover up for more helium and uh you know ... ... excuse the the misconduct in her office\n[noise] well I'll tell you what the only thing I can think of the reason that they would do that is that when a judge carry at is Iran's initially\nUm although he had a lot to say about the operations of the office a Mari Bailey probably did not testify and the other the other uh no one no one asked\nHow far up this go they just knew that it was cast Mary at foster or handling does ... but the point is these people\nDid not cast Merrick and foster they didn't have the authority to speak on behalf of the journey general's office Molly Haley yet but they didn't ask for a yearly how what she was doing in that off but I got to tell you this\nThis is what most egregious because the judge was correct and the court is correct when they said it's a rod upon the court right when a when a prosecutor is asked for discovery information and they said they don't have\nThey not only saying it's a defense attorney but they are also saying it to the court so when they said we don't have any more information and they do\nIt justice and that's why the U.S Jaycee said all of these cases have to go\nYeah you you should ... will send out the column I wrote about this the the decision ran a over a hundred pages long I wrote a double column on it\nBut these the the uh the findings by this judge carry a and last year I mean there were amazing one of the state cops who was investigating it went and said all these are all these ... or perks or you know really serious opioids had disappeared and we need to do an investigation and one of these assistant attorney general is employed by ... he said\nWe really want to make it that tough on ourselves or worse to that effect I mean people are going\nTo run on the on the evidence that doesn't exist and they're saying she loves to do well why are we making it too tough on ourselves this is a this is bad bad storm\nJay this this is the way I've been telling everybody on the trail\nOn the campaign trail this is the problem when you have if you don't have a law enforcement person you got a political activist was only interested in covering up tracks and not coming off but just it just doesn't it now this result that\nYes Jaycee is given\nAre going to raise this debate Jay are you going to raise ... debate when's the next debate\nWhat the next debate is the twenty fourth the twenty fourth ... this month and the people who are sitting at the wall and they're going to happen in this story that's going to be a very interesting debate because they're the moderators\nWell Jay ... weren't as working people go

ah the bottom line is there may be a mental issue there having said that what specifically did he said today with what you disagree\n[noise]\n[noise] I think this way if you did say it I mean I yeah he did speak about one jobs\nYeah and he played ... they don't feel that Trump is bringing jobs back years and it's that's debatable but I'm not going to go\nOn and it's really it's really not
