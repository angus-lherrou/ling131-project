Seventeen oh\nAlready had two or three jobs I was just that was our living by years of my ... my dad and I could not get along so I just had to get out and we actually were the religion of got better\nThe farther always email [laughter] right now\nThat made sense I was the one boy had three sisters and still do\nAnd um you know there was always some sort of an issue and and I don't know what you saw it as competition or you hit it I was younger ... was we fixed it later on in life I'm the guy had to get the hell out Mm So I was I was out and they did not have my own place you know when I left I went and I we I slept in my car for that night\nOutside of my sister or my sister's apart\nAnd it ended up staying with them for a couple of weeks or whatever to like it was going to rub some change together and ... and get myself in an apartment\nUh but yeah I mean that's tough\nI wasn't I wasn't looking to get out I was like I Need to get a you know when I turned Seventeen I'm done I'm but it was time for me now\nWhat was that lawsuit recently in New York where the guy was thirty eight\nOh my gosh just said they only\nAllowed to get a bite out that that just had a full me think let that sink in tone that people ... and by the way your parents were that close now ... now now\nCalling lawsuit and they didn't want me to get I mean corn garden and corn that Jack ... daughter ... corn corn corn court it's hard to say [laughter] corn court now see you in court court [laughter]\nI'm Carrie Jung move out mhm so like that it's exactly what I had a conversation with a during the ... was she sounds like a cat wouldn't leave [laughter] so I'm thirty eight and you're getting sued to get out of your parents' house\nThat sucks hats off all I Would I Would say if you're telling the truth you're probably not but if you're telling the truth of Twenty one you moved out to you know I mean knowing the truth\nI think that's probably inappropriate age I thought so how ... and even if\nYou're Eighteen Nineteen twenty Twenty one that that makes sense twenty two twenty three okay how you doing you nice places to rent them and then by twenty four twenty five twenty six you like you know yeah he's got he's got to get out and do\nThat I'm thirty eight I\nMean what is wrong with you know man there is something wrong when there is there anything\nThere seems to be a a wave that's happening across\nThe country where people are staying with their parents longer and I wonder if it has anything to do with Obamacare and here's what I mean I guess if you're in school and you still live with your parents or whatever\nYou're still covered by by their health insurance till you're twenty six ... so I Wonder if that has something to do it maybe maybe not I don't know are some\nCases probably you know for these kids or young adults to may have I don't know ... like diabetes and who can't afford 'em right neither insulin eye on their own if if they didn't live\nThey live somewhere else maybe they're probably gonna have to take it could be\nI'm not I'm not going to deny that\nBut also on top of that there seems to be a change in our culture and our value system to where they're also not getting married\nUm and it's interesting to me because that was always sort of you know the\nOld saying first comes love incomes married then 'cause the baby carriage whatever uh it's just an old saying that was based on something because that really was the value system and this is going to say you're a good person bad pursuit in between person if you're doing it that way but I just wonder if there's something that was a sea change that caused the shift\nAnd I wonder if there are people listening right now who are in that boat or you know Nineteen twenty Twenty one twenty two who aren't at all thinking about I Can't wait to get my own place\n\nWho aren't at all thinking about I Can't wait to meet that right guy with the right guy and get married\nAnd his name yeah so I don't know you you couldn't wait to do that or I couldn't I couldn't wait to get married to buy a new um or just just as a no\nJust age that I couldn't wait to meet that person and I was going to spend the rest of my life when\nI Know it's going to get married yeah I mean that that was what we\nAre now me I mean it's way but I think people have our general we are the same generation although you're feeding the mountain years younger whatever carrier but we are the same generation I mean our generation was okay generally speaking we grow up into two parent household generally speaking we had a mother and father the father generally worked outside of the house the\nOther not as much today they both work more maybe that had something to do with it I'm ... and you know as you were growing up you want to have sort of vet look\nIn your house you don't okay I'd like to have you know a couple of kids or whatever in a car too and in a nice house and the picket fence whatever it's changed now now it's a it's a job first 'cause a lot of millennials don't work I don't know so maybe it's not job first what is it what's the goal anymore\nI I don't know I can tell ya because like I Wonder if any money has an idea of what you are rarely old but I Wonder what what changed what in our value system changed um because if you took somebody and and had\nThem in a bubble from the time they were born and told them you're never let them know that there were cell phones are never let them moved there were video games never let them know that there were cars\nThey grow up the way people grew up before they had cars video games and cell phones so it's not like people have changed human beings are just different now that they're not human beings are always a clean slate when they're born other than being able to suck and breathe once they're smacked in the rear end and that's it and everything else is is learned\nIt's from our surroundings\nYou know we we grow up knowing there are cars knowing that there are telephones on their cell phones now know there are computers but if somebody grow up in in a in a place where that wasn't the case\nWith us these what's what's going on in dance dance theater soaring academies due to Charlotte oh dude I when I went to the post office that I Am calling you somebody waiting in line was a big time cat owner 'cause I'm older and are they holding the wire\n... oh so allergic jak so oh it's horrible so I I just wonder if that I had 'cause I saw a couple of studies recently that showed from two thousand like six or seven to now the rate of people getting married has plummeted now I'm getting married any more\nHere's a thought maybe because then like you say we are from the same generation even though I'm younger\nThat we came from two parent household but maybe as me millennials started growing up and the divorce rate way they're like you know wanting to couples end in divorce in the ... percent and the kids see this and think\nWell why isn't gonna bother I it's not something I Want to do any time soon anyway\nOr is it is it a matter of this is the me generation I Know a little me mhm looking out for somebody who I'm married to is a different story\nIt's a different happenstance I mean so if I have a spouse now were a couple now we're in a unit whereas can't handle I no longer an individual and I think that we

that associates Doug how're you\nJohn great thank you so are all the president has to say that the fed is logo\nAnd that we get eleven hundred points it did to the negative on the stock market people obviously you're freaking out some of them are dug you know be I think the stock market as a slot machine and the way so but I don't really worry about it my four one K. still looks great today um but people are freaking out about it can you point to one thing that made this happened ... conglomeration of things\nYeah I think it's a conglomeration of thanks Joey what's always interesting about the market is things that we know that are potential headwinds\nThe market looks at it stares at it shrug it off shrug it off and and so it it it matters yeah they got manifested here as we know that the Federal Reserve is on this trajectory of raising interest rates so what does that really at the end of the day designed to do cool off the economy\nSo that brings into question next year twenty Nineteen what earnings look like\nTrade a China looks like a tough or a photo if you will in in this regard so that's\nProblematic we've had a few companies are pre announce their earnings which don't didn't look necessarily great\nOil has gone up the you know that's I'm up to Seventy five now it's pulled back the last couple of days like everything toward Seventy but still it's much higher than it was Eighteen months ago I had went on the economy should have some of these things that no those have all been there but suddenly that mattered and people that sell but\nDo do you have a video image dug out what a managing director senior vice president over it originated associates you have an opinion as to why the fed would want to cool off the economy\n[noise] well they have this stated inflation target of two percent going here and then when you start to she mentioned oil as an example there's other places we can point to that are that are showing some inflationary pressure which is part and parcel of course to a stronger economy in this economy as much stronger than it was\nWhen President Trump took office right you're getting some of those pressures\nFed tries to stay in front of that because you you it's kinda like\nAnd you know the old porridge three little bears story they don't want it too hot or too cold and want to just right and so they're trying to do that meaning a slow things down into that sweet spot where we have reasonable growth but maybe that's three percent with reasonable inflation which they are they're Damien there'd be two percent so that's that's why they're doing it\nIs it rational or reasonable dug a a I heard today somebody made mentioned that there's a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the midterm election if the if the Trump accountable you search the tank and he's ... he didn't work all the tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational thing to politically people can make this happen\nUm that that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um think about it if you're on that side of the political ledger you're kind of hurting yourself right if you write festival here things go down I don't see that yeah\nOkay a gambler he's managing director of the vice president of a investments are even dreamed of associates\nSo as we watch this you know Obama when he was an officer and talk to you about this before we started so he doesn't pay attention to the daily gyrations of the stock market or when it wasn't doing so great and and what it was doing great he said look how great I Am\nI'm ... of course the left politically is saying well see the bubbles burst for for you know sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now they've been sending the bubbles going to burst this can continue like this\nDo you think this is something temporary and it will correct itself again or are we seeing but maybe you do get too big for its bridges\nYeah no I I think are so investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people you think it's a bull market or a bear market and they have an opinion based on how they feel about things\nBut really what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this fats in the regulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive\nWe have an economy or that had been held back because of the consumer and then very low in terms of their confidence in the outlook All right now and this is actually right we're at twenty year high something like that in consumer

six people dead one point three million in five\nWe're speaking about our thoughts and prayers certainly are going to Panama City to Pensacola to the entire Gulf Coast of Florida no a lot of people getting believe with rain today and the remnants of hurricane Michael if we could carry if you don't mind do some didn't exactly what you have a Michael\nYon unfortunately the death toll is rising a distance from NBC News at least six people killed by the most powerful storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history\nOfficials warn Thursday the number was likely to rise of search crews struggled to gain access to ravaged areas in ... to the piles of debris Michael made landfall in Mexico Beach Florida on Wednesday just shy of a category five hurricane strength with winds gusting one hundred and fifty five miles per hour well\nJust one week into the night as it passed over George it's still prove deadly unfortunately in these types of things as we go through and sift through damage ultimately those who did not heat warnings particularly around the Mexico beach area\nWe typically see debts climb unfortunately Brock Long administrator of the federal emergency management agency sent on CBS on Thursday Florida governor Rick Scott's a Thursday morning this hurricane was an absolute monster and the damage not in its wake is still yet to be fully understood\nAnd Michael ... a tropical storm more than a day after landfall isn't finished yet\nAnd the story made aggressive on Thursday with maximum sustained winds of fifty miles per hour as it were spending tropical storm\nOr is it as far as two hundred and thirty miles from the center of the national Hurricane Center said the Carolinas still cleaning up from Hurricane Florence could get flooding tornadoes in up to seven inches of rain on Thursday when people in South Carolina North Carolina to remain vigilant and be careful and this is a strong tropical storm pushing through long set on today\nBy is is a mean guy Michael mean guy now and um you know we're gonna we're gonna keep an eye on what we find out about about casualties and damage if you see some of these pictures\nI have horrific yeah\nI mean the region with smoke yeah and again I'm this one was not the typical hurricane that UC turning off the coast of Africa and going through you always hear about the lesser into ... and all that many dinner rolls around this was just sort of turned up in the Gulf\nAnd there was and he was a muddy dude I'm thankfully the death toll isn't as bad as it could be but if you even hear about one death and it's too many um but uh yeah the the destruction appears to just be catastrophic so we'll keep an eye on that any information we get it on that will certainly talk about um we also have Kanye West was at the White House to\nYeah I heard about that yeah\nNow I listen to the guys McCain who am I to criticize so I'm not criticizing rush I wouldn't I wouldn't dare do that but I Will say this um\nI I don't think I'd ever play somebody actually saying the F. word on my show yeah and and I believe in yeah in playing what Kanye West said at the White House\nFrom what I understand it just went right out the BS just bam have a nice one ooh yeah I have not heard anything from ... pi the FCC chairman so maybe he's OK with it I don't know what if it turns out you're going to say that it's going to change this show [laughter]\nIs that once or twice\nYou know what I mean well you you use it all the time during the commercial breaks you just might actually do it instead of actually on the air I Am now be exactly right right I mean can you imagine with the budget by\nMan [laughter] that would be something that that that every all of them with me so uh so yeah a Kanye West and now I'm hearing people on the twitters\nClaiming that what Kanye West had to say to make any sense out of low I've got a I've got a good set of years I mean I I thought he made perfect sense now you might not agree with him and he might have been off the reservation a tad here and there but I mean for me I completely got it I got what he was laying down\nAnd the people on the left are so ready to put somebody in a box I mean\nI Believe somebody legitimately said the words house negro the other day talking about Kanye West on CNN\nYeah as a matter of fact I was reading that story mhm how\nHow do you get away with that I Do not know\nWhat does that are and that is that even about getting where I just said it so I can say it but southern getting away with it it's about that they actually called a real living person that name it was in some some sort of a of a fictional character wasn't in a novel this was a real person\nOn what used to be a legitimate news network saying Kanye West as a house negro\nAnd others calling you an Uncle Tom\nAnd from what I I heard Kanye West's Saturday at the White House\nYeah I've been to the White House so I I Know how it feels million I'm with you mhm uh well I listen I buy contract to have to mention that I that I went to the White House I don't think it's in your contact when I bring up White House or President Trump I have to say of course I was invited there would have very few people\nYeah I Am right now ...\nSo there you go I'm All right so what do what he said was that appear to so he was saying I Want less crime in Chicago I Want fathers to be involved in their families I wanted to be more jobs in ah in America\nI Want 'em Adidas to do better than Nike because I invested in a devious when people told me oh stupid by not investing in NYC and I could have lost two hundred million dollars would instead companies were thirty billion now I mean\nWhat is it hard to understand his words I don't think so\nNo not once not from what I heard I didn't hear the whole thing I heard in soundbites from it\nBut the political left in this country needs Kanye West to shut up they need him to not act like President Trump is doing anything right they need him\nTo um to get in line and bashed Trump and do a music video you know portraying somebody's shooting the president indoor or saying after the president instead ... wait a second why can't I'd be happy the jobs are coming back why can't I Want the inner city to go to work and not go to prison\nWhy can't I be somebody who supports this country first\nAnd and I think the beach with all those questions is you can be you're going to be attacked vehemently\nAnd horribly but you have every right to say it and I keep on saying it and some guy in Twitter today oh you're so you're all of a sudden you're on ... because he's on your side no one on ... side because what he said was true\nYou know they're going to find this hard to believe but I actually believe in the truth but it was
