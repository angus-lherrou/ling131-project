the country they just want to they just want to run the guy out of town they don't want him to teach anymore either released colleges will what are they learning at the law school if they're not learning about due process doesn't have any rights\nI mean there there's no evidence against him it's like the prosecutor from Arizona said you know you couldn't get a search warrant on the basis of ah Christine Ford's testimony let let alone a an an arrest warrant\nOr an indictment what the hell are they talking about oh this is this\nThis was very close though ... thank goodness though everything worked out\nAid for four or five hundred forty to forty two you know one of the guys who is one of the guys who's happiest uh the Brett Kavanaugh that Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham\nIt's gotta be Devon known as the California congressman and he's the one who wrote the intelligence committee report last spring where they uh they were they laid out how the or the FBI was using all the Hillary Clinton a campaign smear a report the ... so called\nTo what to get this so Warren to surveilled Carter Page and uh and so now what now the FBI has admitted that all these ... one of the FBI a former officials the lawyer James Baker has admitted that uh they used\nThe the ... to get the warrant I mean it's been admitted before by Andrew McCabe but now it's been confirmed\nAnd the FBI redacted the section\nIn in uh noon as his congressman Nunes has this report where he pointed out that they were using fraudulent information to obtain a warrant they said it was a question of national security\nSo Noone as Nunez was on with Maria burner Romo over the weekend on Fox Business channel and he was just talking about what what is what is Robert Mueller doing what the hell is he doing he's kinda he's looking at a guy who was raising money killed himself\nHe was a guy named Peter Smith are Peter Smith I guess his name as he he ... he was raising money to try to get the the emails they the missing Hillary Clinton emails what the hell does this have to do with collusion he's dead he he he killed himself\nAnd they he has nothing to do with Trump had nothing to do with anybody but known as soon as is asking what the hell is Muller doing cutting number eight\nSo I don't want them to be shut down what I Want the investigation to do is is determine who\nLeaked the plane conversations fooling general Flynn's conversations I Want them to investigate that I Want them to investigate who is behind fusion GPS who was fusion GPS talking to\nThe Russians were they talking to Christopher still talking to I Want to know all the Russians\nFusion GPS interviewed got information from funneled into the Democratic party and the Democratic party funnel that to the FBI to open an investigation that put them all our investigation should be looking at times because I don't know what the hell they were looking at this whole time lounge contracts they say this one\nYeah he says what what the Russians were they talking to I Would I have another question why are they talking to Russians or was this guy Christopher Steele just making up because that's what I think was going on let's\nPlay a let's by cutting number nine with Devin Nunes is from California\nWhen Rosenstein appointed a special counsel\nLead investigators\nThat there was no evidence of the Trump campaign colluded with Russia [noise]\nSo what has a special counsel been doing this whole time [noise]\nThey really look like it's pretty clear now that is an investigation in search of a crime because the very thing the Trump campaign was investigated for colluding with the Russians\nWe now know but it was the Democratic party colluding with the Russians and feeding it to the top levels or the FBI the general counsel of the FBI\nThe Obama administration was operating on Stalin this principle show me the man and I will find you the crime\nDevon Nunez knows that you just can't can't say it publicly because he's a member\nOf the ... of the government Edwards your next with highway car go ahead Edward\nThanks for taking my call I just wanted to make a point there so on
