about uh the cleanup effort and the and the recovery effort in Panama City in around there\nWill talk to about about safety in school I mean that's going to be a lynchpin I think for his electability whether he will make real changes substantive changes to how things are are done in public schools in Florida to make sure the kids are safe but also how do you combat\nYou know the next person on on the left\nHe's like their favorite son now Andrew Gillum he's the next coming he's gotta gotta they gotta usually but here's a guy that couldn't even run this the city of Tallahassee\nWithout there being all sorts of investigations and stuff so it'll be interesting you talked to run to standards about that we of course have a station in Panama City we also were in South Florida we're also seeing August the we're also going to roll over the place in Florida and we we ... we appreciate it a more than that you couldn't even imagine and I like to see to see it just win\nBut I Wonder if if he's going to be able to put his foot down and say look this is what I Believe about school safety this is what I Believe about about taxation ... would raise taxes\nThis is what I Believe about illegal immigration and and open borders are closed borders this is what I Believe about about the less versus right in this country right now it's not a very good relationship so make sure you stick around about twenty minutes from now for him to see it as let me go to the phone lines in the meantime and say hello to welcome to ah\nLet's go to Jeff in Rhode Island Jeff I appreciate you what's going on\nSo ... how's it going\nI'm living the dream and I hear something in the background what's going on\nSo I I moved out of that all good so I'm just curious are now I Know that the last wave of immigration that came through a few months ago basically they will pass through like a turnstile so I'm curious this time around or [laughter]\nWhat a difference to the president is actually putting pressure using leverage against Mexico they differences they've gotta go Eighteen hundred miles through Mexico before they ever get to our border and our good friend and I put that in air quotes Mexico needs to step up and do something to help us out you know we have a great\nWe have a great relationship with them when it benefits them what we need their help in this one\nBut that was that was on the last time to know it was it doesn't matter because they wasn't what I Know it wasn't\nIt wasn't done last time last time that you know the president did not put the national guard in the border the president did not say a political trade agreements with you all the president did not say hold on the president did not say I'll take money away and funding away from Honduras this time he says he will now he needs to stick to his guns can do it but he didn't do that last time\nWell here's the thing though I'm I'm kinda wondering I it 'cause I'm going to get a little frustrated with me too because where there's a thing now are the Republicans had had the houses of Congress the Congress how's this for the last what it is\nThey've had the house for eight years they've had the Senate for a four years\nOkay now and the president said for the last two and yet here we are still a tourist style at the border so I'm Wondering what what what would it take to actually get that the stock\nYou ... you have you have to get the establishment Republicans either out of office or get them to grow to grow is set to be honest with ya I'm President Trump would like to do that he's tried to build a border wall and he's not getting anywhere with either side but was a majority on both sides he should be able to get somewhere\nAnd he's not going to get done because a friend because those it may just download down on\nA Republican want they're afraid they're our ... our basic due to lose their job\nThey're afraid to stick to our lives because they might be from moderate I'd uh I'm a Republican districts they might be for moderately Republican states where they were afraid of losing their position\nTo vote Democrat these people are not going to vote for them\nI'm telling you that they're getting ...\nTo the establishment Republicans he didn't get there by lying big up there because there were a moderate\nAnd that's what some of these stages of these districts woman at this point we've got to take a hard space Lewis I get your frustration and I appreciate the call I get your frustration and you're right on I'm not I'm not arguing about the frustration\nI'm but I'm here to say that the president is going to have to do a lot of this himself listen he's empowered people like Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell that we thought were rhinos\nHe's empowered them to actually stand to have a voice be heard he's empowered people like Susan Collins I've got your back\nIf you do the right thing here he's empowered them so maybe they're they're they're more conservative than they'd been pretending\nUm but they were afraid to be more conservative because they thought that this was the way you did it with decorum and I offer one and one for all his reach across the aisle they've got to get like Democrats they've got to say I don't want to reach across the aisle we have the power we're going to do what we're going to do you join us do you look stupid\nAnd I think that as the process goes and as the days weeks months and years go by under a Trump presidency where you have the majority you're seeing more people grocery intestinal fortitude you're seeing that\nAnd I think it'll continue as long as the President's Day strong when he says I'm gonna stop funding to Honduras he's got to stop funding on doors when he says I'm going to put the national guard of the border he's got to put them on the border\nAnd when he says I'm going to punish Mexico if you don't do the right thing he's got to punish Mexico\nBut I mean I'll throw it out there I'll I'll ask is very directly to those will be watching listening\nWhat specifically do you want him to do about this four thousand member plus caravan coming up from from Central America I really would like to hear

then again on Sunday and we'll be talking about it right here on Monday morning am\nKevin vi V. weekday morning six they've had followed the voice of Boston\nSeveral you are kale\nWorld of relentless change the church brings a message that causes some to laugh\nAnd others to stumble however it is the message that give life and\nTo those who receive it in the doctor Oswald Hoffman says we preach Christ crucified this week on the loose for an hour\nSundays at two thirty in the voice of Boston W arcade\nVoice of Boston you working in one hundred and twenty seven to ... like eighty to Boston and I heart radio station [noise]\nFrom\nGary all or nearly three weeks ago journalist your mom who show gay walked into the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul he never left the Saudi Government now says that the Washington Post columnist died there after an argument escalated into a fistfight\nWhat is it would not wanting to uh holder accountable and take her to task frankly rip her part\nOn the fact that she's a phony Cherokee Indian and she perpetrated a fraud is central to her character it's central to her integrity or lack of it is central to what a phony Charlotte than she is\nAnd when deal came in I thought that was frankly the only good question John Keller us they don't get to the moderator in a second he let her off the hook\nIt was a mild flu shots and I'm saying that you've been given this massive opening a new refused to take it frankly the way Scott Brown was very reluctant to use the issue in two thousand twelve but especially in the wake of the DNA pass a disaster\nAnd you\nBasically just say I don't really want to talk about it very much I think you perpetrated a fraud and then you kind of moved on he moved on about her taxes he moved on about fifty thousand dollars that she claimed into duck shoes for clothes and I'm thinking whoa whoa whoa whoa\nJeff back it up buddy forget that the ... on the clothes or how about the fact that she lived that she's Ninety nine point nine percent white and not Cherokee Indian and you can tell on her she was nervous\nShe was shaky she was I mean she knew she was vulnerable and he didn't take it\nFor the life of me I don't understand why he didn't take it so here is the first Scott where I think honestly Jeff's not doing as well as I Want it here is is opening rural caught one Brittany\nFirst of all I think the fact is um you know having been a former Democrat is assets in this race so anybody who was attacking me and that's not an issue with senator or and I think one of the big things that's been out there she released a video earlier this week to try to clarify an ancestry ah thing I don't care center one about a ...\nOr let me just say a few words about Elizabeth Warren\nAnd forgive me a first about Elizabeth Warren than about John Keller and then I Want to take your calls six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight is the number okay my friends um I thought Elizabeth Warren\nA did hurt him on the transgender issue I'm with Jeff on it I don't think he defended that position very well\nIt was a technicality he was arguing about a loophole she came across as I'm more passionate she frame that I saw it in a much stronger way and I've got to say this what surprised me was notice how she kept filibustering the entire debate\nNotice how she's the fraud she's the phony Indian she's the one and by the way he could've nailed there on how she enriched herself as a senator\nTo the two and a Fifteen to twenty million dollars how she's done one book tour after another he could have gone on about you've done nothing for the people of Massachusetts except frankly wind your pockets senator I mean there were so many openings that frankly he didn't take to be honest but she constantly often had him on the defensive\nSo he was on the fence she was on offense um\n[noise] and [noise]\nIt's just I I it was frustrating for me I thought frankly he came across as a nice guy but I think in some ways frankly he was too nice\nShe had the initiative she was the one going after him she was almost like a snarling dog honestly like a snarling animal at times a year as snarling at him and ... your finger at M. condescending lecturing angry rabid\nAnd so in some way she came across as very off putting\nBut I've got to say a he had many opportunities and he was reluctant to pull the trigger\nAnd I Warren Jeffs about that I said listen nice guys finish last you may be great to marry you\nMay be great marriage material you may be a great guy as a buddy but if you want to win and politics are in sports are generally in life you ought to become a street fighter\nAnd you can see Elizabeth Warren at times went for the throat deal didn't know that being said I thought he scored some real real blows\nHe hit her hard on that she didn't know the ZIP Code of Massachusetts he hit her heart she's focused simply on twenty twenty he hit or hard that she's on almost nothing for the people and the voters of Massachusetts\nI thought on immigration on open borders on sanctuary cities on law and order on crime on um illegals on the police I thought he scored blow after blow after bowl\nSo I think when everything is said and done I Would scored a victory for Jeff deal but a victory on points\nKnown knockout blow when in fact I thought she was Pete up for him to knock her out\nAnd I don't know if he's going to regret that down the line he should have been more aggressive he could have been more aggressive and honestly why he wasn't\nA is something I'm going to frankly have to talk to him about when we have him on the show later tonight okay six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight lines are loaded I Want to get to the calls let me just make one final point\nI saw John Keller disgraced themself tonight\nThis guy is not a moderator he's a democratic hack\nThe way he allowed Elizabeth Warren to basically sees that debate he would give her a minute to talk then when she went way over a minute then he goes to Jeff deal he's barely ten Fifteen seconds into his answer and she's cutting them off\nAnd Jeff again nice guy kept letting her cut him off and I would just have called them out if that was me on the debate stage I Would have said excuse me John is this the Elizabeth Warren show I mean issue moderating debate as well so she gets a minute of her time and she gets a minute of my pain\nYou can see he was in her corner\nAnd he was doing everything possible to try to help her proper up and give her as much time and as much room to interrupt and block and try to get under Geoff Diehl skin and prevent them from getting his message out\nBut in the end let me tell you what I think everything is the storyline is going to be tomorrow he came across ultimately a sweet reasonable likeable knowledgeable ... walk he knows the issues very well senatorial\nHe really came across as a senator you can see him as a senator\nShe frankly came across as a nasty which she came across as a nasty hateful person and that's frankly the Elizabeth Warren that I Know\nThat's the Elizabeth Warren what you saw tonight is what I saw one I confronted her in the hallway at W. R. K. O. in our former studio in Brighton when I confronted her about being a ... a multimillionaire\nAnd I said to her after a while you're worth north of Fifteen twenty million dollars you're part of the one percent\nSo if you will against the one percent and called them greedy and evil aren't you a hypocrite because you are the one percent\nAnd the fire the fury the anger the shaking of the finger her the wedding of the finger her shaking almost screening breaking down what you saw tonight is what I saw and that's what I said she's not ready for prime time\nThis morning bat stuff may work here maybe we'll see we'll see although I think just going to get a bump in the polls after tonight\nBut I'm telling you Trump will destroy her in fact I think her democratic opponents will destroy her she's not presidential material that's the one thing we saw tonight and John Keller is a joke\nHe's not a moderator he's a democratic water carrier for Elizabeth Warren who do you think one who do you think last ditch Jeff deal do enough where are you happy with his performance all of your calls I promise next\n\nSmell trending on W.

think integrity is a big part of this okay thank you\n[noise] six one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight okay joining us now is the man of the hour himself state representative Geoff Diehl Jeff I'm Sorry we how'd you hanging on the phone for a while we find some technical issues I got to ask you first right out of the gate how do you think you did tonight\n[noise] well ... thanks for having me on and thanks to cook the country for tuning in and watching the debate I Hope everybody got a chance to see\nWhat was going on there and I think that the debate went\nPretty well I mean I Would say that we were able to differentiate ourselves on the fact that I'm focused on working for the people of Massachusetts she's clearly spent so much time at a state that she doesn't even seem to be connected on a lot of issues and I think the other thing uh it's very clear with her is that she is just obsessed with running for the White House to the point where she\nCan't handle a any mention of the president and his administration and the success of this happening and I want to make sure that I had that scene at the table down in Washington it's going to get Massachusetts what we need for going forward and uh I think that was what tonight\nI'm you hit or hard on that I thought you scored\nI thought you had a good night I thought you hit her heart on twenty twenty I thought you hit her heart on not spending any time in Massachusetts I Love the line where you said you know I bet you don't even notice ZIP Code\nOr I thought you were very strong on immigration on law and order however Jeff I've got to ask you the sixty four thousand dollar question\nYou had this whole DNA past debacle disaster\nI just played the opening clip\nYou hardly went after her on that why\nWell first of all just you know I've made it clear from the beginning of this campaign that\nThe issue is not whether she thinks she's a Native American it's whether she took\nMinority hiring positions and I definitely made sure I pointed that out at the beginning of the fact that she didn't want to engage and then I get it on it and I think the moderator wanted to steer towards other subjects but at the same time it's clear she did take advantage of that in really want to address that uh I think the other thing too is that you know right now\nShe is reeling from national media that is already\nCalled out how first of all that attempt to try to\nPut it to bed really backfired that she really has less Native American heritage and most people so like my job is to try to communicate to people in Massachusetts thing they don't already know we already know that she\nHas a lack of integrity when it comes to that claim when it comes to her taxes I Want to make sure that people do other issues that she fell down on it and that's what we did for the entire part of the ... a debate tonight\n[noise] Jeff you also could have really hit or hard on the book tours and how she's used government to enrich yourself and how she's worth north or Fifteen to twenty million dollars you didn't do that and I'm just curious why\nAre we talked about I mentioned the fact that she's a millionaire and that she sees the tax code to benefit or so but yes I think that again people are looking for\nInformation on parts of the her record that that they weren't aware of and uh at the same time you know obviously the moderator was trying to steer the conversation in areas that were were specific issues I was able to I think\nClearly talk about where she's let us down but at the same time look there's two more debates and I certainly plan on making sure we continue to follow up on this but I think everybody knows she's the millionaire and the race I said I'm just a guy's a Whitman probably has more in my house or the other one of my business and a half a I'm just trying to work for the people in Massachusetts that was very very evident\nI gotta tell you I thought you toward I thought you scored a direct blow on that one Jeff let me ask you this at times especially in the first half hour the debate when you're in the eye of the hurricane I get it\nBut I Want you to know this this was so obvious to me my wife was texting me my sister in law Brittany was beside me\nUm she looked shaky she looked unraveled at times almost like she was unraveling\nShe looked rabid she looked angry she looked at times almost I hate to say this but almost like a which\nAre just spiteful hateful angry or bitter she really did not come across as likeable at all in fact she came across frankly is very dislike ... and you on the opposite really came across as likable as reasonable as very sensible\nAnd when you were beside her what was it like wash did she look as angry to you as she looked as angry the U.S watching it on the screen\nChess I think she's pretty angry in general that she didn't get the president she wanted a Hillary Clinton and I think that uh she can't believe that her aspirations to make a run for the White House started slowly disappearing right in front of a a I think it's very clear that she doesn't she's\nGot an inability to work with other people and she made it\nClear over and over again blaming Republicans for things she couldn't get done blaming the president bringing the vice president I'm that's why this race is so important to the people in the state it's not about someone who just comes out and and attacks other people all the time it's about someone who actually has the ability to\nWork with people from both sides of the aisle he reasonable and put the people at Massachusetts are veterans are police officers are small business owners are fishermen that's what we're supposed to do is work for them not doing as people but that's what she seems to be all about\nA Jeff I Know you're busy a lot of other media people want to talk to you I've got to ask you though a lot of people are going to be talking about it tomorrow which was the moderator John Keller\nUh I thought he lost control of the debate at times he let her filibuster she frequently cut you off she wouldn't let you talk she wouldn't let you finish your senses is almost like he gave her a minute and even more than a minute\nAnd then when you add ten Fifteen seconds she would cut you off and start filibustering it's almost like he gave her harm in it and then he gave her your minute do you feel that Keller essentially bungled the debate and with the acting almost it was a two on one situation\nWell no I think actually the um the fact is that John Keller\nThey try to steer the the debate in the direction of his actual issues but I think it was clear that Senator Warren even though we had rules set out at the beginning about how much time we would take a for each of us to give our opening one minute statements on each issue did\nTake more time but I'm not going to complain because the fact of the matter is I still think in the time I was left with I was able to convey what was important and look if she comes off as a showing that she really doesn't have any willingness to listen to me or what I'm Talking about\nYou know then that just goes to show that uh that's how she acts down in Washington as well so I'm like I think that uh this this debate went very well in fact so well\nI'm senator wind actually refused to meet with the press afterwards there was a about a let's say a dozen or more people from the press cameraman and a interviewers that were down there that want it to get a follow up from us I was the only one that went down there and answer questions from the press owes debate she avoided it so I think\nThat we know who actually did pretty well at this to\nOh Jeff I I think you want to debate I think there's no question about it and I think you're going to get a bump into balls I said that in my opening monologue just let me ask you this final question what surprised you folks I Know you ... a lot for this debate you've been campaigning for God Knows how many months now\nBut on that debate stage face to face with Elizabeth Warren\nWhat was the thing that you didn't expect or that surprised you the most\nI don't know if anything really surprised me other than to say that I don't think she expected that are her opponent was actually someone who\nWas going to be able to hold her accountable I think that she just thought that this was going to be a walk in the park she'd come in some notes in front of her and she would talk to use all the talking points down to Washington I don't think she realized that I actually care about Massachusetts I have a small business my daughters\nAre I Want them to be able to afford to live in a state raise my grandkids here and uh I don't think she understood that I care so passionately that I\nMade sure I was fully prepared to take her on every issue and I think that's what she wasn't ready for\nJust do you think she came in over confident\nWell look I don't know I don't know what's in her head all I Know is it a I'm ready to take over as a U.S senator on November say\nOh is it showed Jeff I got to tell you um you came across the senatorial you came across as statesmen like as I said I opening monologue honestly it was the gentleman versus the which she did not do well and I will definitely tell you this she's in trouble\nThis is now a real race and you're going to start seeing the poll numbers close I think the gap you're going to make up a huge gap\nAnd I'll tell you something else my friend which you also reveal tonight she's not presidential material I mean I Do have is you got onto her skin you scored below after ... after blow she is not ready for twenty twenty and I don't even think she's ready for twenty Eighteen\nSo but you know I Want to know Roger let you did a really good job tonight and uh hopefully you'll following up with another decisive victory on Sunday\nYeah I'm ready for it and we got a week after that so what this is great I'm going to get a chance to let people know everywhere across the state or a and all the forms that Senator Warren her time has come to touch it's over\n[noise] we have been talking with Republican challenger state representative and I think the winner of tonight's debate Geoff Diehl Jeff great job buddy and hopefully we'll talk to you on Sundays that okay that sounds great",
