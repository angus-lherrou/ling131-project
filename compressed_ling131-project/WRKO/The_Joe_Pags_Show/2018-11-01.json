treat deal when my kids turned Thirteen they didn't grow up the house no more to go trick or treating they answered the door and hand candy out for me got you\nBack to the uh fourteenth amendment real quick um my grandfather was a a a was an attorney and a ... and he was a scholar and [noise]\nAnd uh I Would ask them questions about it and he told me that the constitution as a living and breathing documents because it represents may turn in the United states of America and it evolves\nWhen the fourteenth amendment in his opinion was written it was because the United states was not fully formed here and there were people living in territories\nThat were being absorbed by the United states and it was written for for those people so that their children and their legacy will be there for consider us citizens\nI totally agree with you on its couldn't misconstrued as a means for anchor babies but the way that it was written in the way that I was raised to believe it unfortunately\nIt gives the dams and the ultra liberals in the communist the opportunity to tear nation apart by allowing illegal immigrants to just drop the kid and then all of a sudden ... chain migration and all this other garbage\nHold on to say to carry you here he used a proper terminology drop a kid\nI may not always good I was actually came\nDown and and and before you cut loose yeah go ahead please cut loose a robust trigger a Twitter rent which I don't um I don't subscribe to the\n... the reason why you're being hounded the way you are is the same reason that I get hounded Scott ... the way I think it's because we're right\nThat you Kevin I'm not using any you know what you did it right at two minutes by man I appreciate joke I\nHave a great name\nSo I write see they they're very good call now I disagree with his grandfather it's not a living breathing documented is actually the foundation stone and that is changeable you can change it from the amendment process but what's in there now is not living readable and changeable and all that so I'm just I just read his grandfather on that it wouldn't be\nThe the fourteenth amendment was added it was in the Eighteen sixties it wasn't like Seventeen eighty seven when it was a bunch of colonies and and we're still figuring out how do we are doing um so yeah I mean I'll I'll disagree with someone would grandad said although I respect the fact that grandfather raised in um to learn about the constitution that doesn't happen that often\nI now certainly not now right\nExactly right All right let me go back at it Pam you got two minutes go ahead\nOkay founding fathers not given the warning or everything they put in the constitution or that I mean are there for a reason to pray and under the jurisdiction there uh\nHas to be met that both of those situations have clean that and it's all ... like they can automatically American citizens the faith but not be there because when they were carried\nOut there if they held the American Indians even do that more than that I live under a Mac and Gary ... because they're under their tribe or their issues that [noise]\nAnd then you go to a and back into it if it were born here and not American citizens because they're not in ... and under their parents' ...\nMotor that's not true I mean I don't want to I don't want to argue with these I Want to give you two minutes but a couple of things you said weren't right but go ahead I'll give it to the remainder of the time good\nWhat was it true\nThey're not under their parents' jurisdiction during the jurisdiction of the country but they represent\nTheir parents can't\nWrite resigned because their their diplomats but go ahead finish\nDiplomat country and within the country\nWell there's a big difference the illegal alien is

didn't really want to argue with you but the bottom line for me is that child when born I Believe\nDoes fall under the jurisdiction there oh I get where you're coming from and I think it was very well said it was very thoughtful but I'm not going to reiterate it a million different times you and I don't agree on that one small parts we do agree however that they shouldn't be getting citizenship so let's do something to fix it\nAt\nAll right we appreciate Japan Samuel good stuff rates have carry last one on this new would carry his name is Dwight mhm I Want you to take the call this time I don't

follow the laws and every single where you're born if you see renewable\nCorrect me if I'm wrong I Believe it says about the parent unless you're our pledge to another country\nEveryone stopped reading at that point but I think they need to keep on reading\nNow does he doesn't say anything about being played through a country in that in that amendment doesn't say anything about that\nOkay and that was my question\nWhen I'm a and it will do is I'm a I'm going to read it to you all do would sound better of carry read it but she probably doesn't have it in front of her or what it says there's all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states in the state where they reside no state filmmaker enforcing the

doing well I really appreciate having you on today\nUm there's a lot going on but it's Halloween so we have to go\nWell we are because ... you and I were talking before we started here about how this works you actually have students in the field these incredible young journalists who actually doesn't put to shame the legacy media every single day\nAnd they got into Judy Chu stories they say her I said this is something that they'll make so to the website and then beyond that took me through the process somebody's going to school at let's say Michigan State university where I wanted to have a story today and how does a process happen\nYeah so we have students on college campuses across the country and be there are people who set us apart from other news organizations um we don't just have a central news team\nUp and some ivory tower trying to find stories about college campuses ... we have students that are actually living in the stories so that we're going to talk about today these Halloween one's\nA these are coming from students who have actually just organically encountered these events these things coming out from their school administrations on campus so these are things that they are actually living in and experiencing a back in the day I was actually a campus correspondent myself and I loved it so much I had to stick around so\nThese these students are really good at what they do they provide us with these unique stories and the cool thing is they get the chance to actually\nBe journalists and today the student that wrote the Michigan State story about the ah the flow chart about whether or not your costume is race that he actually on Drudge Report right now oh it's cool if\nThese students are very successful they're good at what they do and it's an honor to work with them\nAnd that's why it's hard for me to have you guys are we we just can't be reformed on the website I go every morning to you guys reporting on it it's amazing stuff every time which was Michigan State university I was a TV news a good way to Michigan for five years for on WGM radio there Monday through friday live I'm\nGenerally speaking the areas not nobody but him as you can get no us she says and before we started you could talk for for Halloween decorations taco helped me through the leaders ... should be raised was talking with Dr\nYeah it's pretty hilarious to even say out loud but the school put out this flow\nChart essentially for students in the dorms and it had all these different examples of racist costumes versus but not racist version of the same cost him and the one that stuck out the most to us the craziest one is that it has this guy in a taco suit and it's one of those big like costumes that you buy it spirit Halloween wherever I Know\nAnd he's wearing one of those and there's one where it's just the taco suit and it says not racist\nAnd then it shows the same guy in the same costume wearing a some borough and it says that this is racist buffet at ... I I'm not kidding I Wish I was kidding he uh that the poster goes on to say don't be a Mexican taco just be a taco\nBell you know those are Mexican food no there's no they didn't vote should Taco Bell labs are invested in food [laughter] we we were just serving food was much more because it makes it raises a good as you know I don't speak Spanish fluently I Know a lot of your age ... but she'll just means hub\n... with their problem is there's some ... ... it really is a traditional Mexican dear what is your what do they explain why that's racist\nNo they offer no explanation all they say is what you can and can't do and they draw the line of not racist versus racist and\nFrankly I think that when people throw around this term racist so much it actually dilutes the term\nI think that it's something that should be saved for things that are truly racist racism is a horrible thing unfortunately it's real and when the left just throws it around at something like a fat guy wearing a ... hat I think it tight loop that term and I don't think they're going to go busting down the doors of every margarita bar\nSaying hey you need to take a simpler out for when it's someone's birthday death

to Boston and my heart radio stations\nOoh [laughter]\nIf you had a button Nichols they'll tell you that outlines any and then like try and you're not you're not doing it again and they\nAll\nI think the last ... hours this area's part [laughter] oh gosh that last night [laughter]\nWe're on this program are privileged to have those of you who've chosen to listen listen and those have used to have chosen to watch watch\nTruly privileged it's an honor I Love every second of it\nWe've edited up and it wasn't even me it was talkers magazine before we added some of our biggest affiliates we have four million weekly listeners so now it's five or six million mhm we have um fifty million people have access to the program on Newsmax TV\nWhich is cool\nI got a total of an added them up and it's a lot this is generally speaking more than ... normally get we've got a total of twelve complaints yesterday about how I handled the call with the guy I think his name was William\n... and I wanted to address it because if there were twelve complaints than probably some others felt uncomfortable not the same time I got a ton and I I didn't at 'em up but a ton of people saying you're on fire way to go you demand you really you know you spelled it clearly he was being passive aggressive whatever\nI I just want to give a couple of helpful hints to those who are\nOf the belief that I somehow was meaner nasty or or a bad guy\nAnd again this is only really focused on a very small minority of those who watch or listen but there are a couple who were like you disappointed me so bad you one guy said I had something else going on in my personal life that's why I acted like that\n... other than having to deal with this one every day hey and white and you're telling me and now you know and that you I didn't say anything about her name mentioned your name didn't say a word ... and say anything he just said this one [laughter] I think that I come from then okay exactly right\nI'm not my personal I was actually going just fine so I'm not really sure what you're talking about but let me address it and get it out of the way\nAnd by the way and say I will take calls from people on the fourteenth amendment again today because I Am always ready to mix it up always in fact when I have my my interview with a sheriff Clarke he and I disagree on the fourteenth amendment\nImagined that carry it wasn't even an argument it was a good lively debate right good\nWhen people call into the program there is no set time for when they should be out but I've actually had the people who make my call screener do me a favor and have the line start linking a certain color when it gets to two minutes\nStudies have found a study that I did right before the show and carry a ... study as well as the survey that we didn't yes then but industry folks for years and years have said to me that's just way too long for a phone call move on to the next guy or move on to the next topic I'm giving you inside baseball you're gonna get anywhere else\nSo to me this is about the max I gave the guy William yesterday about three times that you haven't only twelve seconds what do you have to say came out\nThat's not true\nWhen somebody calls the program they talk to the screener first that Sam my daughter um and they let her know here's what I Want to talk about I unlike other talk show hosts invite people who disagree with me to call the show\nI Want them to call the show because I think that if we actually have a lively conversation if not debate\nOn a on an important issue no matter what it is could be abortion can be climate change can be the fourteenth amendment no matter what it is I think that we at least\nBreathe life into the fact that there's more than one tech there's something you have to know about me and it's a it's a a reason why some of you listen I don't print the present anything on my show\nThat I haven't fully engulfed myself and knowledge of and what I mean by that is I really really really study not only my site I already know myself because they took the facts and then I and I dealt with it I form my opinion from that but I also have to get the other side because the last thing you want to do is talk shows up somebody call in\nAnd have a varying opinion and you have no clue what he's talking about and you had no thought process that knew about that I Know what the argument is over the fourteenth amendment I get it\nAnd what's interesting is when people call in they look like yet on the one guy either calling earlier this week Kerry who dropped the F bomb from New York in the aggregate his name but he called me a punk because\nWhen I said would you rather go to a convenience store where the employees are armed are the ones that can be used or the employees are not armed he said you're a punk I'd go to the one where they're armed and and then he dropped the F bomb or something that's a stupid what you wanted to go into the you want to go Rob the the um the convenience store that had armed people are behind the counter which is the week I was just an idiot\nIt's okay I I don't want any to call in\nBut when you call in if you think you're going to say you are wrong and you've misinterpreted or you misunderstood the fourteenth amendment already you're starting on a grounding that suggest that I'm stupid\nAnd you're suggesting that you're not going to educate me now do I believe that there are some people that call in where I can get an education yes I think that I can learn from you know are there are people that I have on his gas that I have on his desk 'cause I Wanna learn from them absolutely almost every guest\nIs somebody who's exactly that description and learn from them but if you're going to call in and be passive aggressive and immediately say you're misunderstanding the fourteenth amendment you your misinterpreting it and then you go off at a change and\nFor a minute fifty\nBefore you said anything about what I'm wrong about I'm going to start jumping in\nAnd we're going to have a conversation now if you want somebody to call in and get three four five six minutes to give a dissertation about why he's writer she's right and you want me to shut up you've picked the wrong show I think NPR does that I think that CSPAN does that\nAnd color what's on your mind and go and then seven minutes later well thanks so much very interesting point that's not what we do here what we do here you you know what I pictured carry I think that I value set at a few times on the year when I picture when I'm doing\nA lively conversation like that maybe even a debate is the way the dinner table looked at my house growing up is that makes sense\nOkay that's all I Am\nI come from a big family and when the entire family got together it was hundreds of us and you couldn't hear yourself more than two inches in front of your face and I ...\nEverybody was talking a shoveling food in and talking to some more than a guy says yeah but I think what do you talk about what do you think about it and it's just sort of how we can vary there was out of love those out of carrying it was a ... never angry\nWell William yesterday got angry because I wasn't going to hear his passive aggressive this tell me how wrong I was\nAnd then he started going to French law and international law and the whole bottom line for the fourteenth amendment and those who want to argue about it is the is a small part that says the jurisdiction there up\nThat that's what they are hung up on and I get that I completely understand the argument I completely understand Williams argument by the way what do you mean I agree that we should not be giving birthright citizenship to to the children of illegal aliens unfortunately the the constitution right now allows for it\nI think it should be changed I think it should be adjusted William thinks it covers it already and then he uses several examples couple of things that aren't gonna work on me\nWhen you call in or write to me afterwards and either assume some personal issue I might be having which is dumb um or you tell me that rush and Sean and mark and Glenn would never do that\nTerry have have we ever know discussions about how we're going to do the show here\nSaid well let's listen to rush in showing Glen and and mark first and then we'll do it kind of along with what they said or done now never never and I don't expect that they would ever listen to my show and take talking points for me either but they're all great they are great hosts and I'm not I'm not afraid to say they're all better than I\nBut in the Joe ... show I'm the best one to do it 'cause it's named after me and and we got here because we did it in a certain way that appeals to people I Do understand that you're used to hearing funny fart joke guy on the radio and I still am that guy I have to be because of who I work with and the parity what\nNo ... not because then they know about what you are you shake it you know you gotta do know that was a lie on the line Kat\nFarts all day so what I'm saying it what a ... so\nWhat I'm saying is we're going to bring you a unique take on the day's News I'm going to bring you factor based opinion on what's out there you may not agree with me sometimes what I found interesting turn to leave it at this will take phone calls on this one eighty nine for one pack edited nine for once every two four seven\nWhat I find interesting about this\nIs that\nEverybody who thought I was mean or or wrong and Sam ... is for some reason for the buck on this stuff um\nEverybody who contacted me about how mean or wrong or how did with the guy speak agreed with him\nSo I get that you guys feel strongly about the issue you feel strongly about the amendment you feel strongly that I was incorrect or him and corrected my tech and that you might have been right in his tank and you wanted me to shut up or six minutes to let him go on about how ... he was I prefer to mix it up\nI prefer to debate I prefer to throw down and I prefer to where the guy got angry I prefer to say why are you getting angry stop yelling at me let's have a conversation but at least points out what it is that I'm getting wrong\nSo if you're still bud heard about yesterday but you tuned in today to see if I was going to address it I Am addressing it will you if you're listening right now I'd be glad to debate you anytime but when you come at me with this this passive aggressive as I Am very keen to it\nAbsolutely terrorists resident

All right now before I take some of these phone calls have you made clear on my stance is on the fourteenth amendment because I'm William didn't get it and a lot of a lot of you wrote me didn't get it but I'm going to make sure that you do get now understand I think it's perfectly cool that you disagree with me\nBut let me make sure that we understand each other before anybody calls me ... so stupid as just a little bit you know what I mean\nI Know I said I guess I'm going to hire you and me are here within calling you pump best friend\nYeah ... ... not pretend that it's not the case 'cause I Am pompous without a doubt yeah\nAh and arrogant and all that other Martin so the bottom line is this the fourteenth amendment says what it says\nIt says what it says it it's not about adding to it unless they're drafting from it I'm not pretending that it's something other than it is the fourteenth amendment says what it says I even said 'cause I hate this term it is what it is\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states in the state where they reside no state she'll make or enforcing the law which celebrates or privileges blah blah blah so that the second part as a matter of the what's at odds here\nAnd what people are having a hard time understanding my take on is the first part where he talks about the jurisdiction there up\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states in the state where they reside that's clear to me it's clear English if you're born here\nAnd you're subject to the jurisdiction there of a person being born here would be subject to the jurisdiction their of their parents aren't so they gotta send to get their hands to send back but the child certainly is subject to the jurisdiction there are there is no argument\nIn my opinion about that line now senator Howard that presented this and wrote about this in the Eighteen sixties\nWrites very clearly obviously we're not talking about foreign dignitaries or their families we're not talking about aliens we're not talking about and he goes down a list of ... obviously we're not talking about here is where I Believe they screwed up\nThey didn't put that in the amendment the amendment says what it says\nPeriod end the story now I Know what the intent was\nKennedy intent matter well not if you're a conservative\nAnd you look at this as the foundation\nThat this is in stone what liberals do is they say yes I see the first amendment but his living and breathing and its movable and his multiple with its like play though I disagree either get says what it says well the second amendment is little bowl and we can make all sorts of laws restrict or access to guns and infringe or access in southern because ... mobile reasonable and\nAnd it's play though I disagree I think it says what it\nSays I think that for all of the amendments so if it's poorly written fix it\nAnd it is poorly written they should not have left out the part that said obviously this does not include a team together word obviously this doesn't include foreign dignitaries this doesn't include um the children of illegal aliens they should have said", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "01"}
