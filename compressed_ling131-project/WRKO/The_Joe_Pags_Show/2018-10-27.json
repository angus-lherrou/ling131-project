England in your\nVoice so Boston New York about one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I heart radio station\nWe'll talk about how um how they found him so quickly so got some information on that but let's just just set the stage right now though what do you have for me\nNow from writer as us attorney general Jeff Sessions said on friday that these are stay on the suspect in Leeds Thirteen suspicious packages sent a prominent Democrats and others isn't the custody of the FBI has been charged with five federal crimes\nAs they are facing up to fifty eight years in prison and found guilty sessions sat at a press conference denouncing the charges\nWe will not tolerate such lawlessness especially political violence he said\nAt the agents arrested say oxygen the fixed in plantation Florida and also how the way a white van plastered with pro Trump stickers\nThe slogan CNN sucks and images of democratic figures with Red Cross hairs and with their faces at the high director Christopher Wray told a news conference fingerprints on a package that the congresswoman Maxine Waters were confirmed to be that other say oc\nNow says that there could be other packages\nAnd reporting by Zachary ... at all and he got\nThere you go All right I had not heard about the the Democrats with crosshairs over them this was on the outside of the ... Ah yes or it's going to make sure the Christian Rousseff swagger to drive an unwritten plantation Florida which is not just ...\nA lot of people down there and he's got crosshairs drew pictures of prominent Democrats and nobody noticed it\nAnd he uses a you know ... Trump supporter although records show he was a registered Democrat until two thousand six feet to those which team he registered as Republican for some reason not be\nI've been reported but he wasn't registered Democrat his name as you say is Caesar essays are or what does it ...\nSay oc say ... you\nAlso went by ulterior something um I don't know what the guys are just that he is but I've heard people describe him as white um I Would say that he's he's not white in the traditional sense he's a guy that has I'm guessing mixed heritage\nI've heard that there again that was described joined today right\nAnd that would make sense but also Caesar essays are it could be there is some Hispanic in their ... you know it's true though carry it doesn't matter ... ... if he did it he's a piece of crap he should not have done it I think\nThe good lord above none of these bombs blew up thank the good lord above a potential bad guy is off the streets but there are a lot of questions when it comes to this\nAnd we don't have a lot of answers now or carry lucky best news anchor side taken a bit so when she gets more information from the program we'll bring it to you having said that it definitely bears\nUs getting into how the media the far left legacy media is representing this they're calling him ... or ... bomber the which would be make America great again\nThey also have and I've seen kind of runs in color graphics from CNN and other outlets that say I'm the bombers targeting Trump targets\nWhich is not true Trump never set on targeting these people go and get them that's not true so it doesn't make any sense but I'll ask you this if you're an ass wagon enough [noise] to use the term Margot bomber\nOr a state of the bombers going after Trump Trump targets\nWere you also reporting that the guy that showed up at the congressional baseball practice and almost killed Steve ... are you calling him to Sanders shooter\nHe was a vehement\nBernie Sanders supporter or I've heard people call him a ...\nA Bernie Bro it was never reported that way in fact his background wasn't talked about much at all a bunch of young country music fans were shut up in Las Vegas a year ago\nNot much about that guy's political backgrounds talked about is it or why he chose a country music concert\nThat I'm not blaming Hillary Clinton for that I'm not blaming Maxine Waters for the guy that that shot Steve ... so why is it that the legacy media things they can get away with pretending like this is something Trump did or that Trump supporters are on hinged and this is the thing we do\nI'm a Trump supporter do I appear to be somebody that we do something like this and if you say yes unity it if you say no your common sense you know logical rational person\nSomebody who would do something like this or shoot up the baseball game or blow up the Oklahoma City federal building these are not jobs these are bad guys these are bad people doing bad things\nYou know the guy that that shot Gabby Giffords out in Arizona several years back turns out he had a questionable political background most of it leaning left we don't talk about that much\nAbout what we do is we always end by we I mean\nThe legacy media the legacy media always homes in on if there is an angle that will expose the person with somebody on the right Terry you'll recall I'm guessing that when the the bad guy in Aurora, Colorado shut up that movie theatre mhm\nYou'll recall that uh Brian Ross who's now been just excommunicated from ABC News although he's doing now um but he reported that there was a person with the same name registered as part of a Colorado Tea Party group\nI Do remember that was that the right guy no one's not\nBut of course it when he makes the connection this is a little CSI online makes the connection instead of verifying it finding out that the guy that he found who had a\nA similar name where are the same name was Thirty years older maybe he could have thought himself you know Brian if you're if you have any integrity and ... and ... as a reporter you won't report that it could be this guy because you know it's not\nThere's a there's an age discrepancy\nBut instead it's easier to just go with it I think the good lord I think the authorities forgetting this potential bad guy off the street he's got a questionable background he was a manager for chip and Dell dancers or something that's not necessarily very conservative thing to do um\nBut even if you were the most through and through Trump supporter you can find\nThere is nothing about what the president says does or or alleges or or pushes that would make a Trump supporter do horrible things attempting to kill people\nThere just is no connection there I mean there there was an attempt here to make a connection that doesn't exist\nAnd when the president comes out and says let's stay together and what we eat together as one is it galvanizes America we can overcome things like this and it was good the bad guy off the streets and thank God they got him he they used to be mocked for that too so at some point we have to realize that the left\nDoesn't want to get along with the right the left doesn't want\nTo see this guy in the White House as a human being that isn't telling people to go blow up members of Congress are former presidents\nThat just isn't who he is but I guess it gets ratings I guess it gets viewers I guess it gets the numbers that they need to sustain themselves 'cause this really this is about reality this is about the media not doing what the job is supposed to be\nWe're going to Megan Kelly is well I sent out a a an open commenter on Twitter today saying you're never going to be accepted by NBC News you should have known that going in good for you you got a

you and I discussed it do you think what you said was racist\nAnd no I don't think that I don't think I don't think she meant and it's that way certainly\nI don't think she ever said the term black face\nShe said why people aren't allowed to to to do a dark and their skin black people are allowed to white near skin um and I don't understand why you're impersonating somebody you're going on in a while we can cost to\nI don't think she ever is an by the way it's being reported by the far left you know outlets that she said black faces okay no she said both times you brought it up she said lightning or darkening is questionable I'm Wondering why it is\nI think it's a valid conversation in fact we had the conversation about it that afternoon it is it eight nine four one packs Joe ... dot

back the house ways and Means Committee chaired the Republican from district date's great state of Texas is Kevin Kevin how are you\nA good joke thanks for having me on you know what what an incredible time we're living in right now want to get it to the incredible\nSuccession the positivity that came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today a first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI shows was this idiot but sent out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what are you from yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police law enforcement work obviously these guys had a history\nOf uh of problems you have a ... and in sending in in threatening to blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do know this is a person that frankly um and I don't know what to greet how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know had like a lawn right\nLet me pick toward they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it I get it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these ... and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and and you know I I took a\n... advice early on and he said you know so much stopped talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady the house ways and Means Committee chair ... one last thing on that\nUm ... is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling him a demographer bomber they're calling you up or how good bomber speak to people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice and almost killed these college they didn't call him a senior shooter or so why is there a double standard here\nAnd there is and I'll tell you a jot play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only a few minutes no in fact the coach\nBatting practice or apt I took some a swing city one takes some ground or as a second I looked out\nThe was take them is now I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about four minutes ahead of the shootings so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is\nAll the blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often um are silent when you hear Hillary Clinton urged instability or Maxine wandering Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder I mean ... we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens\nThey made it happen I mean we we'd like to see them tamped down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since our bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to blame the guy that did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know it is the the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right for some people you write criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for our security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the region a librarian and he's the executive director there\nAnd we were comparing and contrasting with this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished in the fact is thirty five forty years later the media looks back at ... lovingly and and they didn't love and back then\nUm and and they're treating from horribly and basically they've got about the same record insect the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it's it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point well thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that to ... the economy for decades in ignited prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half\nReally and then you put on top of that this amazing a record in the courts of a constitutional judges from the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success you have to\nYou again is never going to get them a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair or the the success that we're seeing was fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you your jaw I Want to come on but I only been two minutes or ... you were like you you're", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "city": "Boston", "day": "27"}
