I I agree with probably Ninety nine plus percent of what you're saying I like it or listen to listen to see all the time thank you I you know you talk about a lot a lot about Robert Francis versus ten yeah\nAnd you know last hour you talked about all this funding coming in from outside the state yeah have you ever look that are examined gr questioned the seventeenth amendment to the constitution\nThe seventeenth amendment as the amendment that says two senators from each state and bill served six year term so what do I what do I need to examine about it\nWell it it dropped it down to the popular vote as opposed to the state legislature right voting for the senators so what it did was I was in a sense as a centrally like if we were to remove the electoral college right\nWhen we have this thing state legislature voting for the senators than it was representative of the entire state\nOr the ... every corner of the state was represented equally based on population centers and the delegates if you will you know that they have and it would completely eliminate the entire campaign it would completely eliminate all of this outside funding\nWhile when I went to respectfully disagree with you bill because actually this is exactly how the electoral college works in Texas the electorate the electoral vote as part of the popular vote the popular vote in Texas in each individual states besides how many electoral college votes goes to the winner\nUm and that's it's right actually a popular a a popularity contest per state so that's what it is for Senate I mean how would how would you break it down even further I understand what you're doing nothing and I understand there's not a bucket to hold on hold on hold on ... ... talk I understand that's not a popular vote for the entire nation like 'em because Hillary Clinton would have won the electoral college\nEnsures that the popular vote of each individual state gives that state of voice in the election go ahead I'm listening\nYeah absolutely and all I was doing was was comparing it to the electoral college yeah is in the state we had the state legislature which just voted on and represented equally either populations state it is the representatives in in the legislature voting for the senators\nBut I don't I I Would rather I Would rather I have a direct voice let's say that we send somebody to represent us and you and I live in the same community and were not happy with the job he or she is doing we still have a voice and making sure that the person that represents our state\nOr in the Senate we still have a voice in that race I I kind of like it the way it is now so you would you would change if you take our vote away from being able to put either O'Rourke or or cruise back into the job you would actually trust our state legislature to do it\nYes I Would because our voters towards the delegate its a representative republic as opposed to a democracy\nNo no no I agree and it's a representative republic but everybody who you know I agree with you I animals at a time and I'm Sorry for interrupting but it's a representative republic in which we get to vote every two years on something so I mean we're not giving up every right we have to to take part in this representative Republican I I kind of like do we get to vote\nOn the senators but that's just me bill disagrees gotta hit a break we're going to go on TV were back on Monday we continue on radio\n... yeah\nLove tell you about relief factor you know aches and pains can slow you down could stop you

all eat no I'm a guy\nWho's for lower regulations lower rules lower control\nLess control from central government that's the way I Believe like I Believe if you're a proprietor of a business you should be able to allow smoking if you want now I don't smoke\nI use I quit smoking back to Ninety six I I don't smoke don't care to smoke not going to smoke and if you allow smoking in your business I guess what I'm not going to go there\nRight but I truly believe that you as a proprietor of the business\nHave the right to say smoking's allowed no I Believe the government should should insist that you put a sign out front that says this is a smoking establishment or this is a nonsmoker yourselves ... that makes sense to me that's as far as regulation should go but all of these regulations and all these cities now so you can't smoke inside\nI don't think that the city should have regulated that cigarettes are available at every corner store\nIf they're so bad banned the sale of them will be a black market I Can't believe you're saying ... know what I'm saying is there'll be a hypocrite you've got assumed tax you've got all the the cessation programs paid for by cigarette companies you're telling me businesses you can allow smoking\nAgain if you offer a nonsmoking environment my family and I will go if you offer a smoking environment we want\nIt it should be the capitalistic way it should be the free enterprise way that the market decides whether you survivor not end of that business that allows for smoking is not surviving perhaps they stop allowing smoking and then they see if there's a change in their business that's the way it should go I don't want the government to regulate how much salt can be my stuff\nI don't want to regulate how much trans fat can be in something only regulate anything as long as I'm informed that makes sense carry\nMakes perfect sense\nSo you go shopping for for the family or Mario does whomever hide it and you you're going to look at the labels because the government says you've got to put on the label what's in the stuff mhm\nAnd yes I'll take that much federal take that many cars that much sugar or whatever or you make a conscious decision as the consumer what you're going to feed your family ... I don't want the government to say you may not sell that stuff anymore because look if I Want to sell a bowl of fat\nAnd somebody wants to buy it I should be allowed to ...\nIsland N.Y and yet how you doing Joe ... fat\n[laughter] did you have a little flavor put some bacon in it you know what I mean if if people are buying it I should have the right to sell it and yes I'm at the at the end of the day we're seeing in the United kingdom we don't have a whole lot of times we should probably just say the u._k.\n... character you know I don't even ...

of the the national\nPolitics right now and what what the cabinet debacle did\nEither for or against the Democrats for or against the Republicans it's an interesting conversation we also have in this

in and also what can we do to continue to urge people to leave the Democrat plantation and think for themselves so we talked about that as well it's a eight eight eight nine four one packs Joe ... dot com\nThe top story on drudge\nIs um is is Robert Francis O'Rourke raising a bunch of money you see this I didn't want\nTop top story trending on drudge nationally is that they're calling it they told me I guess a play on beetles media\nBut um I guess you raise thirty million dollars in the past few months wow learn a million dollars in the past few months and a lot of change can you imagine raising that kinda money and you're still gonna lose by double digits I mean I think than\nThe later Robert Grant says oh I couldn't do pit Quinnipiac poll I saw a day and cruise up by nine\nYeah and and as these polls come out the the the leaders widening but cruising going to slow down\n... is is not going to sit back on his laurels he's not going to pretend like he's got it in the bag he's gonna keep on doing it and and they're gonna debate soon or four days from now here in San Antonio\nI'm is going to be moderated by several for gunny the morning anchor over on Ken's five a very good reporter very unbiased person I think we she's going to do a great job I'm so it's going to be interesting to watch but the commercials that I see pop up on television you nationally aren't seeing these but we do you guys know who this guy is because\nElon has a monitor the Late Show has among so you're aware of him many call him the Hispanic Robert Kennedy which makes no sense 'cause he's not Hispanic\nAnd be even see the Robert Kennedy likeness but um this guy is he's doing he's trying to do what Obama did no wait\nYou know where to gather and diversity and that's our strength well the truth is\nThis guy somebody who said he's open to abolishing eyes he's a guy I've got a piece of video that I saw yesterday where you literally says just in some discussion about something different that the United states stole half of Mexico recently we we just stole it from\nKerry I guess we went to Mexico and said screw you were taking Texas Texas how came to United States happened\nYet what what happened was for those who don't know and and you don't learn the Texas history wherever you happen to be Texas was part of Mexico\nTexas was treated so horribly and felt like they wanted freedom and liberty that Texas actually seceded from Mexico on its own and became an independent republic later Texas agreed to be annexed by the United states steel anything what are you talking about we're talking about\nSanta Ana screwed that up we didn't do anything\nBut but that though raises a bunch of money doesn't seem to understand that\nAnd he's got this ... it's a really strange month for about how police are looking to kill the black people about how uh ice is no good and we shouldn't have any borders and that we somehow stole Mexico so when you watch these stupid commercials or hear them\nWhere he goes on but we just need together and as we need to just work together Republican or Democrat I'm just down for the people of Texas He's lying he's not\nNot even close actually listen to what he's actually said you know when he when he said that the police are acting like the old Jim Crow\nReally said those words when he says that we stole half of Mexico from them he really said that\nYou know when he says he didn't try to leave the scene of a of a drunk driving accident while the guy who reported him and the police report says he did so well he can raise all the money he wants the the real deal is he's a flawed candidate who's lying in these ads but just a little bit under the surface you can find out exactly what the guy is\nSo it's an interesting story I was going to talk about bad though was going to talk about um today\nBut there it is the top trend on drudge and I found that to be interesting and it eight nine for one pack Joe ... dot com quick breaks the
