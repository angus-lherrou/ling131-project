Texas what's going on Michael\nShow makes me appreciate what's happening so what I Want to know is why\nIs everyone in the media you everyone calling this a caravan\nAnd it ... to ... a caravan is when we all get together\nAnd we're going to be jumping our minivan and go to the Grand Canyon ... that's pretty dry\nAnd then when we come back home or go to the beach we go we go to snow ski that's called the Caribbean Europe Germany France Greece when they're when they're the influx of refugees coming in then they didn't call it a character that they called it an invasion\nOf an invasion of of of refugees but I got a solution\nIt is it is a Caribbean by definition but I understand where you're coming from what else what's the solution\nSo the solution is is that I really think this is really easy solution I got two parts first part is this and that is all you need and I'm sure you can find some very patriotic owners the truck trucking companies they show up with Eighteen wheelers and trailers\nAnd as soon as they cross the border just say here you go step right in and we're going to turn around and take it back to where you came from going to be a three hour for our trip and we're going to give you an hour east eat your water to drink will stop her potty break and then just dropped off where you came from or\nAnother way of doing this to we can send him to Canada\nAnd let them deal with the situation if there [noise] um\nWell it wouldn't be a ... hour trip but not really sure where you get ... miles but go ahead\nBut the point is just send them back where they came from and if it's done very ... very humanely no one's going to get hurt you know they're going to be taken care of and they're going to be sent back to where they came from and then they can apply to any of the nine plus locations and Mexico to apply for us\nAnd it has been a lot of locations on the way here that they could have stopped at him and applied to come in legally I'm with you I think we should be turned away I big Mexico should have to step up\nAnd they allow them in Mexico should have to step up and take care of him and then help them migrate back to their homes or they want to come here legally there there are certainly ways to do that Michael I appreciate you you're right I mean we shouldn't just sit idly by I don't think we should set up a bunch of ... them get back on him like that idea but\nBut the fact is they shouldn't come in they're not here yet they shouldn't be able to just break through the border because they feel like it but I'm saying that it's not\nDefinition wiser caravan it is a social horde of people it's a battle of ... were you want to see a group of invaders that's fine but saying that it's not a Caribbean in some of its was no words no true let me go back at it and say Hi to um Bruce and Boston roof will be a legitimate and make it happen let's go\nI it's like a Trojan Horse it because it's a Trojan Horse and what are they well they do all the toilet paper trail it paid off\nBut the whole thing of it is they shouldn't be yeah they shouldn't be allowed in there and where where well I I'm I'm I'm two thousand miles at greater away you know and I'm afraid it for everybody that ship between me and them and that kind of like for me I Want them gone Joe\nI got you know Bruce I'm bound listen I I agree you every call because I think that's a sign of affection Boston nowhere because they they should not make it here they should be stopped before they get here and yes we have a legal legitimate border that we have every right

I Believe in open borders I don't believe that we have any sovereignty I Believe that that Louis Farrakhan the good guys hang out with them why does that person have any chance in the United states of America so I've got people on the phone lines you want to talk about let me let me add this to it\nThis is true right the president the other day said he's a nationalist them much went nuts\nAnd that is true yes by definition do you know what a nationalist is [noise] uh someone who's loyal devoted to their\nCountry and do all kinds of errors yeah that's the reason they believe in their nation\nKnow it used to be the one we go to the Olympics and I don't even know that it's this ferocious anymore but it used to be that there would be allowed to change the matter where on the global was happening there will be loud chance of usa usa usa people will be holding up the United states flag the stars and stripes they would do that because of their pride in country\nSomehow the left has convinced beep\nOh then if you say nationalism or your nationalist you're a bad guy and that means that you're\nSomehow white supremacist somehow you hated the Hitler white man right now are in fact Hitler yeah ... right so for me\nWe just listened words have definitions it's illegal alien\nDoor does not mean extraterrestrial extra terrestrial literally means away from this way and away from the earth like in radio we say you've got satellite radio you've got Internet radio you got terrestrial radio terrestrial radio is radio it's actually emanating from the ground here on earth\nExtraterrestrial means your ... your ... uh being from\nOutside of his globe outside of this planet saying that somebody is an alien just means they're not from where they are right now okay it's not that hard\nIllegal alien has a a very very simple definition you're alien to where you are you're a foreign person where you are now you're not from the place that you know our\n... and you got here illegally Syria legal person who did that saying that it's immigration it's not immigration it's illegal immigration those you do it are illegal aliens nationalism is very easily define you believe in the nation you say America First you say Americans first when I say America First\nI'm not saying white America First or black America first of all there are a lot of people below ... black America first are there are a lot of people who lack mold F ... the race that don't change their name to something else but that's who they are um they believe in and Latino or Hispanic first\nThere are people who believe him their identity politics first\nI Believe like the president believes and nationalism I Believe in America first\nAnd Americans first that means Americans no matter what your shade or hue is no matter what your course does have hair is or isn't no matter what your your your facial\nFeatures are or whatever fill in the blank identifying mark you might have\nI Believe in this country first I Love the United states of America I Love our national anthem I Love our flag I Love our military I Believe in this land\nIs really very very simple okay\nSo the bottom line is\nIf I say I'm a nationalist and you find something negative\nYou're the problem if I say I'm a nationalist I Believe in this country and you somehow try to make that a ... year the problem if you put a racial connotation in something that does not have a racial content your the problem okay\nGet that through your head the media the fake news media cause real media doesn't doesn't do things like this but the fake news media that would make hay out of somebody saying he's a nationalist and pretended some negative in a horrible thing and it means that you're anti fill in the\nBook there the problem so what we need to do\nLike like Megan Kelly apologize suited for the whole black face thing which again I don't understand because you never really said blackface she just said changes your skin tone um to better look like the person you're you're trying to look like on Halloween she apologizes emotional apology to be sick\nBecause New York and LA potentially and her bosses all freaked out so she thought the entire nation freaked out we didn't the entire nation understands that you're trying to look like somebody on Halloween costume the entire nation understands nationalism is a good thing and it's a positive thing for all people in this country\nDoesn't matter that New York and LA in Chicago and a few others have a different feeling that doesn't matter they're allowed to have that opinion but they don't get to reset a definition they don't get to read to find words redefined phrases they don't get to do that\nAnd I'm just about fed up with a sort of a present that as well we'll
