O. J. Lansing, Michigan\nAnd on veterans' day I sent her out to go interview a I'm a guy who said he he was a recipient of a medal of honor language group started writing hustling goes that covers the story gets it done makes it happen comes back she's she's thrilled\nManaged as a great story man this story takes a\nJoke you got a new source of watching ... editing the story in in the booth\nAnd I said well we'll show me the money shot well let me see let me see the metal mhm oh well he doesn't have it why does any habit he said he lost it in a fire I so I'm sure that they would have issued them another one yeah well he didn't have it I said well\nLet's find out if he actually got the medal of honor\nAnd we do some research on line and back then and this was Twenty years ago probably\nA while I Know that you'd have as many resources but we could go to sort of a a directory of people who had been awarded the medal of honor over the years and this guy's name is on it so I said you know what I call the Pentagon actually call the Pentagon\nAnd she did we were not able to verify that she was a recipient of the medal of honor\nAnd later we're pretty sure we found out that it was sort of a stolen valor thing with the guy ... either had dimension Saudi gotten it or just as making up his whole life and you're sort of sticking to his story\nSo she did this great piece of work to a group of five or six hours to go out there shoot the thing and we have a woman bans back then and been edited ... voice tracking it had me chicken ... and we did not run the story in the eleven o'clock News Good and it was great\nThe way she but she was like what can we just run it and then afterwards say hey we couldn't verify that he actually was a recipient but it's a good story for Veterans Day and nature was man that sucks but no we can't\nWe just can't and she understood and she was a trooper about it but that's what NBC News should have done\nAnd what do you know what how beneficial would have been for the viewership in for their believability in their credibility and they said listen we did a story of this world who claimed she was sexually assaulted or in rape trains or something a\nAt a at these parties with Brett Kavanaugh and we were not able to verify or corroborate anything she said in fact your story changed so much than we used a news organization\nFounded necessary to drop the story that would have been better no\nYes absolutely I mean now anybody can come forward anybody I don't have any evidence I don't have any witnesses the here's my store and got the ... will say that Iraq and they run with it thinking that well and that's me the truth that he's dead and that may later\nAnd later they'll just that we're going to go ahead and retract that\nYou know and I we don't really want to know that there's a ...

on the merits now let's go back and find out who he ... you know it might have stopped the auto of back when he was fourteen now the guy drew a piece of advice allegedly somebody at a bar after you be

they're not going to you that is his head that they oppose anybody that Donald Trump nominates like Japan court are certainly not going to\nFind their way to supporting judge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen [noise] certainly not after the cast and I they demanded to happen and say they should just be honest about what this says about the strike destroying a man's life\nBecause he's he's was nominated by Donald Trump this is about the laying and keeping that seat open in passing the terms of not three twenty twenty and America has had it\nAmericans are smart and they're watching this process\nPeople are disgusted by the process Christine Blasey Ford has Dianne Feinstein a Democrat due to blame that she is now a household name recognizable everywhere because they're the ones who smoked out her identity she asked to remain anonymous they did it by sitting on it by dropping it and after the twelve hour had told and\nBut for the Republicans bloody Ford may not have ever had a forum to testify under oath it's the Senate committee and the majority of the other Republicans they gave her that um but you're right they're talking about ice and beer this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the process of\nFolks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six\nVetting on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed this last July which is on the desk of every senator so we'll see what happens but if you're if you're a few of those red state Democrats Joe pads you're really nervous today because you're caught between a on one hand your Democratic Party drifting so far to the left towards socialism and\nToward destruction and resistant an obstruction and delay and and and stop sign as a symbol of your party\nAnd you're stuck between that and the will of your own people right\nBecause West Virginians and and and who's yours in Indiana and certainly people in North Dakota now spread they want judge Kavanaugh confirmed and they want their senators to do their jobs advising contending in voting for him\nIt's our tells the president Kellyanne Conway till you do you think that there should be ethics committee I'm I'm an investigation into Feinstein or whoever on her staff leak that out she said on this for two months she could have talked to tell them about a directly when they met privately she could've brought it to the president's shoes you got the letter you're right she sat on her because she hoped to do would be him down on the merits\nThey couldn't the guy is supremely\nQualified to be most jobs are going to be an investigation should there be\nWell I saw some members say that they were going to investigate it I saw Senator Tom cotton last week and say that very thing that they should investigate the leak of the of the letter\nAnd uh the other thing that's happening as Senator Hatch made reference I Believe it was yesterday Joe to the to the odd consequences that couldn't follow to Ford's lawyers who either\nNeglected to mention to her\nWhich was their their duty they mentioned it to Ford that she had an opportunity to testify under oath privately and in California\nBut ever having a kind of washing either foreign lied under oath that she didn't know that or her lawyers failed to tell her and it's fair to tell us you know there are no cameras and cleaned lights\nAnd private testimony in California there's no Washington based obsessive media right to take to go and cover every jot until and the new client base for them afterward so that there are many things that could be investigated long after the vote for his confirmation happens\nIs the government is you're going to happen to your your bed is he's going to get confirmed Lindsey Graham says if he's not re nominated him yes I did see that\nSo leader McConnell said he's ... he's going to have a vote and this man will be voted on people that pose and oppose him but have the guts to say why don't pretend it's about X Y and Z when you've already said you're going to pose any of Donald Trump's nominees from the beginning I wanted to mention for all the talk about how energize\nThe liberals are and they're watching in suburban women I suburban women are smart enough to know that they are benefiting from an incredible economic boom market\nThat didn't happen by coincidence that happen through causation his name is Donald Trump even we haven't found one Democrat now who is trying to applaud the ... his name is Brock Obama President Obama is trying to take credit for it so he didn't get the talking points as Democrats but to say but the economy is not that great he's saying it's so great I'm taking credit for it but these suburban women also\nShould look at this process and they should say\nI'm so much is going right but I also I also I'm so disgusted that\nPeople um hurt this woman used it in line for their own political grandstanding purposes and the case of a few of them up and the Senate Judiciary committee to actually raise money for their twenty twenty elections they injected politics and what should be a decidedly non political\nProcess here and yes I think it will be investigated after the fact\nAnd and I think that people will be very upset about this for a long time to come to folks are watching and for all the talk about liberal excitement look at their ratings at the Fox news primetime lineup last Thursday after the testimonies over five million per show that pizza that'd be the um the daytime shows\nThe morning shows for the networks want to you had us over three hundred thousand lakes\nOf the ... to the president's tweet about Brett Kavanaugh just twenty four hours later\nThat's a very high number of like for a presidential tweet so people are energized or watching a lot of voters out there say they'll let let this one slip through don't given to to the mob mentality of of the minority in the Senate who doesn't have enough votes to stop this man\nI I I Know you're going to go one last quick one would have been refreshing to Leon had anybody on the on the left on that panel the Judiciary Committee been questioned by somebody in the media one simple question if he comes back squeaky clean from the FBI investigation you wanted will you vote for him when he was only when I go to watch and you\nAnd I am in prison that question hypothetically you're it's a great question right\nOn and remember I Want to say something else so Ford and cabinet under oath but none of the senators were they just ask and say whatever the heck they want 'em but you're right what would change because they never thought look they never thought\nThat uh that the Senate Judiciary committee would give for an opportunity to testify they did in fact they accommodated to bend over backwards to accommodate her\nHer laundry list of demands a she testified ten days after she was eleven days after everybody found out who she is and that would be eleven days after Brett Kavanaugh was willing to testify number one number two\nAnd then they said well we have to do an FBI investigation they would only take four days between now and the day that there has to find so let's just do it they never thought the president would go ahead and author I authorized and say well
