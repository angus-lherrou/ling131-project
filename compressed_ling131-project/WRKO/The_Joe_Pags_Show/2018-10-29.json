{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "So we didn't we didn't even look at the signature as a volunteer or have picked up the pages last weekend and started looking at 'em and pointed out to us that there was a problem\nOh so you've got a tip from the people at from people who were actually looking at the signatures about just how bad this thing was you know that's how you\nKnow actually we had picked up a the papers because she had sent out a\nA fundraising letter which she uh\nLifted registrar beach which is the correct term for that position so we said well let's look at our papers to the if she all her nomination papers have the incorrect a term for that position but they weren't they were correct so they were just sitting at a table ... a a volunteer\nActually just picked up and started flipping through the pages and then clean it out you know there's more problems than that and then\nWe recognize some of the names that appear to be incorrectly list a written\nAnd we started calling them and the first ten people all said those are not our signatures\nThat Maria there he had turned out of town and it's a pretty good pretty high rate of uh problems [laughter] not that\nOften but when you thought and then we immediately started to pull things together that we have had concerns ever since we have a Stephanie Barry wrote an article out here describing Mr ... being a\n... in the restricted area of the courthouse and campaign uh being her campaign manager\nThis guy and he always for most people even in Springfield I don't even though they remember Frank ... this guy is the political operative who's running a Cheryl a Sherlock Coakley revere as campaign Hugh who is he's a he's a jail bird is to be\nOne thing I uh yeah he served jail time and has conducted felonies\nAnd that's why we were concerned to here he was in certain areas of the court house according to the article but other things started to come up from the campaign we're looking at the finance rate campaign finance report and uh so we realized the rules were always be followed by our opponent\nBut we never imagined we would find what we did when we picked up those papers\nOn and I don't look at my door and I'm looking at the story in the Republican it's us freight geo was remained a pope figure in local politics despite spending three years in federal prison\nFederal prison for policing a taxpayer funded homeless shelter he wants women Springfield see any relation to the hospital and family [laughter] you know\nI I don't know and I've I've never met Frank geo but uh by what you read in the paper is what I read in the paper uh when I'm very uh started to do the investigation\nShow ... I mean so what are you going to do I mean how do you I mean again this is a this is far down on the on the ballot most people you know or you know ... even sure what the register of beads does until they buy a house or how to how ... how do you get the word out to people about what's been going on in this one despite\nWhat I think the important thing is that we do start discussing that because registered the signatures ladder you can't just have an e signatures on transfer dates details and the rule of law are essential to be a position so I think even though it's tied the pat time has passed\nA we still have to discuss the fact that the rules were not followed when it was about a ... writing they nomination papers and then also it's very important for us to talk about\nThe actual but what actually happened to some people people's identities were taken their ... and those people have the right to have their some sort of resolution to that problem so that will up\nI ... will be on anything in regards to the election but we have to address both those issues and the most we can do is just start talking about it\nSo I I mean these are the are the people whose signature claim their signatures were stolen or are they going to ... are they going to seek a criminal complaints here\nOr there that's really up to them and they have standing we don't have standing in regards to that the only thing we can do is we have to ask the secretary state to do an investigation not only in what happened here\nBut also how can this not happen in the future because it was a ... the secretary state was totally local town clerk's you don't make that decision but then it wasn't being made at the secretary state it's sort of probably has to be some safeguards put into place as\nRegards the campaign where asking or\nPoll watchers to command a we feel the irregularities that came out of the uh signatures in Springfield off but\nUh will help trigger that and asking for poll watchers and unfortunately we're also asking for the recusal of the registrar or voters for this election because she is a former assistant to share a ... era\nWalk or have you challenge the coke we revere to a debate to to explain how how all these uh allegedly fraudulent signatures ended up on her nomination papers\nWhen we asked for with Asperger debate numerous times a campaign forums as she has not agree to any of that she finally had agreed to a debate which will be friday afternoon twelve thirty well into the end of the early voting period\nAnd that will be on channel twenty ... and I look forward to asking a numerous questions in regards to how she's been running her campaign from whether it to her campaign manager as to uh the campaign finance reports and then finally the issue for the signatures\nFriday twelve PM I'm ... I'm guessing I'm guessing the debate will be ending friday at one PM so you're gonna get you're going to get a whopping thirty minutes\nActually that there was no candidate ... residents don't and voters don't have a right to ask a question which is disappointing I always look for a Jew a candidate forums where we can really hear what questions\nAre Marie Marie and Julie these you're you're an attorney from long about a ... where can people go to learn more about your campaign for register the\nUh Marie M.

in\nWrongful conviction from my heart studios available now our radio\nVoice of Boston\nYou walk walking over one hundred point seven to UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station\nIs\nLeft will continue to say now is the time to talk about sensible gun legislation now's the time to talk about sensible gun laws we have to fundamentally change rather than the other yet they've never once given a valid\nIdea or what a bill should look like that show has banned assault weapons ... what\nWas that it's a weapon where you pull the trigger all the ... that's automatic will learn about weapons out here\nWhere I was semi automatic just same thing no it's not\nWell we should ban a big magazines skinhead my big old clips ... made a big clip\nWhy would you like it because you only have two boats are shooting here what does what does that go there so I'm not sure I understand that solves we should have laws that people can't get by guns anymore okay been only the bad guys ... because the good guys by them\nLegally\nDo when you talk about better background checks on people who have known criminal records or histories like the bad guy partly by promise pray I thought the promise program it's a minority you have to make sure he has a chance at life well there were Seventeen people in Parkland for now don't have a chance\nBecause of him because of the allowance of scrubbing a criminal record which should have been obvious to anybody when this guy tried to buy a gun\nSo I said I said this last hour they can get one gal oh you've got a bunch of calls but I didn't get even one called that took took my offer call and tell me what it is you're on the left your anti Second Amendment you want more gun laws what is the what is the dumb law look like\nThat solve this problem because I Want you to remember what the intent was and remains of the second amendment being tend to the second amendment is not to shoot it here it is not to take target practice be tend to the second amendment is to prevent\nAny tyrannical government to again do with England did to to the colonies to the people here to stop them from ever telling them how to worship how much taxes they were going to have to pay for tea they owe to stamp\nTaxing over and over they they went rogue and went nuts and then started telling people you don't really owners plays I Do so did you try to disarm the people and we're going to have a warrant show use boss\nAnd the people who came here came here for freedom and liberty they came here to have religious freedoms and and to be able to be in the press to report on things and to be able to\nHave a gun to prevent the government from ever over running them again read the entirety of the declaration of independence it goes very in depth as to how we're not going to have this happen again\nAnd here we are with a loud minority but a loud minority of people in this country who are going on and on and on about how the constitution is a shame to ... to the second amendment needs to be getting the to divvy take it out now they meant mosquitoes fitted mean these weapons of war weapons of war\nBetween those didn't mean those\nSo I Want to hear your thoughts I Want to hear somebody give me a valid answer and you're on the left okay we get rid of the second amendment that'll solve the problem by filling the blank or we come up with a piece of legislation of bill it looks like this well let's say\nYou're guaranteed I press the button had the bug just now mhm\nSome ... to be earlier he said if you ever wonder if people steal things from you from your show the answer is yes and then I I press plays little piece of video of some guy on the radio doing girl ... now his voice was about as deep as yours\nSo it didn't have the same effect mhm

you of course we're watching very closely what happened you know if this bird\nAnd this actually happened right before you beer on Saturday morning on my on my weekend show and we watched it throughout the day when from seven people Betty people don't know which to Lebanon you got for police officers who were shot and if you go through Twitter but you do\nUm and you start looking at how are we coming together as Americans how are we going to make sure that we we had this all over the past next time you're not seeing that except for for people like you and me what you're seeing is we need new gun laws now we need gun legislation now how many people have to die the president's some how did this and already some how did this\nWhen you see the reaction sadly we're not surprised our way\nNo Joe and you know first off I Want you know I'm like most Americans I was speechless when I heard this again on Saturday I'm tired of mass shootings\nI don't want them you know we are committed to trying to find ways and solutions and empower people to come up with solutions for themselves and that includes armed security arming or sell whatever that may be but I feel for the victims I feel for their families my heart goes out to them and I'm left with no words\nAnd then a left with discuss you know so my anger that this happens then turns to discuss when I have to turn on Sunday Morning and watch\nMainstream media blame President Trump's with this as you said again the calls and the an array of somehow responsible and then of course the calls for gun bans ... you know Joe\nEvil is walk this earth and there are evil doors that have been walking this or they will always walk among us and they have from the beginning of time right so the question becomes what are we prepared to do is a society\nTo protect ourselves from those people I Would love to live and fantasy world where we don't need armed security at every soft target gathering and yes the synagogue in in a church gathering and\nHeck your Boy Scout meeting in a soft target all these things\nWe've got to take precautions we've got to do what's right with God will empower people because I'm just tired of watching this unfold and no new gun law is going to solve the issue and you're never going to take away all the guns are the people because we have something in this country called the second amendment it's absolute and it's not going away whether they like it or not\nIt's ... years a great story at an array TV\nYou know you bring up something interesting it is a fantasy but we'd love to have this where we have to lock our doors we leave our cars running in a in a colder winter so tomorrow when we get back in we'd love to to think that we don't have to protect ourselves at all because it's all rainbows and butterflies but the fact is grant they're bad people out there doing bad things in every bit of gun legislation I've ever seen\nTries to restrict you would need the good guys and tells the bad guys continue being bad look it's against the law to kill people to synagogue it's against the law to kill people in the school or in a church or at a movie theater those laws already exist and it didn't dissuade these people from doing it the last thing we want to do is say well then we should norm ourselves either 'cause that somehow we'll make it easier\nYou know gun laws are the only set of laws that the law abiding has to worry about breaking right I don't worry about burglary\nLaws I'm not verbal arising homes I don't worry about murder I'm not murdering anybody I don't worry about robbery laws\nI don't go around from people but I Do carry my firearm on a daily basis and I worry about different cities what their regulations right they wouldn't have to walk\nInto one restaurant or I Can't walk into a bar or I Can't walk\nHere I Can't go to this state if I accidentally drive across the bridge from from Virginia in Washington DC then I'm facing a felony in Twenty years in prison right only the law abiding when it comes to gun laws are the ones that\nHave their own is not to somehow break the law I'm it's insane to me you know we have a right to protect ourselves the law abiding is not the problem that's for sure\nYeah I've often thought to myself if you're going to have a sign up and in Texas it's a thirty oh six center surreal one side if you're gonna have a sign ups and guy can't carry can protect my family my stuff my my person then you should protect me\nIf you're if you're going to have an open a combination please come in here or don't

otherwise\nWell you would hope that they would but often times what I say is ignorance from lack of knowledge\nThey're not thinking they're living in the fairy tale world that they put a sign in the
