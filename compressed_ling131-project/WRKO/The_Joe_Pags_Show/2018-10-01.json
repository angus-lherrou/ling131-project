Michael ... view reader the unauthorized biography of Kim Jong il are going to the right now if you don't have it already but what's interesting about this is most people watching and listening right

okay this year we're not going to have a dress rehearsal of invading your country on your border I mean these are very ... and if you're going to have a negotiation you have to give some each side so\nHe's still have the sanctions the pressure's still there on human rights and when you're dealing with these dogs you have to praise them you have to kiss the ring in order to get them to do what
