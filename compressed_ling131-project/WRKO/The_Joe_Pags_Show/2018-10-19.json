age young people um I I don't understand because I I Know that you really smart show your contemporaries must be pretty smart they are going to college they got to be pretty smart why are the only for the socialism garbage\nWater they think back to the truck to when all we have to do is look at Venezuela today and see how bad it is\nThe problem is that the Democrats or denigrate job with marketing in my opinion hearing something will be free sounds great sounds nice it's really I think college students especially in a lot of 'em are always short on cash so when you think about the logic behind social than\nIt sounds great getting free stuff is nice everyone on 'em and a lot of people don't go much further than that which is the problem in my opinion\nBut they know that there is no free lunch it's an old ... be cliche but\nHonestly ... they know somebody has to pay health care for a Medicare for all thirty two trillion dollars what does it come from well if I get it for free I don't care if I get free food I don't care where you just really\nThe problem is that so many students who have grown up in my generation have gone through high school have gone through college without learning the fundamental American\nGovernment and learning where money comes from and how the government on programs that they don't think that are into it I think that's really where education system has failed that and then allow groups like Democrats and socialist organization you just\nPush this idea free everything for everyone out great and they don't know the logic behind why it's going to

are it doesn't make any sense\nThen again I don't know I don't I've always ask people who think socialism is a real is a real viable option\nWhere has it ever worked and they don't have a good answer because it never has worked anywhere have you tried that if you actually had a conversation just one on one if it's in a group to yo you down and shut you down but one on one have you had a real sensible conversation with somebody who thinks this could work\nFrom my experience when I talk to people and posed that question that you have where has socialism work on something that so many Americans think in response to the socialist platform to default response that I received from my peers in college oh well it was done wrong and Venezuela or\nIt's going to do it differently and there's always just a small exception that they try to point you say\nThis is why it's going to work this time um and and once you try to point out well actually it was and pointed the way we're supposed to be implemented are in the United states where it will run into the same problems because of X Y and Z that kind of where the conversation shuts down and they don't want to hear why they're wrong\nIt it actually worked exactly like it's supposed to work in Venezuela and we'll see what the numbers it's Abigail Murrow go and check her out on a on a Twitter we follow each other is it\nAt

better hang okay that's enough on out here I live here in our own right now I can\nDo anything I Want with it [laughter] oh cocoa nut oil is absolutely I agree it's a ... now I'm more one package editing for one Seventy four seven semi might entertain a phone call or two for people who want to tell me how they would they would spend\nMoney or or something I mean maybe it's not something that has been a lot of time on I actually want to start with a with telling you who we have in the program today which other just awesome as always been our programs are always awesome today is even all summer I have not spoken with her before but uh in a ... as I could have sworn you spoke to her before [laughter]\nAnd let's say you know no that was what you said last night when I had done junior on your watch it I really think that you had had done overseas oil you wouldn't Pablo sleep through every single show\nNot every single [laughter] every single one your choice Sacramento [laughter] all the other day two nights ago did a story on our earlier [laughter] come on and so I said is that we have you know all all\nAlthough yesterday he remembered something could happen to liberate revenue didn't I Know there's something wrong with you and that was like a neurosurgeon see what's going on with the with the brand now ... book that we we have a Lara Trump on today Lara Trump she is the wife of Eric Trump\nShe's the daughter in law the president the United states that we have a great conversation about family the media how did she react when the president said before he was the president I think we would go for it and um\nOf course the midterms we've got to talk about that as well but have you seen her do interviews or like like ... in my position not being interviewed but she's ...\nI have not I didn't I didn't actually\nGood care neither I was like what the hell what's going on that and uh and I guess she used to work for a inside edition or something\nA ... named him or her father in law so that he was going to oh yeah I had no idea she was in the media but she's really good I'm like so that I was like ... stop\n... Laura Martin from the matter with you uh so yeah it's a great conversation will have it for your bottom of our number two and we also have ... she's from campus reforms which are really cool show but I Do want to get back to a story that we sort of presented at the end of the show yesterday and I asked you if we can circled back to that we will talk about the caravan of people coming here\nThat's going to be a big deal heading to the mid term it it looks like it actually losing their timing it to get here in time for the midterms mhm which is a leftist thing to do there are questions now about who's financing it who's funding it who's pushing for it\nAnd I really think the left thinks this is somehow a winning deal for them if four thousand or more\nIllegal immigrants try to break through our our border in terms of the midterm somehow it's going to help the left I have no idea how that would happen it would not help the left but I Do want to start with something off the beaten path that is not breaking news and it's not news of the day but we'll get to the news of the day of the day goes on and again make sure you can be for Lara Trump\nUm but I got to tell you the story from yesterday there was a college somewhere university somewhere who um before you graduate is requiring you take a class in learning how to act when you have contact with police and I think this is a really really good idea ... let's go back to that from yesterday ...\nActually is a high school during the blaze since high school student to ship Leno watching a video about conducting themselves around police officers if they want to graduate from high school and the taxes on mandates in high school students view and video on diffusing tensions between civilians and law enforcement\nAnd they can they say the Education Act was signed into line two thousand Seventeen and requires it all high school students watched the video tape the corresponding class on proper conduct when dealing with officers of the law during traffic stops tech state senator rice a west authored legislation in an attempt to find the expectation that law enforcement and citizens during traffic stops\nAt school seniors will not being able to graduate if they do not fill this fulfilling this requirement according to the new law\nThat video titled flashing lights utilizes reenactments that law enforcement officials in citizens engaging one another\nAnd then he includes pointer such as dumb move around to reach for anything other directives include officers don't always have a clear view into your vehicle to keep your hands visible and that the officers know if they're reaching into the consul and the training video also offers tips to educate citizens on their rights\nSo just whether they must get out of the car or a decline of an officer request to search the vehicle\nIt's also broken into four distinct parts which include the role on force meant citizens writes proper behavior and filing a complaint\nAnd the Texas commission on law enforcement produced a video and collaborated on content with the department of licensing and rank right regulation as well as the state board of education West is featured in the videos that the content was specifically designed to ensure a bond of trust between officers and citizens\nI think it's smart I Am not for more laws are not for more regulations amount for a government overreach\nBut I think this is intelligent I I actually compare this to carry you probably have this when you were in high school to pull you probably did to stand by the time you and it probably wasn't available we'll find out you guys think economics in high school did you take like personal economics\n... how to write a check yes down now I think that that's why you guys are ... style that nice about [laughter] [laughter] oh boy did you take that class in high school\nI don't think I did but I remember learning how to do that in some class I'd I'm not sure what class it was but I don't know if I was an economics class I mean I won't\nSay which daughter it is and it's not Sam [laughter]\nAnd it's not CJ it's not a day is not Mesa I won't say which daughter isn't it terrible wide but I Would have to say that this that I've got at least one daughter has no clue how you pay rent has no clue how electric gets paid ... there's no clue how the Internet works has no clue how you would they things just are\nSo am I right or wrong about those things just are you're definitely right yes they just are all the cars still goes will have the gas get in there I'm not sure what it's in there was an as\nFree as are aghast ferry at night or something and and the answer is no but I really truly an ... actually even make it more specific I think that athletes\nShould before they sounded first contract like athletes are going to make a lot of money doing it\nShould have to sit down mandatory by the NFL or a major league baseball or NBA or whichever league it is\nIt is sit them down and teach them how to manage their money ... you know give them some sort of crash course in personal economics how many people that have won the lottery do we now know or or they're just out of money on our time down there on road yeah right\nSame thing with for athletes as soon as the money train stops that's it they're out of money they were making ten million a year it doesn't make any sense so we should have that sort of class that sort of a a\nIt's almost a rite of passage in life on some level of education before you leave this is the future what if he tried to write a check in the future when they ask what is the first lesson security mean well how do you get gas in the car how does the Internet where I think we need a basic course on\nLiving life and how things work but I mean they're leaving thing here with the police but\nDoesn't even matter anymore about checks though I mean there's nobody really uses checks anymore I Know that people can still take tax\nBut one of the world class polo would be a check card or a card that is that it's associated with a bank account yes and again I won't say which daughter [noise] but I've got at least one that believes it's unlimited\n[laughter] and and you know what I think they should also show or teach kids how to shop grocery shop\nI couldn't agree more because somehow they're always groceries in the house right 'cause there's a groceries or grocery ferry that comes at three o'clock in the last ... and fills up the the the ... century and the refrigerator\nIt to me I just think that these are basic things that we sometimes take for granted so exactly the same way with police when I get pulled over by a police officer which rarely ever happens\nOr don't lie to the people you say you worry about them do not lie\nIn the last time the guy clearly that's probably the more you have this morning\nDo have to say a loan officer Smith [laughter] Minnesota safe out there wasn't this morning but um\nI've been pulled over by police and I'm more times than not don't get the citation and not because they know who I Am or something like that to be some animal and I have to be double mhm and I just never ever done it you know just to let you know pass on the radio\nGrade gray gray follow me now gray gray or a\nGrandmother who would have been a Native American Indian part
