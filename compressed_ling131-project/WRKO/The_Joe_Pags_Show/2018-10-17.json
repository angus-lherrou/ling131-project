R. J. O. there in Boston\nAnd what are you know of Elizabeth Warren is actually just choose the Trump doesn't like tax cuts wants more regulation but I'll be honest with you Jeff I've never heard her say a word about the needs of the people of Massachusetts I mean that's kind of weird is it is\nIt's a little strange here in Massachusetts I don't know if you know but the fishing industry is a pretty important thing in the city of New Bedford the richest ... in the United states and city councils asked for times via letter if she would help intervene on getting a a ground fishing the sector nine forty federal fishing licenses moved already buyer she has not intervened to help them at all\nAnd Joe you probably heard this when she called the entire criminal justice system racist from front to back which is there and meet the endorsement of law enforcement whether it was a ... a and also the Boston patrolman union\nThey've never endorsed a Republican for US Senate before and they are involved in this race because Elizabeth Warren clearly does not have the backs of law enforcement and she called for the elimination of ice\n... which again doesn't make any sense so she just coming out ... ... to a beach Trump's used probably running for president not really sure why she's empire law enforcement's use for open borders I mean I remember when she went down to the border and somebody else or a question wasn't even on like Fox News max it was on a left leaning network where they said well\nWhat about this case in Iowa where this for young woman was killed by illegal aliens you said but what about the mothers and the baby's she just seems to be disconnected from reality Jeff and again I don't live in Massachusetts but I'm not affected by what she does in Washington other\nThan anytime I see her face each to complain about a Supreme Court justice reach it seems to be something where she's always on the national stage and she she\nIs that her message is one that will resonate well in Massachusetts you've got a pretty good chance\nYeah I Do and like I'll tell you uh when she made that comment about Mali tip it's a and the fact that it was really people at the border that where the real problem\nAh and then being separated from their families Maureen Maloney a woman who lost her son Matthew Denise to an illegal immigrant who had a driven him or he was dragged into the vehicle till into his death\nAh about ten years ago you know worrying Maloney was separated permanently from her son would not meet with Elizabeth Elizabeth Warren would not meet with her that's how bad Elizabeth Warren is\nTo the constituents here in the state of veteran from Wall it took a hundred and Thirteen Days before she returned to call to him and it made national news so yeah she really has been more focused on the national scene right at all about Massachusetts and for me I have a record of serving in the legislature here for eight years I've actually\nProduced eight to ... billion dollar tax cut for the people of Massachusetts when we stopped the gas tax from being index to go up every year without a vote or with her she's more about selling books he's written to about herself she had one point six million dollars in the process and again she seems to be more focused on the White House than the houses of people here in our state\nIt is or Jeff deal it's G.

mean what's actually happening is it it appears to be he's just fighting back reasons at the same woman who's willing to describe his junk and again I Can't call junk and I am I allowed to call the junk or not\nNo I'd say now mhm like that word\nSo this is this is the same guy or the same woman who\nOn with or was it interesting Cooper and she looked like you know there's something going on with her her eyes were so dilated there were so huge the later said she was a cold medication or something which I'm not so sure that we do that to your eyeballs this is the woman it's still basically to see the nightclubs and and she's dancing using\nHis name and his fame to get people to go there and everybody keeps them showing up on these cable news channels talking about how we might run for president or something so I mean for me it just I don't understand why it's a problem and he named calls her back\nI mean ... he's been calling him every name in the book since day one but really do on appeal it back further than that the media is recalling him every name in the book since day one every name of the book\nAnd then they called him everything you'd from Cheetos to to fake bank to 'em from Port drop whatever they'll recalling instead of Trump calling him a or a woman abuse or a sexual assault or they're called this guy everything he calls her horse race and which by by the way I don't think she's got a horse race\nInterfaces reasonably attractive\nAnd one of the rest of the road just saying her face the reason I don't see or do you use the worst face their\nMind in hot and so but I mean\nIs he allowed to be a child and fight back I guess I mean not like he's going to stop because we used to say so in fact they do talk to Eric Trump about horse race\nDirty the guy said the word Horst face to him I'm sure you did he yes do you think it said Pocahontas to him a yes influencing them in ten years ago with yes so now ...\nAwesome excellent\nSo we do we go there we go to the economy would go to the midterms we go to I'm Ted Cruz versus bad though they're doing their big debate tonight in San Antonio I'm not going to the debate carry because they care about the people

I Love your energy I Love her energy going into the mid term we're very very\nClose to it um it looked like it was gonna be a blue wave what you're getting to me sounds like a ... for some real blue wave some stupid but now we're starting to look like the red or the conservatives or the American traditional values people are so mad about Kavanaugh so mad about the lives about the economy\nThat they might just go out and vote how are you feeling going in there\nYou go if you look at a rally or trumped up yeah these are not people that were coming out for\nYou know John McCain presidential rally or American Army rally this is a whole different swath of the American occupation loves Donald Trump because he's ... well yeah and some of the country one rally you know supporters\nTo make sure they know he's actually on the ballot this fall because if we lose Democrats are going to go after the end it's out of reach them in Turkish comments that number one number two\nWe didn't like in Wisconsin and I think across the country or what Democrats were doing the judge John I'm In fact that you have allegations that are substantiate and they want a conviction without any proof of people don't like to be on that show what I've seen is\nPeople especially my part of the country or the central rural Wisconsin yeah they don't like ah they don't like the protests there like you know what you're paying down the doors of the Supreme Court you're you know you're running after\nOld senators you know in the you know in the capital I'm lucky bay that's all you let's blow up a lot she's each other down an NBA so clearly\nThey hate that and because the left is behaving so poorly in the swing areas\nAnd I think this rural part that might have slum Democrat is not kicking back our way which gives us a great opportunity to win not just keep studying pick up seats in the Senate but\nI Would agree with you and it's interesting the president is on the ballot vis a vis a vis both in two weeks the next month this mid term um because of the house does go to the left suddenly he can't do he wanted to do and started impeachment process to use which\nThey don't make any sense any way the Senate will do anything with them anyway but it's a way to to sort of feed the animals that is the media\nUm you're right though I mean I had known and explain like that before people like this didn't show up for McCain and for Romney\nThey're showing up their their their driving hundreds if not thousands of miles to go impact these arenas and have been tens of thousands of people outside as well there really are energizes the media just ignoring it or\nOr is it something that I guess they probably are dumb question what are the ignoring it or or do they hate it when they see it so so they're just not reporting it as much\nI I I don't think they see it so I think this is a a a recent phenomenon of several weeks they don't see that saw ship\nThat is happening um and by the way the media stock\nYou know in New York and in California so the middle America has a huge thing in in how we rule in DC they're not part of it and so there you know they want to talk about stormy\nDaniels in the president's treating weren't Russia and they want to talk about Kevin on you know allegations in thirty six years ago yeah they're not seeing going on and real American by the way the policies that you know you know we implement which we talk with all the time do we\nBelieve in limited government conservatism which is you know limited rules regulations lower taxes strong military it works and our people aren't going back to work with better wages\nReally America loves that and Democrats what's the alternative\nHeard of this I Want to protest I Want to burn American flag and want to punish people who disagree with me but if you're talking about how do you make my life better than zero ideas and you know they used to be the party of JFK ... what's your country can do for you but what you can do if you're a country remember that or you\nKnow talk that or I'm darn JFK was there to lower taxes and and a strong military\nThis Democrat Party is a bunch of left wing radical socialist who have nothing to do with the Democrat Party of all\nTheir lives and\nUm you know blue collar Americans who put their butts in everyday go to work and build this country and make a great\nI could not agree with you more Sean Duffy district several Republican the great state of Wisconsin I'm the midterms are coming up I think you're right I Know you're right about the left today the message really is let's let's talk about abolishing ice let's open the borders let's give away everything we Kevin trade wet some let's impeach the president impeached justice Kavanaugh\nBut because we're enjoying what you have done with the president's done when it comes to the economy\nThat really can Lois to sleep with my bank account is fine my four one K. is looking good we can go out to eat once a week

I guess they're not paying attention to to see when you are watching football or ju yeah but I don't pay attention when they're like doing that the ... those things well I've never seen a clock on the side anywhere weren't showing you know like a countdown\n... ... and the debate format I think you probably would need that you probably would need a chant\n... every answer right than well money's going along yeah doing doing yeah\nI think it will just have a nice day is it baseball or is it the NBA one of them I think actually does have like a clock I Can't remember which one it was a baseball\nI don't I think you're right there is a clock at it they can't decide they just let the the place than I think\nUh but they're also very limited challenges in baseball\nBut uh I I don't know I there's got to be a better way than just allowing somebody just a lawyer but his own record just a lie about how his mother voted just to lie about offense or a wall not working I'm a ... or whatever even Cruz lied about what you didn't so I mean to me that would make it much more exciting and I think even younger people would start watching\nA ... that's interesting to let me go to the phone lines and I I Would like to know exactly how you would like to see debates improve because we've got a big interest now\nNot just in this debate but in debates around the country we had a lot of interest in some the Seventeen or Eighteen Republicans that were running for the Republican nomination back in two thousand sixteen people now are making it I mean it really is appointment television though isn't it carry\nI Would have said yeah a lot of people are a lot more engaged and they were a few years ago\nI mean people in my family who have never cared about debate charges that debate tonight mhm what's your guess back to this let me go to the phone lines to see what you think about this Joe Hi what's going on\n[noise] hello Hey Joe oh yeah that was calling the reason though the color of the you know I like to challenge that yet but I think a bonus round or the best that doesn't make up the debate unit\n[noise] I don't know what's going on a deal with your kids or something right what's going on okay can you hear me now\nI can yeah your phone cut out so you said a bone of ground to sort of a bonus around what it'd be bonus round or bonus time like give it a cruise or something who knows maybe gets an extra ten ... ten seconds or thirty seconds or what\nNo I'm saying are having fact checkers check the information and then at the end of the debate after uh\nEverything's going wrapped up at the end you can have a bonus round with the fact checker hook on mountain state you said you didn't vote for that tax increase uh ten dollars a barrel but we reviewed it and your vote that show that ... that\nAre in fact vote for that policy could you please confirming your stance or whether or not you did or not\nIt would give the candidates have to you know you've been fact checked and and allow to respond to that\nUh I I Wonder what his response would be I'd like to see just be uncomfortable moment it'd be like are well I ... well they say about point\nExactly and that's what you like a character you know when somebody's ... somebody presented with the fact\nHow to respond and it's it's from a third party it's not from the opponent the opponent can say everything till the cows come home and then debate they're gonna they're not they're going to say whatever they got to say to get to make themselves look at\nAs far as the winning the debate I didn't think that I I'm actually a ... supporter but I didn't want to debate on I don't think anybody really separated themselves\nUm he's not going to make the five nine points up with the with the debate ... presentation he he gave I think in ... knock out I think he swung and missed like ... like the wrong opportunity\nWell I think he did too but but let me just let me just question you on that because you sound like a really smart dude I mean ... if you think that it was sort of an even debate and and and I walked in winning it enough room for you to think these can you can overcome the five to nine points I hear you I get you and I think what you said makes sense but let me ask you very directly when he said\nThat a wall or offense won't weren't going to use El Paso as the example\nThat made him look like a lawyer when he said he didn't do the ten dollar per barrel oil thing and we know that he did that made him a liar and nobody called Ted Cruz ally or when he actually said somebody that was factually correct that made him look kind of dumb\nOr so I mean what is it about him that that makes you think I'd like to support this guy to bad he's not going to win because she had me he really did horribly last night for you to be a big supporter and still think that it was an even debate that means that I'm probably right he lost but go ahead\nWe all know that politicians while the debate do help ... you know politicking running a government in the country isn't just about winning debates agreed and it's about policy yeah so I think even though he's a poor debater doesn't mean I think you'll be or a policymaker\nI mean that you would call it how do you feel like I'm listening I really am I I really want to do with policies below I\nI'm a I'm a registered nurse I'm actually a nurse practitioners church and in fact is due to the fact that our population is so unhealthy by the time they're sixty five and getting for us to case manager right they have inadequate care\nThat it's actually more expensive to take care of these patients I'm a lot of people going in and out of the hospital using the ERs is their primary care physician right I think the fact that we have the most per capita uninsured members and the whole nation really hurts\nA Texas I think it would be cheaper if we were to actually get everybody covered so that way they can get preventative care to prevent these train wreck\n... it's actually probably not ... but it's probably not cheaper and you know that this whole Medicare for all thing which is what you're alluding to the Medicare for all thing even state wide or or nationally would cost trillions of dollars that we don't have that's true it's a real true fact\nCheck it would cost thirty one trillion dollars so that's not the result I look\nI I agree with you we should make sure that people get ... not only preventative care what they should be taught how to eat right and taught how to take care of themselves and they're not in a hospital all the time and the ER she'd never ever ever and ever be used\nAs your local physician would be used and that's exactly what they're doing so there should be a solution there somewhere would all work is saying solving anything in fact when we have privatized health care and it's not any more it's more socialize now that it's ever been under Obamacare which has made it on affordable to most people\nWhen we had when we had more privatize health care which is where we're leading back where we can have real competition for health care insurance will will plummet but if I could start buying it in Oklahoma or if I could buy in Arkansas infections doesn't do the right thing for me or if I had a health insurance account from the time I'm born\nUntil now I'm fifty two I'll have plenty of money in there to go and take care of my simple needs that have to take care of that's the right way to go that's capitalism that's free enterprise end it looks it looks out for the needs that you have to say that you're for what ... saying\nDoesn't make sense to me if you're a health care provider he said nothing to you that makes any sense nothing that we can pay for any way that makes any sense why is what I just said not the right way to go to privatize it make more competition make it affordable and available for everybody\nBecause right now in Texas that is privatized they did not uh expand Medicaid and it's actually failing are\nOne of them do that doesn't matter where the medically evacuated to expand Medicaid me to get on the exchange it doesn't it doesn't mean Obamacare isn't available\nPeople in Texas are on Obamacare a lot of them and it costs way too much money Texas did the right thing by turning away that money that money would have said we're now incumbent upon what the\nThe Obama administration does or what the federal government says for our health care decisions or we'll paddle of twenty eight doctors will tell you you're too old for that procedure or you can get the hip replacement that's true those are made up facts that the fact\nTexas said we want to stay independent now if you want something done at the Texas Legislature I hear you Joe\nI really do when you're trying to say that a U.S senator can do something for Texas individually that's really not true the U.S Senate if you can go there and do the bidding for Texas Senator Ted Cruz is doing that when it comes to health care with ideas like I just ... like I just presented\nLook socialize healthcare doesn't work check England check Cuba that Michael ... Michael Moore thought was so great check Canada check overseas anywhere and find out where the monarchy goes when they need an operation where do they go\nThey come right here we've got the best healthcare system in the world Obama just took it over and screwed it up with his ... his buddy Gruber we have to go back to privatize\nOpen competition and have real affordable health care for everybody because what you're saying I got to make it out of work to do it but what you're saying is going to make that it's going to make everybody I'll let you finish I promise what you're suggesting is that you're gonna make it available to everybody who's going to pay for it\nYou're going to pay for it I'm going to pay for it because we're healthy and were successful and we can afford it why wouldn't we want competition so that we can make it affordable for everybody go ahead\nAll right so here's the catch twenty two though because you're saying you know not making it available to everybody to or where everybody but they're\nGoing to say that no no no I'm saying do that I said do that\nNow what you're saying well you know a competition as though yeah competition loading has had a competition for reports resources right\nNo no no no no there there are plenty of resources there well there's a shortage of resources\nThere's a difference or there's a shortage in in positions as well as\nTheir ... there won't be as there won't be a physician's couldn't compete and actually compete for the listen ... you've got a mindset that you're not understanding the way Medicaid and Medicare work the government is telling physicians\nI'm not going to pay you what it costs you to do that procedure or you know physicians are going to say screw you I'm gonna retire screw you're going to become a lawyer screw you're going to be Dr race cars I don't have to be a physician and have you give me thirty dollars for a fifty dollar procedure that's what Obamacare is doing it's actually running great doctors out of the business you know that\nNo I agree with you and ask the documentation standard requiring but I think the other aspect of it than that\n... and his band nine inch nails are in Boston for to show that the weighing on friday and Saturday Night also shows seven o'clock and also friday night rumors the plate with ... tribute band that continue their New England shore where they show in New Hampshire at the Hampton beach casino ballroom\nLegendary comedian Lily Tomlin is in Medford this weekend at the ... center\nFor a show that the seven pm Saturday and then again on Sunday night and finally on Sunday Cisco Brewers in Portsmouth New Hampshire present the fifth annual New Hampshire food truck and craft beer festival all the activities get started at one PM\nInformation I Need and other events happening in and around Boston visit W.
