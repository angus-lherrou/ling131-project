almost completely covered and what we could see of his body was completely padded up top to bottom now I'm not suggesting that if you have tattoos you're in a gang or you're a bad person\nAnd you want to be you don't want to be identified you're not some poor person from Honduras looking for a way to feed your kids you know you're all tied it up and ready to go and when you look at people who were from MS Thirteen or coming through our southern border and doing horrible things they tend to be tied it up\nAnd they tend to to not want to be recognized or or or identified\nSo we don't know who's in that care about what am I was in that or keeping a close eye on that our number three it'll be campus reform because it is Thursday we'll have ah been McDonald on to a tell us some crazy to some nothing is that's happening in college and university campus carry ... which one you wanna start or what do you think is the is the news that's mostly been coverage that I'm guessing that bombing no I'm\nThinking ... century assist packages probably want to start with that yeah the that let's go there [laughter] okay\nUh this one as an NBC News too suspicious packages on Thursday addressed a former vice president Joe Biden and then there's center Robert De Niro his office in downtown Manhattan\nAre similar to the pipe bomb sent a political and media figures in the past few days according to the FBI on package drafted mine was discovered any postal facility in New castle Delaware and other was found that postal facility in Wilmington, Delaware official said\nAnd I like to the Wednesday that a package of dusted by somewhere it within the postal system and the package that and to to narrow that sound at three Seventy five ... street that side of their restaurant try that can grill theatrical owns and the offices of De Niro he's tried that got productions and there's no need to evacuate because the building within the police said\nAnd playing the narrow is called authorities around ... am eastern time on Thursday after he realized the package he'd seen earlier in the week it looked like the other thing that thing efficient than\nThe employees are retiring NYPD detective according to John Miller in ... and the deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism investigators are looking into whether some of the packages were sent from Florida to senior law enforcement official told NBC News\nVery official said they believe all the packages were sent through the mail at the CNN package arrived by now to the screening facility in midtown Manhattan before being delivered by courier and the the in an office is an official said\nA package with not screened because it was relatively small and the devices are poorly made and some discovered cannot have exploded but it's unclear if that was intentional or if they were just badly constructed official said\nThey send the bomb pads and dental floss somehow subtle flies and found hadn't yet to be examined even found these explosives that weren't defective PT commissioner James O'Neill said they are treating them as alive and devices\nAnd ... than they are not aware of any new devices being discovered that are still concerned there couldn't be more and cautioned anyone who comes across as potential package of this time to treat it as dangerous\nAll right we appreciate that thank you ... and we'll get into that in earnest certainly will take phone calls on that same if people want to talk about this this suspicious devices I mean we're getting we're getting more and more information in ... and as I take a look at with these devices look like\nIs um I mean it it to me there were a lot of questions there's not enough postage on these packages to be sent there is no post a mark on these packages I'm the packages never got to\nThe person that it was either address to where the return address was to the media's reporting it as if Debbie Wasserman Schultz and and Maxine Waters had these packages in their hands of Bill Clinton did and they had to save them from it and then they did not get as far as them many of these were found in the facilities um but there are a lot of questions that we talked to add to cut about that a lot\nAnd I want to know I mean the investigative Lee what are we looking at here I mean what what's the positions could be made and we do that before and move on for those who are the San Antonio area carry this is a big story yesterday and the day before a Joaquin Castro Who's Afraid to come on the show he's a U.S congressman he is um I think just for twenty Democrat\nHis brother is Leon Castro they're twins I think fraternal I can tell them apart so I Would imagine they're fraternal they look very very much alike\nUm holy on was the mayor of San Antonio for a time then he was the housing and urban development director under um than President Obama\nOr he's been mentioned about running for president or whatever Joaquin Castro is his brother who is banned I guess he just assumes that are going to continue as the congressman from district twenty uh he's one of these power players in San Antonio that shouldn't be he has proven through his tweeting but he's not a very smart guy\nAnd recently he was on I think MSNBC and he made a direct delegation that he saw reports\nThat Jared Kushner the son in law the president the United states had a hit list that he gave to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nAnd the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nTook action on it that's like a show that he was killed I mean that's pretty much what he said even CNN or MSNBC or whatever it was I think we're seeing that actually puppy somebody wears the puppy person which I'm sure you know\nNIH high or low ... but I don't I don't know\nWhenever he was on he makes that allegation and it's so far left and not so\nThat even the host as us there or not reporting that at all you got that well suffice it to say there were reports so he doesn't back it up with anything that he does like a series of tweets they've tried to cover his ass because he completely alleged that the son in law the president or somehow complicit in the death of showed him and he did that\nHe tweets out of the blue couple of days ago\nThat he was informed by people in San Antonio at the polling places or is it lost palm is is that the area of the city wasn't homeless does that sound familiar does uh-huh how allegedly they contacted him I guess they all have a walking Castro's phone number they contacted him and said that police all essay pd\nPolice officers were patrolling the polling places and intimidating them\nNow if you look up this area where the polling places it's clear to me this is very close to a an NSA PT San Antonio police departments substation\nThey would have to drive at least near there to get to the substation or leave a substation\nThere are zero reports that I've seen anywhere even by the most far left wing um outlets in this city or beyond that said police officers are actively telling people who to vote for who not to vote for or to vote or not to vote\nNobody's reporting that oh I see walking Castro tweets that out as if it's happening\nSo I got a hold of bill McManus he used the police chief in San Antonio he and I had been friends for as long as I've been in this job he came shortly after I did I Believe um I I've been here Thirteen Years I think he was right after I got here\nCould be wrong about the about the timing is pretty close though\nAnd he and I have discussed stuff personally\nWe've done it on the air we've debated we disagreed like one one vehement disagree that we had was about about sobriety checkpoints I'm against them because it assumes I'm drunk he's for them for the better good as other people or he agreed with the Supreme Court ruling on it\nBut I'm long and short of it is the guys always been honest with me so I got a hold of them were able to connect last night for a few minutes and I said what's going on\nBecause the reports now are that the so called top brass of the police department the essay P. D. or telling officers not to go to a polling or anywhere near polling places\nWell the cheese response was actually a very simple the job of the police department of an a police officers is not to be political at all there is no political role for the SAT\nHe says that SAP officers were not told to not drive anywhere near a patrol anywhere near\nBut but the long and short of it is they were told you go to a polling place if you're cold there because somebody is in need now I Can't think of any reason why an essay PT police officer would go to a polling place if not called there\nUnless he or she is going to vote and I don't know what the what the localities are or the rules and regulations are the dress code is for police officer I don't know if you can carry the you know can you go and vote if you're in uniform I don't know\nI Do not now\nI voted for very long time I've never seen a police officer in uniform voting\nBut nobody's even alleging that the allegation by walking Castro who has a real problem with reality is that police officers were purposely patrolling inside of the parking lots of polling places\nAnd his allegation his suggestion was that they were trying to intimidate people and as you see something like this happen get a hold of me that he signs it Joaquin as if he's a friend of everybody well again let me reiterate the police chief\nYou remember when mom and dad used to sort through your Halloween\nSome stuff was no good for you some stuff was dangerous\nIn some stuff they just sort of do for themselves so long so let us do the mid term nightmare of blood on wheels spin allowed all the candidates and issues and math and reading fool establish the facts guard in creating a line was only one teacher to consumers\nAre going to get to the bottom have as much as you want they're hungry on the voice of Boston [noise] W.

back then as a candidate or or just yesterday\nYou're feeling the same kind of thing out there but we need people to come out and vote that is such that key but\nThese Senate races are are trending in

else\nIn the social media or with the media with talk radio what we needed was somebody that could attract people\nThat don't normally listening to talk radio people that don't vote people that don't pay attention to politics because the only way we were going to out vote the Clinton mafia\nWas to really get the silent majority the blue collar those that became so disillusioned with politics that

Ronald Reagan a presidential foundation and Institute John how are you\nI'm just great to be with the job really glad to have you back I got to tell yourself you'll with wonderful but that thing behind you got my attention or ... years it'd be a plaintiff some short and some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nYeah well we're right here at the Reagan Library that's our escort team at ... one of the blame us jets a little off the carrier or a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots when they came after our fleet at one point in Nineteen eighty six\nI Do remember that and I also remember the President Reagan said watch this and went back and and launched an attack on on Gadhafi himself and that really got him under control didn't it\nSure did I mean but I came to the table now ... history Ronald Reagan was most successful than us some ... year it's a great little I run up to what's known alcoholic I say it's a great addition to the library\nHe was you know if you can move to your left or actually moved here right just for a second so you actually see the plane\nI Want to show people that that in all that's beautiful weather that\nThey're not really nice All right I'm going to be the director and ask you to move back but that was really excellent I Want to be watching to see that that's cool All right I Want to talk about the Libyan crisis for a second the president than Ronald Reagan really I I was very engaging politics or even though I was pretty young those Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old um but but\nThe grab their attention because of the way that he dealt with crises um she might have dealt with crisis the same way that Donald Trump would but he would do in a very different way wouldn't it\nYeah you know I I've heard Trump often use the expression peace through strength\nYou know that was Reagan's uh blind um and uh I find it fascinating to see a President Trump the day after day you seem to take one page after another from the Reagan play ball address so we write the race in America is strong on the during the Reagan he says because of rape instance on\nAn added to head dramatically different styles that same same conservative philosophy\nIt's very interesting it's John Hi but she's the executive director of the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation and Institute a really appreciate the time it's interesting to watch because when President Reagan look there were people on the left who couldn't stand him either\nThe media went after him all the time but the way that he was very very different um\nBack then I remember the left and the right in this country all saying well hell yeah Gadhafi is a bad guy and we have to go and get the bad guy if Trump says somebody's a bad guy the left knee jerk reaction is that he's races to use ... still in the blink is what is it the way that Reagan dealt with with delivering the message is that why\nMe yeah in some respects I think it was a combination of the few things Joe I'm you know in the Reagan years or ... when there was no such thing as Twitter you know we didn't have the kind of social technologies that we have today so Reagan whether they liked it or not sometimes we didn't ah\nThe only way to get his message out was by I'll use the word loosely partnering with\nUh the mainstream media rights and go\nTo get his message across that was it I mean other than that you know a campaign advertising yet to sneak through rainy season CBS NBC\nRight say on CNN was just the nascent little channel at the time and so a Reagan had the script is moments and\nYou know working in in ... in unison with the general crest to try to get the message out he couldn't afford to make a need that many of the the whole right a Trump you know he can tweet us ... you know he can reach a hundred million Americans are more and with a hundred and forty character right\nOn any given day if he so chooses without the filter and the media doesn't need the media sense like Reagan did so in that respect us two very quite different styles as they play themselves out of\n... it's very interesting comparison to make and you're absolutely right um I I might be missed remembering this and I think that's what we're Brian Williams said it was I I may be missed remembering this but Ronald Reagan appear to me to do more press conferences more news conferences where he would actually take the questions from the media\nTrump will do you know sort of announcements he'll walk out and and on the fly he'll take some questions Obama almost never took all the questions he be quite frankly even though the media was his buddy\nUh he he didn't want to sit there and be questioned by anybody what do you think Reagan did that is it because that was the only available way to get it out there and because of that is that why it appears as though he had a friendly relationship would they Sam Donaldson even even though the same del too was always you know she's working at um ...\nI think your analysis is pretty good I I'm Reagan had the script almost almost because the cameras pointed out and we're not as all he had to work with me that a message out he couldn't speak directly to the American people right ah I you know I\nHome advisor dot com you just tell them about your project and they match you with local pros that can do the job
