I'm Sorry but one call\nI think that everybody med school in ... in the school districts should know this guy was called in and there was something viable that was going on that please needed to intercede but instead we're going to hide it we have to hide it because his last name was ...\nBut we have to we have to say well you know because of the stats we have to make sure that he doesn't have his record is going to hurt 'em exponentially again he'd get a job when he gets out of school because he has a right I have an idea\nDon't be that guy that has the police visit you twenty thirty forty times there'll be that guy that causes the problem in school you get expelled and then maybe you'll have a better chance at a job or identify what he was emotional problems are and get them help before he has a need to to have police visiting dozens of times\nSo did anything get fixed well Broward County school board is still a left leaning school board that is it looking out for parents or teachers or kids the teachers' union a former leftist organization\nIs not looking out for for themselves it's just about power control and and and having having the ability to pretend to the stats are different than they really are\nAnd that's nuts to me that's nuts\nIt's a editing nine four one packs Joe ... a lot of people on the line when I talk about\nAbout a cabin all they want to talk

it's Britain Tucson bread I appreciate you what's going on\nHey Joe I'm asked why you don't think they talk to the judge or his accuser well they've already got sworn testimony from both of those people yeah I'm a tennis silly to talk to them again they talk to\nTheir people that are supposed to cooperate their story right and that's why ... why I think that they didn't talk to them this week\nWell I I I actually saw a news report after the question was first asked early on to the program and you're a hundred percent right they under under penalty of perjury and felony\nHave already testified bantered questions under oath it's worn therefore it's it's admissible in any investigation so now you've got to take what they want to and try to follow it up and eat a corroborated or or you know find exculpatory evidence and what they found so far he hasn't corroborate what she said so this should be an easy vote go ahead\nYeah and real quick you know President Trump could take a whole and ask the Democrats who do you want me to nominate for ... the Supreme Court they would give up a name he would nominate them and the Democrats would find them tooth and nail because Trump nominated him\nWell it's just you're right because they just don't want him to have a when you're a hundred percent right they don't want his name on anything they've supported\nNope you absolutely right\nI'd rather I appreciate you thanks for waiting in Tucson open line now at eight eight eight nine four one bags eight eight nine four one Seventy two four seven let me go back at it and say hello to juniors in Pompano Beach which isn't far from Port going to be honest with you what's going on junior high\nHigh uh hey yeah does that does that to kind of a Broward schools run the because he had something in common with a Keith Ellison\nA I said that what sense he said that it was All right for the red sea to lie about their ... their record as a student\nWhen did I say there is okay I never said that\nI thought I thought there they do say that\nYour your thought I thought I said it was okay for Runcie to lie about the students record annoyed and\nHer ... okay maybe I harder drawn\nYou did you turn around what else\nOkay but either I'm pretty sure I'm right on their head in the car and it's All right to lie for a to advance the cause of the Muslim\nThere is some there I don't think in in the Islamic State's called to Kia to key allows you to lie yes it's true cut\nAnd surprise you didn't ask ah that that to a gym or Canada they well they have a ... law advocate\nThe Kennedy had I had the Kennedy had I had on his not a Muslim\nNine now I I'm Talking about his opponent\nSo why would I ask him about what I thought there were more important questions like why would you want a guy who was allegedly a wife Peter and a woman beat her to be the top law enforcement officer Keith Ellison has never come out and said that he somebody who believes in in in ...\nUm he hasn't talked about how he holds up hoodies he hasn't talked about a lot of that stuff why would I focus on his religion what he's a horrible Kennedy no matter what religious views\nAnd okay that brings to mind a you know unless you are right no I Know that former congressman and say that ...\nYou know Alan West yeah I've had him on the program is\nFar he's oh you have it well he says that Muslim is not a religion and you know that that ban the fix that that Bob Hope Joseph Ratzinger and the federal pen okay say it's a it's a form of government that uses the rate they didn't have the prop\nYeah it is and I say it is a theocratic government it is actually it is absolutely a government and the religion all tied into one is looking Saudi Arabia the government is based on the religion right\nSo I think that's in part with the candidate all adults are in a different part of factor\nFirst say with the Muslim around there okay a a fear the right and we talk about Kevin ought\nTo know

Know that we you and I've been talking and it's been kind of rough week another medals birthday is coming up this week she would have been what Nineteen Nineteen Joe\n... in a new and I've talked about this a million times no parents ever wants to marry a child or and and this stuff gets to you been working your face off on elections on getting changes in schools but talk to me you know bad ... bad I mean it's not that a good week\nI'm kind of beat up gel with everything that's going on ... you know in the news the administrators in Broward County they all got raises\nA one of them was responsible for the threat assessment for gross I said it said his name Eighteen Nineteen fifty eight they did the threat assessment yeah he got a raise the person in charge of the promise program they got all raised their all they're all they're all still here and Broward businesses you\nYou you you worked really hard to change over the school board it didn't quite happen but it got close you really did make a huge difference you're against the the the labor unions are against the you know ... and his ... and you were against the government told a situation that\nThat loves the promise program because it makes the numbers look better when it comes to specifically\nMinority kids in school you were a large do about the promise program and whether Eighteen Nineteen fifty was a part of it\nDo you feel like you made some changes and I got to tell you from from standing back a little bit I think you made a huge change but you said you'd be a little beaten up the the you know the change in may ... you helped\nWell in Florida I helped a lot Joe ... or ... and in other states people right in the all the time you know every every school in Florida now has an armed guard in it or they'll get more money for a mental health and hardening of the schools yeah so it's getting done at just Broward was a very slow process process\nI never knew the Brower was that far left and by the way it may be pollock gum Andrew Pollack whose daughter metal was killed at ... high school in Parkland, Florida um I grew up in South Florida I never really thought about the politics of it\nMuch I was always a conservative American traditional values guy and I didn't know that if that Fort Lauderdale or or Broward County itself was that far left has always been or is this something that's happened gradually I've been out of there for ... for about Twenty years so maybe it's changed over that time\nWell I I've never been into politics until this really happened today and then one when I take a look at it and it's kind of pretty much a cesspool and Broward County what's going on and who runs at ... and who and the people are OK with them run that it's the same people in charge\nYou know you're you're friends with a share of gritty Judd no who is a great guy were she was a share of where you are um and he's made some positive changes and he's actually training people to be mentally first responders but first reactors if somebody should show up God Forbid another school with a gun\nBut they're just not doing it in Broward County and they eventually went back and took the money ... money that they turned down originally are they going to do what ... is doing or or is this police is their share of this Israel the city it is he not going to go to play ball how what's going on in Broward so we\nHad on the Asian house again Joe I don't think they're capable of doing what they're doing Paul county you know it's just a whole different ideology\nIn Polk County ... and a lot of other counties but Broward they just don't have the leadership\nThat these other counties those poor leadership from the superintendent of schools you know a a nine year old got a gun into a school the other day or the sheriff's office or what for leadership or lack of training so until they change the leadership or nothing it's going to be business as usual and Broward\n... well the problem is and we talked to briefly about the nine year old before we started here today Andy\nHe now is probably going to be put on the promise programs is the fact that he brought a gun to school will probably not be known by when he goes to middle school and when he goes to high school the teachers there won't know the administrators won't know the security won't know and here's a guy that you should probably look out for now he's somebody who brought a gun to school right\nYeah it's kind of terrible you know and and then we just had this big ah\nFood festival here this weekend that they politicized the whole shooting\nIn Parkland or Alyssa Milano was here and it wasn't supposed to be a political event but they turned it into a an anti gun rally like they always do and to me that that's really a deflection of what happened\nHere in Parkland because there's numerous entities that are at fault or that led up to ... fourteen I'd be the first one to blame if it was the gun or I go along with it but I I Know because I looked into it\nAnd I have an investigation going on Joe and there's a lot of people responsible for what happened said boy fourteen and one of 'em are it's not

have somebody on the side you know he's not a massage or you can't have a mean horrible drunk to beat people up and Nineteen eighty two before he got to know that didn't happen either as friend got arrested\nOr you can't have a gang rape is to drug didn't and in spite vehicle no no proof it's been refuted what is it that you're complaining about what do you think you know\nI Would be much more\nAt least sympathetic to the opposite slash wrong side\nIf there were honest about it if they just said listen we just want to keep abortion available\nNow we can have a discussion about why I

Boston in my heart radio station [noise]\nThe last show\n... email here also Newsmax TV to Joe ... show have you most of the wide really glad to have back to the Republican\nSenator from the great state of Texas it's John Cornyn senator our you\nI'm doing great Joe good to be with you\nAlways an absolute pleasure ... it has been a whirlwind for you in the Senate Judiciary committee for the better part of a month now did you listen going into you have any idea that this confirmation process would take this long knowing who Brett Kavanaugh has been for the last Thirty years well\nI I got a chance to get to know Brett Kavanaugh back in two thousand and when I was attorney general when he helped me get ready to argue or a case before the United States Supreme court right and I followed his career since then I think what's made this show up such such a pitched battle\nIs the fact that this is a successor to Anthony Kennedy one of the swing votes on the court right\nOf course there was a a a a rash of successor to escalate and people thought well that didn't really change the balance right the court that much but they see this or those who see the court as a way to enact policy or through judicial ... see this as a loss of power and they're not happy about it\nMember of the Senate Judiciary committee in the Republican for the great state of Texas John Cornyn senator let's be real about this when he announced that it was going to be Brett Kavanaugh the left protesters that were already organized some of them pay we're already gathered\nHad a blank signs in their hands and they had a villain with a Sharpie when they found out what the name was they were going to resist no matter what your right spot on Gorsuch replaces Silvio we're not going to fight that fight we're going to fight this well no and that's exactly what they've done\nWell and it's a nobody should be confused or this is not a search for the truth this isn't a where people have an open mind and are willing to listen to both sides of an argument\nA Senator Schumer the Democratic leaders said he would do whatever it takes right to defeat the nomination a number of people as you point out said whoever Trump dominates they're going to oppose\nSo you know we can't let this good man go down and I'm confident we will get him confirmed\nBecause if we if we lost the nomination based on the scorched earth tactics and based on all the unfair process I Can't imagine who would be willing to step forward and go through this again in the future\nAs a former prosecutor as a as a former judge 'em you get this case\nUnit to you about Christine lousy for it and maybe even adding Deborah Ramirez and and what do you take that to trial do you try somebody on on charges that are completely ... not only uncorroborated senator but also refuted\n[noise] yeah it's an important point Joe I'm we focused a lot on the fact that we have allegations but a thirty five years old\nOr in the case of Dr Ford\nBut the ... witnesses that she said were there at the time not only don't corroborate her story they refuted that it didn't happen her best friend from high school said I never even met but Kavanaugh and obviously Ramirez allegations or had been\nChecked out to ... similar situation allegation no cooperation from people she said that they're actually refutation of what her claims are so we we acts actually hired a sex crimes a prosecutor from uh from Arizona to help us\nThis or ask questions of Dr Ford in a respectful way to get information I Know a lot of our folks are on the left or were mad about that they were denied the photo op that they saw from the need a hill hearing where you have a bunch of older a graying\nSenators on being charitable they're questioning or a woman who is alleged to have been a victim of sexual assault\nAnd they were denied that opportunity but we thought it was more important to get\nQuestions to a doctor for it in a way that was respectful got the information we needed and I think what it shows is as you suggest is an orchestrated effort not only to defeat this nomination but two of them but to ruining\nIt Senator John Cornyn the great state of Texas Sen Cory ... book or yesterday actually said these words it doesn't matter anymore if he's guilty or innocent John is that where we are in America is that really ...\nThat is no that is to me that as an American I'm I think uh I've I've I've uh had old ... fall for too with the senator Booker I told him I said that a look a Corey I can hate the sin but loved the center but I think he's just been ridiculous in this process\nNot only the I Am Spartacus moment but saying he was intentionally going to violate the rules of the Judiciary Committee and make confidential documents
