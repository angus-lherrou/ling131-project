I guess but what I Do it from there but who do and ... bunch of jerks go to bed and duty but I don't know something like that I mean ... how did you go to the Nineteen fifties sandwich with bells that [laughter]\nI don't know the the only thing I can think of is like that I Want candy song and that you know I don't know I'm the\nI'm ... I'm done with the maybe polio ... I I'm\nPicturing like music videos are numbered sharing like a video for the safety dance and you know all these people are like why are you going to know and and then the other knows you know thinking about too is that coming to America song um by what's his face\nBy a a diamond which is oh yeah\nYeah I was thinking about the actual James ... ... or whatever yeah gum to America but you're thinking of\nAh yeah it'd\nBe really annoying with that one yeah something like that I look if you've got a parity idea of the phone lines are pretty jacked up because of the NFL we could be given breaking it down and listen like the last caller I Do probably mixing it up ... there'll be offended if I mix it up with you and actually put back on you what it is that you're saying we can really mix it up and I have a nice debate you you guys that I got to tell you something\nSome of the ... most of the reaction is man that was great really great back and forth I'm Glad you did it uh he acted like I was being a bully and being mean and there's one there's always one door who says you know the conservative you shouldn't be on the radio you were to mean no I'm not being mean I'm going to mix it up man let's roll up our sleeves and literally go at it looks really that's really really do these topics\nWhich really go at it looks really OK you told me that a hundred million dollars can't do anything so how much of the NFL give a billion\nOwners and solve everything\nYou said there's no oppression getting oh there's no oppression well uh no uh prejudice against the law in our country well so it was murder but it happens okay but if it happens the ideas you get arrested and we solve the problem\nIf oppression happens you you get good people like me to find out about it and tell the forties and\nYou can bring suit and that's actually against the law to discriminate in certain instances and so on the idea that we're in a press the country and the guy rides around Alabama all day hating the country or disliking what he sees as the country that's nuts to me and let me break down the word ignorant\nEverybody gets so offended by the word ignorant if you're ignoring facts that are easily available to you if you're ignoring what's really happening you weren't being ignore rent\nIt is not a racial term it is not a gender based term it is not an ethnic term it is a term that has a definition you're ignoring facts\nSo you're being ignore rent that's the word the root of it is ignore so if you somehow overtly offended by the weren't ignorant you're probably ignorant to its definition is\nWell what do I know\nSomebody just suggested the the song Spanish by the doors anybody know that song I've never heard of Spanish by the doors\nOn\nHow much Spanish Caravan by the doors

I mean he's seen so much I mean most people would never want to see what the terrible tragedies that you've seen them in his life the atrocities horrors just listen to how bad he hasn't\n... if you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job it's covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and\nAnd and Donald Trump in many ways\nThe danger is not what ... is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally and you know people would give you a hard time I you know people yelled at me a Hillary Clinton rallies or into to those make campaign [noise]\nUh you know that what happened from time to time and you know it during Mitt Romney you know people through some things that me and asked me why didn't you call but why didn't ask about Ben Gossett you're Jewish story up in Gaza that happened when I covered Mitt Romney but at a rally after rally after rally\nHaving the president of states where people up into a frenzy and attacked the press to me is that the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist and I guess\nHe's never recovered a riot [noise]\nHave you ever covered up fire you know what people are like crying 'cause their house has been destroyed that they've lost their their hats they've lost all their ah prized possessions I mean he thinks covering around\nIs is is uh is the worst thing that's ever happened man is he led a sheltered life as a as a

knowledge I Love the way you guys there in your sheriff's department\nDo the job and especially you know watching you out there on live TV I saw you out they're interacting with people in the community and I love the the way that you take the job on a lot of people I've seen police officers you know guys like this to\nGo walk around like like you know their stuff doesn't speak I've seen some who I think are sometimes too lenient you seem to really have it down to do\nI'm going to interact with my ... year maybe somebody who goes to church with me or my my kids go to school together\nBut at the same time I I Can't let them go too far because then that would make it bad for the community is that kind of how you approach it\nYou know that is these are my neighbors these are people that I'm gonna see at the store these are people that I'm going to deal with in the future and uh I don't know what is what is it it's gone on in their life to put him to this point so I
