{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Well often sometimes not I'm not sure what often often that's the case there has been a reliance on\nSorry but this is what I encounter or what you just brought out there's been a reliance on on the male spouse for you know keeping the books if you will um and and and keeping the finances in order and I have seen that and\nDoing the investing and doing their retirement and hung in and all that\nAnd when I Do recognize that\nI Do state really openly you know you should get or or to to to Mrs you you really should be involved at least to have some idea because as I said in the past\nI've seen the results of of the loss of with a male spouse on whom the female spouse the surviving spouse was a reliant\nAnd the impact of you know almost a hands going up or do I do now um but you so you bring up a valid point so both husband and wife\nShould be integrity involves or at least if one has the responsibility the other to be aware of what is done on a regular monthly basis or where the\nUh I'll put it the investment accounts are if you will and the legal documents et cetera\nUh by the way speaking of legal documents which I I really didn't intend to bring that to to discuss today but having mentioned them in conversation and and as everyone knows I Believe I'm not an attorney but I always bring forward that people regardless of age should have their appropriate legal documents in order\nAnd if they haven't been initiated in order to do so just this past week Lou and meeting with a couple of listeners if you will\nListener couples I brought this forward and in one instance\nThey had some legal documents that were ... years old they weren't up to date and they appreciated that I kind of John them to to bring it forward in another instance I'm not only did I provide the planning that that's I'm In one instance the husband was retired\nThe I'm the wife was not\nAnd um she didn't know when she could and as a result of our planning\nLiterally she is now smiling recognizing that she doesn't have to stick it out for many years so to speak\nAnd um that the assets they've accumulated\nHandled and and planning and within the right strategies will provide the income actually more income than they thought possible and in a relatively short time a shorter than even she thought possible ... ever before that she'll be able to retire and they'll both live very comfortably\nBut in that instance uh with that couple they didn't have you know they had fought we'll get to it at some point and they hadn't had their legal documents in order\nYou know the again or maybe a will are remarkable trust or maybe on the Arab world ... trust the depending on the need on the circumstance and certainly a healthcare proxy\nA durable power of attorney and a planning directive I'm an end by the way those last statements are those last documents refer to if you are incapacitated\nAnd you can't make either financial or rational financial or medical decisions you have indicated I'm someone who can do so on your behalf\nBe at a spouse be at a child or someone who whom you can trust\nSo I just I'm I'm Glad I kind of went in that direction and often something I'll discuss on air but I have no doubt that most people listening out there who\nHave not either taken the initiative a or if they have taken the initiative to do some type of legal planning it may not be adequate that could have been a divorce\nOr the that could be someone who whom they would've expected as a beneficiary some time ago and they no longer speaking with that person or that person has\nDied or is is no longer you know in the in the I'm In the in the family so to speak so um I I just I'm Glad we're the opportunity at least to bring that forward\nA bit and talk a little bit about ... you brought up an interesting point here because a lot of people a just one interesting ... interesting cut or an interesting concept that was a valid point okay a lot of people aren't aware of a lot of things that they need to do it so they're ill prepared for retirement ... protected and\nIn terms of uh okay uh situations that don't work out well for them whether it be an illness or an early death or or whatever it is\nBut when you're talking to these couples and you walk them through the program and they get the narrative and they go from not even knowing what the predators are in this situation to understanding that everything is secure and they know exactly what's going to be heading to them\nWhat an emotional swing what a quality of life different setting as well\nThe huge and you just reminded me of something that triggered in my mind a few moments ago and then it'll left my mind if you will I Know I didn't have to say that but not from the reality of it and you just brought it back again and that is\nIn the absence of sitting down and I'll say with me or with someone on whom they can rely Lou if people for the most part\nTry to do all of this you by themselves it's overwhelming\nAnd ... and that is why without knowing appropriate strategies and and I'm and I'm options you know people will sit down and say okay we're going to retire in two years hopefully uh what do we have well wait a minute what kind of income is that going to give us\nThey're not able to develop those answers so it gets put aside and they'll say well we'll get to it at some point and often people don't show the planning needs to be done that and and as I said once it's put into a simple narrative they've got it there\nAnd that's with what they can take and go forward literally for the rest of their lives that is pretty significant\nTo put it very simply share and how are we looking on time by the way\nTo two minutes okay well you know why it didn't go quite as quickly as I thought so I'm Glad it gave us a bit of time you've had a morning this morning so [noise] I'm Sorry you've had a morning already to someone else so I guess so but you know I I again\nWhat is what is the reason that we do what we do want air it's to inform people to explain that we are a resource and by the way a on occasion and I I this doesn't occur every week but often enough when I called back someone they'll say ... you're calling me stuff\nI didn't know I'd be hearing from you directly ah well I'm the person with whom you will be dealing with with whom you will meet a I'm a I have a very simple operation sitting down meeting with people using only principle protected programs we don't put assets at risk\nAnd speaking of that are particularly if you're approaching retirement covered by a pension plan north shore now you're confronted with options do I take Maxine come\nDo I take a lesser income and then my surviving spouse\nWill they even have less than that you're not sure what to do let's arranged to meet and lots of talk about the the pension maxim evasion strategy and let's explore how to get the most out of your pension and remember you're covered by four one K.

much for calling us at aged aid money pit\nWell if you're tired of that plastic water bottle going out with your recycling or worse in the trash every week whole house water filter might be a better option for you\nThat's right a whole house you'd filters the water at the main just as it comes into the house bringing you Chris clean water from every tap in your home to learn more we turn now to this old house plumbing and heating expert\nRichard ... through we welcome Richard pay them now Americans are having a version the tap water\nBut filtering it has to be better and less expensive than buying bottles or the difficult to install these shelters where\nIt really depends I mean you have to think about attacking water filtration in steps if it's a whole house you need a large unit that's going to handle all the water was coming through and in that case you're going to be going after\nThe really visible impurities dirt and rushed okay um when you think about the level of water you're going to consume you have to think local you have to think about a filter that's going to sit on the kitchen sink to give you clean beautiful water for both cooking and for your ice make less true 'cause if you put it that the main me not only are you\nBring your drinking water but it's also a lot I tore the water yeah exactly yeah\nYeah so it's a really have to do it in steps you know where a there's a whole industry it's an industry that's growing because people are more and more worried about the quality of the water what happens if the bad guys touched the water you know just they want to have some level of security and in their house\nSo how do you go about choosing one and then getting a job\nWell I think it's a a dirt and rush filters what you think about it the least case that the water I mean coming in I think that's going to be a function of local water quality I mean there's so many parts in this country the water is beautiful I mean we take for granted in this country with writers as good as it is\nSo you may not need that but if you had an old rusty Maine that's in your old town you know or you had a a galvanized a water may come in and that was kind of give you a lot of rush you know you're not and you can't change that new Maine to new Maine you might want to have it during rush filtered\nOut what about a filter that goes actually at the tap I've seen a wide variety of these types of filters sometimes you see the ones that screw on to where the greater would go yeah other times you see them to be large and fit I'm inside the cabinet what's the best way to approach that well I think this to\nAll the ones that you spoke about you know the ones that go on to the end of it is her kitchen spout they will usually includes something called ... she graduated activated carbon\nAnd water goes through this carbon in it cleans it up as it comes through and so that's the least case which you would put on the kitchen sink the either the little ones you see above the sink or the these could be wants to sit down in the cash turned an effect on your cold water feed\nThe other thing that people will put in is a thing called an R. O. reverse osmosis now that is a unit which will bring water through a membrane with high pressure it'll push through this membrane so only the clean water gets through the membrane and the west rest of the water\nYou know push through this membrane the clean water and the rest of the water will discharge to a drain so it's a lot more elaborate to install in that you not only have a supply but you have a drain and people will complain that you they're wasting some water okay but the water level is clean and pure it's almost distilled\nAnd when it comes to changing the filters give the amount of time between filter changes really very big type of cleaning can you have in where it's located\nIn well it's a function of water quality again I mean you know ... years ago we we had this filter that was so good that it would clog up all the time people hated it\nBut the water was perfectly clean because it was taken every bit out of it so it's this is this balance point between taking out the important stuff but not having to be that you have to change it every month or every every two weeks\nYou know what it is important to change it when needs to be changed because I remember in the Twenty years it's been as a home inspector I'd seen filters that folks put in with great intentions and then never touched it again for two years and in fact if you do that I guess it could become unsafe I think it also becomes\nAlmost something you put on the list of when you're going to change the batteries on smoke detectors right and it's an annual thing it should be the change of season we're doing everything we're going to do as we hunkered down for the winter let's get our smoke detectors and and what's changed the water filled", "show_name": "The Money Pit", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "28"}
