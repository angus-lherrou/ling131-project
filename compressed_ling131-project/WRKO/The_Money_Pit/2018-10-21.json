R. A. on I owe you to the IRS I liked that will have to you know is your eye or re on high or low you to the IRS and we talked about that a little bit today on the program\nAnd we also there's a chapter on a long term care coverage\nOf speaking of long term care that's that comes up not all the time but often enough when I'm meeting with people because it's all about providing quality of care in the future and if you have assets protecting those assets I'm\nSpeaking of long term care\nHow about having long term care without having a long term care coverage without having to pay a premium ever at like it's available now proper planning right guaranteed not maybe not\nBy ... stay healthy and I don't need it so that so available and to be discussed also I have a chapter on wheels and trust in the in the book\nThe survivor income gap and I put that together with pension max which we talked about today at some length for life um\nAnd there's a a little at a title that of one of the chapters that I like particularly\nIt's called running out of gas in retirement and uh the the ... I I just want to read the beginning of that chapter if you will and the chapter as I said is running out of gas in retirement\nRunning out of gas while driving late at night it really pales in comparison to running out of money while in retirement sure\nYet that's likely to happen to most who have not planned properly due to increase the lifespan living longer obviously inflation ever increasing taxes\nIncreasing costs of health care stock market volatility and loss and other factors yeah we do have uh\nWe've been to the environment is you know ... ... when you were confronted with them but\nAnd and we're experiencing them experiencing all of this with regularity but we don't really focus on it right but when you start to list all of those issues\nThat's pretty dramatically like to do and you start to get serious planning Everytime it ... you know you go then you start running and only then then you start saying ha ha and those are the issues those are the those are the issues from which I have to protect myself\nSo it's important to remember that guaranteed sustainable\nAnd if desired inflation protected income I'm In addition to any Social Security or pension is required for most of us who will experience\nTwenty five years or more in retirement that's daunting yes that is you call that a what a second what did you call it a ... a final job in ... it's the next job at your next professional position mhm are you prepared for it or you leaving a chance\nWeld chance will be with our chance would be buying a lottery ticket for our our record to what is the Powerball or whatever I that's that's taking place this week that's to chance\nAnd let me touch on you make this point a lot and I like this point a lot because this is this is essentially the thing we need to accomplish in the show you talk about what people die coming down ever since then going up at risk and\nThe Everest in this case is your retirement and many people put a lot of emphasis for a lot of years in accumulation which is obviously important more money accumulate the better off you are of course but\nThey spend a little time thinking about the distribution and that's where the mistakes I made it so the proper planning of the distribution of the assets that you get to mutilated this is what you have to start thinking about you've done a good job hopefully done a good job\nAccumulating money for retirement now's the time to start thinking about how you distributed the best way possible you've\nClimbed that mountain right now you have to negotiate coming down the mountain and how you're going to do that\nAnd while accumulation is hard work the distribution takes branch it's ... you need to do the smart you need to take the time to do proper planning on this\nYou know and again it it it doesn't matter what the endeavor is of course we focus on the endeavor of retirement but whatever the endeavor is ... ... which you're on to ... to ... which you were to embark\nIt requires a plan to call it a road map you know you want to get to a particular destination to getting your car and you're just drive without knowing you know you'll end up stopping all over the place and asking for directions the out of war every battle is won before it's fought so you are I think who was that the one that doesn't that's what\nBill Bill Belichick quoted it but it's that's from the out of war\nThe auto war now we hope we've been formed ... we hope we've made you think and\nPlease believe everything that you are hearing because these are real strategies they're

to Boston and my heart radio stations\nAround the ABC News\nOn a project like this is critical there's really nothing that that doesn't have a lot of attention paid to it and wouldn't talk about that heating and cooling so you're telling me earlier that this is such a sophisticated system you could actually heat and cool at the same time you get the perfect temperature on our show all your\nListeners know that you know the the the world's going crazy with these really superficial heat pumps you know you you know the names Mitsubishi L G ...\nAnd they are reached the point now that they are just so efficient as it gets you enough heat evil in zero degrees outside the heat of building in a zero degree New England when winter\nBut you always had either decide that you were going to be in Haiti mode or ... the whole system how to be the heating and cooling right well this what we introduced here for the first time in residential application we've been able to do it and commercial before is a thing called ... recovery\nAnd he recovery is different and has a BIG Magic box outside\nAnd it has three refrigerant lines that go inside to the building to these distribution boxes and then once we're inside we can have up to twelve different air handlers or different delivery methods to building but the key\nIs that we can simultaneously heat and cool a building for the first time ever well that's the first time ever in residence\nWow so it was always in commercial you could always right so now that means the son could be coming in the south side of a full day and you need to cool that top floor Sunnyside bedroom\nWell when you do that you're going to gather some of that son's he's into the refrigerant and then normal you just send that down to outside it to be wasted on what we can do here as we can say no we can we we can use this energy to good effect and we can hate the north side groups\nWell the final piece of this makes this thing such a breakthrough in my opinion is we get one additional heat exchange off of this system right\nAnd that heat exchange has refrigerant into it\nAnd we can use that waste heat that heat that we would've dumped outside to also heat the water for faucets [laughter] so this is now well all on whatever these Trump that everybody has dropped about this for a long time so we're we're incredibly excited we love being on the front end\nYou're going to be able to watch this project yeah wow yeah see I don't see how it also rules out um before I let you go and ask you one more thing now obviously this building has to be very tight and you use that technique here I think it's called aero stealing\nSeattle for infiltration that sounds really fascinating about that Dr ... so ... was the stuff that I think seals the duct worked right same company came out with the next generation of single arrow barrier and this is a way\nThat a ... a house on the construction or an existing house that has incredible infiltration conceal itself up to a level that you could you could never before [noise] so what they do is they put the building under a little negative pressure they push\nHer out in a row yeah so they're pulling putting fans to push push year out to the building against the ... the walls and then they put these little\nAdam ... stations all around and what happens is that this find missed that is in the air if it finds a crack anywhere at that point it goes near the crack\nThe velocity increases when that ... those air so buried here so ... beads right go through an coagulating and will seal it's like it was like a ... ... it's unbelievable and so\nWe saw this thing that this was already tight building right or be tight but we saw this thing go down I think by ... percent less so uh [noise] and what what I like is that\nThere are houses that were done on low bid there were housed the nova bury their houses that you are would be desperate and with this you can actually do it in a retrofit you have to\nYou'd have to cover horizontal surfaces you know because you know your couches and the floors with plastic but you could literally retro for the house and they have this computer gauge that you watch it shows you what the infiltration is you know\nThree hundred see a family who say that you're going to watch you know literally watching ... pull your eyes crazy fantasy I think that's going to be a major breakthrough for for building the building trades well\nGreat work as usual really exciting jak thanks so much being a part of the money and thanks I mean ... regulations on the forty nine
