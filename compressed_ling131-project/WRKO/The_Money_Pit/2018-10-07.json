{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Level of confidence that they will have the financial resources to live comfortably in retirement and here's something startling\nAccording to the employer Benefit Research Institute a by the way Lew I have touted not touted\nI've I've spoken to them before they are a very um a well known in the industry Institute that does a lot of surveying and um surveys if you will and compiling information but according to the Employee Benefit research Institute\nOn me or fourteen percent of American workers\nConsider themselves poised\nFor a financially comfortable retirement or\nHow 'bout that hasn't said Hi actually well that that is\nAgain most people haven't saved enough\nWe've had for years the demise of the defined benefit plan what I eat pension plan\nUm and the and and again it comes down and and we have more longevity so there's every reason for concern than what we can do with our planning is away a lot of those concerns and set them aside so\nYou know and some people and I I saw there was just very recently\nI saw people or some people's accounts that were than they were they are I shouldn't say war they are just several years to retirement and they're trying\nTo make it up and they'd been placed and they didn't want to be placed this way and more of a high risk more of an aggressive stance what their assets well when you are you know hire a a a more aggressive [noise]\nThere's a likelihood that when the market corrects itself\nOr that if you if you've been in a more aggressive stance\nOr that may not be so pretty when the market corrects yes\nSo now they've been in that they'd been position that way but there are accounts\nAt this point because their equity directed are looking very strong so isn't it wonderful opportunity and a perfect time to do a little reassessment take those ships off the table if you will\nThat have done well and instead of remaining in an aggressive\nI'm less risk averse position you can now take those assets\nPut them into the strategies we talked about and uh I don't I think we've done uh hopefully a pretty complete job this program or discussing the availability of those special risk free principle protected strategies and if the market continues to go up\nYou'll be on the count will continue to grow up blue and when the market corrects\nIt won't impact you adversely\nAgain it's protecting yourself in this a correction that we're overdue for this than Mac and they were overdue for without giving up the opposition and the market without without checking out of the gains that says Iceland checking out of the law says\nYou know there was much in this article and I'm going to take some from it and and discuss next week because it's it was pretty valuable not that everybody loves statistics but it it helps put things in perspective and our listeners can kind of identify with\nAnd what category they may be [noise] um and you know if you find yourself in that\nFourteen percent a category of of American workers are individuals that that you're a the only that fourteen percent who are that's a relatively small percent\nUm than your poised for a that you you feel things will be comfortable for you or are you absolutely certain of that or does it look like you will be\nConsidered that and if if the the balance of the eighty six percent of view out there who aren't poised for a comfortable\nThe time it shouldn't you do something about it and consider sitting down whether it's what step for someone else with whom you might feel comfortable but I think if you're listening to this program hopefully you'll realize that we have the solutions that you need and make yourself\nPut yourself into that percentage of people who will be poised for not just stay comfortable more comfortable retirement who I cannot tell you how many people with whom I meet\nThat don't know what income but going to have on shore or are in a very vulnerable position with their assets\nAnd we completely turn that around\nAnd we create incomes not ... not only for individuals like we discussed for Deborah a few moments ago but for couples and we and and also to be able to show and and actually a guarantee about survivor income to the surviving spouse ... income\nLevels that these people never thought that they would be able to achieve\nThey said well we'd like to have that but we didn't know we could and we're creating those income levels for the individuals on a guaranteed contractual basis for not just guesswork\nCalled traditional financial planning doesn't allow you to know how you're set for retirement because it doesn't allow you to know how much money you're going to have ten years from now you know seven years from now ten years Fifteen Twenty years from now because it depends on a lot of market and then last capability and they are capable losing money so how can you know\nAbout her new well and and again to to briefly spate we can make sure with one of our strategies regardless of what happens in the market you've got to turn your window you can have a seven year but I'm using a turn your window whatever you put in\nTo be used for as from from which to take retirement income we will make sure that that amount will absolutely positively guaranteed double in ten years from which there taking come regardless of of economic circumstances\nAnd again the information tend to go yeah about ... again remember pure pure Carmen four one K. participant and as we discussed and you want to discuss\nOptions are available to reach out to me they seven seven seven to zero Ninety five hundred seven seven seven to zero Ninety five hundred for the voice prompts\nPlease leave a message and it will be ... will be calling you back okay and again through the website download the swarm portfolio sweeping while at night it's it's a pamphlet really not a book it's a pamphlet and\nYou just find a tremendously informative\nBats Hoover website income for life planning dot com and remember what I Do the planning that I Do is planning that Dr\nRobert Martin and Dr Robert Shiller have been espousing for years and there are some of the brightest individuals that exist so if you'd like some of that import reach out to me will be with you next week thank you for listening and uh let me make a difference in your life as well blue\nThank you\nAnd now look back at this week in history\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety an act of Congress creates Yosemite National park almost such natural

games dies in Baltimore at age sixty six following a brief illness\nDuring a career that spanned nearly Thirty Years' Clancy fan more than two dozen novels a number of which were made into movies and popular video games\nThat you look back at this week in history\nBy Americans and you don't have to be a race car driver to know that life can be more drama some of it you can't control like mechanical issues high winds and rain delays but there's some drama you tend to skip\nThe trauma that comes with not having your high school diploma or equivalency find free adult education classes near you finished your voice of Boston\nYou walk about one hundred point seven to UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio stations\nMichelle friends and at a rally in Topeka, Kansas last night before a cheering crowd President Trump taking a victory lap raptor Brett Kavanaugh was voted in as Supreme Court\nYeah so that's going to be a problem because your neighbors gonna dump a lot of water your weight can you chat with your neighbor about fixing this\nOr diverting\nI ... I don't like that but I think the ground\nWell what'd you do is you you basically it's kind of like road rules or you know you hire a drink\nAnd and essentially what has happened here is you've got 'em an unjust war anyway you can so I Would tell you this though that oversized gutters in both houses\nSo instead of uh foreigners gutter I Would put a six inch because they caught a lot less frequently I Would try to have the down spouse discharge the lowest part of the property and I would extend the down spouses awards not collect around the foundation either over grader or underground extend them and get them out\nIf I were still collecting water in the space between the two homes where we do is open French grain\nAnd basically that's a trench that's um you know roughly twelve to Eighteen Inches square\nAnd then you put some a stone in the bottom of it you lay up her for a pipe in stone and then you put more dirt and stone around it and essentially what happens is is the water collection that area goes into the pipe and runs out there's a type of French grain that's actually pre made these days where you don't have to do all stone thing\nUm and then you'll find that at home centers where it's\nIt looks like a plastic ... wrapped in a cloth that has what looks like packing peanuts in between the coffin\nAnd the and the pipe itself and that sort of the aggregate not condoning one piece but however you do that you got to put that drains to pitch so at least about a quarter ... clicking there go somewhere\nAnd that's the key you got to find that were that somewhere is you know if it's in the backyard great if it's the front yard you might be able to\nTo drop it in the street is this how much you do that but you got to manage that water if you don't manage the water is going to have no place to go down saturate those foundation walls and it will show up as a leak in both basements potentially\nBut you can ... you know if you managed the war if you search on our website how if you search on our website money dot com um about leaky basements you'll you'll find that if you look at how to solve all the basement and stop ... once\nYou'll find some really good post that we don't use on and some of the basement content on the site is uh some of the most popular in that we have no actually walk you through this step by step and show your own ways that are that this causes the floods OK\nOkay and there's room for that and the thing that you have this like the ...\nOh there's plenty of room for it with less [laughter]\n[laughter] okay I was in good luck with that project aims you thanks so much for calling us an easy money but\nCome on down you've got the pet what can we do for you today\nI have a brand new a whole team on hold and ah I see a crack from outside and the ... and when it rains I'm seeing 'em in the basement or some water leaking also\nIs it two separate problems Kamara says the same as we can get rid of the Iraq\nIt's exciting for me because it just didn't know that only I can see the water in the basement\nAnd what kind of foundation is just poured concrete concrete block when I checked concrete poured concrete okay she'll correct or not unusual in New foundations\nThere's a lot of settlement that goes on in the first few years of of a home and very often cracks will form and so I wouldn't be too worried about the fact that you had a crack 'em I Would ... would use a concrete car Lewis cotton specifically designed for concrete quick ... makes\nA number of these products are going through the sheer well and keep the water out and you could do this inside or outside I'd probably do both sides of the crack\nAnd you can choose a clear or a color matches the concrete so won't be too obvious but I Would simply seal than up um when you get water that comes through a crack occurring fall it's very simple section in just as it as if you have one that comes in other places in the\nBasement is really an issue of managing water in your case you got to crack this open like that I Would simply steel and I don't think that crack is surprising or indicative of major structural problem in of itself it got worse than it could be an issue but if it's just a small crack for right now in the wall\nUsually it's something it's caused by concrete shrinkage and it's not likely to repeat itself\nIn the ... what will fix it do you think that because of that the property that new way to go down than let's say\nAs long as it's what I think as a normal crack and it's not a serious one nation problem if they're gonna have no effect on you would like to have it inspected by structural engineer and certified that you know that it's a with a normal tolerances are it's it's not going to get the worst or you know whatever but I mean you want it certified by an independent\nStructural engineer the kind of have to live by the report that they provide you either they're not going to just you know try to ah you know sway age the homeowner and they're going to make sure that they document the condition of presenting has to be done they'll let you know OK\nOkay Kate thanks thanks on the ... thanks so much for

general contractor for TV's this old house welcome Tommy thank you it's nice to be here you know inadvertently laying down a hot pot are scratching the surface can definitely want to be one of those sort of oh no\nHoly cow other words that I Can't say on the radio moment that you're saying right I mean how do you get out of those problems are those types of things fixable\nOr in some cases if the hot pot is down there and it's just bubble the kind of a job you may be able to re heat it\nSounds silly that hot pot losing ... now have you got to read it to break back down but you actually got to soften the adhesives underneath the contact that Egypt and sometimes you can actually re fasten it if you have a role or take out your old roller derby rolling the dough and rule that countertop until it cools down and sometimes you can re fasten\nEven without getting additional he's been there just to get it to re stick itself sort of you right away\nExactly exactly this is sort of you've got to react as it's happening\nThat well no you can eat and then he hit the Pentagon and\nPut it down but some of hard to monitor it smarter to do it right away oh my God I guess\nWhat if you have a physical damage in the countertop um is there a way to kind of do selective surgery and just replace one one chunk of it yeah you can cut it in a cutting board is probably the easiest way if it's if the cutting board is in a good location right um but uh basically you're essentially cutting out the area of limited and replacing it with a cutting board\nHere than they have different kinds of cutting boards you can get a solid surface cutting board you can get to where they got like a ... you can get a wooden cutting board\nYou know what the beautiful things about doing that and somebody else will come into your house and that we can go wow I didn't I couldn't ... great value does well it it was kind of up to ruin it and then you can get one hand\nIt's sort of done as like a drop and Trey almost at the drop and think would be installed the ... ... sits in\nThe summer they have this little metal ring that goes around it and you're like metal ring in some of the kind of boy just cutting boards fit in that little ring dropping and you can actually pop it out flip it over so when you wear it out if you use and like I wouldn't\nWant you know one of the other common thing that I've noticed when we first bought our house we had a lovely Pepto bismol pink a laminated happen you know while we lived with it for a while until they could afford the granite\nThat edge just kept popping off and I feel like that's always one of the areas that failed first yeah what can you do to make that sort of either re attached to replace it\nWith lots of times you can take an edge it's usually the corner you're dead right on it's usually the corner because you're running by that comment and you get a check on it once you've caught it you've got to eat and try to heat it back on with an iron soften it gently the glue and then you push it back on with a rural or something from\nA and if that doesn't work and you can't get it all the pieces broken out you're going to have to replace it and you gonna have to find peace somewhere in the kitchen usually beside the stove or the refrigerator or in a dead corner you may be able to steal a peace right out of that corner and patch it right into that piece that that's been damaged\nAnd you don't use any buffer between the iron and the and the laminate itself you don't need like a towel just to prevent further burning", "show_name":
