walk working in one hundred and twenty seven to UCLA HD to Boston and I are radio stations\nI'm Sherry Preston Monday we'll be the first for parents for the south Florida Man arrested and accused of mailing more than a dozen package bombs this week fifty\nBoth these you know a lot of people listening in their late fifties early sixties ten Fifteen Years ago wasn't that long ago like right two thousand eight when the when the patriots went undefeated no seven that was already eleven years ago you know what I write off you are a forty five now you're fifty six and I get really starting to get closer to that retirement day and so I Would I Want to mention here is like\nIf you think of I I'd say ... but a lot of clients ask us in in ... we have different events for our clients and whatnot now so you know it's\nYou know I really appreciate you know how you guys have grown over the years and you know what's the biggest thing what's the main difference or why are you growing so much and I know my answer is obviously number one we've ... we've always told our staff and in each other put the ... if you put the client's first everything will work out in the end which is should be a role for every company does some and then secondly I think that having uh\nPlace especially with the time constraints now of people that are listening and in in a lot of our clients they don't have time to spend sixty have sixteen meetings to have their to go to this person to do their Social Security analysis and in person to do their\nA decent tax analysis on their portfolio this person to manage their money [noise] so are most companies right now\nHave they manage your money so you pay them a fee\nIn return they manage your portfolio they pick stocks mutual funds bonds index funds ATF they put a portfolio together meat you once a year to you if you're doing good or bad\nAnd then what's the last ten years had been really good and then you move on and so we said that's that's good and that's a good planning but if you're paying one percent a year\nTo just do that to me that's not a ton of value and so that's H. P. financial we build our clients an investment plan that's managed in the market according to their risk tolerance which is a big that's what everyone does in our in our industry\nBut then we also take it one step further as part of our retirement road map planning a trademarked plan that we do for our clients\nBack to rebuild the investment plan we build I'm also an income plans for our clients have an income plan\nThey know where their money's coming from in retirement soon have to worry about hey where's my paycheck going to come from when I retire because retirement can be Thirty years of unemployment so you have an income plan that lasts as long as you do with inflation you have an investment plan next step you look at his taxes\nHere in in Europe are there ways we can save on taxes for you and the next generation maybe we can save you ten twenty thousand this year maybe nothing next year maybe more afterwards but each year you have to make sure that someone's taking a look at taxing goes in your portfolio ongoing\nNext to health care I mean the study of cost of health care goes up and up and up and so if we neglect that if we don't look at health care as a retirement expense again we're missing the boat\nFinal piece state planning and legacy how do you take all the assets that you've worked so hard to save up and pass them to the next generation so\nAgain that's when I asked when I'm going back to the question how we grown so much over the last ten Fifteen Years since we started in two thousand three is taking care of our clients putting them ahead of ourselves obviously pushes anyone can say it sounds like you know normal\n[laughter] you know talk that cliche and you will but it's true and the second thing is obviously having a plan our clients have a full retirement road map to get through and through retirement it's not just hey here's a bunch of money invested for me and tell me if I made money or lost money it's a plant it's a road map and that's\nAnd it looks at income investments taxes health care and legacy\nNot only in the beginning but ongoing it's not et cetera and forget it so if you're listening [noise]\nIf you're not sure maybe you think you have a plan but maybe you just have a bunch of statements\nMaybe you have an advisor and you're not sure if they're doing all these things for you or maybe you've been like not talked about so busy working so busy with family and lifestyle and just you haven't had time like many people that come in to see us like you know I've been wanting to do this for years\nWell don't let that don't want these years go by where you procrastinate and then not having a plan comes back to bite you and so if you want to take advantage of a no obligation review we would love to sit down with you we have offices in Plymouth\nWill burn Hyannis Westboro in brain tree type to do is pick up the phone just let us know that you want to know obligation retirement roadmap review at one of our offices and you can call right now the number to do so is eight hundred\nTo two seven Seventy seven Seventy seven I get one more time that's eight hundred to two seven seven seven seven seven and you can also go to our website and register for a meeting there at S.

[noise]\nAnd this segment we're going to go through some of the retirement rules that we think are important to live by especially if you want some lower stress in your retirement you have to plan for certain things ahead of time not just at the last second when you're retired and it's like now we're so chief and ... you know you've\nYou know obviously the three of us have been partners for over Fifteen Years now and when you're taking on a new client or you're having that initial discussion about retirement what what's the what's one of the rules that you talk about something that they have to think about\nIt's funny because most of the people that when they come in they're\nExcited to start this potential next phase their life they're excited to think about what retirement could be and it's really a fun conversation 'cause yeah we're talking about numbers were talking about what it is that they want\nBut it's also more about what it is that they want to do so it the the problem that I see you know ... is as people do retire and they start to you know live that retirement life it's a mental change in regards to the fact that now they're starting to take money out of their assets so many people have\nBecause think about it you've been conditioned to save save save for since you were ten twenty twenty thirty Thirty years of your life may be more and you know putting all this money we knew senior counts continually go up up up because you're putting this money away now you've climbed that mountain is starting to head back down and it's like oh my gosh you know now I'm starting to see my account maybe\nStay the same or deplete or however it is because it just depends on how much you need so I think one of the biggest things that people have is they're excited\nBut it's a mental block in regards to spending actually going out and spending money while I was talking with that ... with clients to go that way you know you spend you know to keep this echo your point I mean it's\nTough is like a switch from saving working and saving up to now spending and not working you know working in saving to being spending an unemployed\nIt like many of our clients have been such good savers a lotta times after your mind our clientele you remember we built a plants that you can have a hundred thousand a year with inflation rely only taking eighty thousand dollars you want to leave it gets three million instead of two point eight million in a matter so after\nAnd after a while they they they said they wanted to come in three or four years ago but like a lot of other folks they'd been procrastinating\nSo as we go through the story I Want you to think about whether or not it makes sense to come in for a review sea of some of these areas that we're talking about makes sense to you as they did to mark and Karen\nSome arc and Karen really they had a few concerns that came in from the radio show and when they first met I could tell they were a little apprehensive you know the it's not something you do every day to go through\nYou know open up your finances and share your life story and what your goals are in family goals and you know income goals and just a it's a big deal and they so they were a little apprehensive just nervous just warming up a little bit once but once we\nGot to know each other and got to know their situation\nIt became apparent we were going to be able to help them out quite a bit and so I was talking to mark and Karen in that first meeting and they had really a few major goals\nNumber one I remember there sixty two years old and they came in a few months ago so this isn't an old case they really want to make sure they retire between age sixty five in sixty six they've saved up bought a million thirty thousand dollars so they had about nine hundred and Seventy thousand dollars in the market\nIn about fifty to sixty thousand dollars in bank account so little over a million dollars major things they were concerned about is when I retire\nWhereas my income going to come from how am I going to have the income I Need to cover all my bills and not worry about running out of money because they were only going to have Social Security there was no pension there was no rental income there were only going to have Social Security income\nSecondly they were concerned about volatility\nThey said you know what dark I've heard your show I Know the market's been up for ten years in a row do what you know I'm concerned that if the bottom job so how is that gonna affect our retirement and I remember Karen saying like you know Mark's worked really hard and and and I've worked really hard and we want to retire in the last thing we want to do\nIs not to plan properly and have to go back to work [noise]\nThe other thing they were concerned about is a state planning they were concerned about just having a solid state planned for their like a trust will that it that they had never set up for their children [noise]\nAnd then finally they were concerned about fees they had an advisor they had they had worked with for many many years and they didn't really know the total fee they were paying they knew they were paying a management fee of around one point two five percent\nBut they didn't know how much the underlying assets cost them on top of that like the mutual fund cos so again major concerns were how much they're paying fees estate planning how much risk or volatility was in their portfolio and how much income they can draw from when they retired or do they have enough they needed about eighty thousand dollars per year\nBut that was after taxes key they needed really over a hundred thousand dollars close to run around a hundred thousand dollars gross so after taxes they could have eighty thousand dollars now than it needs to go up every year great point and that has to go for inflation\nSo the first thing easy solution based on their situation they were able to use the violence has spent technique with Social Security\nWhich some people can't use but basically when mark triggers his Social Security uh sixty six\nThen at that point Karen can take half of his and delay hers even longer set by the time she's Seventy she can now get hers and it goes up so that was a quick strategy that made him a good chunk of money very quickly secondly we looked at from an income scenario and an investment scenario\nThey had we we looked at their uh their portfolio to see how much risk they were taken and so this is if you forget everything else about the show to me having volatility control in your plan when you're close to\nOr in retirement might be the most important thing you do for your retirement plan because too much volatility early on in their retirement can literally wipe out a retirement and we've seen numerous examples\nUnfortunately of of people that have come to us in ... or a potential clients that have come to us too late where it was too late to do anything\nFortunately marketing Karen had said that this money and but when I ran an analysis think of like\nAs a a risk score zero to a hundred so if all your money is under your mattress well I guess that's an is if it's all your money is in a fireproof safe in a place that no one can touch it and that would be a risk or like a zero\nAnd if all your money is an Enron stock well that would be like a hundred and Ninety nine and so they came in and they had a risk score of uh Seventy so you're probably wondering what does that mean to them what to Seventy\nSo when I ran the analysis on their current portfolio they told me dark where we're concerned are advisor we've told him we wanted to take on less risk as we get older we're concerned that this is not being done\nWhen I looked at their portfolio and they came in for the second meeting\nI said hey mark Karen you're you're absolutely right you know if the way it stands at a Seventy\nIf the market where to go up if we had like a two thousand Thirteen tight market where we consider that a bull market like a really good strong upward market you'd ... you'd probably earned about thirty percent at your current risk or which is what should a quaint two uh two hundred and Ninety thousand dollar game\nHowever if we had a a really bad year like two thousand eight\nAt your current risk level that would be a loss of three hundred and thirty seven thousand dollars in I'm In and at that point it remember mark looking at ... and he's like that's like that's about that's the most that's over a third\nOf our entire life savings and they looked and they like we can't afford to take this risk and I was like what you know why do you think that you're ... or did not do this is you know why did how come that you know they just\nThey're going to lie to do the ... where you're telling people you're telling me must be telling your advisor that you want to reduce your volatility and so [noise] so think about it at risk or of a Seventy you could make thirty percent and lose thirty five percent basically in a good down your so for them they can make two hundred Ninety thousand in a good year\nBut they lose three hundred thirty seven thousand in a bad year I said why don't we change what if we bring you to a thirty four on the wrist scale so against scaled zero to a hundred and thirty four you can make ... you know fourteen percent in a really good year which isn't as good as thirty percent\nButton it really down your like two thousand eight\nYou'd probably lose about Thirteen percent which is a lot better than losing thirty five percent ... so if we had a ... is the way we set them up if they had a two thousand eight type scenario in this general terms but\nIf they lost a hundred and thirty thousand dollars on a million they're not going to be high fiving me but it they can deal with it\nAnd then it's ... were they were and now they lost money at the same thing happened in their portfolio they lost three hundred and forty thousand dollars and so I so I told them you know the way we set up their plan is we had some money in principle protected type accounts that don't participate in the downside of the market\nBut they still get some market up side\nAnd then the rest of their money that is in the market they don't need even though they're retiring and for years to retire at sixty six [noise]\nThey don't need for many years so they can they can afford to take that risk for the portion of their money only then finally we talked about fees so I have the the report right in front of me on nine hundred and sixty seven thousand dollars they were paying one point seven percent\nOr just under Seventeen thousand dollars a year and fees ... to me that was very high especially for the value that they were getting ... and so what I didn't I didn't talk about here so initially think about this kind of think about where they were before before they had a ton of risking their portfolio\nThey had NO PLAN on how they're going to draw their income\nThey had no state plan or for the next generation and no one was telling them how to how to save taxes and for that for all those for all that lack of planning they're being charged about Seventeen thousand dollars a year ... so our fees were ended up being a lot lower than that thank God for them but not only they reduced their risk they reduced the volatility\nThey had a plan in place so that when they retire at sixty six\nThey know exactly where their incomes going to come from and it's not going to be and it's going to be there for them take take them to him through retirement so\nI Can't think of before and after a lot of you right now are sitting there like Mark and Karen where with NO PLAN your retiring in three to five years\nSo that you have an adviser that maybe hasn't built your plan or if he if he or she has built your plan great they're doing a great job if you don't have a plan\nOr maybe you have a plan or maybe you have an advise that you just you know I have a I have portfolios I have a plan but I don't know if it's if it does all these things that you're talking about if it accounts for all these things I don't know if I'm taking on too much risk\nYou'd be a great candidate to get a second opinion to sit down with us to at least know how much risk taking in your portfolio and how much income you can generate off your ... portfolio so last as long as you do it's important to know without the stats for all these years\nHow do you go into retirement blindly without having this plan in place so we want to help you put that together on your end all you have to do to get this started to pick up the phone and give us a call we have offices plum if\nWe're in Westboro Hyannis in brain surgery\nSo come to the office that makes more sense for you but book there have you\nStarted you know don't procrastinate marking Karen now\nThey're not retired yet but they have a plan knowing that when they retire this is all set up for them it's all set ahead of time which is one of the main retirement rules we suggest is to set up a plan prior to retiring\nSo give us a call ... eight hundred to two seven Seventy seven Seventy seven we do a few appointments available in October to sit down with us a call now a hundred to two seven\nSeven seven seven seven I go to S.
