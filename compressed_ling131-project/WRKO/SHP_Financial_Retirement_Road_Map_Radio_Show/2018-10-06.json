point seven till UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio stations\nAround the ABC News\nI'm Michelle friends and the clocks ticking down to unexpected afternoon vote on the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh today Stephanie Ramos is on Capitol Hill unless\nBut also specifically just because of putting my mind is the tax planning you should have diversification within ... in your tax absolutely you know do you have a higher rate money ... money and after tax money you know ... you know do you have different areas because we love that so\nSo the whole idea of diversification and applies to planning to making sure you have all five areas it applies to investments in flight it applies to specifically within your taxes themselves\nI mean these are just all areas that need to be focusing on for a true comprehensive plan\nAnd most people that I say I'm going to continue to say this until everyone has to play they deserve it will come in and they have\nA bunch of investments and or like you said ... maybe they have like a million to in IRAs and like thirty thousand and raw and ... and ... and in and checking in savings and there's ... there's not really a lot of balance there from attack standpoint so we try to create tax vacation we try to ... acid diversification\nAnd we try to create planning diversification meaning everyone if you're thinking about retirement when you're younger and you're working you're just putting money away you don't really in in in essence obviously I think everyone should have some sort of an estate plan but what you're doing is ... is just investment planning\nYou're not worried about income because you have an income from your job\nYou're not really too worried as you know health care situations could've come up but most likely as you're older you're not ... ... or a ton about that\nWhen you're getting close to retire if you if all you have is investments thinking about what your plan is right now you just have a bunch of investments\nOr did you have a fully written plan that looks at income meaning where is your income going to come from when you retire not just from one portfolio but how is it going to come out\nAnd they'd be going to be all pre taxes are going to be tax free what's the combination do you know how to plan your income so last as long as you do and make sure your accounts are set up properly to give you the income you need to retire and then we look at investments that's what as you get close to retirement\nWe'll talk about this later in the show but I think you need to look at investments maybe giving some up off the upside it's okay if you don't hit thirty percent in a good year maybe you only get twenty two\nBut that's okay because you're not maybe if you get twenty two when it's up thirty maybe you'll only lose Fifteen when it's down thirty if that makes sense so really you want to have some balance from an investment standpoint in diversification\nThen we talked about taxes how do you create tax efficient plan as you get close to retirement in ... in retirement as well as leaving money to the next generation we talk about health care and we talk about estate planning and legacy planning leaving assets to those who you care most about\nIt so that's what it all comes down to is having a plan that covers\nEach and every area not just a pile of investments and so we think think about in your lifetime what you've done to get to where you are now and what does that mean to you and do you think you just want to have a bunch of investments and hope it goes right or do you want to have a plan that make you know looks at every single area to make sure it's uncovered\nSo you can retire with a little bit more confidence\nYou know going into your these years can be twenty Thirty years of retirement\nThat sort of thing and so that's an order short on time but like\nThe whole idea of making sure that people are aware of how much work this is there's so much to it and so I that's why I just want to really emphasize I Know I cut you off that that that's the whole you know that's why you know 'cause I appreciate when people are like oh you know what to do it myself it's like a appreciate that 'cause I Love doing this too\nBut it's a full time job yeah so do you really want to do that in your retirement\nIf you're in some people do if you don't want if you don't want to travel as much and do as much and and be able to run everything that's fine we completely respect that\nBut if you're not sure or maybe you say hey maybe I Want to get a second opinion maybe you're someone who does nothing and doesn't want to do some retirement and wants to rely on a professional you'd want to come and obviously and sit down or maybe you're someone who's not sure and say maybe I Want to run some of this myself maybe I Need a second set of eyes\nAgain that might be a reason to come down with us either way we have appointments available for you to sit down with our team and I

LA Times areas you might be missing he said exactly that's what I'm here for but I just wanted to you know I'm not you know I'm not sure I'm gonna move for as you want to get a second look at my situation I said sure I said tell me about your situation\nAnd he said he'd have to have had this adviser for a twenty six twenty five twenty six years\nIs like I really love 'em I've you know we've become good friends over the years and I said well you know ... ... what do you love about him like what\nWhat do you say that he's done a good job as a gay we've made a good amount of money over the years but he also takes me to golf we go to dinner and lunch here and there and I said well do you love him or do you love the relationship where they get kind of doing that fun the fun things he goes home let's face it out you know who doesn't like a good steak dinner in and around the Gulf\nAnd that's all right let's tell me while you're really here like what are you really here for because obviously something is not is off he's like he finally broke down and was like Derek I'm retiring and for weeks from right now [noise]\nYou know from when we first met obviously and I am asking for two years\nWhat my plan was in in every time I asked my plan is my advisor said hey you know you're going to retire and we'll just start send you a check and you're good and he's like well I heard you're supposed to reduce your risk as you get older there's no no no the market will always come back just retire we'll start sending you a check and you'll be good\nAnd just didn't feel right about that and so a lot of people listening if you're getting that type of advice I and I told him I said there's a chance I don't want to be rude but sometimes you may have outgrown your advisor\nWill in turn to chime in their ... the way that we still I still get that a lot I mean I live I got that two weeks ago you know we we had a workshop at ... you know in in a family came in from that meeting and they said oh yeah I'm actually retiring in six months and\nYeah I ... my invest as an advisor so I said okay what's your plan is that we don't have planned on my ... I still coming to that we do encounter people that are that close to retirement and still don't have something written exactly what they're taking money from\nMentioned the patriots show up to a Super Bowl and like brave about take the field and what's the game plans like what you're talking about we don't have a game plan well matched that see that's just a football game this is your whole life is is retirement\nAnd so he and he also said you know not only that we don't have a plan but we also haven't talked about taxes inflation health care all that stuff as well I said All right and I said what are your main concerns what do you have and they were lucky enough they worked hard and they saved up a little over one point five million dollars between IRAs a little bit and Ross and some some after tax accounts [noise]\nAnd I said what are your main concerns he goes well two things I Need sixty thousand dollars per year\nOff my portfolio and I said why or us I said why why didn't you that you think will that be between that sixty thousand my Social Security in a small pension all of a good chunk of income coming in every year and I said well why do you want that income\nHe's equal number wants to pay the bills number two I Want to buy a motor home and travel the country for a few years and number three I Want to take a big trip every year with my family\nAnd so it can now are getting to the heart of really why you're here\nAnd I said what else are you concerned about he's like I'm really concerned about leaving money behind to list or making sure she'd taken care of\nIf something happens to me that's that's on honorable and and I said you know the reason I Know he really meant that\nIs because if someone says at once I write it down if someone says it twice I Know on it and if someone says it three times I circled it and I was that that paper was circled on the line and everything dies yeah everything on it was a lot of damage that's part of the papers [laughter]\nAnd so I said since you're retiring in in four weeks I'm assuming you advise is already set yourself up for this and he goes yeah I'm sure you already did and I said well you are you sure and you you really open to a second opinion because if we're going to really dig deep into your situation as the number one do you mind if you ask how much you're paying and sees\nHe said oh he takes care of me you know because we were good friends she only charges me point eight five percent per year he's like I Know most people are one one and a half I'm only paying point eight five like that's not bad\nI'm like the Hubble these mutual funds and other things you own he said well no there's no fee and that's just paint pointing five and I said All right do you mind I Know you're paying twenty five but you mind if I just run the analysis for you and just see what you're paying and total he said I Know it's going to be twenty five but go ahead sorry I'm going to do that because you're open to if you really open to it I'm going to run the real Nelson\nSecondly I said how much risk in your portfolio do you have in my question was one point five million what's the most and this is something if you if you're if you've nodded off during my initials talk you hear\nThis is one thing you want to remember 'cause I asked him what's the most you be willing to lose in a given year\nWithout totally losing air being super nervous he saw that one was anything I said Steve come on you got to pay to play this is the market here you have all your money in the market he said find ten percent\nIt and just I mean there that's a great question for all of our listeners should ask themselves how much at this stage in your life how much are you willing to lose before you start hitting the panic button and just taken time and just ask yourself that question how much we're willing to lose at this point in my life and then do you know the answer\nWell he said ten percent found the ... which is a hundred fifty thousand dollars he goes I get nervous when are you saying that but I guess I Am at one point five million if I lost a hundred and fifty I'd be okay I said All right well let's we're going to run your portfolio from arrest standpoint from a fee standpoint\nWe're going to run an income analysis to see if you have enough income and cash flow coming in to cover your needs and achieve their goals and finally a roadmap which outlines of five areas of of our planning process income investments taxes healthcare and like I said\nHe said fine he's leaving we set schedule the second meeting and that's why I said you might have\nNext meeting you bring your wife back you might if you bring Liz back he's got she's not going to want to calm she doesn't she thinks he's meetings a super boring I kind of got a chuckle out of that\nAnd I said well just do a favor tell her Derek said it I think it's important for her to come back and be involved in this process and he said fine that's what we'll see I'll do it I can see what I can do fast forward I'm not going to I don't want to make a story longer than it has to be but when they came back in\n... in between the meetings actually we were running the analysis and it's like it was a different person he said he didn't want to lose a certain amount of money he said he had he was only paying a certain amount of fees and I was looking at the analysis my team ran it was like sure this is Steve and Liz this is not what he thinks he has\nSo he came back in and I walk into the conference room and there Steve next to him is his wife list and she was he was right she was not happy to be they're\nNot really involved but I started talking and going through the situation nonetheless and I said you know you're right Steve you guys both have enough income to cover their selves and he felt he's a good I knew my buys it a good job I said if you both with age Ninety\nAny kind of looked at me and I said if you happen to pass away at Seventy five lives is going to run out of money at eighty so just make sure you love to be Ninety meeting like that too much [laughter] I said also your fees you several point eight five percent at one point five million\nI ran the analysis with your ... advisory fees and mutual funds you're paying one point for six percent per year for Twenty one thousand nine hundred in these endless finally started paying attention looking at the pie series the wire repaying this much money you might pay twenty thousand dollars you know we could do that in terms of travel each year\nAnd then finally I said listen remember the ... member you said the most you could lose off of you at one point five million dollar portfolio\nWas ten percent or you would not be able to you'd be really nervous and he said yeah I said I ran the analysis if we had another down market you would lose over four hundred and fifty thousand dollars and I kind of pause and and and I knew lives was fully ... paying attention she was not born anymore\nAnd she was like listen she looked at her she'll go to Steve and she's like I'm really looking image like what are we doing right now you're we're now two weeks to retiring because two weeks later\nI taught she goes to the issues I told you can retire I don't want you going back to work less foreign fifty thousand dollars what would that even mean and I looked at Steven I said Steve why do you think it is\nThat your advisor never built you a plant why didn't he take the time\nAnd build you a plan to cover all this and I said because here that's HP financial we obviously hope for the best and we have we hope to market as well we have to plan for the worst\nYou know this is great to her and I have obviously become closer now over the years but but you know in in terms of our they've been clients for a while but it was just to see that reaction of her looking at her husband like what are we doing on the loose foreign fifty thousand dollars\nSo I urge you are listening if you're like Steven lives and you maybe think you have a portfolio re thinks you have a plan get it double check it a second opinion because\nI'd have to be wrong have the market had this huge collapse\nAnd then you're sitting there wondering and few years man I Wish it took the time to get this taken care of it which took the time to build a plan so we knew we had a plan to get too into retirement\nIt's too important folks this is your livelihood so\nWe recommend if you take some time we have appointments available to go over\nThis exact thing running now is on your portfolio\nSee how much a paying fees see how much risk you're taking in sea to make sure do you have enough do you have a plan that's going to give you the income that you need
