{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Yeah well the reason you're gastroenterologist did that is because there's just a wealth of studies now that are coming out showing that coal and health and vitamin D levels are connected but ... they're the same studies about breast tell the same studies about prostate health\nThis is like an insurance policy ... you're not to not to take this and it's it's free and\nAnd the other thing I Want to say is you're listening in five years I don't want you to say I didn't know about this I was never told I mean five years from now I don't want you to turn around and say I didn't know about\nI Wish I would've known because you've been polled at right now you're being told you know you can't say you never you never knew about it because I'm telling you right now it's involved for example in a number of places in the country if you walk into emergency room with anything that might be your heart you know what they do\nGet a hundred thousand units right off the bat first thing a hundred thousand years the vitamin D day and then they keep giving\nThem until they let me ask you a question speaking of the cardiovascular system and I know you could probably talk for about thirty minutes on this but some of the information you sent your just fascinating what vitamin D does talk about his role in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system\nAnd same clues we know that heart health is better the closer you lifted the equator we know heart health is better in the summer than the winter but just recently there have been a slew of studies out of the best universities in the world all connecting\nYour vitamin D level to your heart health there's a study for example out of Harvard by a friend of mine professor Edward given each he and his conclusion was pretty stark here it is quote\nLow levels of vitamin D or associated with higher risk integrated man\nAfter controlling for known risk factors that is even\nAfter they control for smoking high blood pressure high triglycerides diabetes all the things known to contribute even after they control for that\nThere was a ... wrong effect of vitamin D day\nAnd it was integrated manner that is if you're really deficient than your risk is much higher if you're a little deficient than your risk is a little higher and we don't have enough studies yet to say that you know if you have heart disease you should take vitamin D although many cardiologist their prescribing it just on the basis of why not\nIt is safe you know five thousand units a day it cannot make anybody toxic five thousand units a day is ten minutes a summer show even five minutes of summer gun shy so the way these doctors are thinking is\nLook what the risk versus what the benefits it looks like from the studies there's a tremendous risk associated with vitamin D deficiency we don't have all the studies we need and we're doing those studies now but it would be unethical to let people remain vitamin D deficient while\nWe're conducting all the studies we need to about heart health or bone health or breast held or prostate health their immune system\nIt would be unethical to let them white vitamin D deficient the problem is that many doctors use antiquated reference ranges and so if you're a level of thirty five they'll tell you that's okay it's not okay [noise] level needs to be fifty or higher and get that adults need five thousand units a day\nAgainst those just tuned in I mentioned earlier you know I go through the health food store looking multi vitamins most of them at best have four hundred I use I mean when you're looking at the the vitamin D that you can buy by itself as a stand alone vitamin most or four hundred I use I saw a couple that were a thousand IU tablets but again that falls far short\nOf that five thousand number and that's what you get with purity here why is that so important\nThere's recently been a study by professor Hany at ... university that shows that when you get your level to fifty\nYour body has enough for all the things that need to do and it begins to store a little bit of the vitamin D just like your ancestors used to store it so if you're a level is less than fifty your body is basically using up all the vitamin D as fast as you take it for all\nThe things that need to think of vitamin D as a mountain spring with a pool at the top right the pool we've always known about it calcium and bone and we've taken enough vitamin D to halfway fill up that calcium and bone pool\nBut all the other pools below with the breath pool the cold and pull the immune system pull all the other polls that are blow it had been basically dry since we've been out of the thought right if you take five thousand units of vitamin D\nThe upper pool over flows and starts filling in all the pools at the bottom the teeth and gum the mood the cognition the bank resell all these pool\nAnd there's enough left over to store a little bit for\nA rainy day and a little bit of a surplus yet\nBut you don't do that unless you're levels around fifty if your level of less than around fifty you use up\nAlmost all of it immediately and that's called chronic substrate starvation wow and that's not a good thing\nBy the way ... vitamin D super formula is not available in stores only directly through purity products you get it in conjunction with their omega three fish oil the free bottled fish oil both of these are thirty days supplies\nAnd all you pay for shipping four Ninety five you can't beat it the phone number one eight hundred six five zero six eight to zero that's one eight hundred six five zero six eight\nTo zero now Dr can now talk to me about the link between vitamin D and body weight what's the research showing well\nMaybe fifty studies out there that show a real simple association the lower your vitamin D the more you weigh the higher your vitamin D ... but that doesn't prove that it's a cause and effect\nBut there were clues includes that we know what about mood that is\nPeople who live closer to the equator way less than people who live far away from the people who live at higher altitude closer to the sun way less than people who live at lower altitude most people experience as people way less than the summer\nThan they do in the winter so those were clues but we don't need those clothes anymore because the explanation of why your vitamin D level is so what we call inversely associated with your weight that is the higher your vitamin D levels ...\nThat's become clear just recently for example a paper in the British Journal of nutrition August of last year they studied women who were dieting\nAnd the women who had the highest vitamin D and takes lost more weight than the women really at the lower vitamin D intake yes and then just a couple of months ago a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial is the highest standard of proof we have in medicine and this was thirty six thousand people\nAnd they just gave them a tiny doses of vitamin D day so we don't have any idea what the full effect is but the women who were taking even this tiny doses of vitamin D were less likely to gain weight than the women who were not take while at a Monday so that's another reason plot\nSince purity is giving away a month's supply of the formula vitamin D formula plus the fish will ... you know of course that there's research that shows that fish or in a self help with weight control so there's reasons to believe the two things together will help now it's not a diet till it's not dramatic you won't just stop eating\nPart of that that is you just feel better you're more and if you're under doing something\nNow don't you know we're sort of run out of time here but I I Want to give you a few minutes tell people why you believe is so vitally important did they give this formula try\n[noise] well you know we've had time to talk about the heart body weight mood but you know we haven't had time really to talk about brain health colon hill press till prostate health pancreatic hill bone hill the immune system\nI could go on and on the main

much fun so great weekend overall my\nYou know all the kids enjoyed as part of their birthday for the year\nLast week and we had the I'm doing a lot with football this year with my two boys playing you know\nIt was really neat because their conference with breast cancer awareness month ... everyone had paint gone and in represented some ... one kid on our team at a picture of like a friend of his that was going through chemo on his homeland embedded in so it was really I Try to teach my kids and it's not it's an I forget this myself ...\nJust like driving around or interact with people every day it's like you have no idea\nSomeone on the other side is even going through right what do you have an down the road and beeping your horn and Jeremy Italy\nAnd think of it this way I mean not not to bring business into it but like you think about the market volatility and we'll be touching on that later on today but you know it's obviously it's extremely important a lot of money that that's that's a that's built into that but you know that's what's really important why don't you go down to things like cancer and people that are fighting it\nRight I teach my kids are you guys don't know how could you have it and maybe it's not always going to do this easy in there's going to be obstacles and just remember when you're talking to someone you know before you judge or say anything I mean you have no idea what's going on behind the scenes and I thought even the patriots did a good job of having the\nPeople come out in the field and gone through or have gone are going through cancer everyone knows someone who was touched by that so\nThat's something we don't want to keep keep going and unfortunately I had to have lost my hearing of the year award so no my ... my way [laughter] but my son last week and he's been begging me for his birthday he's ten he wanted to go to a hundred ... anyone knows ... house probably something you don't bring still\nBut I was like fine he he kept on all his friends wanted to do on like find where to go get paid for all these tickets Fifteen dollars apiece for all his friends waited in line for a ton of time and they start scaring

P. how do you navigate that game\nRight so dark I see this I see this constantly ... I'd say daily if not several times a day 'cause we're seeing multiple clients every day and and the two offices in Plymouth than ins first of all it's it's very very\nIt's endemic it's a very common problem for financial advisors not too familiar rise their clients with the concept of estate planning or especially with trust planning\nAnd how when people pass away there could be some significant taxes that are due and court activity that might happen without planning so to the first step is educating clients and the listeners so that they know that companies like guess HP\nThat do regularly mentioned the value of estate planning and legal planning that's really the crowd you should be with yeah not just someone who's just in it and giving an investment advice pure investment advice I mean there's a place for that the vast majority of clients need an advisor who's going to at least advance the cause of saying to them look\nUpdated trust in a state plant you really need to talk to someone about that the way that I commonly see this and my staff commonly sees this is that after we do estate plans\nMany clients will still say hey do you do you think that my current financial person and it just as investments for me maybe that person's not even in Massachusetts do you think that they can actually put the assets into the trust that you all have just set up that that that process is extremely important process\nCalled funding your trust or moving the assets in connecting them with a new legal plan\nSo again if you want to register for that start to six PM\nAgain that's workshop followed by dinner go to S.

H. P. workshops dot com again that's S. H. P. workshops dot com [noise]\nAll right we know chief everyone stories different everyone's situation is different\nBut given the recent market volatility I thought it was important we were talking off line about you know a situation that not only stories work out with happy endings unfortunately and this one we did it ended up being happy but it was a little bit of time to get there yeah so if you want to bring everyone back to two thousand a I think it was the summer of\nTwo thousand two thousand and they you know a couple that I started to have conversations with about working together marking Gina come into the office they come to\nWorship exactly what we were talking you know you were just talking about and they came in to visit with us after that workshop every member mark you know he came in you know and his work clothes you know you just finished up work to kind of dirty because he's a he's a contract he's out there moving things and building things and doing things like that so you come in\nAnd he was trying to retire in the next three to four months I was his goal and when we started to talk about I had an advisor to write I did have an advisor that he did he was working with three sat down in the conference room I could just see in mark size and even in jeans size because mark has had a lot of stress\nYou know in his career trying to balance he owns his own business he was a sole proprietor\nTrying to balance all these different jobs and he was actually being hands on in some of these jobs as well because he needed to do that I couldn't\nFind help and things like that and you know gene was getting the kind of the brunt of a lot of the ... you know the ... the late nights and things like that so there's a lot of stress on both um therefore you know as a sole proprietor you said you know what I I've had enough I think I've saved enough\nMoney that I could step away from this business\nIn either salad or dissolve it depending on the value and I said okay for his\nMain goals ski ... where the mark and Jean say they want like what would be a certain amount of income to David amount of money\nSo the main goal was you know he needed to generate about a hundred thousand dollars a year and all we had was Social Security so really he just needed a hundred thousand dollars a year so probably about Seventy thousand sixty Seventy thousand off of his ... portfolio at that point however you know we started to talk and said look you know a hundred thousand dollars\nIn two thousand needs a lot different than a hundred thousand dollars and two thousand and Eighteen sure so we we do need to account for inflation and Jean definitely had some concerns\nWhen it came to health care because they were going to be retiring early they needed maybe a little bit even more income up front\nTo supplement and to get them in you know it to get the health care paid for four in the early years before they get on to Medicare and how much that they save head of a one point of this round up to about one and a half million in assets that they've put away a lot of it was pre tax that he'd been putting away through his company and things like that so we sat down\nAgain they they were about a month to month and a half two months away from retiring\nSo what we did is you know took into account the goals that they were trying to accomplish and you know I said look there's a couple of different things that we that we can do for you to limit limits let's take a step back was set up another time for you guys to come in\nAnd let us do what we do for for the families that we work with which is\nWe wanted to take a deep dive into the whole things that they had in the account to give them the potential upside that they can make it a good year in the market and the potential downside did they could lose we also want to assess and take a look at any underlying costs beyond what the advisor was charging them and then when we wanted to do is say hey look you know\nYou have about Ninety five percent of your assets directly in the market in about five percent down at the local banking cash or cash like alternative we needed to develop a strategy that when mark does retire as was said to mark and Jean we need to know where your your money or your paychecks going to be coming from\nIn the short term or even ... throughout retirement what we did we set up another time for them to come down is really nice to kind of take us to step in and take a look at that because they're advisor day they had been working with and never talk to them about building a plant\nWill keep in two thousand seven and eight ... we were coming off a few good years in the market so at the time was that a concern of there's where they can certainly care I don't want to lose part of this one point five million\nI brought that up to them I had to you know you have to yeah because ... like just like we're seeing now you know ten years into a bull market run the market doesn't go up every year forever right that's where we have a very old bull right now I mean literally it's the\nOldest bull market in recorded history it's not the strongest ... the old for a long time so I mean it's you're naive to think it's just going to keep going and that's what I I didn't say that to them but in my mind I said look\nIt's my responsibility as advisor to show them the upside and the downside so when they came back with the results so when they came back you know do good news is they weren't paying a ton of fees that wasn't a big deal to them and that wasn't a big deal to me all however we did address I did take a look at I did want to educate them on the the fees that they were paying\nHowever what was a little alarming to me was\nThe amount of risk that they were taking in their portfolio you know in a good year they stood to make about thirty two percent in a negative view they stood to lose about\nThirty so I was like whoa you know that that's you know that's a big downturn to think about that used to give blood sweat and tears one and a half million dollars if you lose ... hundred thousand yeah if you lose five hundred thousand dollars that that's a big downturn\nWhat they did is they actually you know showing the plan children the income strategy exactly how we would build out their plan reduced some reduced some risk give them some upside but also get what we call that paycheck or the mailbox money whether it's through the market or other avenues\nAnd enough to go to I had it in all their goals perfect you know their retirement would've been a clear nice concise picture\nWould have been able to manage it for them they took a step back\nWent to visit with their advisor in their bodies are kind of talk them off the ledge cast for lack of better way of putting it and left and said let's leave it where it is sort of member\nHim saying or her if you with the advisor but they said it was too conservative right correct or taking too you know you're gonna miss these big years in the market if you go this route\n[laughter] right and I would I turn around and said hey look a when you're retired at the boat singles doubles not home runs\nThe especially when they have enough they had enough they won the retirement game they saved up enough where she was able to build a plane with our team here at S. H. P. and two thousand eight for them to get through the rest of their lives hundred thousand dollars a year with inflation\nAnd unfortunately as key to saying they're advisor of course everybody's is not going to say yeah go ahead leave us and go to this other from they stay put they didn't make the move\nThat didn't make the move and obviously we know what happened to two thousand and eight so we kept in communication over the next few years finally two thousand Thirteen you know we'd been sitting down year after year kind of saying okay where are you where are you is this a good time is this a good time because once that happened he knew he wasn't getting the right advice\nFrom his advisor he wasn't getting you know the right advice from his advisor to put him in the best position so around two thousand Thirteen is when they felt comfortable and we felt comfortable that you are taking another look at this with inflationary costs and things like that they were able to retire so really by\nBy not executing the plan of cost him a lot more you're more than you know assets it costs them time\nYou know how much I guess by the time they when they came many years about two thousand nine to one point five million what was it down to at that point\nIt was about a little under a little little under a million dollars she's and then basically we let it we ... we let it grow and then you know like I said what's the only they lose money they last time in retirement because that's the one thing we don't get back to go back to work ... you had to keep working just had to keep working keep to keep the business going\nTo let the market recover to a point where now retirement could be again\nSo a lot of times when people come in and that's what we're talking to them about it's not you know okay he's done a good job saving now let's look to build a plant around this cause so many people come into us with a portfolio not many come in with a plan\nExactly and I would say if you're listening really think about that for a second ...\nYou've you've literally worked your entire life to this point to accumulate a certain amount of assets that are there to get you through the rest of your life we've had market runs like you wouldn't believe in that we're a big believer in the market here and a lot of our clients up almost every client has a good portion of their money with us\nIn the market but how much volatility is okay are you OK right now moving five six hundred thousand dollars depending on how long you have to you retire are you OK having to go back to work because you took too many chances and took too much risk at a stage be financial we always say we always we hope for the best we hope to market continues to do well\nBut you have to plan for the worst like I mentioned this and I'll continue to mention it it's insane to risk where you have in order to obtain\nWhere you don't need marking gene unfortunately they read what they had to make a little bit more money\nWhen they had already won the game it's like being up twenty five nothing in the first in the fourth quarter of a football game and throwing ... you don't want to do that you want to protect the lead same thing would retirement you don't want to risk where you have\nIn order to obtain something that you don't even need is another hundred two hundred thousand dollars of gained isn't going to help you but if five six hundred thousand dollar loss will certainly hurt you so where are you right now\nWhere what is your plan look like are you absolutely sir and they have enough income and you have enough money as constituted right now that's going to take you to into retirement do you want to protect that do you want to take the step to protect these assets to make sure that you have enough to get you to into retirement for you and your family and folks that's just the first step here it is H. P. financial\nOnce you build up the income plan we also look at investments taxes healthcare and legacy all under one roof here that stage Pete would be doing it since two thousand three to pick us up on the offer get every time a road map review\nI mentioned earlier unfortunately is a busy time we only have eight appointments available over the next few weeks", "show_name": "SHP Financial Retirement Road Map Radio Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "20"}
