{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "And faith is a trust\nAnd its trusting that the solution God has provided in Jesus crucifixion in his resurrection\nIs sufficient and even though I don't understand it even even though I don't think anyone probably can\nI trust in it may be another way of saying that same thing is to say that the the\nCross of Christ is not so much foolishness as it is and who fence it's offensive to those who are trying to be right with God on their own terms and it's also in a fence to those who think they don't need to be right with God\nIn the passage that was the basis for our tax for today in many translations it's translated as a stumbling block or a scandal on\nAnd that is something that causes one to stumble or in some translations to it falls on someone in in hurts them crushes them kind of thing okay and so that is the gospel I mean it's foolishness but it but it is an offense\nAnd it's interesting because today people are very very concerned about a fence and offending others and and from our research we found that one of the main reasons why people are apprehensive\nWhen sharing their faith is the fear of a fence\nBut the the irony of it is that the message that we have is inherently offensive in a stumbling block\nSo just like the Bible passages shells as we preach Jesus and Jesus crucified and it is this stumbling block it is as you said an offense an offense to the Jews and a folly to the gym tiles it's a it's a fence\nTo our reason is right in your face that says you can't understand this the only thing you can possibly do is trust\nLooking ahead to next week's program it's going to be an important day here for the Lutheran our because Dr Michael ... is going to make his debut yeah the next Lutheran our speaker Tony what do you think about\nThat I think that is great [laughter] um as as one who has spilled in 'em over this past year when we have been in our vacancy speaker I'm thrilled to have him come here\nI'm also real because he brings to the table such a vibrant and unique way of proclaiming the gospel and um every time I hear him preach\nI learn something new from it I'm engaged by it and I know that our listeners will be as well so I Can't wait to have him here not only and you might not know does not only um does he preaching the Lutheran our but he's he's a member of our US ministries team\nAnd so he works with us in in the development of our programming and figuring out um the ministries that we're developing and he speaks into that that process as well so all while he's voice or on the radio he is also a valued partner in our United States uh outreach of the gospel as a whole\nI think our listeners will discover that each speaker brings their own different style and to the program in the case of Dr Ziegler I think he's going to make use of the radio medium in a special way talking about that theater of the mind and you know you can use of his voice to bring the words alive to the listener\nHe has experience actually in um doing the gospel of mark from memory in connection with the gospel of mark program at Concordia Seminary in St Louis\nIt's amazing to hear him recite scripture from memory and he just doesn't remember it but he embodies it and and um he presented in a very engaging way\nI remember that when we were going through and and having people record sermons and you know things like that during the ... the first time that I heard him the first thing he did was he read the Bible passage and I was\nWow if the sermon is as good as him reading the Bible passages who's gonna be great in Iowa but he has he has a talent for interpreting\nAnd he has a talent for convene with his voice and I and I think you said the or the mind is a great way of doing that when you listen to him preaching close your eyes you can visualize a what's going on in the message\nAnd just a heads up for our listeners I think this is going to be a case of active listening being cold for on your part it's this is not going to be the sort of thing where you can have it just kind of\nGoing in the background I think Dr Siegler really captures engages your imagination and requires you to follow along carefully 'cause he's going to take you on a journey yeah with his sermons\nYeah your salvation free but let's say a little work you know I'm no he's a he is engaging and to follow along with him and I was a cemetery professor for a number of years so I you know I think I've heard a lot of things\nBut the way that he presents the message I think okay\nI haven't thought about it like that before and my only problem is that while he's preaching I start thinking and I started going down these well okay I Wonder what that's like and then I have to remind myself to keep listening because he's brought up these topics that are so engaging\nIn presenting them in ways I haven't heard before so um he's he's a gifted preacher but whereas we like to say he's also in many ways challenging\nAnd the fact that he's not going to say the same thing in the same way\nBut that he's presented in a in a fresh way enemy gauging way in a stimulating way [noise]\nTo learn how you can support the worldwide outreach a Lutheran our ministries go to lose the\nRun our dot org or call one eight five five John three sixteen that's one eight five five five

us a quick\nStudy or to to sort of back this up highlight the science behind the elite asked his anthem that's found in as to FX 'cause I Know there were dozens and dozens of studies maybe you can pull out and highlight a couple of your favorites\nYeah for sure so Dr Mark Miller he's a PHD a biomedical research or he explains that well he's talking here about how free radicals compromise and undermine function and tell you that performance in the body he said after that that is simply\nThe curb at negating this as evidenced by clinical trial showing improved performance and accelerated\nRecovery in fact research published in the journal of medicine and science in sports and exercise found that those who took for granted that did that in daily over twenty eight days scored better cycling times greater output\nAnd those who did not take it for the fight I\nMean remember that after that and it's one of the few that viable antioxidants that can actually neutralize three radical even at the site at the mitochondrial membrane it's like the body armor protecting yourself your joints blood vessels brain heart and Oregon on many levels\nThat is impressive on so many levels so much information there and I know this last as Anthonette has about a dozen happens to\nI'm lucky here I see there's a patent for promoting I health\nAnd reducing I fatigue there's a pattern for inhibiting the expression of cytokines in sales end up having to get this on composition for body fat reduction there's one for improving muscle atrophy and older adults Sherry I'd like to be a little bit of a skeptic here how can this one simple nutrient\nMagically do all of this disaster ... give us so many benefits I mean really\nI Know it it sounds amazing to get to be true but it really is true many studies that I'm referencing here there are developed a lot of time that these are reputable clinical studies conducted by leading researchers around the world that really back\nThat benefit to that that that then by the way my ... I put it that are with us did that too and this comes from after that that research published in the international journal sports nutrition November two thousand and all that and this is another study done with cyclists they took for granted access\nThan than it was a small study but very positive showing that cyclists improved their trial time by two minutes and twenty kilometers bike race I mean that's a meaningful improvement in a race like this and\nThe researchers said that they also bring back more efficiently which makes sense he found that three search purity can actually make the claim that after the FX will promote and improve power output\nIn your muscles and then I tell people asked to effect in strength and power out it it transformative if you like energy and this is found in other studies to like one that looked at hand grip strength\nAnd so much great information necessary I Want to share a couple of more testimonials that caught my attention out of so many right there on the purity website again these are unsolicited these are from real people here's one from Rick he's a male age fifty five sixty four lives in Naples, Florida he writes this\nWhat a great product to asked FX has been for me after starting taking ... my workout and strengths has increased as if I were in my twenties again and I've only been on asked FX for two months now can't wait to see the long

energy level I Love this product just a couple of samples from the real people who have responded and purity is website and cherry I'm looking at the list of\nPatents again on this asked his anthem compound this is where the you know the science research backs up or we are talking about this is just flat out amazing in this area a lot of people out there are going to think ah when I'm going to say here sounds a little bit odd but you said before the show this supplement may even help people drive\nBetter or use the computer more comfortable you can come on how does this out but\nIt does sound funny but I step back and they actually helping these areas to an end here's why one of the interesting things about after that then is that it's a relative of vitamin a and we know that vitamin as good fries good for vision ask the sad thing is to us than has actually been shown\nTo fight oxidation in IT issue scientist at a study\nWhere they found a forty six percent improvement in a measurement called depth perception that that perception that third delivery to determine\nDistances between objects are basically to see in three dimensions and researchers they study the handball team specifically looking at how quickly they could change focus and guess what the handball team that was supplementing with us does and then\n[noise]\nA following of hate advertisement by purity

basically shows that we're all contaminated by plastics and solving virtually one hundred percent of us in our tissue it's downright scary stuff right\nOh I Hope so literally this is a scary subject and as you mentioned that EPA fact issue survey and that was done on thirty three thousand us residents they found her beans plastics chemical solvent in a hundred percent of the samples so basically pat\nWe're all contaminated than the environmental working group back in two thousand six found that tap water\nIn forty two states is in time and they did buy more than a hundred and forty on
