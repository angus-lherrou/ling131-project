our heart muscles in leg muscles make bones stronger keep our arteries clear impact our mood and emotional state support metabolism and essentially serve as a master switch\nFor two thousand genes in your body believe it or not we're talking about vitamin D\nWell our guest today is Dr John canal a practicing medical doctor an authority on vitamin D he's the founder of the widely respected vitamin D council author of numerous scientific papers that outlined the tragedy\nOf this vitamin D deficiency epidemic an author of an upcoming book on the topic he's the man the media increasingly turns due for answers when a new vitamin D study is published in his Thirty years in medicine\nDoctor can now has never endorsed to supplement for any company but that's all changing\nYou not only door says purity is advanced vitamin D formula he's put his name on it and joining us live from California doctor canal welcome back to the program thank mapped out just now I Know that you're plump you're extremely excited about the absolute barrage of information that's emerged in the\nPast year or two on vitamin D you're saying the vitamin D revolution the vitamin D error is officially started in the impact it's going to be\nUnprecedented what's really going on here\nWell let me tell you just a little bit about how I got into this because I think it would give them information about how the the ball\nAbout ... years ago I realized that vitamin D was going to revolutionize medical care the reason I came to that conclusion is because I realized that virtually all Americans are vitamin D deficient when we follow doctor's advice and our government's advice and we started putting on the phone blocking staying out of the fund it had\nTremendous effect on the vitamin D levels in our blood so I started a nonprofit the vitamin D counsel on there you can read more information than you can possibly remember\nAll about vitamin D and I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then within the last year or so I realized that to work fully to optimally work vitamin D need a number of coke factors\nIt needs vitamin K to vitamin K one but the more expensive vitamin K to\nIt needs for on it needs magnesium it neat thing and we'll talk about all these secondly I realized there's the difference between having vitamin D on the shelf and people can buy it for getting people information on the radio so people who are not taking it\nOr taking the wrong preparation can learn about it and that's a big difference so I approach the number of companies and purity agreed to make the vitamin D formula that I insisted upon and secondly I said by the way I Want people to take this with fish oil\nSo what we're gonna talk about today is purity offer about up complete vitamin D formula one that's unlike anything else on the market you can't buy it in the store you can't put it on on the Internet at this was the only such formula that exist\nTogether with or ultra pure molecularly distilled the shore\nAnd let me ask you a question here 'cause I'm a skeptic at heart and I like to play the devil's advocate on the radio and how is it possible that one vitamin in this case ... can be involved in everything from cardiovascular health to immunity to body weight even dental cavities I mean I've heard stuff like this before you know about vitamin C. what's what is different with vitamin D\nYeah that's a good question let me just do one thing that people understand exactly what sort of things have been discovered and one of the best ways to do that is to go back\nAnd look at Google News now here's the headlines from major publications in the last couple of years about vitamin D I'm just gonna read off a list of headlines when you think about it is truly amazing\nThey these sorts of headlines have never been seen before for any other vitamins Newsweek or Americans dying from a lack of vitamin D London time\nNeglecting vitamin D comes with a heavy price\nYour PI lack of vitamin D can affect thirty six Oregon Washington Post vitamin D deficiency called major health risk am a news that's American Medical association knows listen to this that vitamin D deficiency maybe the root\nOf numerous health problem that's the American Medical Association the you know it's just truly amazing\nThe reason that it's involved in prostate health breast health bone health cognition blood pressure health immune health all these different things as because vitamin D ... it's not a vitamin\nIt is truly the one vitamin you cannot get from a good diet because it's not a vitamin mhm it's made in the skin upon exposure to sunlight and what's eventually made is a steroid hormone now they're worried hormones activated vitamin D is a steroid on and the way they work at is the key\nThere are key to your genetic code\nAnd some steroid hormones are key to only a few genes but vitamin D is the key to two thousand gene that is it\nUnlock two thousand gene\nIs the key that two thousand one tenth of your genome by the one one tenth of your genome is waiting for the key to unlock it\nAnd the only thing that can unlock it is vitamin D that's why it's involved in so many different health conditions your body knows what it needs it just needs the key on lock the right gene\nNo doctor you say we need five thousand I use per day now here's here's the problem I went through the health food store the other day and I'm looking at most multi vitamins and I'm even looking at vitamin D sold separately\nYou know as a supplement itself is most of them have two hundred four hundred I use I saw a couple of brands they had a thousand nobody even comes close to what purity is offering your I Want you to talk about why we need five thousand per day and there's really only three ways to get it I could either go out in the the new times sun\nWhich really isn't practical for a lot of us and there's you know these the skin concerns you talked about before I go to a tanning bed again not an optimal choice where I can supplement the right way was purity products why the importance of this five thousand number was that the magic bullet\nYeah because of the single fact and this that changed my life seven years ago when I was researching vitamin D I came across a number of studies that showed that if you put on your bathing suit and go outside in the summertime\nAnd Sunday for about twenty minutes ten minutes on each side you make between ten thousand and twenty thousand units of vitamin D in twenty minutes now that's incredible I thought about that and I thought about that why would nature devise a system that made that much vitamin D that\nQuickly and if you look at levels that people like lifeguards were roofers gardeners or something they're levels or fifty or sixty or Seventy\nSo that's a natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to be ideal your blood level to be fifty or sixty you have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up till maybe thirty two", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products", "city": "Boston", "day": "20"}
