{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "As you look back on that as an adult do you continue to use prayer as a shield and as a protector yeah for me it's interesting with the prayer it as a as a\n... a lot of times we'll say a when something happens will pray for you mhm and a and a lot of times that's a a a way of saying I'm Sorry for what you're going through or whatever [laughter] um but what I realize that prayer has\nPower and and the power of prayer is something that I've learned over my life and I still use it today I'm when I'm fearful and anxious anxiety about decisions I Need to make things like that\nMost of the times still oddly enough I I use prayer when I go to sleep I'm a person that thinks a lot in their head and turning off those worries and those concerns especially when I'm trying to sleep\nPrayer is about the only effective way for me to to do that so it it's carried along with me this this whole time so it's it's more than just apply attitude in it actually is is is powerful yeah\nWhat'd you say fear is a bad thing I guess you know it's what kind of fear is it\nAnd who you ask probably so when I was a little kid I felt that that fear was bad and maybe a it was my subconscious working out the issues that I was going through so maybe it was good but as an adult\nI found that that fear actually can be good obviously fear helps to protect us from things that you have that that a fight or flight syndrome that we get ... exactly what the hell the fear of of things that would do damage to you\nI also think that when it comes to fear that\nIt is something that can set of hedge or a boundary so that we remain faithful to God and then there is I'm not like a horrifying kind of fear but a a fear when we look at God\nIn who he is honoring him and that's a kind of fear too and I would say that's a that's a positive fear as well\nYeah actually the first use of the law would be an example of a healthy fear the fear of running afoul of the authorities that God has put in place\nThe curb that yeah restrained you from acting out on whatever sinful impulse you my dad that might be against the law so in that case that would be a healthy a fear to half\nYou're correct so like the the the first use of the law um why do people obey the law in in that sense it's because they're fearful of the negative punishment you know [laughter] and so it's like oh well I'm not going to do this because I don't wanna go to jail so you're not really a doing things\nFor a wonderful virtuous reasons but because you're fearful of the\nPenalty but at the same time it's not like the man's trying to keep it down you know I mean it's it's really about protecting you as well as a maintaining stable society so\nWhile there's fear involved the overall goal isn't simply tear the\nOverall goal is to Maine taint peace and to keep us protected and to keep us healthy\nIn the sermon Dr Hoffman said that all fears are really mirrors of the one fear the fear of death would you agree with that\nI agree with that I might put it a little bit differently to me to death is one kind of loss okay and at least for me personally I think that a lot of my fear is connected to loss or death being probably the largest one but\nYeah I I Would say that the death as a form of loss and and if you think about it that way that many of our fears are connected so uh we're fearful if we're going to lose our job or if we're going to lose a relationship\nWith someone that we love or if we lose someone in in death or if we're going to lose part of our identity you know or part of our freedom um all of those I think go back to last for me in may be admitted it tells you a little too much about who I Am I'm but fear of\nLoss of of of many kinds his his been something that that I've dealt with over my life uh it it also I think it exposes the fact that maybe we think that the things that we provide for ourselves are the only way that we make it through this world and if we if we lose those things we're not going to be able to go on\nSo I think it probably also says something about my understanding of my of my trust and and my relationship with God and those kinds of fear\nIt seems to me that fear could also be a result of uncertainty not knowing where things are going to go and so you fear what could happen\n... exactly yeah I'm I'm One of those people that I I'd probably do myself a harm by thinking about all of the possible results of a situation you know so I can imagine like forty different horrible things that could happen you know I'm so uh I I tend to\nI tend to let my mind think through those things and sometimes I noticed that that will that will actually\nImpact me emotionally that I Will be fearful\nAbout a consequence that I have determined to simply be a possibility in my mind and trying to realize that there's there's plenty of real things to be fearful about it instead of just being fearful about the thousand things that I make up [laughter]\nIn his sermon Dr Hoffman says when fear is so thick you can cut it with a knife face cuts through and then there's light again no matter what may happen there is God and where God is no fear\nNow I couldn't agree with that more you know as we're talking about this I only thought of the illustration as I was coming down here about the story of when I was a child\nBut thinking about that statement and also thinking about some forty six and that he's using this that a a a mighty fortress you know kind of thing I thought well I Know of course I didn't know this but uh in a way I was kind of building a fortress you only a little ... rex yeah with prayer\nBut that is true in the darkest times God is that defense he is that lights that cuts through that darkness we also know from scripture that a lot of times we don't necessarily see the light of God unless it's dark\nOr to put another way we see it more clearly are more brightly or when it's dark\nSo ... it's interesting that when you talk about faith and you talk about people's relationship with God through Christ that if you ask them to tell you a story about it many times they are going to tell you a story about darkness a story about fear\nA time when God made a difference in their daily life\nSo in many ways without these times of fear without this times of broken it's without these times of darkness\nMaybe we wouldn't understand God's graciousness and provision as much as we do today\nTo learn how you can support the worldwide outreach a Lutheran our ministries go to lose the run our dot org or call one eight five five John three sixteen that's one eight five five five six for six three one six\nOur email address is info at LA jam dot org\nNext

it as it was in the Indian background\nJoin the conversation about his Senate showdown voice in Boston do you think about one hundred and twenty seven to ... like eighty to Boston and heart radio station\nAnd getting these omega threes that crude oil the vitamin D the antioxidants makes such a difference this is a game changer for anybody in at fifty plus age group\nNow this is absolutely great information I Know that didn't make it three's talking about that just for a second our best known for their cardiovascular benefits and\nThere's certainly also known as bringing food now we discuss this in some of the past shows if you would touch on the brain benefits for our listeners listening out there today and tell us why you say that supplementing with omega threes isn't just a good idea for the brain but an absolute necessity\nGo oh this is such an important point that you're bringing up absolutely for brain health we must must get omega threes back in there you know when you think about omega ...\nThrees and you think about brain health and memory and mood and feeling sharp you really want to single out the D. H. A. component that is that do go\n... you know what Steve your brain is sixty percent fat I wait and up that twenty five percent twenty five percent needs to be the age hey you know what I use an analogy in my practice of people understand calcium and bone health right if you don't have housing in your diet\nAnd you don't supplement with calcium your Bones Are going to get parental and weak you understand that right right exactly\nThat's what happens to balance bones need calcium for their normal strength and structure\nNow with the brain and the same the ha for normal structure will use this one brain or and to communicate with another to build out that bring me the serotonin doping mean older feel good neuro transmitters so must must have must get it back in there so important and what this cruel omega fifty plus we've increased\nThe level of th have because we concentrated omega threes and they're now with growing anger fifty plus you're gonna get a hundred and thirty ... milligrams of the tree preserving Steve\nWhile the leading brand of crude oil you're going to get twenty four excellence twenty four\nAnd a leading brand you to get a hundred and thirty with chronic or fifty plus that's why this is so incredible for the brain\nThis is absolutely exciting I got to tell you though during the last real show that we did together you're totally shocked me Dr\nMember civically you say tell me around the time I see what I say that\nAnd I remember that the studies show the grill oil improves joint comfort in just seven days now if the benefits of the brain on a hard then ... Myers up that certainly would they would touch on this study and tell us how this works\nRight right those are great study in fact that's the reason I started taking crude oil about five six years ago a pilot study double blind placebo controlled exactly what you want to see out of the journal of the American College of nutrition participants got three hundred milligrams of crude oil or a placebo now remember\nIn Columbia fifty plus we're giving you even more of a giving you five hundred milligrams of cruel also even more important but\nThe participants in this study that got the crew loyal

or when I read that I immediately went out and bought my first bottle of criminal but after thirty days they were thirty eight percent more comfortable the researchers didn't stop\nThere they looked at flexibility of the joints they looked at function of the joints all improvement a cold is the crucial\nOil advantage so if you're out there and you're taking fish oil fish oil is great I mean ... in here it's so important but\nYou're not going to get the same joint advantages just started ... you're not going to experience this joint comfort benefit that we get specifically from the krill and
