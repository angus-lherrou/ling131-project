{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "Seventeen years and we have four children uh the oldest is Fifteen youngest is eight and yeah we just we have a lot of fun we have for chickens and a dog and [laughter] and we live in the city of St Louis so you're allowed to have\nChickens in the city and just to give you a a view and our our family life we had a Fox attack our chickens a couple of nights ago and my Fifteen year old son and I drug ourselves after our daughter woke us up and said the chickens are screaming the my son and I had to go out with flashlights and chew off the Fox and\nUm I didn't get a great night sleep at night but that's just kind of our house it a lot of energy and action and my wife is always makes things fun and the kids do as well\nLet's talk about the your work of Luther and our speaker each speaker that we've had has spoken to a particular context and its issues you represent now a different generation of Luther and our speaker what do you see as the great challenge of our context\nAs I understand the organization we are an outreach organization and I think the challenge that we have is the same challenge that everyone in the church has that our our culture at least in North America has\nShifted and there's some church hurt and some skepticism and I'll often apathy towards what we have to say and\nOf course I Want to share Jesus and I want to share the word of God and so I think that's the challenge is how to bridge into that that apathy and sometimes a anger towards the church\nAnd our listeners might be interested to know that besides being the river in Dr Michael Vick or you're also lieutenant colonel\nMichael Ziegler in the United States Air force reserve tell us a little bit about your military background and maybe get into the transition that you made from air force to the ... years ago\nMy dad served in the military for Twenty one years in the air force and for one of those assignments we were stationed in Colorado Springs which is the home of the air force academy and we had season tickets to the football games and when I saw all the cadets in their service dress run to the end zone\nAnd do push-ups whenever the falcons would scored a touchdown I knew that I wanted to do that I didn't know what it all but it just looked at like ... really cool and so that had been my lifelong dream is to go to the air force academy and\nThanks be to God it happened I almost didn't get in and actually got rejected and then a month later he got a call from the the ... the senator who got me my er my nomination and and said hey you still want to go to the air force academy I fell on the ground and it was so excited that my my dream was coming through\nAnd I served a five years on active duty I wasn't a chaplain actually a lot of people ask me that\nI I served as an aircraft maintenance officer in a air mobility command which is all the big plane's cargo planes and the arrow medical evacuation and air air refueling those planes you know\nOne of the things when we were going through all the candidates I'm a for the new speaker one of the things that stood out to me was that you have a a distinctly different style in preaching did you talk just a little bit about how you develop your your preaching style\nMy desire is to be conversational and it I think it relates back to the question mark asked about the challenges that we as preachers face today there's a there's a book you probably know the title as as one without authority or I don't remember who wrote it but that's we we can't\nAs preachers or the gospel it doesn't work as well to leave with our authority and so how else can we lead to connect with people\nConnect them to Jesus and so that was part of it it's just a desire to be conversational to the desire for me to be interested in what I'm saying and to become a a student of the Bible anew every time I go back to the text\nYeah this is a unique opportunity now that you're just starting out and people listening getting to know you a little bit more ... if there was one goal\nHad in mind for what you hope God would do through your time here oh what would that be what drew me to this organization is that the love of the last and\nTo focus on outreach and that's what my goal right now as I can imagine it is to help that effort to be a small part of that larger effort Lucerne our ministries is much bigger than just the Lutheran our we're we're reaching out all over the globe but if I can be a small\nPart of that to to speak to people who are on the on the fringe of the Christian faith or outside of the skeptics send the half believers\nAnd that's a lot of us to go to church every week and so to try to speak to wear those to come together where a someone who goes to church but it's not quite sure if they really believe all this and and then to some someone who's completely skeptical about at all how can we reach them\nAnd saw what I Hope from from the listeners is that we'd be able to create something that they could share you know you ... you send send this to the pod cast linked to your grandson to your granddaughter your niece or nephew and say hey listen to this and let's talk about me for coffee [laughter]\nTo learn how you can support the world wide outrage moved to run our ministries go to lose the run our dot org\nOh\n\nOh oh\n\n\nOh\n\n\n\nOoh\n\n\n\nOw\nOw\nOw\n\nOw\nOw ow ow ow ow\nOw\nOw\n\n\nOw\nOw\nOw\nYou\nKnow doctors ignorant invites you to join him in praying the Lord's Prayer our father who art\nIn heaven how we would be dining\nViking don't come by will be done on earth as it is in heaven [noise] give us the state our daily bread and forgive us our trust passes we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil\nDesign is the kingdom power and the glory forever and ever a man\nThe lord bless you and keep you lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you know the lord look upon you with favor and give you peace amen\n\nThis has been a presentation of loose run our ministries\n\nSmart speaker [laughter] [noise] all you have to do is say hey Alexa play deadly ... hard radio simple\n\nVoice of Boston do you think they really weren't about one hundred and twenty seven to ... like eighty to Boston and I are radio station\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News show she reached an update on\nThe man charged with federal hate crimes in yesterday's deadly shooting massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue us attorney Scott ...\nWe we want them to receipt of course and we live in an era when this should be happening because we've become stationary we call it sedentary were sitting at yes or a great deal at that time were not\nWalking and moving our legs and it's actually the muscles in our cats\nThat are actually squeezing on the plane and then there are one way checked out and are being so the the the blood only goes one direction but new but print age eight addresses the real root cause of this but the issue is it shouldn't be happening that the main should be strong enough\nTo make sure that that led doesn't cool and it does get pushed back\nInto the heart so that we can get oxygen aided blood so this is an issue of circulation and we certainly want to promote good circulation address the real cause and of course what's interesting is in Europe\nIt's been used for fifty years well documented and of course it's affordable and today purity product is offering the audience a chance to even try it for free so if we have a wonderful remedy the ingredient is the citrus peel extract called ...\nAsked a horse chestnut extract and another ... appeal extract of called ... three doses three ingredients three kinds of ways to get at these things and make them stronger and tighten up the capillaries the capillaries or the connector ... between the red and blue hoses\nAnd uh that's where the oxygen is exchange where nutrients get in or waste material comes out and those can actors can get loose and therefore uh and and so on will explain more of that as we go on but certainly this wonderful remedy from purity products nouveau print\nAge Steve from purity product is the answer to the cause of what is the origin of these spider thing even ham rights 'cause that's the main problem also and certainly we're sitting all day you

actually walking there just standing in a stationary position and so this is endemic and those kinds of profession what can you do about it well when they look at this\nLet me see it's forty percent of men and sixteen percent of women and uh this is this study from a well New England Journal of medicine so it tells us it's a very prevalent problem\nIt's more than just the parents don't that's probably the thing that will prompt us to do something about this and of course women wear longer dresses and and all the other things to hide these unsightly thing\nBut the bigger issue is not just to hide them but to deal with the circulatory and of course I'm just looking at the data we're number one I mentioned the doctor's office this was in a study in two thousand one in the journal of and geology and geology the study of blood vessels so and it works best\nAnd of course for some people it's really weird because they have these signs and symptoms and it's very difficult and it works

purity products on your host\nMarks the most so glad you could joined us today it's a power pack program in fact our story originally Fifteen Years ago when the renowned TV show sixty minutes captivated audiences around North America with a special segment on the French paradox\nDo you remember the French paradox this is the counterintuitive concept that says\nRed wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best activates genes that control our weight or energy healthy aging and even longevity\nThe holy grail of medical research and what did they find out of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was was there a troll yes ... the active ingredient found in that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nNow our guest today says that's just half the story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce Robert Twenty years Dr precedent is the institution of New York radio hosting his own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a longtime product formulated and high level advisor for purity products that depressed mood welcome\nAboard mark always great speaking to ya\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's talk to them this was virile phenomenon those people out there who just vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is was very ... and why is it all over the news today well first\nOf all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News\nYou know I read about twenty health journals a week and every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically resveratrol is what we call a poly sci and all it's found in red wine it's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries it's even found in ...\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation\nAnd the scientists really first became interested and resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when raspberry ritual was first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms and even some fish well anything that extends the life of anything is going to pick the attention of scientists\nY'all absolutely wow well\nTwo thousand six Italian scientists discovered that resveratrol extend the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and it even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand six\nAnd here's what really got them interested a Harvard researcher David Sinclair report about resveratrol counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice by thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seem to protect the intestines and the colon definitely supported normal and semantic activity in the body it improved in door and\nIt was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved enduring storing aerobic activity\nAnd it even proved to support brain function great study from Weill Cornell Medical school to New York I was just reading that an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any perceived health threat like not eating enough\nCaloric restriction your body feels threatened this which is on what they called the longevity gene in your body it switches on sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a cellular level metabolism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's dictate according to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard no this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWow this is amazing but let me just sit back for a moment I Know you've been working with Sunni products for several years under co Q. formulas but now they feature co enzyme Q. ten which is just as important as residents role especially for your heart health and you'll see in some ways it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs co Q. ten ... what exactly is good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak or what a co enzyme is\nA co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects well co Q. ten is the nutrient that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart\nYour liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy\nWow that's amazing\nYeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful anti oxygen and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's awhile ago while I was teaching for the first time physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point and this is Nineteen sixty three\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin where they were looking for what makes the heart beat they were literally looking at heart and saying\nWhat is making this darn thing beat well they found out that was co Q. ten and that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell wins himself a Nobel Prize for\nDescribing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products",
