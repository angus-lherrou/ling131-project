till you see a like a C to Boston and I are radio station\nIn fact there's over eighty scientific publications on our Kirk human and get this\nResearch out of the University of Louisville identifies our Kirk you mean complex\nAs the most active form in terms of anti inflammatory activity so yes our Kirk human is very very powerful very beneficial for managing a mitigating inflammation\nAnd we need this for those low back the hips than they used the neck shoulders so absolutely Kirk human was a no brainer the number one on my short list of anti inflammatory herbs to add to flex ADA\nSomebody touched on your curriculum and so now let's talk about your special bus William ... lots of science office for you as well as a in terms of promoting joined comfort and supporting a healthy inflammation response right\nOh absolutely pat ... has been used in traditional medicine for centuries but pat there is a key difference between the way he buys\nYour works and the weight Kirk human works and it's the reason that they work together show well they complement\nYou should put on your thinking cap here this is key for understanding the beauty the genius of this flex eighty eight formulas so pat there's two main inflammatory pathways in the body that Cox passed away\nAnd the locks passed away now you've probably heard of Cox to inhibitors right\nOh yeah I'm sure people use those for joining comfort in Islam Asian abuses many times for my next my back my knee and they weren't great by blocking the costs of enzymes won't blocking the inflammation in the aches and pains right\n... ... per beautifully said yeah and that's the beauty of our curriculum and you see it blocks those same Cox enzymes that costs too much\nInflammation but Kirk human pat and this is key it leaves the enzymes that protect our stomach and intestines intact and active so this is everyday pain relief that's good for you so pat while our curriculum\nIs acting to knock out everyday aches and pains it's also supporting healthy brain function and memory healthy liver function cardiovascular health even cholesterol levels in fact\nLet's go to a nice study just published in the American Journal of geriatric psychiatry march\nTwo thousand Eighteen researchers tested memory in forty one adult age fifty one to eighty four for Eighteen months now that's a long study pat\nAnd what they did is they check their verbal and visual memory they check their attention they even evaluated brain activity with advanced P. T. scanning and they found that those taking Kirk human had excellent memory support and their PET scans\nWere better and pat and the same way Kirk human is wonderful for the heart of the arteries that supports healthy cholesterol levels but now\nI Want to get back to the difference between how Kirk human works versus how Boswell your work so we just talked about how Kurt human modulate stick Cox ends on parents way\nYou illustrated that beautifully it reduces inflammation the problem is that when the cops passed away as being locked the body will naturally sent the inflammatory molecule ... some of the omega six bats in our diet\nDown in other information pathway that's known as the locks\nPassed away so there's a locks pathway as our other main inflammatory passed away in the body so now\nIf you will only block the locks side you'd only be handling half the story is still needs to handle the other inflammatory passed away this or locks pathway and this is where our Boswell IOUs rada comes into play\nAll right so this is an important point to let me see if I get this\nYou're Kirk human blocks the cops past way reducing inflammation along that line but if that's all we addressed we'd only be addressing half of the story by adding the bus while you which dampen down the locks passed away your quieting down both inflammatory pathways do I have that right\nYou have it exactly right so that's the beauty here of flex ADA we're using our Kurt came into damp and the cops inflammatory path way\nAre very special bus Willie ... cools off the locks inflammatory pathway for for complimentary effect that that you are really going to notice\nYou're really gonna feel and this is why a full eighty eight percent of the folks in our study in just thirty days notice wonderful

A. on board highly around a gas it and to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate\nThat women have moved their skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls have more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and that's because the estrogen sends a signal to make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do\nAnd you see the skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course parity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joint\nJoining formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray all he's doing is measuring the space\nBetween the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an air and space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age eight is it's the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones we lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief the more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joints\nAnd then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed this people who chronically used pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that's what ha is that doctors call it ... fluid they actually inject this into joints orthopedist do\nDermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there and you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement\nPurity products was the first to introduce it now it's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's and molecular weight think of six million paper clips put together its big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down\nSo that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at the laboratory right there in\nFlorida and we're going to tell you more about that but we proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's got to be knocked down\nIn molecular weight and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but purity products\nIs introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives\nOr their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nIf you're just tuning in we're talking with Bill ... acid or Eighteen bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nI think the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products", "city": "Boston", "day": "27"}
