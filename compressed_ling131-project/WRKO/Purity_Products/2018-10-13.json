lot of ways that came about from just picking up these things over the years I think I could look back to college when you have a beer bottle of beer that sounded twist off but you don't have an open air\nUm but somebody always had a big later on them and I got taught a kind of the party trick of\nBeing able to to wedge a\nBottle of beer open with a lighter um and then you know kind of accumulated some others along the way and then you know like was\nSilly enough to talk to an editor um themselves was silly enough to say we should make\nThis a book [laughter] the the big lighter that's if I follow along correctly in the book as a matter of using it as a wedge basically right against the tightly gripped finger around the bottleneck\nExactly after grip correctly or it's all laid out there hum with illustration diagrams\nA and everything you need to figure it out but yeah you're essentially using a the lighter as a as a lever a lever and your finger as a fulcrum um so it's all highly scientific as you can do\nEnd up for those in desperation mode even folding up a piece of paper super super tightly can function the same way\nI think yeah that's a great one that one's actually um

string that you guys didn't ask to tone and awaiting it on fire [noise] um so that was you know one of one of the more enjoyable testing phases\nOf creating this book um but it'll basically sever its way through the beer and you can turn it into a a glass to drink a glass to then put beer in um I'd recommend you know sending heavily\nOr just to protect your mouth I'm sure you can create tiki torches or that you can put outside to\nWard off ... which unfortunately um scientists haven't figured out exactly why I don't know that they've been spending all their time on this uh mosquitoes love people who've been drinking beer so you gotta\nGotta fight 'em off um [noise] yeah there's a a number of other you can make shot glasses I'm with the basically the the bottle next um that you've

Sandra berry because\nIn a Chinese herbal this some shes Andrus often added to gin saying ah really to extend it affects uh\nShows Andrus been oh cultivated for a couple thousand years and in China and its traditional uses to increase energy to fight for tea gets a sexual tonic um it also shows benefits for\nAthletes in terms of enhancing physical performance and endurance I mean it's just one of the\nGreatest of all botanical so we've found a certified organic shows Andhra berry and as you said we've added two hundred fifty milligrams of that to this to this combination\nWhich really makes this like you know the the World Series winner of just saying products there's no formula like this anywhere\nSo Chris this to our brain benefit is quite a differentiate or\nFor your triple juicing I mean I haven't seen that before an any ... formula very innovative backed by science that's how you guys role of purity products cutting edge kind of stuff\nWe know gym thing is great for energy and

two hours do I have that right I mean do brain boosting benefits literally kick him in less than two hours\nWell yes they do pat and we have human clinical science to back that up uh as I as I mentioned previously two hundred milligrams of Sarah boost extract a is significant enough\nTo boost mental function in clearly defined ways and just two hours but in addition we also have good science showing that with the Korean ginseng extract\nThere's a reduction in stress hormones and the blood and an improvement and function so the ginseng extract that we have in the triple ginseng formula we can say with certainty that it's really a mind sharp in there and you know I I I'm always amazed that\nPeople will say go into a coffee place and spend you know four dollars on a lot to say and maybe they'll do that every day and yeah they get a little bit of benefit you know a little bit of caffeine\nBut you get so much more for so much less money on a daily basis by taking something like this tripled ginseng which works in two hours\nAnd I would encourage people to just think about the real value of having a sharp remind stronger body more energy and endurance for less than what you'd pay for a lot to\nSort of Christ UC triple ... also functions like a belief that we'll invite you with the booster kind of helps you get your ... back as you age can you elaborate\nKnow as we

I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with Reza there a trial I've worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California and she'll lay in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity that investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientist than my conclusion is that green tea\nKirk human from to recruit and was there a troll from red wine are remarkable health and Hansing agent that everybody can benefit from in the very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet and all are considered super foods the green tea perfume and there was ... why did you want to combine this read there's always a method to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other work better you call it a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason not to\nPut them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all\n... derived so it's kind of like you can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and well that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in\nGroups of protective compounds that are both\nAntioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies\nAnd protect our organ systems so they maintain a healthy inflammatory status and the body and this is really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resveratrol in\nOne product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines and the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging but what are you seeing recently in the press I Know you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased\nPlasma anti oxygen activity in whole blood glucose ion you recap\nSome of these headlines and tell me why you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume that don't\nActually wind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount\nThe green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed they improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is you get this great concentration\nOf antioxidants substances which a protective compounds floating around in the body and\nProtecting the cells of your body your organs every part of your body from premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called glue the thigh bone\nSo you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue to thigh on so\nIt is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplementing gradients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nLet's switch gears and talk about this for ... which is number two on your list by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula would be offering free bought on a few minutes we'll talk to me about the human which is spelled C.
