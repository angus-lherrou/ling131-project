I think if there's anything that we know by reading God's word is not that you become a Christian and all of a sudden your life is perfect but in fact you you can expect suffering you can expect trials because\nYou are literally going in the opposite direction in the world wants to take you and that's going to increase friction great friction\nThere haven't been to our fair share of trial but um there's also been a lot of joy and a lot of\nA blessing and I think\nYou know specifically speaking to Noelle and her surprise arrival but also her\nI'm surprised diagnosis\nI think that when we received that diagnosis we all reacted in a very human way\nWe were scared because we didn't know what that meant we were\nSad because we grieved\nThis idea of the life that our child was going to have their were element I'm\nYou know uncertainty and fear of what other people going to think and how does this and you know how this is going to impact our family long term I started thinking about the fact that\nYou know Perry and I may never have an empty and that and that's a huge thing to deal with and to come to terms with and what I didn't realize and what I didn't think about was the huge blessing\nThat we were going to get through her\nThat was one of the greatest lesson that I learned through this whole experience so far\nOf God blessing off with her was just that once\nWe got to know her and once we recognize how\nAmazing her differences make her\nHow kind and how unconditionally loving and how\nAmazing she is like she has to work so much harder than everyone else to achieve the same task\nThat we all achieved quite easily\nIs so much rejoicing rejoicing over little tiny things that you would normally take for granted those are the things that I feel like God has taught us through no well and when I watch the way that our children are older children are with her and the patients\nAnd the acceptance that they have and the ways that they have grown in their opinions\nPeople were different I just found him credit for what's been incredible for\nMe to realize and and I think it's a\nGood reflection on her simple conditions [noise] we get very caught up\nIn looking at the ... the dark clouds of uh\nThe potential of something that happened and so you can get very focused on the challenges of bringing up a a child who has Down syndrome and and and really just get\nSo wrapped up in that that that's all you're thinking about\nAnd what we we fail to see is that there can be more going on than needs are awry so you know some people might not see a having a\nChild come into their home is a blessing she was absolutely blessing for our home and continues to be today because you know she became the sunshine\nThat we all were able to revolve around and be blessed by and and this you know the little person who is just beaming love you know she\nHas her over to my younger brother or something like that but I more often than not it is just about\nI I Want to love you I I Want to be happy with you I Want to smile I I I Want to make you happy and\nWe all are were there for her and it you know to help her with the challenges and so we learn more compassion\nAnd care and all these things and and that's what God was giving us was this opportunity to love and to serve it\nAnd we may not realize that at first but wow what a blessing we've been given and and it was so thankful for it today\n[laughter] yeah and even the blessing now on being able to share our stories of\nPeople and hope that we might somehow encourage someone else here\nAt the beginning of their Jamie I'm you know just finding out that they have a diagnosis dance and you're my third child you know prenatal care after they're born or someone that they you know that's going\nTo hear that that hopefully it would just help people to open\nTheir mind to reframe think think about things a little bit differently that this isn't a burden or a tragedy that her that's her life it's a little bit different but it's a blessing number law and um you know especially when\nIt's hot lately about you know prenatal testing and eradicating down from Ron in certain countries in a row and of course that's not what they're doing or just killing the baby that have Down syndrome before they're born ... which is\nJust heartbreaking and so to have the opportunity to go and he kept

people in a car\nThe reason that it's involved in prostate health breast health bone health cognition blood pressure hell immune health all these different things because vitamin D pet it's not a vitamin\nIs truly the one vitamin you cannot get from a good diet because it's not a vitamin ... it's made in the skin upon exposure to sunlight and what's eventually made is they there are worried hormone now they're worried hormones activated vitamin D is a steroid on and the way they work that is the key\nThere are key to your genetic code\nAnd from their word hormones are key to only a few genes but vitamin D is the key to two thousand gene that is it on line two thousand gene is the key that\nTwo thousand one tenth of your genome but when one tenth of your genome is waiting for the key to unlock it and the only thing that can unlock it\nAnd then the that's why it's involved in so many different health conditions your body knows what it needs it just needs to key on lock the right gene\nNow Dr you say we need five thousand I use per day now here's here's the problem I went through the health food store the other day and I'm looking at most multi vitamins and I'm even looking at vitamin D sold separately\nYou know as a supplement itself is most of them have two hundred four hundred I use I saw a couple of brands they had a thousand nobody even comes close to what purity is offering your I Want you to talk about why we need five thousand per day and there's really only three ways to get it I can either go out and the the new times sun\nWhich really isn't practical for a lot of us and there's you know these the skin concerns that you talked about before I go to a tanning bed again not an optimal choice where I can supplement the right way was purity products why the importance of this five thousand number was that the magic bullet\nYeah because of a single fact in fact changed my life seven years ago when I was researching vitamin D I came across a number of studies that showed\nThat if you put on your bathing suit and go outside in the summertime and Sunday for about twenty minutes ten minutes on each side\nMake between ten thousand and twenty thousand units of vitamin D in twenty minutes now\nThat's incredible I thought about that and I thought about that why would nature devise a system that they that much vitamin D that quickly and if you look at levels that people like lifeguards or roofers gardeners or something they're levels or fifty or sixty or Seventy\nSo that's the natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to be ideal your blood level to be fifty or sixty you have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up till maybe thirty two\nBut five thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to fifty and if you take less than that you'll get some benefits the vitamin D but you will not get the full benefits\nHow do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient I mean other than there is a blood test right\nRight there is a blood test and luckily more and more doctors are ordering tests the problem with getting a blood test this first you have to get your doctor to agree to it and then your doctor has to know something about vitamin D and many of them are really too busy to read the current research right\nThen you have to go and have the blood test done and then you have to go back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way the doctor ordered the right test\nThere is there an easier way are the symptoms I could look for that when you tell me ... you're probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer so probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but other symptoms I can look for\nYes not having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only and another is your muscular skeletal system how kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic field will talk about that later than I have a paper coming out and\nAbout a week talking about vitamin D effect on athletic performance how sharp you feel mentally whether\nWhether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're just not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain how those are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient won't have any way of knowing it\nBecause they've been deficient for so long they think the way they feel and the way they think and then we move is normal yeah\nSo you can't go by symptoms\nNow you've written that vitamin D deficiency is probably the single most overlooked problem we face when it comes to to our health how can you see something that's wrong I mean what what's the scope of the problem here in the U.S [noise]\nWell more and more studies are showing virtually everybody is vitamin D deficient of course it all depends upon how you define that I mean if you define vitamin D deficiency is anybody less than thirty\nThen about a half of Americans are vitamin D deficient but but many people many scientists now thinking that ideal level is forty and many of us now think actually the ideal level is closer to fifty and\nIf you use the cut off the fifty than Ninety seven percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient\nLet me ask you this when when people started supplementing properly supplementing vitamin D was the product like purity products getting that five thousand I use per day what kind of a difference they gonna knows he's going to make them feel better\n[laughter] yeah that's probably the first thing that they'll notice as an effect on their feelings of wellbeing and moved by wellbeing I just mean this feeling that\nYou know you want to live you know in some ways what's the point of going on for a month\nA month to month where you you know you get\nUp and go is gone and you're you just don't really feel like doing anything you know you're not excited about anything anymore you your mood level is low and and that's one of the first thing that and the clues that we had a sort of interesting the clues we had to move are very similar to the close we had for heart healthy are going to talk about that later but\nBut people who live the closer you live to the equator the better your mood the higher you live closer to the sun for the higher the altitude you live at the better your mood\nAnd mood improved in the summertime so mood improved in the summertime and worse than in the wintertime now those were clues that vitamin D was somehow involved but just recently there have been a number of studies listen to this spot in the American Journal of geriatric psychiatry they looked at hundreds of people this is what they found\nThey found that people with the lowest vitamin D levels\nWere eleven times eleven times more likely to have a low mood and then professor Reinhold Veit at the University of Toronto actually did an intervention will study where he gave about three hundred patients four thousand units of vitamin D for a year or so\nAnd what stood out with their feelings of wellbeing and ... ... they're feeling of wanting to live life\nAnd they can feel a difference when they start to supplement the proper language she takes about a month I let me let me get this special offer because I'm watching the clock here purity has put together fantastic offer you've got the vitamin D the recommended dosage the five thousand I use per day\nAnd you've also asked them to combine it with their omega three fish oils and there's a reason for that I Want you to explain that the synergy you get they seemed to make each other even work better plus you're really excited about the fact that you talk to them into a pretty good all your pain for shipping and the shipping deals pretty good\n[noise] yeah when I approached purity I said you know vitamin D needs again and the the special form of vitamin K the expensive for vitamin K to\nIt needs that bore on and I want it to be patented or on and it needs magnesium and it needs think and we'll talk about why that's important but then I said it also needs fish oil there to work together synergistic lay\nAnd this is what I Want you to do I want you to give away a bottle of vitamin D a month's supply that sixty ...\nIn a bottle of the molecularly distilled ultra pure official I Want you to give it away for free and they kind of laughed and they said okay I Will do it then and they asked me why and I said because in a month most people will feel the difference and they'll come back for more but then I said you know I don't want\nAny Nineteen Ninety five shipping and handling charge I don't want any fourteen Ninety five shipping and handling charge I don't want even a nine Ninety five shipping and handling when you get less than five dollars they agreed to a shipping and handling charge you for Ninety five to four Ninety five\nYou get a free bottle of vitamin D a month's supply of the complete formula one\nYou can't buy anywhere else in a month's supply of fish oil when he got to lose right\nRight what do you have to

trees will prevent any diseases\nWelcome once again to help line by purity products\nHave your host marks the most so glad you could joined us today it's a power pack program in fact our story originally Fifteen Years ago when the renowned TV show sixty minutes captivated audiences around North America with a special segment on the French paradox\nYou remember the French paradox this is the counter intuitive concept that says red wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best activates genes that control our weight\nOr energy healthy aging and even longevity\nThe holy grail of medical research and what did they find out of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was was there a troll yes ... all the active ingredient found in that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nAnd our guest today says that's just half the story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce Robert Twenty years Dr precedent as an institution in New York radio hosting his own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a longtime product formulated and high level advisor for purity products Dr press mid welcome aboard\nMark always great speaking to you\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's talk to them this was very troll phenomenon those people out there who just vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is was very ... and why is it all over the news today well\nFirst of all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News\nYou know I read about twenty health journals a week and every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically resveratrol is what we call a poly feeding all it's found in red wine it's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries it's even found in ...\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation\nAnd the scientists really first became interested and resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when Roosevelt ritual was first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms that even some fish well anything that extends the life of anything is going to pick the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow well\nBy two thousand six Italian scientists discovered that resveratrol extended the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and it even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand sex\nAnd here's what really got them interested a Harvard researcher David Sinclair report about resveratrol counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice bite thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seemed to protect the intestines and the colon it definitely supported normal and semantics\nActivity in the body it improved indoor ends\nThere was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved enduring storing aerobic activity and it even proved to support brain function\nGreat study from Weill Cornell Medical school in New York I was just reading that an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any perceived health threat like not eating enough caloric restriction your body feels threatened this which is on what they called the longevity gene in your body it switches on sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a secular level metabolism changes\nYour ability to adapt and cope dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the Cape according to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard no this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWell this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years under co Q. formulas but now they feature co enzyme Q. ten which is just as important as reservists role especially for your heart healthy and you'll see some ways it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs to ten ... what exactly is it good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak of water co enzyme is\nA co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects will co Q. ten is the nutrient that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart\nYour liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat\nInto energy wow that's amazing\nYeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful anti oxygen and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's a while ago well I was teaching for the first time physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point and that this is Nineteen sixty three\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin where they were looking for what makes the heart beat they were literally looking at hearts and saying\nWhat is making this darn thing beat well they found out that was co Q. ten and that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell\nWins himself a Nobel Prize for describing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products", "city": "Boston", "day": "07"}
