Brett Kavanaugh sworn in as Supreme Court justice last night at followed a showdown on the Senate floor with protesters shouting from the gallery as vice president Mike Pence and the final voting process started at arm's\nWe actually talk about do you need to go get another job and then how some of our clients have gone to get other jobs just to supplement their retirement income maybe it's something they enjoy doing if they're handy maybe they go work for Home Depot or something like that but\nYou know can you make it based on your savings and if you want to do a different job is it because you have to or because you want to\nAnother question that people often find themselves Afghan and asking you Joel when they're in a position of a force retirement is should I accept a pension buyout and received that lump sum or keep the pension as a monthly lifetime payout very often in these forests retirement situation\nYou are presented with that option do you want the four hundred and fifty three thousand dollar lump sum or do you want to take the twenty eight hundred dollars a month for the rest of your life\nWell and again in that book I wrote there is actually a a graphic there is a chart of a specific client it's a real client a real ...\n... were a few years back and we'll call this guy a Steve\nSteve Hattie offer that when he retired to either take the pension buyout meaning he took a lump sum and rolled it over into an Ira now he has control over the investments he can manage the money the way once you can change income from time to time or stick with a guaranteed pension where he didn't get a lump sum to control\nBut he got to pay out for the rest of his life every single month\nAnd when we did the analysis\nHe decided to take the buyout take that lump sum roll it over into an Ira and we're still managing big chunk of that Ira today and he's real glad that he did that\nThat's a question that each individual needs to answer on their own we help people all the time to figure out which one of those two choices to make\nSome people love the security that monthly pay out they don't care about the lump sum\nThey want to check every month guaranteed for as long as they live or for as long as I'm them and their spouse live it's just an individual decision you know for instance my wife Wendy she probably loves the idea of a monthly lifetime payout that's guaranteed she doesn't care as much about the lump sum but if I wasn't here\nShe would probably just love to know that that income is coming in every single month I however no the power of good investment planning also I Love the idea of passing money on to kids and grandkids so I Would probably side on the buyout take the lump sum of money that's backing the pension roll it over and to an IRA\nAnd control the way it's invested so again an individual decision sometimes a couple of needs to talk this through with a professional\nVery very important decision so I Can't answer it one way or the other today John because again we need to walk people through a careful analysis and really gauge where their emotions are around the issues of financial security\nThere is a decent portion of the book that you wrote forced to retire that's dedicated to this very issue again let's give away some copies of that book the number to call eight hundred seven zero five one two three two that's eight hundred seven zero five twelve\nThirty to Joe how in death do you get on this pension buyout issue in the book\nWell we get pretty in depth I like I said I did I give an actual example of a real client we talk about the things that you needed side the circumstances that would take over um that would sway you towards monthly lifetime payout versus having control so it gets pretty deep there's a there's an entire chapter devoted\nTo uh to the pension buyout decision\nAgain if you'd like a copy of that book if you're in that stage where you're being forced into retirement or you already have been forced into retirement or maybe it's an option that's been presented to you this book will be very valuable to you\nIt's yours no cost or obligation to reach out and let us know you'd like to get a copy of it eight hundred seven zero five one two three two that's eight hundred seven zero five at twelve thirty to let us know you'd like a copy of ... book forced to retire\nDo another one of the questions that we often get from people who are in this stage of life is I have the option of taking my severance says a one time payment or I can take a payment over several months which of those should I Choose\nSo there's two answers to this question if if we were to forget about unemployment compensation for forget about your state unemployment funds and just think about\nIf these are the two choices you have taken severance or taking a payout over several months usually it's better to spread that payment out over a number of months most companies will give\n'em for every year of service or they might give a month excuse me for every year of service they might give a week or two of pay so if you have Twenty years of service you might get half\nA year of a severance and if you take down in the lump sum\nThey're gonna take taxes out of that as if you made that every two weeks or so so it's better to spread that out over a period of time maybe you can even put some taxes into next year if you take it at the end of one particular year so it's almost always better to take that pay out over several months however\nYou need to check with your unemployment office and sometimes a human resources people at your company can tell you whether that's gonna affect unemployment sometimes if you take\nThe payments you can't collect unemployment if that was your plan until those payments stop so we got to kind of coordinate that with unemployment but if unemployment doesn't matter um if you're gonna be able to get that either way I Would spread those payments out\nDo another question that people often ask when they're in this stage of life is\nYou know should I find another job or just try to retire altogether and try to make it work this goes back to what you were talking about at the beginning when he said what do you what to do\nAnd let's try to make the numbers work from there but a lotta people let's say they're sixty one they almost feel like well I was planning to work till sixty six or sixty seven so I'm really short changing myself\nIf I Walk away this early but what if they actually have all the money that they need in order to create the lifestyle they want their plan to work till sixty fixer sixty seven wasn't actually based on any planning that they'd done they just thought that's what they needed to do I know you've seen that where people are actually in better shape than they thing\nYeah we see it all the time many people that come to us just because of the nature of someone who listens to this program and comes in to visit with us for that money map retirement review [noise]\nAre just good savers are good savers they've lived below their means and so we're sitting down with them and they're not sure exactly where they stand but we run that income analysis for them that future income analysis based on what they've saved and they're guaranteed source of income they find out hey they're in great shape\nAnd this is what we typically see with most again most prospective clients that come in so when we're sitting with them now it's a question of do you want to get another job or do you want to just retire now sometimes somebody says why I Want to get another job and they try for a little while\nAnd they end up not being able to get hired somewhere else maybe it's because of their age and we can talk about age discrimination but you know it's real hard to prove that but the bottom line is let's find out if you have to work let's find out if you can make it work if you've got enough\nMoney saved so you know it's been a great discussion so far about this forced retirement either being offered an early retirement are being forced to retire early is\nWhy I Want you to get the book forced to retire like I said earlier it's an easy forty five minute read it covers the seven things you need to decide before you take an early retirement offer or if you've been forced to retire early or if you think you're going to be\nGet the book one eight hundred seven zero five one two three two again one eight hundred\nSeven zero five one two three two when you call that number you're going to hear a very brief recorded message from me leave your name will get back to you and we'll get you out a copy of the book not any book are real book you can hold in your hand and you can read at your leisure so give us a buzz get a copy the book\nEight hundred seven zero five one two three two\nIs the number that eight hundred seven zero five\nTwelve thirty two if you like your own copy of forced to retire eight hundred seven zero five twelve thirty two you're listening to Dole Johnson's money wisdom Joel is a certified financial planner and the c._e._o. of Johnson ... the official wealth management partner of the Yukon huskies\nDoes talk a little bit about emotions and the role that they can play\nIn retirement planning sometimes good sometimes bad but more often than not emotions are not our friend when it comes to financial planning I Know one of the emotions that can really take a toll on your portfolio is greed how to use the greed manifesting itself when it comes to investing\nWell nobody wants to say they're greedy but a lot of people will say hey I'm afraid I'm missing out and that's really where greed comes into play here I'm afraid I'm going to miss out I better get in the markets hitting all time highs and I didn't have all my money invested in stocks um oh my goodness look at\nYou know Apple's stock it's it's gone up and I could have owned at a year ago and I didn't own it\nThis this self talk we have of everybody's making money and I'm missing out or I'm not making enough money inevitably it can get clients into trouble because what they're typically doing is they're buying at the high than the market turns on them their funds or whatever they own start to go down\nOr they go down enough and they sell trying to preserve what they have left then the market turns and starts going back up again and they buy again fearing that are going to miss out then the market turns and it starts to go down and they sell the\nKeep buying high and selling low buying Heinz ... if they keep repeating that long enough there'll be broke and even though you're hearing me say this and you're going well that's not me that's not me\nThis is the typical investor and I bet if you really examine some of the investment decisions you've made if you're like most people maybe you're not but if you're like most people\nFor whoever you want the beneficiaries to be I don't know what the strategy is their George but you can't circumvent the rule but you can certainly use this rule and create a big asset and a lot of leverage because of the money being forced out\nFrom the rule now if you're younger than George if you're sixty eight sixty five sixty fifty five now is the time right now is the time no matter how young you are\nTo look at this problem because if you've saved a lot of money for retirement you're walking right into a tax time bomb that's going to hit you at age seven and a half especially if you said more than you need to get an income plan but then come up with a strategy what I said way earlier way back when in the program was\nMinimize your taxes over your lifetime don't just for your taxes this year and sometimes that means paint some taxes today many pull in some money out of your IRA today\nTo double triple quadruple maybe even ten times that money in the future and creating a tax free chunk of money using a problem to create a big solution\nLots of good questions and all of them strike right at the heart of what you do do you know here we have people all we don't know how Kerry is she wants to start or custom wedding cakes business but junior is retiring in a year Georgia's about turned Seventy these are folks who are\nRetiring sooner already retired and they have those very specific questions related to retirement planning which I Know is exactly what you focus on at Johnson ... what do they need to do to get more help\nWell give us a call right now we want to help you we'll set up a time

and the principal thing\nTherefore get wisdom and and all you're getting get understand but this is Joel Johnson's money was\nListening to bill Johnson money wisdom thanks for hanging out with us today Joe is a certified financial planner and the c._e._o. of Johnson unity\nThe official wealth movement partner of the Yukon huskies still has been published in Forbes the wall Street Journal and the Hartford Business Journal you see him every weekend on T. V. as the host of better money\nIn Connecticut on W. FSB channel three on a Saturday and Sunday Morning news with tariffs on ... and in Boston Saturdays at seven AM he's an analyst for Fox Business Fox Connecticut NBC thirty and W. teenage channel eight Joel what's happening in our area\nWe are going to have a great show today John thanks for asking I'm doing real well we're going to be talking about retirement uncertainties uncertainties in real this is sort of our segment for people that are already retired\nA lot of things that change in retirement that could really cause some banks I'm a little anxiety we're going to tell you how to deal with those items particularly important if you're already retired and then\nWe're going to talk about irreversible decisions that you may be making even before he retired in fact you probably are going to make those before he retired and so things that once you make a decision you cannot change you can't go back and change it's important that we get these right the first time so\nIt's going to be a good show today and I think the show is very timely based on what's going on out there in our country all the political uncertainties the fighting back and forth between the two parties the what's been going on in the economy in the markets people really don't know what to believe these days you know as the economy doing better is it not depending on who you listen to\nA might only be better on the surface other people is to might be doing fantastic\nAnd so we want to bring you clarification through this show and what I Love to tell folks is\nFocused on the things that you can control there are a lot of things outside of our control a lot of things that we hear about on the news that are completely outside of our control what we want to do on this program is focused on what you can control so you can improve your financial life\nWell Joel let's talk about some of those on certain things that we'd have to plan foreign retirement you remember the old Donald Rumsfeld the famous press conference where he talked about\nUnknown unknowns and known knowns unknown unknowns\nAnd all that stuff got reminds me of ah what what is it they say uh I Need to know what I don't know or something like that I it's more important that you know what you don't know that it gets a little confusing the way they put it in the nomenclature here [laughter] well\nWhat what we're talking about here is actually\nThe known unknowns that is to say the things that we know that we don't know if you will so how do we plan for those in retirement these are the uncertainties that you have to be able to kill foreign somebody's retirement plan the first one the biggest one of the most obvious one\nIs life expectancy your longevity how long am I going to live we knew the answer to that question retirement planning would be a lot easier so how do we plan when we don't know the answer that question\nWell the interesting thing is you know if we asked that question today\nAnd somebody is healthy sixty five year old today they might live to Ninety five in fact there is a pretty good probability they're going to live to Ninety five if we were to ask that same question Twenty years ago to sixty five year old they probably would've said maybe eighty five\nI think if you're sixty five years old and the you're twenty thirty you're gonna live past a hundred obviously there will be some people that don't some people that genetic because he's just aren't able to but when you look at medical science when you look at the advances that we're making especially now with a genetic testing\nA stem cell research and and uh people using stem cells to\nReinvigorate um you know joints that have gone bad even possibly a diseases of the brain and so on longevity is an issue that is not going away and why is this important to you as a retiree it's important because\nYou've got to have not only your income to last a long long time but you've got to be able to give yourself raises for inflation so those old days of working all your life until you're sixty five and retiring and maybe you only have Twenty years when you're in retirement\nThose are gone ah we plan for the average couple now for somebody to be alive until eight hundred we run our financial plans are ... financial analysis weren't counting on one of you if you're married to be alive until age one hundred if you're an individual\nWe still want to run it out to one hundred we want to make sure you have enough money to last for the rest of your lives and you can keep up with inflation so we run these financial analysis for you and behind the scenes they're very very sophisticated\nBut what we share with you is very very simple and easy to understand it's one of the\nThings I'm proud of is that we're able to talk to people that are really really sophisticated when it comes to financial matters\nAnd folks that just want to know like my mom and dad are we going to be okay and\nAnd the reports that we give you as clients\nAre nice and simple easy to understand and obviously if somebody wants all the technical backup we can give that to you about life expectancy in longevity is a much bigger issue than people think it is I think a lot of financial advisors are really missing the boat here\nThey're planning on the clients done way too early when they run their financial projections and people are going to be in a boatload of trouble when they find out hey I'm living in Ninety five hundred a hundred and five and potentially running out of money\nThat's a big one we have to address another uncertainty that we have to think about Joe's changes in interest rates a lot of people say well you know I I won't have a mortgage any more I don't keep that much money in the bank interest rates don't really affect me but people aren't really taking into account how their portfolio how their investments are affected by changes in interest rates\nWell there's no question about it and I don't think people realize just in the last year to two years how much interest rates have moved up on short term bonds when we look at the ten year treasury bond interest rates are up what we call a hundred basis points in the industry\nOr one percent now that move on a ten year bond from two percent all the way up to three for example just from two to three\nThat is a huge move what that means is when that happens over a year year and a half period of time if you had money in investment grade bonds or bond fund you probably didn't make a nickel your money probably sat there and didn't make anything because even though you were collecting your interest payment the value of your bonds went down", "show_name": "Johnson Brunetti Money Wisdom with Joel Johnson", "year": "2018", "city":
