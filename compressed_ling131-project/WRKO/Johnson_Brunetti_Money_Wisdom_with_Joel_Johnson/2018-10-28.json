empty out the gutters so you do need to clean them you need to make sure that all the parts are attached down spouse or extended because by the way you let those gutters go and you get a lot of war than overflow them\nMany bad things can happen for example in addition to the water falling all over your\nLandscape that work and saturate into the foundation and cause a basement leak you can also destabilize the soil and lead the foundation cracks or if the water\nGets in the soil for the first three or four feet and stays there and then so freeze like in the winter can expand and crack the

say face but a different pace is probably a better word to use\nSo we want to keep those options open there's certainly no shame and changing directions on something that you thought was going to make you very happy during your golden years the bottom line is like my dad says everybody that's worked hard deserves a quality retirement but that quality retirement\nNeeds to be the way you define it not the way somebody else defines it than we certainly don't want you to get stuck in something or you've made a commitment to something and now you feel like you're stuck for two or three years to fulfill that commitment when it just is not who you really are\nYou know it seems extreme that somebody would do like you said moved to Florida and then say well I don't want to live here and moved back but I actually know a guy I was just talking to you\nA couple of weeks ago a friend of mine who lived in California he grew up in Missouri but lived in California for the last forty years and decided to retire back in Missouri and found out that when he got the Missouri he couldn't breathe because it was too humid and he had some lung issues and he had to move back to California so it does happen keep your options open\nBy the way speaking of that is for anybody that's thinking of moving to North Dakota last year I took all my boys and we went up to North Dakota for a family reunion Wendy couldn't go and I should say my three youngest boys Brandon who lives in Boston couldn't go but\nUh me Michael Joel and Noah all went up to North Dakota because my uncle Jim General James wold retired general who passed away a few years back that's where their family ranches and and so all my mom's side of the family got together up there in North Dakota I was there for two days\nI was so sick from something in the air it's either in the heyday or in the grass up there my both my boys were sick as can be so just in case for the multitudes of people that are listening to me that are thinking I'm going to retire and move to North Dakota you might want to look somewhere else if you have an allergy issues\nThat of course Joel not to be to fill serving but one of the ways that you can remove a lot of that retirement planning an actual retirement stress from your life is to work very closely with a good financial advisor\nWhile there's no question that money can be one of the biggest stressors not only in retirement but certainly in a marriage or I saw survey a little while back I Can't remember what magazine it was in um but it talked about one of the biggest causes for divorce was I'm arguing over money no certainly not the top one I don't think it was but it was certainly one of the top three there so\nI you know if you have a good plan in place for your money that eliminates a lot of uncertainty\nWhat does definitely cross dressing retirement is when you wait to get financial advice until after you retired or the moment you're going to retire the week before you're going to retire you decide to start interviewing and talking to financial advisors um I Would advise every one of you that's not retired yet have\nThat conversation start that conversation at least five years before you retire and if you're saying well Joel I'm within two years a retirement than start the conversation now if you've never worked with a financial advisor or if you're not sure you have the right financial advisor because once you transfer into retirement\nThat is a serious and fundamental change in your life it's a critical juncture in your life and you don't want to have stressors in areas that you could easily avoid\nIn one of those stress areas would be money financial planning money management all the insurance is maybe should drop when you go into retirement or pick up\nA when you go into retirement so it's real important to you create a plan\nAnd let your advisor work with you find the right advisor make sure that you work with somebody that's the right fit for you I tell people all the time in our workshops on my channel three\nA TV program on the channel three morning news on Sundays\nAnd even on this program were not the right fit for everybody so you want to make sure you find somebody that you can relate to but work closely with a good financial advisor to reduce some of the stressors that we've talked about very wealthy people some of the smartest people in the world use outside financial advisors it's very common in an area\nLike northeast where we have so many engineers that people do it themselves and I'm not going to tell you you shouldn't do it yourself but I Will tell you that there's been a lot of pain created by people that they thought they were smart enough to do it themselves at least get some kind of a second opinion\nSo with that said I Want to offer you our second opinion and that is what we call the money map retirement review a it's a unique process that's why we've actually trademarked the phrase money map retirement review\nAnd we take you through this process where not only do we do a good financial plan that's nice and simple and easy to understand very different than what other firms are doing out there where they make way too complicated we do a nice simple one page financial plan\nWe run an investment analysis on your portfolio to show you how much risk you're taking and we run a retirement income projection that shows you what rate of return you need on all your savings combined with your Social Security and any pension that you might have to be okay for the rest of your life so it's three main components that one page financial plan\nAn investment analysis to show you how much risk you're taking 'cause most of you listening to me right now are taking more risk than you think you are\nAnd third is that retirement income plan I Want to offer that to you right now call one eight hundred seven zero five one two three two I can make a couple of promises if you come in and visit with us number one you'll be treated very well and there'll be absolutely no pressure\nNumber two you will leave our office if you go through this money map process you leave our office whether you become a client or not most people don't\nBut you'll leave our office with a lot of quality planning and it's good advice session from somebody that specializes in working with retirees so get your own money map retirement or if you were gonna open that up to the next fourteen callers to call one eight hundred seven zero five one two three to call now one eight hundred\nSeven zero five one two three to get your customized money map retirement review\nNo time like the president to get that second opinion also leave with a copy of ... book the money map or forced to retire again the number to call eight hundred seven zero five twelve thirty two that's eight hundred seven zero five one two three to milk costs no obligation\nIt's an extension of the education we try to give you hear on the eight hundred\nSeven zero five twelve thirty two this is money wisdom Joel Johnson is a certified financial planner and cofounder of Johnson ... actually meant to ask you at the beginning of the show but it\nSlipped my mind I Know recently ah you had the opportunity to speak to some veterans uh what was that all about and what did you take away from that experience\nWell this was really a wonderful fulfilling and very moving experience I had I was invited to be a teacher\nAnd an organization called American Dream you an American dream you along with mission America\nThey trained people that are transitioning out of the military so they get with service members um somewhere between a few weeks in about a year before they're transitioning out of the military usually after a long term career and they're going to go back to work in civilian life and his organization helps prepare\nService members military folks for that transition ... is a drastic drastic change it is such a deep cultural change it a lot of people do not do well during the transition [laughter]\nThey're losing this Brotherhood that they've been used to um where somebody has your back all the time it's all about team and sometimes in corporate America\nUnfortunately it's not about team anymore it's it's a very selfish type of environment and they're not as close to their companions\nI'm too there are people in the military and their close friends\nThat they may be gone to the battlefield with as they are in corporate America so they missed that and it's really tough so I was asked by\nA gentleman that runs American Dream you are to be a speaker and I was down in Washington DC uh the first day we were down there we actually went to Walter Reed medical center and uh met with some of the people that weren't getting services and Walter Reed and then talk to some of the experts their psychologist about the transition\nAnd then we were able to speak at joint base Myers which is right across the Potomac\nI'm from Washington DC and we spoke to about two hundred ten service members that day in the day a ended with a time where they were able to get there get help brushing up their resumes and so on and it was just really an honor of course with a\nUncle that was a general and so many cousins and nephews and nieces that are in the military and then of course my son Michael who's going to\nOfficer candidate school down in marine base Quantico this summer it was just really an honor to be able to do that so uh\nYou know and I came back and we had a client meeting the next night or after I got back about three hundred clients\nUh here in Hartford that we're talking to going over there investment accounts and I just the first thing I said first thing out of my mouth was thanking them for being our clients and allow in our company to prosper enough where I can do some of these things that are just so special in so important um to the citizens of the United states so\nIt was just it was a really neat and moving time John\nVery cool glad you had the opportunity to do that and certainly appreciate the service of\nAll those guys and all the others who have fought and died for us over the centuries\nA well Joel let's open up the mail bag and take some questions from folks out there we're going to start with cred who says my wife is significantly younger than me and I'm guessing she'll outlive me by at least ten years do any life insurance on myself to be sure she's okay\nAfter I'm gone what's a good question Craig you you may need life insurance the way to find out if any life insurance or not is that retirement income plan that we do for folks it actually shows the impact on the surviving spouse when one spouse dies\nAnd what you see an ad is let's assume you're going to die first there's going to be certain parts of your income that stop certainly your Social Security check if you're both getting Social Security or Social Security check will stop or at least the smaller the two will stop\nYou may have a pension stops and of course your ... your wife is going to be in a higher tax bracket because she's now filing as a single person so if you have to pick up an extra thousand two thousand three thousand dollars a month of income and you don't have sufficient savings or investments to cover that then you may want to buy life insurance for that reason [noise]\nThe question is and it's hard to answer this right now because the market's going and going up for so long what's your behavior going to be don't underestimate your emotions they will cause you to do bad things\nThat will cause you to move out of the analytical part of your brain when things are not going well and you will inevitably make big mistakes on your stock portfolio last mailbag\nQuestion for you this is from Victoria who says I'm thinking about getting married to a gentleman I've been dating for the last two years the problem is that truly a problem is that he's twelve years older than me I'm worried about what happens if he's retired and I'm Still working is this a problem financially\nWell I I don't think it's a problem financially [laughter] I'll leave it up to you Victoria whether that's going to be a problem with you working in him not working and how you're going to navigate through that\nAs a married couple I'm not going to give you a marriage advice um but financially you know it's not a problem and if you do an income analysis and you figure out that you'll be fine with him being retired and and you're working I don't see a problem with that at all the key is to have a good income analysis done which is sort of a projection based on what's happening today\nWhere your incomes coming from the future how much you have an investments how long do you think you're going to live\nA factoring in inflation and it sounds like there's a lot of moving parts there but we make it real simple for you\nYou get that income announces that income projection then you can decide financially it makes sense if it doesn't financially makes sense that you can come up with some strategies on but we've seen this happen an awful lot usually it makes sense but you want to go into that marriage with a good feel for how you're going to manage their finances and quite frankly if you're going to be okay for the rest of your lives when it comes to money\nAre we in trouble in that situation if you know she's married to somebody who is significantly older he dies and you know she's without his Social Security and maybe a pension for Fifteen Years she might outliving how do we account\nFor that but when we would run our income analysis in this particular case we would have that simulated that would be stimulated in the income analysis that maybe he dies at age let's say Seventy seven and now she's only what sixty five what happens when that income is lost from that pension or Social Security does she have enough\nTo last from for the rest of her life and also you know one investments are there of his that may not go to her they might go to his kids are being grandkids are former spouse or something we have to analyze all of that\nCrunch those numbers put it into the income analysis but obviously that's something we always have to plan for um whether the man is older than the woman are not men tend to die seven years before women Wendy as\nI'm three years younger than I Am and so there's probably a ten year spread where she'll live after I'm gone we've got to make sure she's got the income to do that Victoria you need to make sure that you're in a good spot assuming your husband dies before you do\nA lot of people need help with questions just like this Joel the money map retirement review seemed like it would be a great fit for somebody like Victoria tell us how that works and how we make it happen\nIt's real simple just give us a call and set up in time to come into the office we do that it's absolutely complimentary doesn't cost you\nOne nickel to get that we don't pressure anybody but the money map retirement review what's exciting about is when I see people leave our office\nAnd they have a smile on their face they feel much better about their financial future not necessarily because it's better than they thought it was many times it is but because they have a clear picture going for the money map it consists of a one page\nFinancial plan shows you your whole life on one page when it comes to money when it comes to future income we do an income analysis we do a risk analysis for you to make sure you're not taken too much risk\nSo call one eight hundred seven zero five one two three to just give us a buzz set up a time to come in to one of our offices visit with an advisor and get your money map one eight hundred seven zero five one two three to\nEight hundred seven zero five twelve thirty to call or text whichever you prefer to be sure your first and last name when you're\nEight hundred seven zero five twelve thirty two you'll get a copy of want to do both when you come in for your money may advertise you one more time eight hundred seven zero five one two three two you're listening to money with them well Joel Johnson more to come to\n[noise] the thing or two about personal finance keep listening to Joel Johnson\nMoney with the deal is a bill Johnson money will sometimes for hanging out with the day Joel is certified financial planner and the c._e._o. of Johnson's many the official wealth management partner of Yukon huskies\nYou've seen jolt published in Forbes and the wall Street Journal he's the host of better money every weekend on W. FSB channel three on the Saturday and Sunday Morning news with Kara ... in Hartford in Boston you can find him on W. CBD\nEvery Saturday at seven AM hosting better money he's the host of six different books including the money map forced to retire in ... the think differently which we'll talk more about\nThe day and it's always a pleasure to have you I have a question for you as we lead off today you know anytime we have a bad week in the market inevitably you have some people will say this is it the crashes coming you have other people who say well it's no big deal we we're due for a slight correction\nHow do we know who's right\nYou don't know who's right and and you know if we if we're talking to people are listening to people that are real brilliant investors that have\nNo all kinds of research on their side I was listening to a gentleman named Howard Marks who runs oak tree capital big huge huge private money management firm and uh you know he was talking about what he looks for in different markets cycles but even admitted that you know from time to time he's earlier he's late and he misses a move in the market so\nI think it's important that people have a plan I think it's important that it you have a financial plan and regardless of whether the market just great the market does poorly that plan is not dependent upon you predicting moves in the market I think that planned needs to be dependent on you sticking with\nA certain road map that was laid out for you\nKnowing that the market's going to go up or down knowing that your income is going to be secure no matter what\nOr having money set aside for contingencies like long term health care or children or grandchildren that need help and that'll offset the emotions that rear their ugly head when we're either scared of missing out because the markets taken off or were very nervous because the market's going down\nI've been in this business for almost Thirty years now and I can tell you when we see the volatility that we saw a week and a half ago if I didn't have a long term strategy for my own money I Would probably be reacting 'cause we saw days where the market was down three\nIn the day and then another follow through day to day afterwards and then a little bit of a bounce the third day that friday air a little while back but even then it didn't recover and then Monday the Monday after that friday to even open up down a little bit so\nThink people need to be careful about predicting the future especially the short term direction of the market so again back to your question John you know the crashes coming is that correct or we're due for a slight correction the market's going to keep moving up\nI mean sooner or later this market's going to go down that doesn't mean that our listeners should be fearful what it means is they should have a plan anticipating at some point along the line\nThere's going to be a downturn if you have money on the sidelines maybe that's the time to start slowly bind month after month or so if you don't have money on the sidelines just make sure you've got some of your money protected\nWe don't know who's going to be right quite frankly I personally don't care who's going to be right my job as a financial advisor is to protect the downside in someone's portfolio\nSo that the upside takes care of itself that's kinda the old Warren Buffett saying he's rumored to have said rule number one is don't lose money and real number two is don't forget rule number one and it sounds cliche but\nMost people would just be better off if they could not take losses avoid those losses within their investment plan but again this all has to be done within the context of a full financial plan\nWell before we jump into the meat of today's show Joel I thought we might give away a book or two if that's okay with you I'd mentioned the wealthy think differently that's been your most recent book and it's been popular with folks recently maybe we can give away a couple of copy the urban give us the Fifteen seconds explanation of what that books all about\nWell if it's a perfectly what we were just talking about that you know our people obsessed with the short term moves in the markets are they thinking like the wealthy where they have a long term plan or they're outsourcing the management of the money so they can live their lives and there's so many different ways that the wealthy do think differently um I have a chapter in that book\nThe crowd is usually wrong the crowd is usually going in the right direction it's very hard for many people to fight where everybody's going you know especially some of your that type of person where you want to know what your friends are doing so that there's sort of a safety in the consensus of what your friends are doing but many times if you can find enough friends that are moving in a certain direction\nMight find out that's the wrong direction it's certainly\nThe situation many times with the stock market so the wealthy think differently I Want to give that book out to you are loyal listeners now give us a call one eight hundred seven zero five one two three two again it's one eight hundred\nSeven zero five one two three to get a copy of the book the wealthy think differently also get a feel for how I approach money and you can decide whether that's sort of a rite fit for you or whether you just digest some information in the book and you move on your way and take what you can use and leave the rest as they say\nWell again if you'd like to get a copy of that book reach out to us right now there's no strings attached to just leave us a message and let us know\nYou like a copy of the book the number to call the eight hundred seven zero five one two three to eight hundred seven zero five twelve thirty two again the book is the wealthy think differently how to discover and challenge your financial philosophy\nEight hundred seven zero five one two three to eight hundred seven zero five twelve thirty to\nDo we're going to talk today about the grass being greener on the other side you know sometimes you need to find a new financial advisor that's just all there is still there are other times though you might think you need a new advisor but really you're just guilty of thinking the grass is greener somewhere else so let's discuss a couple of different scenarios and whether or not", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Johnson Brunetti Money Wisdom with Joel
