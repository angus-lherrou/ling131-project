well the heart of every home is the kitchen and that's where meals get prepared and homework is done and guess always loved to hang out\nAnd the candidate tree in this kitchen was made by the crash the plane and fancy custom camera tree\nAnd Brian you're on I was looking at your website and I sounded pretty interesting that you guys make every single cabinet by hand is that true\nThat is absolutely true yes in the heart of Pennsylvania\nYeah it's a it's the work you're just spectacular so what bank last us like I mean obviously cat that's coming standard sizes but you guys basically cut the parts and put them all together by hand and they're kind of supervise no process the whole way\nJust substitute we uh we make cabinets that point of ... to the ... of a niche mother is no real standard size for us uh we make our own doors and drawers we make all of our cat in the tree whether it be European ... or traditional framed in ...\nI think a lot of folks don't realize how mass produce most kitchen cabinets are in fact there's a lot of trade offs in that process that\nThat is true or we are what I like to call a local custom cutting to chop on steroids [laughter] we do some production minded work but we're also very close to a lot of hands on work we do a lot of custom cat in the tree for any room of the house that a lot of other companies really don't want to touch\nAll right so let's say you're hearing this program you're thinking about a re doing your kitchen you blank slate um how do you tell folks get started with that process\nUh basically we have a network of professional kitchen about designers across the United states of America or they can\nGo to our designers and they will talk to them about colors woods style prairie traditional whatever it is and try to narrow down what their goal is for their project so that's really the place to store once that's done we're the manufacturer we take those plans and create and order\nAnd builds that exactly to their specification what's unique about the kitchen that you've been hearing the gyms on how well it's quite unique we're using a transitional door style let's actually the name of it\nAnd it's done in very precise equal sized panels that would be the maple white painted part of the kitchen a lot of the rest of the temperature in the house is a rift ...\nWhich is one of the hottest what's going right now right in in the custom market we have done some blue legroom kept in the tree and we also did the all the vanity and the house so it was\nVery good design very easy for us to make it to fit right on and make it look like a the customer one\nSo we're we're very proud of it looks fantastic\nYeah it looks it looks it looks really great so what are some of the mistakes that folks make you think when they start to plan a kitchen where people go wrong and then moved to her credit for many years well I guess\nYeah I think a lot of times um\nPeople tend to get caught up in trends ... or so they will pick something trendy and they'll find themselves for ten years down the road still living in the same house with no plans to move or thinking about doing it again I think a lot of times people tend to uh get wrapped up in counter tops\nAnd appliances takes a lot of their budget and they end up spending money they should for the quality of the need to less than a lifetime and a lot of times a day do the buyer's regret\nNot case so careful planning working with designers you're going to give you kitchen founded for many many years I'm ... from playing ... thank you so much for

[noise]\nThis can go both ways I mean at the same time if you're getting lousy service if you're not getting a response back then maybe it is time to you know I Would call that advisor call that for him and have an honest conversation that you just feel like things are different Lincoln a chance to correct it\nI Would be brutally honest with the company I don't think there's anything wrong with that at our company we are brutally honest with our clients will let them know like I said earlier you know if we made a mistake will let them know we're not perfect um if somebody is unhappy with the level of service will talk to them about that and we want people to call if they're dissatisfied with anything and I think\nYou know any firms that you're working with if they're if they have the right culture there'll be happy that you called\nAnd sometimes that associate advisor can do a better job for you then that lead advisor that is now running the from uh give you a perfect example you know if somebody calls if a client I have calls and they want to change a beneficiary I can promise you\nTo that Donna in my office is much better in getting that done right away finding the right form right away then I Would be because I'm concentrating on the relationship with the client and the long term fulfillment of the promises that we've made to that point that we are going to be here with them organs service them and so on so\nDon is going to be a lot better at it um it satisfying that request for the beneficiary change for him so there are different circumstances wrapped up in this question or in this answer I should say the bottom line is have\nThat honest conversation with your advisor if they're from has grown and be the judge if you think that they can uh do a good job for him many times bigger from is better\nThan a smaller for him and I mean like a one person shop or many times that affirmed that has a lot of staff has better at anticipating your needs and really walking you through the challenges that are inevitably going to come when you're in retirement\nAnd if you're advisors business has grown a lot in the time that you've been working with them and that's probably a good sign right I mean if they're business has gotten bigger they're probably not an idiot if they're savvy enough to build a business that's no guarantee that they're doing a great job for you but it's probably a feather in their cap would that be a safe assumption I think that's a that's a pretty good assumption\nRight how about this again we're talking about the grass being greener on the other side of this a legitimate reason to leave your financial advisor or not I went to a dinner seminar with a financial advisor and found him to be very entertaining and engaging much more so than my current advisor well\nSo if the question is should you leave your current advisor just because the person was entertaining engaging the answer to that is I Hope it's obvious there's no now if you think that that person that you went to see at the dinner seminar\nOr has a good sense of being an expert in the area of financial advice that you may be in maybe you're\nJust before you're retiring or you're going to that seminar you've been retired for a couple of years and going out seminar and and you think that they specialize in your type of person then maybe it's worth it to sit down with them or maybe they do have a better handle on things in your current advisor maybe they don't but certainly don't make a decision at a dinner seminar\nUm I think if you like the person you ought to have an appointment with them maybe get a second opinion but certainly don't change your advisor until you investigate further I mean again we offer just a little while ago for you to give us a call and get a copy of my new book\nThe wealthy think differently and we talk a lot of these things were touching on we talk about in that book\nYou know I talk about as I mentioned earlier that the crowd is usually wrong you want to go into a different direction of the crowd when you're thinking about investments we talk about the\nThe way the wealthy treat time\nOr the way that they don't completely focus on price they focus on value it's just it's a lot of great tips and it's an easy read so I mean if you want to copy that book give me a call at eight hundred seven zero five one two three two one more time that's eight hundred seven zero five one two\nThree two I'll send you a copy of that book the wealthy think differently no strings attached\nI think you'll enjoy it you'll get a feel for who we are whether we ever see or talk to you again or after you get that book I think you'll have a nice understanding of what I've seen over the almost Thirty years that I've been doing this business which is that hey there's a difference in the way the wealthy think\nEight hundred seven zero five twelve thirty two is that number to call eight hundred seven zero five one two three to talking about whether or not these are legitimate reasons to leave your financial advisor\nOr if you're just a victim of thinking the grass is greener on the other side about this Joe I like my advisor but I recently moved to a different state and I'm Wondering if I should be working with somebody local instead this is really a personal decision\nOr some people want an advisor they can go in and they can see their face and talk to face to face across the desk others of video conferences just fine others you know they might have been working with somebody for a long long time and it's fun to just do a conference call\nMaybe the advisors sends you a they review material to review your investments are your financial planning ahead of time and you go through it on the phone\nThis is totally a personal decision I Would not leave your advisor just because you moved to a different state um I think that there can be an effective relationship one way or the other I can tell you we have a lot of clients that have moved down to the Carolinas down to Florida and we still have a great relationship with them we talk to them all the time\nI'm from time to time when somebody a begins to age and maybe they're living with their son or daughter on it in an in law apartment or something that son or daughter it might have a different financial advisor just for\nYou know mom or dad helped the son or daughter ... might want to move the assets to a local person that they're already working with so I'm just because you move doesn't mean you should switch your advisors I guess that's what I'm trying to say here\nLast point on this discussion jolt the market crashed and I lost a ton of money in my portfolio should we leave our advisor or not\nWell this is one where the grass may not be greener depending on which advisor you go to if you leave your advisor but I Hope it was not a surprise that when the market went down\nYou lost money in your portfolio if it was a surprise that I Would suggest you had the wrong investments in that advisor maybe put you in the wrong stuff for lack of a better word because\nUh the bottom line is from time to time the market's going to go down and hopefully you're expecting when the market goes down whatever you ended up losing the advisor educated that to you in the first place we have a number of accounts that we use where you can't lose money on where there's principle protection whether it's a bank type of product or insurance type of product you just cannot lose\nPrinciple as long as the bank or the insurance company stays in business other accounts we have um we have some of our clients want very aggressive growth and they have a portfolio commensurate with apple when the market moves against them they are going to\nHave the market move against them in their account so it really depends the question I Would ask here if the market crashes and you lose a ton of money in your portfolio is did my advisor prepare me for this did they explain that sooner or later this is going to happen if the answer is yes\nThen I don't think you have a beef with your financial advisor if the answer is no they didn't explain it to me that I think you have a problem you might want to look elsewhere\nDo I think the bottom line is that a lot of cases some people maybe just need a second opinion if nothing else or how can we make that happen if somebody says look I I don't know if I'm In bad shape or not what can you offered to him\nWell we'll give you our money map our money map retirement review it is the second opinion a it's a second opinion you appreciate there's no strings attached it just basically three things that I think very few people have all three of these components one is\nWe call them out because it's a one page plant to one page financial plan we put all your assets all your liabilities your future income needs your president income your financial concerns on one beautiful page that's a great point for us having a meeting with you point for a discussion\nIf you are married you can have that discussion with your spouse because you'll both be on the same page no pun intended because you'll have your whole financial life on that one map we called the money map again\nAnd so we want to offer that to you it's got to additional components that has a retirement income analysis to see if your going to be okay if you're going to have enough money\nTo last for the rest of your life many people are worried about running out of income a dying or a running out of income before they die so we want to make sure that you know that you're OK and if you're not you take the steps to remedy that deficiency\nAnd then last but not least a stress test on your portfolio a lot of what we've been talking about today\nIs having things happen to you and your money that you didn't expect we want to make sure that you anticipate what could go wrong and so although we're not sitting around waiting for a market crashed we're cautious investors\nWe want you to see the downside of your investment strategy and the upside so get your money map again three things one page financial plan your whole entire life on one page an income analysis to make sure you're not going to run out of money before you die\nAnd last but now he's a stress test on your portfolio costs now to set up that time to come in and visit with us the number one eight hundred seven zero five one two three two that's one eight hundred seven zero five one two three to give us a call when you come in you'll get a free copy of one of my books\nAnd you'll leave with your own personal customized money map\nEight hundred and seven zero five twelve thirty two hundred seven zero five one two three too if you'd like to come in for your own money nap retirement review\nEight hundred seven zero five one two three two you're listening to build Johnson's money wisdom Joel is a certified financial planner and\nThe ... of junk and ... the official wealth management partner of the Yukon huskies\nDo let's talk about some major life events that you almost always need to have some financial counseling when you're facing one of the significant events in life or you can explain why first of all a job change why my Batman assessed the Tate some financial advice\nBut the reason they do that is because they have won money manager that might specialize in let's say private equity another one that might specialize in foreign stocks another one that might specialize in real estate so they're sort of taking the\nSpecialty investment categories and divided them up but for most people doesn't make sense to have a number of different financial advisors and it can get confusing and if it's not confusing now\nAs you get older it might get confusing it might just be one day hassled\nBy last question from today's mail bag is from Meredith who says we've never lived on a budget our entire lives and my husband is very resistant to having a budget once we retire but without a budget how do we make sure that we don't run out of money ten years before we die\nWell great question married at the way you make sure that you're not going to run out of money is that you make sure you have a retirement income plan in in that retirement income plan you know exactly how much money you need to set aside\nTo cover all your income neat so let's say you have two million dollars and we do a retirement income plan for you and we find out if you set aside a million five hundred thousand one and a half million in this investment strategy over here\nThat's designed to provide you income for the rest of your life\nAnd maybe we can get a guarantee on all are a part of that income and then you have a half a million dollars\nThat you know you can spend you can spend it on a monthly basis you can spend chunks at a time you can save some and not spend some this year but spend more than extra but you know that on the one side that million and a half guarantees all your retirement income so that's how I Would approach it\nI'll make sure you have enough money set aside with a good financial plan where you know Meredith you never have to worry about running out of money if there's extra leftover great then you can satisfy your husband's resistance\nTo have a budget now I Will make a confession here as a financial planner I hate budgets\nI don't like budgets I feel like they constrained me I'm fifty six years old even when I was in my thirties I didn't like budgets but I understand the need to save money and to have a plan so what Wendy and I always did was we set aside a certain amount of rain come right off the top\nAnd just saved it and if there was extra money left over at the end of the month we could spend that if there wasn't any extra left at the end of the month then we didn't have any to spend so you know whether it's a budget or whether it's a forced savings program or you have an income plans set up where there's some sacred money that you won't touch you need to have some kind of a system in place\nWhere you don't overspend and like you said Meredith run out of money ten years before you die\nGreat example of folks who should come in to have a chat with you and your team Joel if they don't have that plan in place already tell us what that whole process looks like\nWell people come in and visit with us so you can come in and visit with us there's no obligation we've been really blessed his affirm as you know we have offices all over the New England

for hanging out with us today Joel is a certified financial planner and the c._e._o. of Johnson ...\nThe official wealth management partner of the ... he's been published in Forbes and the wall Street Journal you see on TV every weekend as the host of a better money on W. FSB channel three on the Saturday and Sunday Morning news with Kara ...\nIn Hartford and in Boston museum Saturday at seven AM on W. CBD he's been an analyst for Fox Business and the author of six books including the money map forced to retire and the wealthy think differently Joel it's always a pleasure how are you this week\nWell doing great John I'm excited about the program I'm actually excited about football season uh I Am unfortunately a Vikings fan and each year they disappoint but since my dad is originally from the Minneapolis area and his whole family is up there I continue to be hopeful every year\nWell the great thing about the Vikings Joel is that they find a different way to disappoint like sometimes they come into the season with great expectations and they're terrible sometimes they get to the playoffs and losing the most heartbreaking way imaginable so they always keep you guessing in terms of how they're going to disappoint you\nI actually went to the super bowl back in Nineteen Seventy nine they played the raiders\nAnd it was one of those crushing just crushing defeats\nAnd back then you know now the super bowls are pretty close back then they were really blow out so I think the Vikings last like thirty eight to sixteen or something like that [noise] um but I'll never forget that it was awesome it was at the rose bowl now when I was a little kid my dad took us to some games in the old ... stadium in Bloomington, Minnesota they would play outdoors\nAnd the coach was bud grant and he would not allow the Viking\nPlayers to have any heaters on the sidelines his philosophy was he wanted them to be more comfortable on the field than off the field so bud was kind of one of these old time just brutal guys\nI'm but boy they had an awesome team back then the the uh what do they call it the purple people eaters the front line of the Vikings with Carl our and Alan Page and these guys so bring back some good memories talking about that and here we are in football season and we're enjoying some games now and boy and it's it's kind of neat as a father who's an empty nester to have\nThose boys come back home for a weekend and watch football with him\nWell so you might be asking yourself what does all of this have to do with my retirement planning what the football afternoon with my portfolio well believe it or not there are a lot of parallels between the game of football\nAnd the game if you want to consider it a game of retirement planning we'll start with the concept of the red zone anytime you watch the game show post game show halftime analysis of what's going on in the game you'll hear a lot about the red zone what team did or did not do successfully\nIn the red zone on the football field and there's also a red zone when it comes to financial planning So Joel explained the red zone and why it's so important in both football and financial planning\nAll right John the red zone is the last twenty yards before a team gets into the end zone and that last twenty art is critical for a team\nYou know if a team gets to that last twenty yards let's say it's you know first and goal and a nine year old line and they can't get in and it's very demoralizing the mistakes that a team can make a tend to be magnified in those last twenty yards\nAnd so it's really really important that they do the right things that they really execute properly in that financial red zone and football which is of course like I said the last twenty yards while in retirement planning\nThe red zone is the last five to ten years before you retire this is when you're in the red zone and again mistakes are much costly er\nDuring that period of time than they were when you were younger as a matter of fact\nI like to say the financial red zone is five years before and five years after you retire because again those decisions you make just before you retire and after we retire within about five years a retirement can have a real bearing on your lifestyle in retirement\nThe biggest fear that people that we talked to have is running out of money in retirement even are wealthier clients they might not say I'm scared of running out of money and retirement but they're scared of not being able to keep up the lifestyle that they've grown accustomed to show by treating this financial red zone again that five years before\nAnd five years after you retire as the critical zone that it is and realizing it's so important that you make the right decisions during all the time it gives you a greater degree of confidence to make sure that the rest of your retirement is going to be smooth sailing\nSo very important that you minimize your mistakes and the red zone both in football in in a retirement planning how about the hurry up office I think most people who follow football understand what the hurry up often says that you can give us a a quick primer there but then what does the hurry up office look like in financial boiling", "show_name": "Johnson Brunetti Money Wisdom with Joel Johnson", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "21"}
