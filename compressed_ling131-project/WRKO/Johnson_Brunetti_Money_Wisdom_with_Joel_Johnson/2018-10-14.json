Johnson's money wisdom Joel is a certified financial planner and the c._e._o. of Johnson brunette he the official wealth management partner\nOf the Yukon huskies\nJoel for a lot of people I think maybe they assume that they understand Bond's\nA lot of people do understand bond real well but then there are some blind spots\nThat they're missing a what's just start at the very basics because I think it's an important discussion to have especially in the interest rate environment that we're in right now so since there's so much misunderstanding about bonds and general just give us a quick explanation of how bonds were\nWell it's very different than stocks stocks you actually own a piece of a company let's take a company like Raytheon we can either on their stocks or on their bonds if we own their stock that means I own a piece of Raphael I'm actually an owner\nIf we own their bonds that means that we've loaned the company money on the risk scale bonds are safer than stocks from a legal standpoint because the company doesn't have to keep it stock back they don't have to pay me back\nFor that stock I bought but they only money if I own a bond that means they have to pay me interest and give me all my money back when the bond matures so overall\nStocks are riskier than bonds now bond funds are different than owning individual bond so again I can own a bond fund that has that racing bond inside it the difference there is the bond fund never matures there's never a specific date where I get all my money back\nThere are pros and cons about owning bond funds are owning baskets of bonds\nVersus individual bonds this is one where you really have to sit down with a financial advisor and figure out what's best for you now here is a huge miss conception the misconception is\nThat bonds are always safer than stocks from an investment standpoint remember I said from a legal standpoint they're safer than stocks the company has to pay you back\nBefore they give money back to any shareholders but interest rates where they are right now and where they're going because they're trending up\nWe see people all the time that I think they're being safe and bond funds and they've actually lost money over the last twelve to Eighteen months they haven't lost money in their stocks but they've lost money in their bond so the key here is this folks\nInterest rates are going up use bond alternatives right now do not by individual bonds it's Ninety nine percent likely that you'd be better off and some of the alternatives that we use some of the things where you can't lose money but you still get a reasonable rate of return\nUse those for safety principle protected\nVersus going into bonds with new money where you might actually go backwards and there's been so much last opportunity in the last one to three years because just the latest trend in interest rates going up\nHas had people give back all the profits they've made in bonds over about the last two or three years so be very cautious about bonds if you've got bonds and your portfolio come on and let us analyze those bonds\nWere not sane sell those bonds or sell those bond funds and go into stocks what we're saying is that there are much better alternatives that we use with our clients for safety and reasonable interest\nSo a lot of people assume as you said ... that they have a safer position than they actually have because of the bonds they're invested in if you're not clear exactly how much risk you have in your portfolio if you've never had that assessed\nReach out to us we'd be happy to sit down and give you a stress test to help you can't understand you know if we experienced certain conditions in the market or changes in the interest rate environment how is that going to affect your portfolio specifically the bonds that you own\nThe number to call if you'd like to take advantage of that is eight hundred seven zero five one two three two that's eight hundred\nSeven zero five twelve thirty two you can call or text whichever is easy for you eight hundred\nSeven zero five one two three to\n... wrap up today by talking about taxes I think everybody loves the idea of trying to find ways to save money in taxes whether it's this year or in future years but the problem is most people aren't actually taking the steps they need to take\nTo save that money in taxes I think most people do assume that their taxes are going to be lower in retirement how often are they actually correct\nThat or they're not correct most people are not correct about that we've been told all our lives that your taxes are going to be lower and retirement I Would guess at least half of our clients if not more their taxes are actually higher in retirement not just because tax rates have gone up\nBut because they've saved more money than they thought they were going to they've got more income they've done better and kind of getting paralyzed for that all that different they took tax breaks they took to defer money in earlier years\nIs now coming back to bite them and in some cases it creates a tax time bomb so a lot of planning that we do is reducing taxes reducing taxes in retirement the other situation you have is one one spouse passes away if you have a married couple when one spouse passes away\nUsed the income drops a little bit because of perhaps part of a Social Security check going away\nBut now they have to file the survivor has to file as a single\nTaxpayer so they have a drop in income but even though they have a drop in income taxes actually go up because they can no longer file jointly they have to file a single taxpayer so we spend a ton of time looking at tax issues there's there's a few strategies\nWe talk about one is freezing the growth of your Ira maybe beginning to take money out of a ... Karen Ira before you have to\nAnd leaving other money other investments alone remember that IRA or that four one K. when we take that money out we pay ordinary income tax if we die with it our kids our ears are going to pay ordinary income tax\nBoth of those need to be investigated what I'm trying to show you here though Jennifer is that rates going up if you're a saver as long as they don't go up so fast that they disrupt the financial markets probably a good thing we have a lot of clients that are looking forward to the day where they can get a five year CD that pays five percent interest\nAnd a lot of your clients or really borrowers anymore right they either have paid off their find a mortgage or their all their find a mortgage and they won't be getting a new one so interest rates going up doesn't hurt them from that perspective not correct\nAll right how 'bout Cathy who says my husband and I argue about money almost every day because we just haven't done a great job of planning for retirement and it's starting to stress both of us out is this normal or do we need some serious felt\nWell if you argue every day I Will say that's a little ... you know more intense than normal\nUm but it's not uncommon for couples to disagree you know when we come from very different backgrounds I was talking about it in a in a book I'm writing right now\nWhere she came from a family very blue collar I'm very focused on money very frugal uh and kind of looked at people that were successful with a little bit of suspicion [noise] um I came of family from a family where my parents were missionaries and then involving charity work and they just sort of\nHad a trust that everything was going to be okay and so there was a different attitude towards money when one day and I came into our marriage and so from time to time that comes up and so it's not abnormal at all for you to have a different approach to money then your spouse the important thing is that you have a plan that both of you can understand that you can look at\nAnd then sometimes it's a compromise where you know maybe with some of the money that's designated in your name or you have some of that on a on a track that makes more sense with your values and then your husband\nOr the money that's in his name he can invest that in the way that he feels a little more comfortable with but that's got to be in balance you don't want to have one person or the other disrupting good wise investments because they feel so strongly about some that's where a good financial advisor will come in and again I talk about this in my book where\nYou know financial advisors sometimes operate as if they're gently stepping into the area of a psychologist in a marriage counselor and I'm not about to say that's you know what my profession is or what my training as but boy it sure feels like it from time to time and\nYou should leave that appointment with the proper financial advisor feeling very good on that person understands you and that you and your spouse um feel more comfortable understanding each other but then you have a plan and there's always compromise involved\nSo many things that have to be factored in outside of just picking investments when it comes to good financial planning and managing those interpersonal relationships are part of it Joel if folks want some help with any of this what can they do\nWell and give us a call one eight hundred seven zero five one two three two we love to put together plans that have been you know disgust specifically with these mailbag questions

need you say hey I make the milk and we walk up to\nEight hundred seven zero five twelve thirty two\nAnd you're listening to jobs and money with them any more to come on the [noise]\nOne to wise up keep listening to Joel Johnson's money wisdom listening to John says money with some things running out with us today Joel is a certified financial planner and the c._e._o. of Johnson's committee the official welcome in the partner of Yukon ... he's the author of forced to retire\nThe money map and the wealthy think differently we'll be talking about one of those books forced to retire in just a couple of minutes he's the host of better money on W. FSB channel three on Saturday and Sunday Morning with Kara ... in Hartford area and um WC Bebe in Boston Saturday at seven AM\nIs where you can catch it better money with Joel and the Boston area he's husband too windy father to Brandon Michael Joel and Noah\nAnd Joel always a pleasure to talk with you a lot going on in the news as always to news items we want it to touch on today both in the F category Florence and Facebook what do you have force\nFlorence and Facebook signed by Florence first as always unfortunately really anytime there's a natural disaster like hurricane\nThere are a whole lot of bad actors come in and take advantage of people I don't I don't know how else to say it they just take advantage of people they they jak prices up which obviously is price gouging\nAnd even though of course there are laws against that you know I can imagine when somebody needs something need it right away they can't really claim that you know it's against the law to do that they they just need to pay for that particular item they need because it's a matter of sometimes of life and death and sometimes it's a matter of just getting back into your own house so\nIt's really unfortunate and uh for those folks that are down there we certainly hope that um that they're being treated fairly but we know that that some of them are not because there are opportunistic um shifty shady criminals that are basically taken advantage of that situation\nYou know think about that folks when that happens up here and I don't mean necessarily Hurricane Florence but some other type of thing\nA natural disaster it might be a snow storm knocked power out for a week\nUm it could be a those many tornadoes that we had a come through Springfield in Worcester a little while back a few years back um those can cause a lot of problems and it's just too bad you have to really watch out especially if you have an elderly parents you know make sure that you're watching out for them so they don't get taken advantage of by\nAgain opportunistic crooks that does seem to oh I don't know seem to be attracted to other people's tragedy [laughter]\nThat's about Facebook for a minute so Facebook I remember a few years back I was having a conversation with my now Nineteen year old he's probably at the time Seventeen back then and\nYou know I was talking about how I'm On Facebook and moms on Facebook and the grandparents or on Facebook and everything else\nAnd you know and that's why I'm leaving it\nHe he's why he had already lap he said yeah you guys took Facebook away from us I'm Talking about are you know his his friends that were in high school that that's their attitude that we took Facebook away from them\nYou know which is why now they're doing is ... and Twitter and so on and so forth so [noise]\nBut I tell you all of our clients want to track their grandkids are their children on Facebook and watch what's going on in our life has been a wonderful tool for [noise]\nFor grandparents to stay in touch however there has been a data breach fifty million profiles a have been stolen from Facebook so if you use Facebook to log on to other accounts I don't know if you notice or not but you can log into different applications on your computer\nOr excuse me on your mobile device using your Facebook logging on and on your computer also be careful of that because if you're using Facebook to log into any sites that may have your Social Security number or other personal information\nYou may have been breached so on the news is yet to come out on the total depths of the breach how big it is\nBut to just be careful of that and it just goes to show we've always got to be careful with our personal data\nUsing a service like life lock or some other type of service where you know if somebody is trying to open up credit cards and your name and so on is is very very important so\nJust a little old but he did the show they're talking about Florence and talking about Facebook and some of the things that are in the news and will continue to be in the news you know Facebook and Google will continue to be in the news\nGoing forward and probably Amazon also because of the immense power that does companies have over everyday life in the U.S today\nWell Joel one of the things we wanted to talk about today if people who are being forced into retirement you read a book within the last few years I don't even remember now when it came out but the book is called forced to retire and it addresses this group of folks\nVery specifically a cut I twist your arm into giving away a few copies of that book here\nWell absolutely I I Would love to give those away to any of our listeners that are either facing an early retirement offer um whether it's an offer maybe are being forced out of a job\nMaybe you recently were forced out of a job or you know somebody that has been offered early retirement package in the book forced to retire it's a real simple read it's about forty five minute read\nBut it will tell you the seven things that you need to figure out how to make sure that Iran proper financial fitting for the rest of your life so when you're forced to retire when there is that early retirement offer even you're forced out early", "show_name": "Johnson Brunetti Money Wisdom with Joel Johnson", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston",
