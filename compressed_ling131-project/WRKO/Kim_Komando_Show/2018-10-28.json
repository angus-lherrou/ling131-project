[noise]\nReally said today because you really have\nWe are back with our special show scary thing we wanted to wrap up this hour show with a question one that you might not hear a lot and that question is\nDo you live in a haunted house yes no maybe\nNow the official term for a so called haunted house is stigmatized property it's a real estate term that means even though there may not be any\nBeing physically wrong with the property well for some reason there may be something emotionally wrong with it like if it's allegedly haunted\nNo way would you ever move into a haunted house now usually the term stigmatized property applies to terrible events like murders or suicides but\nIt can apply to ghosts as well\nNow you think we're making this up check this out back in the nineties a homeowner in upstate New York lived in what she called a haunted house in fact the hundred year old Victorian home was known far and wide\nAs just that the haunted house everyone in town called at that and in fact it was even on a bus tour of famous haunted houses okay\nThe seller was pretty proud of the fact she lived with ghost according to the local newspaper the Nyack news and views she reported ghostly footsteps doors slamming and shaking beds so one day the seller decides to put the house on the market and sure enough\nSomeone makes an offer put down a big deposit and prepares for settlement\nAnd up to that point the seller had never mentioned the place was haunted\nAnd the ... they had no clue until that is they were chatting with some folks in town about how they would soon be neighbors and just about every when they met said oh you're buying the haunted house\nWell the buyers did not want to buy a haunted house so they filed a lawsuit to kill the deal and get their money back\nIn the first round they lost the court said in effect buyer beware but on the appeal they won the New York Supreme Court ruled they could kill the deal and get their money back\nSo there you have it a real case involving ghosts buyers and sellers but what's this mean to you\nKnow in most places the law does not require a cellar to disclose their property is haunted\nThe northern Virginia association of realtors says ghosts suicides or alien abductions are defined as non material under state law and agents are advised to avoid discussing non material facts that stigmatize the property\nBut others aren't so sure the website legal zoom votes to disclose if the house just want it as they put it quote\nSellers should be up front about their homes\nParanormal gas or ghoulish histories as we saw in New York state if you have an alleged haunted house and you do not disclose it you could be sued by the buyers and you might lose not because of the court necessarily believes in ghosts but because the rumor that the places haunted\nCould hurt it's market value\nAnd if the place is worth less because of those rumors well that's not smoke and mirrors that's real money\nAnd that's reason enough for someone to file a lawsuit so obviously the whole issue of haunted houses and disclosures raises more questions than answers first of all do you believe in ghosts and next is your place haunted\nAnd if you do believe and if it is hard to then you'll have to decide yourself whether to disclose that when you sell the place [noise]\nOur advice well you always want to follow the letter of the law but if you ever find yourself selling a haunted house you might want to also follow the spirit of goodwill [noise]\nComing up next week unrealistic today the Internet of real

family member did have a financial plan\nAnd with those financial resources at my disposal I did not have to worry about the cost of care I did not have to make choices having seen first hand how clean can deliver the most tax efficient cost effective way to pay for my loved ones care I wanted to share this insight with you\nBecause of the stress the plan and the strategies in place I can devote all of my time to managing their care in fact I've given myself a promotion\nI Am no longer a kid give her I Am a care manager having the plan has allowed me to put a team of professionals together to manage the care we huddle every day to discuss the plan of care for the day we discuss any new developments and we discuss the strategy\nI've devoted a chapter in the book just on caregiving [noise] now we know that over this ten thousand baby boomers journey sixty five each day\nMany of whom will need long term care during their lifetime the dementia society of America estimates that\nSomeone is stricken with some form of dementia every sixty eight seconds further these baby boomers may also be responsible for the care of their parents and experienced a tremendous strain of their assets as promised\nLet's discuss how Medicare and veterans' benefits pay for a long term care even if your spouse or a loved one is already in a nursing home\nBut before I Do so I Want to provide a word of caution\nCurrently this much pressure on the Medicaid system\nActually caused by the high cost of the trade off ... as a matter of fact the average per person Medicaid spending for seniors with Alzheimer's and other dimensions is nineteenth times higher than the average per person Medicare spending for all other seniors\nTake into consideration if someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer's every sixty eight seconds in this country\nAnd almost ten thousand baby boomers attorney sixty five each and every day it just a matter of time before the Medicaid system will be broke\nSo if you're healthy now and you're relying on Medicaid five ten or maybe Fifteen Years down the road to pay for your long term care that would not make a lot of sense however if your spouse\nOr a loved one or aging parent\nWho is currently in need of long term care we can help\nBefore we get into the nitty gritty of how Medicaid for long term care actually works we need to clear up some common misconceptions regarding Medicare and Medicaid\nTo be clear these words sound very similar but there is different is apples and oranges let me first that with Medicare this is the primary health care plan for those of us over sixty five [noise]\nWhile it's true that Medicare will pay for some long term care it's limited to one hundred days of care so in reality you should really defined any benefit that comes out of Medicare is short term care\nMedicaid on the other hand is a joint federal state program designed to help people over sixty five pay for long term care\nWhile each state has can have less restrictive rules and the federal law they cannot have more restrictive rules\nAs a result in Massachusetts if you're married you can keep your home a business property one car\nPersonal contents and up to Fifteen hundred dollars a cash value life insurance and in ... prepaid funeral plant\nWell most people are happy to learn the digging hang onto these assets that I just mentioned many are usually concerned about their liquid assets like checking\nSavings CDs four O. one K. and other retirement assets now to demonstrate how Medicaid can actually work in your favor I Want to share with you how we were able to help one of our clients\nFor the sake of this example will call our couple Mary and Jonah\nIt eight Seventy eight John was diagnosed with all the time has like symptoms and after four years of caring for John at home Mary's health was beginning to fail\nAfter meeting with John's physician it was determined that it would be in the best interest for everyone to bill would need skilled nursing home care as you might expect Mary was frightened by the prospect of having to need to pay over seven thousand dollars a month for John ... nursing home cos instill keep a roof over our head\nAfter all with the exception of the Alzheimer's diagnosis John's physical health was generally speaking pretty good\nWell the doctor could not predict exactly how long drawn would live he expected that he could easily live another five years or more well Miriam bill we're not wealthy they accumulated between checking savings and duties and other retirement assets some four hundred and twenty three thousand dollars\nNow since these assets are considered liquid they're comfortable in the state of Massachusetts\nIn order to qualify for Medicaid and Medicaid pay for the nursing home cause we completed the division of as a calculation as required by medicate there's simply means taking the four hundred and twenty three thousand dollars and divided in half\nWhile you might expect that if you divide those assets between the two of them they would each receive two hundred and eleven thousand five hundred however in Massachusetts the maximum amount that healthy spouse in this case Mary king keep is a hundred and twenty three thousand six hundred\nThe other three hundred thousand would need to be spent down on John's nursing home costs before he could qualify for Medicaid and have Medicaid pay the nursing bill\nWell Mary was beliefs to learn that she was not going to lose all her assets to pay for ... care she was still very concerned about how she live on our limited income in only a hundred and twenty three thousand six hundred dollars of assets\nSince we've helped over ten thousand families with cases just like these over the last thirty five years I shared with very little known law called\nOver Ninety three by applying the principles covered in over Ninety three we were able to protect the other three hundred thousand by converting it into an income stream they complied with over Ninety three\nAs a result Mary was presently surprised to learn that John could qualify for Medicaid immediately and she could maintain the entire mistake of four hundred and twenty three thousand dollars [noise]\nIf you'd like to learn more about this strategy please call us at eight seven seven to two zero to seven one one and receive a free coffee of our book [noise] tax free money for a long term care [noise]\nI'd like to shift gears now and talk about how Medicaid\nCan pay for nursing care for a single person\nIn Massachusetts a single person can keep the following assets and still qualify for Medicaid to pay for nursing home costs now the assets you can keep our your home one car personal contents term life insurance and Fifteen hundred dollars a cash life insurance and an arrow vocal prepaid funeral play\nWhile most families are happy to learn to love ones can keep these assets a lot of times they mention or they're concerned about other\nAssets like they're checking savings CDs mutual funds and retirement assets and Massachusetts a single person can keep two thousand dollars of assets in order to qualify for Medicaid\nAs a result this means that we need to use them create a financial planning strategies not found by working with your average stockbroker insurance agent or a financial planner\nFor over thirty five years we've specialized and working on these types of cases and helped over ten thousand families\nTo demonstrate how single person with a hundred and twenty thousand dollars of assets might qualify for Medicare to pay for nursing home costs are going to use a real life scenarios from one of our listeners after hearing are show came in to see me regarding her mother her mother Sally\nWas age ... eighty two and recently suffered a severe stroke and was now in a nursing home paying seven thousand dollars a month\nAs I met with a daughter became obvious that the objective was to make sure that mom had the qualifications needed without going broke in the process I explained to her that the maximum amount or month could keep and still qualify for Medicaid was two thousand dollars\nIn this case since Sally had accumulated a nice little nest egg of a hundred and twenty thousand dollars unfortunately without any planning at seven thousand dollars a month she'd be out of money in less than twenty months\nWhere we needed was a strategy that would allow mom to qualify for Medicaid and still protect some of the nest egg\nThe strategy we settled on is what we refer to as a half loaf strategy by implementing the strategy were able to protect over Seventy thousand dollars for the future and qualify Sally for Medicaid over ten months soon [noise]\nGoing to take a short break now and when we come back we'll discuss\nAll of ... veterans can receive up to twenty six thousand dollars a year of tax free money to pay for a long term
