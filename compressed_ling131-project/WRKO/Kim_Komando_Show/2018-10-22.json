{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "The long term care funding strategies in particular the pension Protection Act when I asked for a show of hands trying to determine how many people understood the pension Protection Act\nI was amazed to find how few advisors raise their hands at that moment it dawned on me that unfortunately most advisors are too busy trying to be all things all people but they fail to become an expert on any one particular area\nSuch as long term care unfortunately for you the consumer this trend is problematic\nBecause the one thing that maybe could make a difference in whether you die broken a nursing home or have choices to receive your care head home or an assisted living could be covered by having planning ahead\nUsing the pension Protection Act so let's assume you're middle aged couple concerned about long term care expenses and the devastating impact it would have won your future financial well being\nI Would suggest that you ask yourself the following three questions to determine the correct course of action as it pertains to the pension Protection Act the first question you should ask yourself is if I get sick tomorrow in need long term care where would I Want to receive that care\nIf you're like most people you'll say at home\nCurrently this is we're about Seventy percent of people receiving the care are at an here\nLies the problem the normal amount of home healthcare and needed to keep you out of the nursing home because up woods near eight thousand dollars per month put another way it could burn through two hundred thousand dollars in less than two years being for home care\nThe second question you should ask yourself is if I needed home care and it didn't affect total two hundred thousand and cause which as what I liquidate first a normal response might be to use the savings CD or maybe an existing new to you currently own regardless of the answer to the question\nThe third question you should ask yourself is Ken I benefit from using the pension Protection Act and you know what the answer is a resounding yes let's assume that you have a nice mistake saved between your four O. one K. IRA checking savings that aren't annuity\nCause further assume for purposes of this discussion that you decided that you want to use the annuity value to two hundred thousand dollars to pay for a long term care if you get sick\nBy simply transfer that existing annuity you all into an annuity that conforms with the pension and Protection Act you could immediately create a tax free pool of money of almost a million dollars\nThese tax free dollars could be used to pay for the cost of home care assisted living or nursing care\nRecently I was sharing this concept with an existing Klein of us that we've been working with over Twenty years he and his wife and are in their mid seventies he asked me if there was something to do with his IRA since like most baby boomers that's where most of their assets are\nUnfortunately the pension and Protection Act will not work for an IRA or any other retirement account however I did share with him or rather unique patented strategy that he could use the IRA\nAnd provide long term care in a special account\nWe suggested the transfer on a tax free basis a little over a hundred thousand dollars of this IRA money to a new i._r._a.\nThat would then double as a long term care fund and provide both he and his wife a tax favorite monthly check of over seven thousand dollars a month that they could you choose to pay for home care assisted living or nursing home care\nI guess the moral of the story is that if you're concerned about the devastating caused so long term care\nHow could affect your time and in the future you owe it to yourself to take a look at some of the creative options that are now available whether you decided to use some of your checking savings CDs and new to your part of your retirement assets is totally your decision\nThe reality

I don't want to name a possible on out a possible sponsor our future sponsored so I'll just say there is a place it is called but narrow bread [laughter]\nI'm Talking in code [laughter] and they have their yesterday [laughter] have amazingly delicious food yes get the Greek salad ... it's the best out I've ever had but every single time they ask you if you would like to tip the person that has just standing there at the register\nSo because of ... era I developed the seven foot wall with that if you have to go farther than seven feet I Will tip you but if you don't [laughter] I Am probably not going to do\nThat if you're just taking my credit card right my apple pay ... pay quite a farmer's market\nI bought spinach pasta was twelve dollars for one thing of pasta and they asked they asked for a tip on the app that you tip of course not okay so my hair stylist\nLovely lovely young woman named Nicole and\nYou know like a lot of hair stylist she she rents her station right and so this is pretty much her business well it is for it and what I Love about Nikolas she treats her\nStation like it is a business so she's professional she's on time if I say I need to get my hair done this afternoon show part the water or she'll make it happen and and for somebody her age to have this type of business document as something she uses square\nAnd to you know when you pay and so you don't go to the front desk for anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent\n[noise] so I told her I said you know I said you got this all rock and she's like what do you mean and I said you know ... ...\nYou search has shown that whatever you put in the middle that's what people are going to tap and\nThere'll be a certain percentage that will that you can guilt them into going to [laughter] you know the third call which is really the goal of all businesses that people have more money Seinfeld explained to her I said so you know you're married\nYou got a two and a half year old and a ten month old little pictures up there the kids you know and you know and then trying to get a they named ... you know they're getting ready for college you know in their cheek bones we can really hungry whatever it may be\nA said seriously research has shown so instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty per cent on just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent\nAnd see if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I felt so out of work out she goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and some people are going like thirty percent\nBut the the isn't that different though because that industry has a naturally of gratuity\nBut it's the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on this great\nSo when you're up a narrow do you tip yeah really I Do that where they keep asking because people like you keep ... okay but here's the reason\nWhy gay many many moons ago I worked at ... which is a bar like Houston right and and\nWhen you wait tables and I also waited tables and when I was at a a shoe at a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at bat so if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy who was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want but a bad but at ... okay\nBut sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to hit the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's and I don't think just because they handed\nMe a muffin that it's I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nHey how are you lived there were a task\nBeach in California that's just south of half moon bay\nAnd is it is a beautiful there\nWell today the fog Israel and a little bit but it's really nice should be maybe in the low seventies but it's always got a little chill coming off the water\nAnd now let me tell you something I Can't imagine I don't know why that you chose that over me but for everybody who is not a regular listener Jackie was my assistant for over ten years and she became a dear dear friend of mine and we put up with her husband had just because we have\nTo honor that's it and they uh they retired they sold all their worldly belongings and they put it in a bus which is helping the bus forty five foot and behind that you have your hot rod\nYeah well we have a twenty five foot trailer that we all her car and\nAnd which is a\nUm an eighty to ... an oath to core but\nOkay and so you got this way everybody has the picture\nAnd um I I thought you guys were coming back to Phoenix I heard\nYeah we are or right after Thanksgiving we're heading that way we are in our last month and a half year\nAnd so what what has been like a really great thing that has happened the last year that you guys been Harvey\n... great things I mean every day's an adventure and what we're doing um but I guess one of the highlights a has been for us this year when we got to Wisconsin this year as you know we have from it and you don't know we have\nA full size a refrigerator Airbus and if it decided to die when we got to Wisconsin\nThat I have to understand we're up in northern Wisconsin and they are the places are few and far between up there\nSo systems can take care of this thing was a quite a challenge and of course we went online and um we got some help from our forum friends that are out there are kind of doing the same thing we're doing\nUm the the question was going to be if we are going to replace this how do we get this thing out of the bus I mean this thing is huge so uh the last we heard was that we have to take off the side windows [noise] take off\nAnd have a pick up outside and basically toss it out the window [laughter] um [laughter] ... generally that didn't happen because some very smart person on the Internet said you should check your\nMother board in the refrigerator while it's very possible that if you change them I ... back in business and sure enough that's what we did\nAnd that was that that was it off it\nWas it was it was an ordeal et cetera on an eight or eight inch pedestal and of course of the things quite heavy so getting it out and even doing the repair it was a challenge but I'm rather interesting but I'm thankful that we've got the Internet in places where we can get some good information\nYou know if you just take your wife out to dinner where you wouldn't need such a big refrigerator [laughter]\nGosh we go out to dinner practically every week\n[laughter] nice All right so Andrew but ... I Want you to loosen up because how has a technical question and I bet you're you will have input on so how does that question\nBasically what's happened is we added a bunch of super great movies from the old days watching the kids go up and some of my early day adventures which I don't know if I Want everybody to see what we had those digital lives and we're now in possession of\nA stick obviously that's got this information on it we're looking for an F. D. P. side which is a file transfer sight of that we can get out for our kids to be able to jump on there and drag that\nTwenty two gig radio uh back onto their own computers so that was the best person that we know that knows about all things digital\nOh we decided to call the gym commando show so here you do\nAnd so so what the sun is Andrew is that they use like a drop box or something like that right and it took me two gigs that's huge it's really a huge huge\nHuge and so unless you could you know you can break it out into individual videos right and then you too might be the best place that's what I was thinking too is that you just put it up there and then it can play and then if somebody wants to download it they can download if they want to\nKnow and then you can delete it you want to you or you can protective yeah you're protected put in on it you know with a um a private you are oh oh okay\nSo that is somebody's searching for you know how big adventure which we all\nI mean right but they do that how big adventures doesn't quite come up well totally miss you guys\nDo it very much pleasure glad to talk\nTo you to really break up the files put it up on YouTube but when you guys come back out we're gonna do years three\nOf hell and Jackie on the road because if you're in our beer they have a lot of lessons that mother board story that they can pass along and they're really really great good godly people and I love them dearly thank you my good friends they weren't where you are more coming up here on the came commando show [noise]\nNow I don't know about you but someone has been telling me how to brush my teeth all my life\nParents teachers dentists and always a different technique up and down sideways my dentist says to make sure that however I Do it I should do it for a full two minutes of course Ninety percent of us don't emotional issues worn out toothbrush to boot\nSo let me introduce you to clip quip is electric it's small light and sleek there's a built in two minute timer that pulses every thirty seconds to remind you to switch sides with quip\nNew brush heads are automatically delivered justice dentist recommend every three months for just five dollars try quip and see why it's backed by more than twenty thousand dental professionals quit starts to just twenty five dollars bats it\nDoes it get quip dot com slash came right now and get your first refill pack for free with any quip electric toothbrush your first refill package free at G.
