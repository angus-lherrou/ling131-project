{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WRKO", "content": "As it pertains to long term care funding strategies in particular the pension Protection Act\nWhen I asked for a show of hands trying to determine how many people understood the pension Protection Act\nI was amazed to find how few advisors raise their hands at that moment it dawned on me that unfortunately most advisers are too busy trying to be all things all people but they fail to become an expert on any one particular area\nSuch as long term care unfortunately for you the consumer this trend is problematic\nBecause of the one thing that maybe could make a difference in whether you die broken a nursing home or have choices to receive your care head home or an assisted living could be covered by having planning ahead\nUsing the pension Protection Act so let's assume you're middle aged couple concerned about long term care expenses and the devastating impact it would have won your future financial well being\nI Would suggest that you ask yourself the following three questions to determine the correct course of action as it pertains to the pension Protection Act the first question you should ask yourself is if I get sick tomorrow in need long term care where would I Want to receive that care\nIf you're like most people you'll say at home\n[noise] currently this is we're about Seventy percent of people receiving the care are at an here lies the problem the normal amount of home healthcare and needed to keep you out of the nursing home could cost up woods near eight thousand dollars per month\nPut another way you could burn through two hundred thousand dollars in less than two years being for home care\nThe second question you should ask yourself is if I needed home care and it didn't affect total two hundred thousand and cause which as to what I liquidate first a normal response might be to use the savings CD or maybe an existing new to you currently own regardless of the answer to the question\nThe third question you should ask yourself is Ken I benefit from using the pension Protection Act and you know what the answer is a resounding yes let's assume that you have a nice mistake saved between your four oh one K. IRA checking savings that are in a newly\nCause further assume for purposes of this discussion you decided you want to use the annuity value to two hundred thousand dollars to pay for a long term care if you get sick\nBy simply transfer that existing annuity you all into an annuity that conforms with the pension and Protection Act you could immediately create a tax free pool of money of almost a million dollars\nThese tax free dollars could be used to pay for the cost of home care assisted living or nursing care\nRecently I was sharing this concept with an existing Klein of us that we've been working with over Twenty years he and his wife and are in their mid seventies he asked me if there was something to do with his IRA since like most baby boomers that's where most of their assets are\nUnfortunately the pension and Protection Act will not work for an IRA or any other retirement account however I did share with him or rather unique patented strategy that he could use the IRA\nAnd provide long term care in a special account we suggested the transfer on a tax free basis a little over a hundred thousand dollars of this IRA money to a new i._r._a.\nThat would then double as a long term care fund and provide both he and his wife a tax save a monthly check of over seven thousand dollars a month that they could you choose to pay for home care assisted living or nursing home care\nI guess the moral of the story is\nThat if you're concerned about the devastating caused so long term care\nHow could affect your time and in the future you owe it to yourself to take a look at some of the creative options that are now available whether you decided to use some of your checking savings CDs and new to your part of your retirement assets is totally your decision\nThe reality is that there's much more tax efficient cost effective ways of paying for long term care than you might expect\nThe next step is an easy [noise] pick up\nEight seven seven to two zero to seven\nOne was to get your coffee of\nTax free money for long term here learn more about the most tax efficient cost effective ways to pay for a long term care [noise]\nBe sure to tune in next week for another informative session of elder care financial radio\nI Want to thank everyone for listening\nGood night and everyone have a great week\nYou've been listening to elder care financial Radio Free you the latest information on how to pay for a long term care in the most tax efficient cost effective way possible\nTo receive a free copy of Stevens book tax free money for a long term care called eight seven seven to two zero to seven one one that's eight seven seven to two zero to seven one one [noise] tune in next week for another edition of elder care financial radio [noise]\nFor more information about contests on W.

problem I mean I mean you 'cause you're you're absolutely right because in and you know where he\nHas never really had to be a commercial or if he does see a commercial at only Fifteen seconds yes there is and a half minute commercial there is a skipped\nOnce he watches five seconds of it right I'm sure if I did when I was at my sister's on this past week and I was watching TV my mom I'm like

offer free to day shipping for millions more items and they do right now right\nAnd they say they're expanding it's free shipping offer for purchases thirty five dollars and above\nAnd you don't need to pay a membership space and take advantage of it that's what Wal Mart kept saying because they want to remind you that Amazon Prime now costs a hundred Nineteen dollars a year\nAnd Walmart says we're also making returns a lot simpler you can either print to return label from your online Walmart account or go to the nearest store\nJust pack up the item bring it to the Wal Mart services desk and they're going to return it for you right there on the spot you don't need to uh put it in the mail anymore they're gonna start rolling this out in November\nAnd speaking of Wal Mart or a friend of mine does this whenever he goes to Wal Mart went announcement comes on over the loudspeaker he it gets into the fetal position he screams no no no it's those voices again [laughter] what's this cat\nUh I I I walked out when he did that I'm like I don't even know you I'm Sorry [noise]\nAnd then there's also target they're getting in the battle between November first and December twenty second they say hundreds of thousands of items are now eligible for free to day shipping a target dot com alright so Walmart says we're going to give you a free to day shipping\nTarget says ... give you free to day shipping on select items\nA target also has a few ... do you have to use your target credit card and it's only on orders over thirty five bucks case so everybody's saying wait maybe this is something we can do to compete against Amazon Prime targets as we have another idea they had to drive up service okay shoppers can place their orders on line\nAnd then you have to drive to target and then a target greeter is going to put your online order into your car and it's going to be available\nTo thousands stores I never understood why that is even an option white somebody a target\nThought that would be a great marketing idea when whatever you're going by at target is still to drive to target and then you have to find somebody to actually go get shorter and put it in the car versus just going to prime now that Amazon dot com and having it delivered that day it\nSeems even with the grocery stores a local grocery store chain here in Phoenix, Arizona allows you to buy your groceries and go pick 'em up who we heard they fight fries price okay you have to do it like fourteen hours in advance\nWhy bother you know I go to a prime ... prime now that I was on a ...

some stuff for dinner and she said well I'll just go over to whole foods I said no no no let me show you how this works 'cause she thought that computer savvy\nI go to prime now and she's like well why would I buy all this on line I can just go to get my car and go to the store and like well Christie and they don't have to go to the store it you know you're just going to come to you and she was going to now she went to whole foods she said she likes to go to whole foods but speaking of target you know what we've been talking about my because Mike\nAsked election and Mary and things like that like he might get this is actually a good idea for you is that you go to target ... can you address nice for work right so you go to target what do you think about it or\nYou go to the dollar spot right there in the front door of different yeah just where they have everything for a dollar and you just hang out there might but they're going to find a cube woman and you know that she likes to
