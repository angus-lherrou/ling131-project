you love real estate\nAnd we're back with our special show going global all about international real estate and you know buying a home\nOr over the border is one of those things that many people here in America dream about it's just such an over the top romantic notion the very idea of buying a vacation home a retirement home or even an investment property in another country\nBut for a lot of Americans it's not a dream it's a reality because they've done it\nAnd if you'd like to join their ranks by buying duct condo in the heart of London that ranch way out in the Australian outback or even a fishing lodge in British Columbia well you can't so let's take a few moments now to talk about how to make that happen\nFirst of all you have to find the property [noise] real dot com can help with that they have a huge international search engine and it just got a lot bigger so that's a great place to start\nNext to talk to a real chore here in the U.S one with the CIA PS designation that stands for certified international property specialist real tours with that designation have the education the training and the experience to help you make those dreams come true\nIn many cases they already know trusted real estate professionals\nCountry you're looking at so you won't have to just roll the dice you'll be working with real estate agents in other countries who have proven track records and relationships with real tourists here at home those referrals are really important [noise]\nNext up how to pay for it well in most cases you'll have to have cash wind up in advance because getting a mortgage in a foreign country that's not easy so many people use the equity in their American house to do the deal others sell stock others might even cashing in a four O. one K.\nBut whatever approaches right for you\nBe sure to talk to your accountant before you make any big financial moves now if you do want a mortgage we've heard it might be possible if you work with a major international bank which has branches both here in the United states and in the country where you're buying property now there's no guarantee\nBut with locations in both countries it will be easier to track your credit you'll reserves and your income\nThe biggest of the big American banks all have offices around the world so it's worth looking into\nAnother issue is the exchange rate if it were to swing up or down you might end up either saving a lot of money or paying a lot more there are companies that let you lock in an exchange rate for a fee\nBut it might save you from having sudden unexpected sticker shock when you get to the closing table in a foreign country\nNow we mentioned your account and a few moments ago and this next part of advice is for them all so\nTaxes it's really important especially if you're buying an investment property to know what your tax situation is going to be if you buy a property in another country but whether that property generates income or not find out\nAll the tax implications because some day you might sell it and obviously you won't have the luxury of the capital gains exemption or the ten thirty one like kind of exchange like you do here in the United states [noise] speaking of which here in the usa when you buy something you own it\nBut that's not always the same deal in other countries you might on the house but not the land\nThat sort of thing so you'll have to have trust professionals on the ground in the land where you're buying property to find out which brings us to our last piece of advice when you buy a house and investment property a retirement home or anything else in another country\nGet an attorney our international real estate expert real tore Patricia tan\nSays always have an attorney by your side and not one that was recommended by the seller rather get an independent attorney who can explain ownership laws walk you through the deal and look after your best interests the hallway\n[noise] okay

questions that investigators have is they look into what's now being called the deadliest transportation accident in the U.S in almost a decade twenty people killed in a collision between a limo and an SUV deputy superintendent ... with New York state\nBecause of the ... the plant and the strategies in place I can devote all of my time to managing their care in fact I've given myself a promotion I Am no longer a kid give her I Am a care manager\nHaving the plan has allowed me to put a team of professionals together to manage the care we huddle every day to discuss the plan of care for the day we discuss any new developments and we discuss the strategy how to handle them\nI've devoted a chapter in the book just on caregiving [noise] now we know that over this ten thousand baby boomers journey sixty five each day\nMany of whom will need long term care during their lifetime the dementia society of America estimates that\nSomeone is stricken with some form of dementia every sixty eight seconds further these baby boomers may also be responsible for the care of their parents and experienced the tremendous strain of their assets as promised\nLet's discuss how Medicare and veterans' benefits pay for a long term care even if your spouse or a loved one is already in a nursing home\n[noise] but before I Do so I Want to provide a word of caution\nCurrently this much pressure on the Medicaid system\nActually caused by the high cost to treat all ... as a matter of fact the average per person Medicaid spending for seniors with all the time is in other dimensions is nineteenth times higher than the average per person Medicare spending for all other seniors taking tickets\nSet a ration that someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer's every sixty eight seconds of this country\nAnd almost ten thousand baby boomers attorney sixty five each and every day\nIt's just a matter of time before the Medicaid system will be broke so if you're healthy now and you're relying on Medicaid five ten or maybe Fifteen Years down the road to pay for your long term care that would not make a lot of sense however if your spouse\nOr a loved one or aging parent\nWho is currently in need of long term care we can help\nBefore we get into the nitty gritty how Medicaid for long term care actually works we need to clear up some common misconceptions regarding Medicare and Medicaid\nTo be clear these words sound very similar but there is different is apples and oranges let me first that with Medicare this is the primary health care plan for those of us who was sixty five\nWhile it's true that Medicare will pay for some long term care it's limited to one hundred days of care so in reality you should really defined any benefit that comes out of Medicare is shut term care\nMedicaid on the other hand is a joint federal state program designed to help people over sixty five pay for a long term care\nWhile each state has can have less restrictive rules and the federal law they cannot have more restrictive rules\nAs a result in Massachusetts if you're married you can keep your home a business property one car\nPersonal contents in up to Fifteen hundred dollars a cash value life insurance and ... prepaid funeral plant\nWell most people are happy to learn the digging hang onto these assets that I just mentioned many are usually concerned about their liquid assets like checking\nSavings CDs four O. one K. and other retirement assets now to demonstrate how Medicaid can actually work in your favor I Want to share with you how we were able to help one of our clients\nFor the sake of this example will call our couple Mary and Jonah\nIt eight Seventy eight John was diagnosed with all the time has like symptoms and after four years of caring for John at home Mary's health was beginning to fail\nAfter meeting with John's physician it was determined that it would be in the best interest for everyone to bill would need skilled nursing home care as you might expect Mary was frightened by the prospect of having to do the pay was seven thousand dollars a month for John ... nursing home costs and still keep a roof over our head\nAfter all with the exception of the Alzheimer's diagnosis John's physical health was generally speaking pretty good well the doctor could not predict exactly how long John would live\nHe expected that he could easily live another five years or more will marry and bill we're not wealthy they accumulated between checking savings and duties and other retirement assets some four hundred and twenty three thousand dollars\nNow since these assets are considered liquid they're comfortable in the state of Massachusetts\nIn order to qualify for Medicaid and Medicaid pay for the nursing home cause we completed the division of as a calculation as required by Medicaid to simply means taking the four hundred and twenty three thousand dollars and divided in half\nWhile you might expect that if you divide those gases between the two of them they would each receive two hundred and eleven thousand five hundred however and Massachusetts the maximum amount that healthy spouse in this case Mary can keep is a hundred and twenty three thousand six hundred\nThe other three hundred thousand would need to be spent down on John's nursing home cost before he could qualify for Medicaid and have Medicaid pay the nursing bill\nWell Mary was police to wear and then she was not going to lose all her assets to pay for ... care she was still very concerned about how she'd live on our limited income and only a hundred and twenty three thousand six hundred dollars of assets [noise]\nSince we've helped over ten thousand families with cases just like the ... over the last thirty five years I shared with very little known law called\nOver Ninety three by applying the principles covered in over Ninety three we were able to protect the other three hundred thousand by converting it into an income stream that complied with over Ninety three\nAs a result Mary was presently surprised to learn that John could qualify for Medicaid immediately and she could maintain the entire mistake of four hundred and twenty three thousand dollars [noise]\nIf you'd like to learn more about this strategy please call us at eight seven seven to two zero to seven one one and receive a free coffee of a book [noise] tax free money for long term care [noise]\nI'd like to shift gears now and talk about how Medicaid\nCan pay for nursing care for a single person\nIn Massachusetts a single person can keep the following assets and still qualify for Medicaid to pay for nursing home costs now the assets you can keep our your home one car personal contents term life insurance in Fifteen hundred dollars a cash life insurance and an arrow vocal prepaid funeral play\nWhile most families are happy to learn to love ones can keep these assets [noise] a lot of times they mentioned or they're concerned about other\nAssets like they're checking saving CDs mutual funds and retirement assets in Massachusetts a single person can keep two thousand dollars of assets in order to qualify for Medicaid\nAs a result this means that we need to use them create a financial planning strategies NATO found by working with your average stockbroker insurance agent or a financial planner\nFor over thirty five years we've specialized in working on these types of cases and helped over ten thousand families\nTo demonstrate how single person with a hundred and twenty thousand dollars of assets might qualify for Medicare to pay for nursing home cos I Want to use a real life scenario from one of our listeners after hearing are show came in to see me regarding her mother\nHer mother Sally was age eighty two and recently suffered a severe stroke and was now in a nursing home paying seven thousand dollars a month\nAs I met with the daughter became obvious that the objective was to make sure that mom had the ... needed without going broke in the process I explained to her that the maximum amount or mom could keep and still qualify for Medicaid was two thousand dollars\nIn this case since Sally had accumulated a nice little nest egg of a hundred and twenty thousand dollars unfortunately without any planning at seven thousand dollars a month she'd be out of money in less than twenty months\nWe'll we needed was a strategy that would allow mom to qualify for Medicaid and still protect some of the nest egg\nThe strategy we settled on is what we refer to as a half low strategy by implementing the strategy were able to protect over Seventy thousand dollars for the future and qualify for Medicaid over ten months sooner [noise]\nWe're going to take a short break now and when we come back we'll discuss how qualifying veterans can receive up to twenty six thousand dollars a year of tax free money to pay for a long term camp state Joan we'll be right\nBack to receive a free copy of Stevens book tax free

a little known veterans' benefits called the eight and attendance pension benefit\nThat can help [noise] qualified veterans and their spouses receive up to twenty six thousand dollars a year on a tax free basis to pay for a long term care if you're a veteran and was like a copy of our free book\nPlease call eight seven seven to two zero to seven one one\nWell up to twenty six thousand dollars a year tax free benefit to pay for a long term care would be wonderful\nFor many veterans there are currently nearly two million veterans or widows who will likely missing out on this benefit\nA recent v a study said that veterans are generally unaware that this program exists and only one in seven widows that probably could qualify actually get the monthly checks\nLet me provide an overview of how you may qualify for this benefit if you're a veteran\nOr a widow of a veteran in order to qualify for the aid and attendant pension benefit the veteran must meet for criteria number one\nHe must have served Ninety Days of active duty\nNumber to one of those days\nHad to be during a time of war number three know dishonorable discharges and for spouses and widows you must have not had a divorce assume that you meet the criteria I just mentioned the application\nAnd a qualifying process takes a look at income expenses and assets and wants to prove to benefit will provide up to twenty six thousand dollars a year that you can use to pay for home care assisted living in nursing home care\nI promised at the beginning of the show that I Would share with you a little known law\nThat can allow you to create a large pool of money and then use it to pay for a long term care on a tax free basis recently as with a group of top financial planners from across the country and we were discussing the various topics of long term care planning\nI was surprised and lack of knowledge as it pertains to long term care funding strategies in particular the pension Protection Act\nWhen I asked for a show of hands trying to determine how many people understood the pension Protection Act\nI was amazed to find how few advisors raise their hands at that moment it dawned on me that unfortunately most advisors are too busy trying to be all things all people but they failed to become an expert on any one particular area\nSuch as long term care unfortunately for you the consumer this trend is problematic\nBecause the one thing that maybe could make a difference in whether you die broken a nursing home or have choices to receive your care at home or an assisted living could be covered by having planning ahead\nUsing the pension Protection Act so let's assume you're a middle aged couple concerned about long term care expenses and the devastating impact it would have on your future financial well being\nI Would suggest that you ask yourself the following three questions to determine the correct course of action as it pertains to the pension Protection Act the first question you should ask yourself is if I get sick tomorrow in need long term care where would I Want to receive that care\nIf you're like most people you'll say at home\n[noise] currently this is
