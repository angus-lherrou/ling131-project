a call themselves from it from an eight hundred number\nThat matched the number that his credit union uses actually got three calls from his credit union the same number in rapid succession he didn't answer the first to just let it go to voicemail but then the third time they called these like oh well this was really be important I should answer [noise]\nSo he was greeted by a female voice to explain that his credit union had blocked too phony looking chargers in ... in Ohio\nMade to his debit ATM card [noise]\nShe then read him the last four digits of the credit card that was in his wallet\nIt checked out\nHere we told the lady listen I'm going to replace him card immediately about travel out of state California well the woman on the line said oh don't worry about you keep that card we're just going to simply block any future charges that weren't going to be made in Oregon or California or those the only two states you're going to be and he said yeah I'm just going to California ... not a problem\nAny charges that you make in Oregon or California will be fine\nOr to freeze the card everywhere else he said well that's a little strange but he figured well you know what she's probably doing a favor she said you know it just to make sure that everything's on the up and up or just want you to feel comfortable is this your home address because this is where we're going to send the new car\nWhen you're done with your trip he says I guess that's my home address including my apartment number everything's perfect she said is this your mother's maiden name and he

in your wallet\nIs this number these three numbers on the back of the credit card that's in your wallet and he said yeah Ah yes so at this point everything seem ... pretty legit right\nThen she says so that I can apply the same PIN number to your credit card but I'm mailing out to you\nI can you give me your PIN number so this way you don't have to go to the bank everything's all just going to work uh and so that your PIN number will be the same PIN number that you have\nRight now and he said oh okay well you know here's my four digit pin the card that he hangs up and then he looks at his account\nThere were two fraudulent charges on account from the day earlier totally three thousand four hundred dollars there was a twenty nine hundred dollar charge from a Kroger near Atlanta there's a five hundred dollar cash withdrawals from an ATM\nAfter everything was said and done he had just three hundred dollars in his account\nSo what this scammer head was every single thing about him
