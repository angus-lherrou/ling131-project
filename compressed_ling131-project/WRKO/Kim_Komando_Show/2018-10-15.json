IRA checking savings that I knew what he\nDoes further assume for purposes of this discussion you decided you want to use the annuity value to two hundred thousand dollars to pay for a long term care if you got sick\nBy simply transferring that existing annuity you long into an annuity that conforms with the pension and Protection Act you could immediately create a tax free pool of money of almost a million dollars\nThese tax free dollars could be used to pay for the cost of home care assisted living or nursing care\nRecently I was sharing this concept with an existing Klein of us that we've been working with over Twenty years he and his wife and are in their mid seventies he asked me if there was something to do with his IRA since like most baby boomers that's where most of their assets are\nUnfortunately the pension and Protection Act will not work for an IRA or any other retirement account however I did share with him or rather unique patented strategy that he could use the IRA\nAnd provide long term care in a special account we suggested the transfer on a tax free basis a little over a hundred thousand dollars of this IRA money to a new i._r._a.\nThat would then double as a long term care fund and provide both he and his wife a tax favorite monthly check of over seven thousand dollars a month that they could you choose to pay for home care assisted living or nursing home care\nI guess the moral of the story is that if you're concerned about the devastating caused so long term care\nHow could affect your time and in the future you owe it to yourself to take a look at some of the creative options that are now available whether you decided to use some of your checking savings CDs and new to your part of your retirement assets is totally your decision\nThe reality

what\nThe Internet was attacking other stupid okay here's the other reason why you need a case corners right well that's just that but you notice the color right a very pretty good minds pink my black

where it is so then came out the stories about horrible past for us to have\nAnd I learned something which is surprisingly I've been here between sixteen Seventeen years [laughter] I've never heard about password walking you've never heard a password walking never\nThat's where you like you walk on the keys in order for you to enter and your password\nMost popular walked password is one shoe to W. E. three four are getting back to the top row and the bottom row and you walk\nWith your fingers across ... and then some people they make it more difficult so instead of going down to ... to rose they'll go down three\nRight that's the actually the the third most popular is one Q A V. to W. S. X. which is the first two rows\nAnd let me tell you something if you were to just look at that as a password he'd be like that's a darn good pass what exactly because it's not a word in the dictionary word at all and it's got like a couple of letters you know\nOr some some a haiku you know a gang symbol almost you know things like that and see and that's the deal but I think so many of us are getting tired of passwords oh I'm Sorry I don't I mean and then you know so let's say you don't know your password well then you have to go through the whole password reset\nLike what was your a second grade teacher his middle name\nUh [laughter] well that's wonderful\nTo choose to verification is so great especially Yahoo I mean I don't know how many people are actually still using a Yahoo account but I Am for fantasy football and ... and only use it for fantasy football so every single year obviously I forget my Yahoo password\n'cause it's been six months and used it but if I have an a Yahoo apple my phone they send me a message through the app and I can get in\nYeah and that's really the OSCE yeah the two factor authentication is easy I mean and it really is and we always get

space and linked him yes they bowls since two thousand sixteen if I've huge security breach\nOr you know in their website can you guess in the category of brands one or two of the most popular

you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver as that what's happening\nYou that's part of it yeah or I I end up using an app or using a program to to accomplish the task I get done and I go\nVisit their an easier way to do that by having an example okay we babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday Spanish so I thought it would be cool to make a little look at the end of the summer the shit\nHere's what I Do to grandma's house on Tuesday perfect\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in text it ended up being thirty five pages long about fifty to sixty photos\nBut it was a short it was really hard isn't there a publishing program that maybe could have helped me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now there it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nA there are sites like ours that will do round up so say you know here at ten grapes photo apps but we would only hit ten out of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available\nOr icy if you're looking for a particular app you can always read the reviews people are brutally honest\nAbout what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew a you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yes we're shuttle fly you shutter flies at\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that they use these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nIn one of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book do yes\nAnd we got it and 'cause I created a um a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word bank called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know one no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular app\nThat only does one task is that you might want to look at okay\nUh what is it is John right out of work I work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form about those pages and getting that that\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kind of fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you've created the animated book bed that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures bang we communicated back and forth on fiber they ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to ... to take months to make those animations\nAnd so so and so the next time you have a task put in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh call us\nOkay okay [laughter] okay I mean that's why we're here and or\nDrop me a note through the website and I know this sounds crazy and a lot of people don't believe me but I Do I read every single know that you send me through the Web site\nAnd I've got a system I've done it for many years and when you send me your questions things that you want to accomplish we will use that as content at Fort chip or a cool site or an app review or whatever it may be over a commander dot com or you can just call give us a call to the show and if you're a Kim's club member by the way you\nAlways get priority calling and you can join ... right now\nOver and get Kim Dotcom stay right where you are big security alert I Need to tell you about what the Web cams that's spreading like crazy across the United states you're on the Kim commando show\nWith more and more of our lives are moving on mine intrusion into our privacy can have devastating consequences one great way to secure your privacy so you can have their freedom to be anonymous and untraceable online is to use what's called a VPN it stands for virtual private network\nWhen choosing a VPN you really need to trust the company running it and I recommend F speak to our freedom VPN F secure as a publicly lifted company they had this Thirty Years' spotless track record of protecting its customer security and privacy it's so easy to use and it's really easy to set up you'll be up and running in just a few minutes\nF secure even let you tried for free for five days no sign up no credit card details required\nYou can trust as the cure to protect your privacy and to keep you anonymous and untraceable online or to your freedom VPN now and get twenty percent off when you use discount code camp visit F dash secure dot com slash camp that's F dash secure dot com slash camp\nWhat would it take for you to get a tattoo you didn't want a million dollars how about a million socks I'm Randy from Bombay when me and my business partner Dave how's it going critter jobs to start a sock company Bob as we wanted to make the best socks and the history of feet no more knowing seem no more falling down your leg added our support the idea\nIn what's better than creating the best socks and the history of feet sharing them\nThis is what we do one pair purchased equals one pair donated to those meet our dream was always to donate a million pairs we thought it would take ten years that's what they've said when we don't need a million pairs of socks I'll get attached to to celebrate but then something happened people loved our socks and instead of ten years and only took two and a half\nA million pairs and one bomb a statue on my arm\nFeel most comfortable socks and the history of beat by going to bomb is dot com slash W.

Louisiana\nEntered him hey how are you I'm fantastic how can I help you today sir\nI got a three part question right yeah\nMy question it's okay to ... all along reputation management mhm what would be like well with me the best ... that I can find for small medical office and also what I was looking at it that was all Henri am a software that you can purchase and then the\nF ... the search engine optimization have to go with an old all ...\nAll right well let's talk a little bit too so what's going on with your business on line\n[noise] [noise] well the problem with them or if it's obviously what most businesses have is you know if you have as many\nGood reviews that go on line to help you out of the ...\nThey would balance it out but I'll be if they do the work that\nWay you know are the people who have experience it's usually doesn't go online and put post there there\nAre positive experiences with you at your business so when I'm Out here it's mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses to what I Need to do is buy something someone to neutralize the negative responses that happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before\nI Would contract with any reputation type management farm okay [noise]\nIs I Would encourage you to do this yourself because you may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this all works okay\nBecause as it as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too\nIs that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody do the job when you've already done the job right [noise]\nRight and so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp\nOr where where is it so I'm Glad for all the medical or it's like ... great the current okay all they need they excel\nOkay so okay a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay so anybody who\nComes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay because I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for you know if they had a great time they're happy to do that\nAnd you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before\nBecause they you know can you up on line and just drop some rep in there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now out weighing the negative reviews okay okay so that's the\n... the other thing you can get let me finish the other thing you can do is with health grades is drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it\nAnd what I have\nHeard is that when you do this is that health grades will remove it health grades also has a program\nCalled recognize Dr status and that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay um there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam\nI get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain\nFee that they\nWill spotlight your business you'll\nHave more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo so in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to accentuate that positive okay", "show_name": "Kim Komando Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "15"}
