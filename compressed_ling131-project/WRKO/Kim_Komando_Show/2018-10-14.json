young\nAnd generate income and build wealth\nWe're going to wrap up today show with a look at one of the best tools available for every real estate investor\nA tool that helps you move from a small real estate investments to a bigger real estate investment and all the way up to norm is real estate investment while ... your tax it every time you sell one property and buy another\nIt's called the tank thirty one like kind of exchange it's part of the nation's tax law and it has huge benefits for everyone who invest in real estate\nAnd that's true whether you're buying a single condo or one thousand unit apartment building so let's take a look at what it is and how it works but remember I'm just giving you an overview here so if you really want to use the ten thirty one talked to a real estate attorney and accounting and your real chore\nSo when you buy an investment property it generates wealth in two ways one it creates revenue every month when their incomes in\nInto overtime to property will typically increase in value so good over a matter of years or a matter of decades the property will become much more valuable than it was when you purchased it and you know what that means when you sell it you might come away from the closing table with an enormous check\nNow if you just do the place and you don't buy anything else sure you will have to pay taxes on your profit but if you take that profit and use it to buy another investment\nAs expensive or more expensive than the one you just sold you can for the entire profit into the new place and defer the taxes\nThat means but if you make a one hundred thousand dollar profit on your first real estate investment\nYou can put the entire one hundred thousand dollars towards your next one\nInstead of just what's left over after the taxes it's a huge benefit to real estate investors all across America because it helped many people go from a single condo to a four unit building to a forty unit building and on and on\nAnd you only pay taxes on it at the end of the line when you've decided to do your real estate investments and not by another property [noise]\nNow using the ten thirty one like kind of exchange is not for amateurs this is the big league so you want to work with inexperienced real estate attorney and accountant as well as a real Torre who knows investment properties inside and out\nYou can't just do it on your own because for instance after you make that profit on your first place that money will have to be held by a third party until you purchase your next real estate investment\nSo talk to your real toward about all your investment plans and ask them what you attorneys and accountants in your area will be able to guide you through at ten thirty one like kind of exchange you know many people have real estate investments they might buy a house but keep the one they were living in and then rent it out and that's great\nBut if you really want to grows an investor and create a really big real estate portfolio\nExperts say the ten thirty one like kind of exchange is the way to go as I said it's the big leagues of real estate investing and there's no reason that you can't use it on your path to being set for life [noise]\nComing up next week on real estate today we'll move to the other side of the spectrum and our special show retiring wealthy will look at how real estate can

diagnosed with all the time has like symptoms and after four years of caring for John at home Mary's health was beginning to fail\nAfter meeting with John's physician it was determined that it was being the best interest for everyone to bill would need skilled nursing home care as you might expect Mary was frightened by the prospect of having to do the pay was seven thousand dollars a month for John ... nursing home cos instill keep a roof over our head\nAfter all with the exception of the Alzheimer's diagnosis John's physical health was generally speaking pretty good well the doctor could not predict exactly how long drawn would live he expected that he could easily live another ...\nFive years or more well Miriam bill when are wealthy they accumulated between checking savings and duties and other retirement assets some four hundred and twenty three thousand dollars now since these assets are considered liquid they're comfortable in the state of Massachusetts\nIn order to qualify for Medicaid and Medicaid pay for the nursing home cause we completed the division of acid calculation as required by medicate to simply means taking the four hundred and twenty three thousand dollars a divided in half\nWhile you might expect that if you divide those assets between the two of them they would each receive two hundred and eleven thousand five hundred however and Massachusetts the maximum amount that healthy spouse in this case Mary king keep is a hundred and twenty three thousand six hundred\nThe other three hundred thousand would need to be spent down on John's nursing home cost before he could qualify for Medicaid and have Medicaid pays in nursing bill\nWell Mary was pleased to learn that she was not going to lose all her assets to pay for joins care she was still very concerned about how she live on our limited income and only a hundred and twenty three thousand six hundred dollars of assets\nSince we've helped over ten thousand families with cases just like these over the last thirty five years I shared with very little known law called\nOver Ninety three by applying the principles covered in over Ninety three we were able to protect the other three hundred thousand by converting it into an income stream that complied with over Ninety three\nAs a result Mary was presently surprised to learn that John could qualify for Medicaid immediately and she could maintain the entire mistake of four hundred and twenty three thousand dollars\nIf you'd like to learn more about this strategy police call us\nAt eight seven seven to two zero to seven one\nOne and receive a free coffee of our book tax free money for a long term care [noise]\nI'd like to shift gears now and talk about how Medicaid\nCan pay for nursing care for a single person in

planner\nFor over thirty five years we've specialized and working on these types of cases and helped over ten thousand families\nTo demonstrate how single person with a hundred and twenty thousand dollars of assets might qualify for Medicare to pay for nursing home costs are going to use a real life scenarios from one of our listeners after hearing are show came in to see me regarding her mother\nHer mother Sally was age eighty two and recently suffered a severe stroke and was now in a nursing home paying seven thousand dollars a month\nAs I met with a daughter became obvious that the objective was to make sure that mom had the quality care she needed without going broke in the process\nI explained to her that the maximum amount or mom could keep and still qualify for Medicaid was two thousand dollars in this case since Sally had accumulated a nice little nest egg of a hundred and twenty thousand dollars unfortunately without any planning at seven thousand dollars a month she'd be out of money in less than twenty months\nWhere we needed was a strategy that would allow mom to qualify for Medicaid and still protect some of the nest egg\nThe strategy we settled on is what we refer to as a half low strategy by implementing the strategy were able to protect over Seventy thousand dollars for the future and qualify for Medicaid over ten months sooner [noise]\nWe're going to

advice regarding long term care that you've probably heard from your local stockbroker insurance agent\nOr so called experts as a matter of fact\nI've found that most of the prices and attorneys are too busy trying to be all things to all people and feel to become an expert in anything so unlike Ninety nine point nine percent of the advice is out there I chose to dedicate my career\nTo helping families learn how to pay for a long term care and the most tax efficient cost effective way\nBecause of the constraints of time and everybody's situation is different would just gonna introduced the

money for a long term care\nNow before it gets added into the strategies and how to pay long term care I Want to relate to my story someone that one is asked how I was a became so passionate about providing long term care planning\nThe answer is that I've worked in the shoes are ... in fact I've been a dual kid give her\nOnce for my elderly mother and again for a close family member have gained unparalleled experience during this time of being a dual kid give her\nYou know I could sit here and explain to you how to use an umbrella but until you get caught in the ring you really don't know how it works well being a kid give her some law\nUnless you have made this journey you really don't know what it's like now my unique experience brought me to both ends of the spectrum you see my mother didn't have resources to put together to have a financial plan\nAnd because of certain circumstances she could not take advantage of some of the strategies in our book the total financial burden of her care rested entirely on me and to put tremendous pressure on the family on the other hand my close family member did have a financial plan and with us\nFinancial resources at my disposal I did not have to worry about the cost of care I did not have to make choices having seen first hand how a plane can deliver the most tax efficient cost effective way to pay for my loved ones scare I wanted to share this insight with you\nBecause of the stress the plan and the strategies in place I can devote all of my time to managing their care in fact I've given myself a promotion I Am no longer a caregiver I Am a care manager\nHaving the plan has allowed me to put a team of professionals together to manage the care we huddle every day to discuss the plan of care for the day we discuss any new developments and we discuss the strategy of how to handle them\nI've devoted a chapter in the book just on caregiving [noise] now we know that over this ten thousand baby boomers journey sixty five each day\nMany of whom will need long term care during their lifetime that dimension society of America estimates that\nSomeone is stricken with some form of dementia every sixty eight seconds further these baby boomers may also be responsible for the care of their parents and experienced a tremendous strain of their assets as promised\nLet's discuss how Medicare and veterans' benefits pay for a long term care even if your spouse or a loved one is already in a nursing home\nBut before I Do so I Want to provide a word of caution\nCurrently this much pressure on the Medicaid system\nPassionately caused by the high costs to treat all ... as a matter of fact the average per person Medicaid spending for seniors with all the time as in other dimensions is nineteenth times higher than the average for a person Medicare spending for all other seniors\nTake into consideration that someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer's every sixty eight seconds in this country\nAnd almost ten thousand baby boomers attorney sixty five each and every day\nIt just a matter of time before the Medicaid system will be broke so if you're healthy now and you're relying on Medicaid five ten or maybe Fifteen Years down the road to pay for your long term care that would not make a lot of sense however if your spouse\nOr a loved one or aging parent\nWho is currently in need of long term care we can help before we get into the nitty gritty how Medicaid for long term care actually works we need to clear up some common misconceptions regarding Medicare and Medicaid\nTo be clear these words sound very similar but there is different is apples and oranges let me first that with Medicare this was the primary health care plan for those of us who was sixty five\nWhile it's true that Medicare will pay for some long term care it's limited to one hundred days of care so unreality you should really defined any benefit that comes out of Medicare is short term care\nMedicaid on the other hand is a joint federal state program designed to help people over sixty five pay for long term care\nWhile each state has can have less restrictive rules and the federal law they cannot have more restrictive rules\nOn the voice of Austin W.
