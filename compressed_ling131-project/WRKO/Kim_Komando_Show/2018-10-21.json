live well they begin the process of rebuilding their homes their communities and their lives but there is a way you can help and that is the real tours relief foundation\nThe realtors relief foundation as a charitable organization with a very specific mission and its summed up in their slogan we bring help home\nIt began in the aftermath of nine eleven attacks at that time the realtors

raised more than thirty million dollars which has helped countless victims of some of the biggest natural disasters in America\nRebuild and start over again\nWe're talking about Midwest tornadoes Louisiana flooding hurricanes Katrina Harvey Irma and now Florence and Michael\nThe goal is to provide help to people who have endured devastating loss from money to help them rebuild to money to help them pay for temporary living accommodations even to help pay their mortgage on a house that's no longer standing the real towards really foundation is there\nThe funds are administered by the local realtor associations in the areas which have been hit which makes sense because no one knows where they need exist better than someone who lives right there in that very community\nNow one thing you should know about the realtors relief foundation is that every dollar donated goes to help\nThere's no overhead deduct it there are no fees deducted and there are no administrative costs coming out of the money people donate instead one hundred percent of the money goes to help the people who need it\nAnd frankly it's a good fit because as we said quite often here on real estate today real tours help build communities and after an immense natural disaster in which people lose their homes their businesses and in many cases the ability to make an income\nThe real relief foundation is there to help rebuild communities it's just one way the realtors across America give back in times of need\nAnd just to be clear about it you do not have to be a real chore to contribute and you do not have to

put in a deadly chill cold at the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul\nBecause of the stress the plan and the strategies in place I can devote all of my time to managing their care in fact I've given myself a promotion I Am no longer a caregiver I Am a care manager\nHaving the plan has allowed me to put a team of professionals together to manage the care we huddle every day to discuss the plan of care for the day we discuss any new developments and we discuss the strategy of how to handle them\nI've devoted a chapter in the book just on caregiving [noise] now we know that over this ten thousand baby boomers journey sixty five each day\nMany of whom will need long term care during their lifetime the dimensions society of America estimates that someone is stricken with some form of dementia every sixty eight seconds further these baby boomers may also be responsible for the care of their parents and experienced a tremendous strain of their assets\nAs promised let's discuss how Medicare and veterans' benefits pay for a long term care even if your spouse or a loved one is already in a nursing home but before I Do so I Want to provide a word of caution\nCurrently this much pressure on the Medicaid system\nActually caused by the high costs to treat all ... as a matter of fact the average per person Medicaid spending for seniors with Alzheimer's and other dimensions is Nineteen times higher than the average per person Medicare spending for all other seniors\nTake into consideration that someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer's every sixty eight seconds in this country\nAnd almost ten thousand baby boomers attorney sixty five each and every day\nIt just a matter of time before the Medicaid system will be broke so if you're healthy now and you're relying on Medicaid five ten or maybe Fifteen Years down the road to pay for your long term care that would not make a lot of sense however if your spouse\nOr a loved one or aging parent\nWho is currently in need of long term care we can help before we get into the nitty gritty of how Medicaid for long term care actually works we need to clear up some common misconceptions regarding Medicare and Medicaid\nTo be clear these words sound very similar but there is different is apples and oranges\nLet me first that with Medicare this is the primary health care plan for those of us over sixty five [noise]\nWhile it's true that Medicare will pay for some long term care it's limited to one hundred days of care so unreality you should really defined any benefit that comes out of Medicare is short term care\nMedicaid on the other hand is a joint federal state program designed to help people over sixty five pay for long term care while each state has can have less restrictive rules and the federal law they cannot have more restrictive rules\nAs a result in Massachusetts if you're married you can keep your home a business property one car\nPersonal contents and up to Fifteen hundred dollars a cash value life insurance and an arrow vocal prepaid funeral plant\nWell most people are happy to learn the digging hang onto these assets that I just mentioned many are usually concerned about their liquid assets like checking savings CDs four O. one K. and other retirement assets\nNow to demonstrate how Medicaid can actually work in your favor I Want to share with you how we were able to help one of our clients\nFor the sake of this example will call our couple Mary and Jonah\nIt eight Seventy eight John was diagnosed with all the time has like symptoms and after four years of caring for John at home Mary's health was beginning to fail\nAfter meeting with John's physician it was determined that it would be in the best interest for everyone to bill would need skilled nursing home care as you might expect Mary was frightened by the prospect of having to need to pay over seven thousand dollars a month for John ... nursing home costs and still keep a roof over our head\nAfter all with the exception of the Alzheimer's diagnosis John's physical health was generally speaking pretty good well the doctor could not predict exactly how long drawn with live\nHe expected that he could easily live another five years or more well Miriam bill we're not wealthy they accumulated between checking savings and duties and other retirement assets some four hundred and twenty three thousand dollars\nNow since these assets are considered liquid they're comfortable in the state of Massachusetts\nIn order to qualify for Medicaid and Medicaid pay for the nursing home cause we completed the division of as a calculation as required by medicate there's simply means taking the four hundred and twenty three thousand dollars and divided in half\nWhile you might expect that if you divide those assets between the two of them they would each receive two hundred and eleven thousand five hundred however and Massachusetts the maximum amount that healthy spouse in this case Mary king key is a hundred and twenty three thousand six hundred\nThe other three hundred thousand would need to be spent down on John's nursing home class before he could qualify for Medicaid and have Medicaid pay the nursing bill\nWell Mary was beliefs to learn that she was not going to lose all her assets to pay for joins care she was still very concerned about how she live on our limited income in only a hundred and twenty three thousand six hundred dollars of assets\nSince we've helped over ten thousand families with cases just like these over the last thirty five years I shared with very little known law called\nOver Ninety three by applying the principles covered in over Ninety three we were able to protect the other three hundred thousand by converting it into an income stream they complied with over Ninety three\nAs a result Mary was presently surprised to learn that John could qualify for Medicaid immediately and she could maintain the entire mistake of four hundred and twenty three thousand\nDollars [noise]\nIf you'd like to learn more about this strategy please call us at eight seven seven to two zero to seven one one and receive a free coffee of our book [noise] tax free money for a long term care [noise]\nI'd like to shift gears now and talk about how Medicaid\nCan pay for nursing care for a single person\nIn Massachusetts a single person can keep the following assets and still qualify for Medicaid to pay for nursing home costs now the assets you can keep our your home one car personal contents term life insurance in Fifteen hundred dollars a cash life insurance and an arrow vocal prepaid funeral play\nWhile most families are happy to learn to love ones can keep these assets a lot of times they mentioned or they're concerned about other\nAssets like checking savings CDs mutual funds and retirement assets and Massachusetts a single person can keep two thousand dollars of assets in order to qualify for Medicaid\nAs a result this means that we need to use them create a financial planning strategies not often found by working with your average stockbroker insurance agent or a financial planner\nFor over thirty five years we've specialized and working on these types of cases and helped over ten thousand families to demonstrate how single person with a hundred and twenty thousand dollars of assets might qualify for Medicare to pay for nursing home costs\nAre going to use a real life scenarios from one of our listeners after hearing are show came in to see me regarding her mother her mother Sally was age ... eighty two and recently suffered a severe stroke and was now in a nursing home paying seven thousand dollars a month [noise]\nAs I met with a daughter became obvious that the objective was to make sure that mom had the ... needed without going broke in the process\nI explained to her that the maximum amount or mom could keep and still qualify for Medicaid was two thousand dollars in this case since Sally had accumulated a nice little nest egg of a hundred and twenty thousand dollars unfortunately without any planning at seven thousand dollars a month she'd be out of money in less than twenty months\nWhere we needed was a strategy that would allow mom to qualify for Medicaid and still protect some of the nest egg\nThe strategy resettled on is what we refer to as they have low strategy by implementing the strategy were able to protect over Seventy thousand dollars for the future and qualify Sally for Medicaid over ten months soon [noise]\nWe're going to take a short break
