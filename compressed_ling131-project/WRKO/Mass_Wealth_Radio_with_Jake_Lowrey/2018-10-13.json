John boggle sang\nDoesn't have an accent radio show he's just one of these caustic condescending lips\nBy call I'm an actor and a comedian that that explains why I've never heard of them yeah exactly he's if he unless he has a show in the seventies on seven oh I think I think he has like an hour long XM Radio program which nobody lifts and he just says and argue liberal things on social really uh you know what the number one show and actually um radio is by the way it's\nFox News channel it's not it's not John snarky boggles saying anyway here's what he sent to ... to to what Susan Collins dear Susan Collins I really struggled with this but my tourist dollars just voted against ever visiting main while you remain in office and so now he uh\nNow he's now he's deleted that tweet went over so big\nYeah I'm guessing a vis boycott of Maine products is brought to you by all the people who moved out of the United states after Trump was elected right\nJohn tests are who owns six restaurants in Texas in his opening a seafood restaurant in California told the newspaper he'll look elsewhere for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of seafood that he buys annually for ... good luck getting

so\nSo in other words they knew that they couldn't find anybody to back up this woman ... story which he couldn't remember 'cause she was so loaded and she she had to talk to her lawyer before she could even come out with some kind of a memory lapse about what a cabinet had allegedly done but they wanted to show the pattern\nOf behavior I\nThought you know a few ... if you try to say there was just another story and one of the papers today in LA\nThere are ... there are a sheriff's deputies are being accused of stopping Latino Z\nIt's called racial profiling right\nThere because there's a pattern of behavior the deputies are saying so what is the difference between a pattern of behavior for ah for Brett Kavanaugh I bet you think which it turns out it's not even true\nAnd a pattern of behavior for stopping drivers are stopping anybody because you suspect that uh they're they're uh they're engaged in the various activities\nSo that Ronan Farrow he's shot we're going to need a new poll question or a Steve someone just to yeah they are one of our other questions was will be ah well the teacher in Minnesota or be fired or resign and I said no this is the uh this is the
