extreme genes in America's family through show and extreme genes dot com\nSegment is brought to you by legacy tree genealogists legacy tree dot com Tom Perry's here from GMC place dot com so we're talking preservation but of course\nAnd the strange renewal of physical things of analog things and we are talking about Christmas gifts what you might anticipate Tom you mentioned calendars awhile ago that's really kind of fun and intriguing when you think about it a physical calendar may be hanging in the kitchen\nAnd then you can actually scan a cue our code and get a video from your grandparents or an answer your kids or whatever it might be I mean that's an amazing mix of the old and new\nBut we're not limited to just calendars\nFact one of my favorite things to do is recipe books because mom address page grandma had recipe Eric grandma address space that sometimes they're headed down through even more generations\nAnd this is cool because you can do it either analog like we talked about or you can do it you know so you want to get these and make PDF settlement you always want to get the card or whatever it's written on\nAnd make a copy of that even if it's in grandma's handwriting they can't read\nBut then always you want to put it down where you can read it so you've got this really cool picture of this handwritten index card and then it underneath exactly what it is and maybe a story behind it like why did say to do this why the Graham I use is when grandma hit a pinch what did she really mean\n[laughter] I mean for a really cool things on it if you're\nCreating a PDF you can print it out so you still have something physical and I've even seen people do CDs and put all these on a day to death\nBut then they ... the CD in photos that they've made up of the old recipe books or you can go and get a binder and put these in the slaves on the front in the back of the binder and then put things inside as well and then get a slave to hold a death than the people that want to do digital that got the one that wanted to add like they got it\nAnd this is a priceless gift to give for Christmas in a different holidays that are coming up\nWouldn't that be fun to do a cue our code actually showing grandma or mom actually putting this recipe together the flash the cue our code that takes you right to the website with that video if you're lucky enough to have them around still to show you exactly how it was done\n[noise] oh that's absolutely wonderful fact taken at now their step you can actually grandma's gone kind of dress up and all the clothes\nAnd shoot it and then when you go\nInto photo shop or your editing you know make it gray scale or turn it into sepia tone and put their little scratches in it and change that speech outlook funky and do little things like this on a cue article and it would just be so much fun will be held areas and everybody will have a good time and nobody's going to give them better than that\nWell let's see now we got calendars we've got recipe books what else is in your little book of tricks for your time for the holidays\nOne of my favorite ones to do also a story books because you can take recipes and putting them you can take aged out of certain people was journals like his dad kept a real good journal take out the pages or he was talking about you know brother Mickey and make a book for them of all of his journal joining we've talked about Mickey make one for sister Sharon\nAnd with the new technology when you put it into like word or something you can do searches and find that were to say okay\nFor Jimmy shiny page forty eight sixty to eighty one hundred and four\nAnd it's really easy to get those and put 'em in pediatrics if they want it digital or actually print out before I'm sure you have this really cool story book that all these journal entries how the recipes and I'm a special photos\nAnd they get high all these things together and just make a gift that is just priceless and you can go to a local copy center and make it into a hard bound book if you want to or go digital or do both\nWow you're making my head explode again you do this all the time in a

this complimentary consultation to anybody who's listening it's seven eight one's three zero five\nThree nine to nine seven eight one three zero five three nine to nine\nSo now that the point with all this has hey life's going to happen and when you're near retirement it's a it's a big thing I remember being in high school and there was a gentleman named Paul and Paul you know I looked up to ... vice principal retired stockbroker he was just a guy why a lot of admiration for any put a big role me getting into industry\nSupposedly once you know a kid he said I Want to tell you some success and excellence and knock characteristics of trades their results of hard work to discipline and planning to think about that in terms of retiring okay you're near retirement success an excellent\nIn retirement and our characteristics traits I mean you didn't inherit from mom and dad and they might have gone to inheritance at some point but I'll tell you this\nYou don't have the other pots okay I'd worked discipline and planning you can inherit five million dollars and they'll be out the door and no time you know I had a family friend years ago Eric seven figures back one seven figures was worth like eight years out there\nAnd you know short within three or four years it was gone there's only so many new cars you need so many properties you need the arrests have got to pay taxes on how you got to maintain this is an electric bill over here\nUh it gets heavy so folks most you all the you've done the hard work you've words coming folks thirty forty years to get to this point okay you have the discipline to save money as his declines all the time let us help with the planting a perfect example get a call ... later on today who I missed a call last night when Jefferson I can use his full name used wins like family\nWayne calms me two thousand one instance where I\nI don't know if you can help me when I don't know either okay it was about two years away for retirement I was able to um doing in service withdrawal which role lab right more in the next segment and help protect someone's four one K. and I did this two thousand two and three the market went down wind you don't lose so that was good news\nTo thousand for he retires something called pension Mac to get more of his penchant for his wife and him jak he was about nine years younger also which is something called Social Security ... when they start filing Social Security\nBut the thing is two thousand eight that market crash in two thousand five ... decided to move to a poll Beach Florida and he moved to fifty five plus community I told me that's the waiting room but I haven't either this once it went down there and saw is not the way they haven't they live like frat boys you know the kids were the wealthy college kids that's what it's like\nAnd it's beautiful nice everybody's young and have fun and going to watch games I mean they want to watch the game last night and have food and drinks all night\nGod Bless them but they are in that and so two thousand eight the market crashed and wind and it was a penny when I went down there waiting for his arm around me to folks and he'll tell people he's er he's retired he made this happened I didn't do this was All right all Ryan and said whoa whoa whoa whoa 'cause you know I like credit but it's got to be where credit's due right\nWing you know and I tell people why farmers did you did the hard work you worked so hard he was you know is it and start guy yeah ... or just bought a\nShiite just when you save money you took reasonable vacations but you still ... for one day\nYou will ... who took suggestions the toughest thing is especially good market sometimes people say hey let's just keep being more aggressive more aggressive very odd to say to somebody who you know the market's gone up ... percent but we're gonna have to scale back the market's up tempers that we're going to get more conservative\nBut again we're playing for the long haul these folks that doesn't you know retire is not a three year a five year says thirty is let's hope it's a thirty a vacation\nSure absolutely so folks are you thinking about the hard work that you

with us love advisors you know they'll set of class All right um that's what would the money come on board and we'll figure it out from there\nIt's not like that with us I took like it's a process Senate if you are going to become a client you are not going to come in the first day of your money I don't know you get you know it's a thirty were talking there's a long term relationship\nAt this point I practice up business is big enough we don't necessarily need more business we value it you know I I wanted to go to a nice climate was a great relationship and I know the grandkids names and they know my daughter and that's important to me I don't want any more transactions at this age you know if I was younger and chasing business about dollars and cents deterrent anymore\nSo we need to get to know how to find out how we the right folks to guide them learn about how much money do you have what are your expenses or they'll just what we can get you for a return it he Hawaii what are you trying to achieve\n... and and I really want to get into a more than ... because I think it's really important you know I always say go deep it's going to be big it can't be surface office because that will get you where you need to go\nIt's a it's a free consultation so seven eight one three zero five three nine to nine will get into details about what you can expect when you come in for that

offers a complementary consultation in his office and I'd like to give you a number where you can call and get that set up they can get you in a in the next probably a five to seven days it's seven eight one three zero five three nine to nine\nSeventy one three zero five three nine to nine some financial partners in Robert let's get you for that complimentary consultation and get you started toward a thirty year vacation now when you come through the door let's let's walk people through because\nYou know it's it's intimidating I I'm a large us right now what I'm saying okay all this sounds really great but when the rubber meets the road what really does happen here\nYes it's so funny I Try to put myself in clients' um position you know the issues and so we actually do is we put together a confrontation with an advisory board for our business just recently\nWhen I thought to myself is it really want to know how ... what was it like more of what was it like last of ... and try to fill it out so\nI was just me well why do you ask climbed the tree I thought no I don't I put together a board that consistently means throughout the year and tells me we like this ... we don't like this we could use more of this as we near retirement these these are things we need more luncheon learns ample [noise]\nUm so it it's funny I'm now ... from different points of view\nSome clients down my wife's friend or family said it's really intimidating because we are you on the radio with Kim Kerrigan\nI'm Lisa ... is a big time and we're almost free would only enough money you know we're not worth the time or we don't know when I see it I thought to myself you know they don't realize it everybody says the same to me as far as I'm concerned each of us he's all of us\nYou know my mom was a housekeeper growing up so I've seen class walk on the door was seven seven to ten grand as he'd be walking was Fifteen twenty million or more um it doesn't matter it's all the same because the same process you know it's the same drill I call during the drone that is a really\nReally great point to make and I I'm just going to reiterate it for you you know with you're listening right now in your intimidated by the amount of money and I think that you have saved don't let that hold you back from coming in to talk to right everybody needs a plan\nThat's good they hit on that because you often times people will need a motion to come in and\nSo here's what I think it starts off we walk into I Try to make that long before you walk in the door but most of our clients way up and go to the workshop or if they come in from the radio they'll call in or referrals from existing clients but most clients to go to a workshop at some point because I think it's important they get to see what the process of it\nAnd they need to know how we run our practice but he's hoping his folks you know they'll find out through the radio to get something in online are friends with a sign of this workshop and they do they sign up for the workshop when they sign up\nThe worship right away Murray cause uh there's no we don't call centers call service I I just don't think it's personal summary reaches out\nTo him for the workshop she follows up again one more call it comes to worship\nFirst people leave me right away is either you Kim Murray was to all of which are amazing folks in fact sue is a cloud because it was a client she is a quiet but I manage a kidnapper when a new shoes selling your business go into retirement because she'd be a perfect addition to those at the family and I called
