'em out online at Lowry financial\nDot com so Jake you know this segment we want to kind of answer some questions about fees because you had a big question we have is with all your retirement planning let's make sure that you're not paying too much\nRight exactly we have an analogy it's it's the shopping cart analogy in in your family David and I probably already know the answer to this question but who lived as the grocery shopping in your family\nWell that's that would be the smart one that would be my wife [laughter] I I\nI figured you were going to say that because most of our wise you know the mom's I mean you know there are moms as well a lot of the times writing um my my wife says she has three children we have twins twin five year olds but she says she has three children right [laughter] so you know me being one of\nThe right age ... and then there\nAnd they and then you have ... ... one of one of moms children [laughter] so anyway uh we have this analogy it it's the shopping cart analogy and what it is is you know when when my wife goes grocery shopping you know or your wife goes grocery shopping maybe I'm tagging along\nShe's not just throwing things in our inner shopping cart you know just random things right mhm my wife has and you know she's got a mission she knows what she's going to get ... and you know she knows what that chick costs would it should cost you know if she if she think pose a thing of spaghetti\nShe knows what that spaghetti is going to cost her when she goes to the checkout line right right\nUh you know me on the other hand I yeah I'm the guy that's probably just throwing things in the in the shopping cart you know uh and she adds I throw him in she takes them out right [laughter]\nBut um you know when she goes through a the grocery store you know she's she's taking things off the shelf that she wants to make for dinner for the week\nAnd she knows what those items are going to cost so when she gets to the checkout line right now and they're eyeing ended in huh there's no surprises there is no surprise she knows if it's supposed to be you know\nTwo dollars and fifty cents and brings up at you know two fifty three for the whatever she knows that yeah that's about right you know that that's what is your costs me ... you know\nSo the thing that we compared to is where we like to do is when you bring in your portfolio is we like to run your your your shopping cart through the checkout\nLine okay and see what you're paying for your portfolio\nSee a lot of people aren't aware of exactly what they're paying for their portfolios for their mutual funds you know for\nThe investments that they have you know variable annuities gosh we talked about variable annuities you know a two and a half percent fee and the average variable annuity you know I tell you right now if you have one of those folks please come in and see me you know we'll talk about it but\nI Want to see the whole portfolio and what we'll do is we'll we'll put it to the morning star report and do the analysis [noise] so you can see exactly what you're paying in fees and ... on your current portfolio\nBecause that's huge there's two things that will that will deflect you from having your\nYour good rich or your your your quality return right you're let's say you have a return to six percent there are two things that will\nAffect that six percent return fees and taxes mhm right\nAnd I think sometimes I think sometimes you know New England nice\nKind of sets in where where people are going to sit across from their a financial advisor and they're too nice to ask hey how much is this going to cost me and feet\nAnd this is where your fee analyze can say hey this is what so and so's charging you you know and this is a no cost obligation type of uh uh yeah NYU they got here you have these\nRights right exactly you ... you know you call us like it said uh we want to help families this you have to do what's best for you and your family in retirement right because there's not a lot of people standing in line helping you when you have no money so you have to do what's best for you and your family in retirement\nAnd so what what I always tell people is look the education is that you have in retirement is power you might have the perfect portfolio you might come in and I might say look\nYou've got a great plan here keep it the way it is congratulations you've done great retirement and you're doing great you don't need my help there's a chance that we might do that you know we're not a perfect fit for everybody\nBut there's why not give it a chance to see right or or just a an opportunity to take advantage of me and say you know what Jake is offering this opportunity for me to have the analysis done\nOn my portfolio I currently don't know what the fees are on my portfolio so I'm going to pick up the phone and I'm going to give them a call and go meet with him either at is seeing them officers Waltham officers Beverly office so this is something that interest you\nPick up the phone or going to take the next ten callers this and no cost no obligation a consultation verbal do the analysis on your current portfolio will also go further with it if you'd like to but right now we're focusing on the fees that number you can reach me as eight\nFive five three one eight eight three eight seven or eight five five three one eight eight three eight seven\nAnd a you know then we can also be makes if you want to take it a step further will do an income analysis will will break down the taxes\nThat your pain I mean if if your current financial advisor has looked at your tax return your previous tax return to see where your taxes are man you really have to reevaluate your situation\nBecause if they're just Sonia financial instruments and not looking at what you're paying taxes that's an issue so like I said if you have these concerns if you want if you want to look and have a customer retirement income analysis done that's the test of your on your income see the different sources you have to make sure you don't run out of money\nIf you want to have the sharp edge that we've just talked about the shopping cart if you want to have your portfolio put through the checkout line so we can see the the analysis and see what's going on with your current the situation you're fee schedule to make sure you're not paying too much in fees\nThe tax analysis we provide that Social Security ... and we can also create a plan for you these are all the things that you need to have done it might sound like a lot\nBut these are requirements folks are you in this you've been saving his money your entire life it doesn't take long to do this right I mean it didn't exist maybe an hour to do this right\nRight and should you go after Jake should you factor inflation in somehow is well\nAbsolutely we in fact we factor in inflation\nOf course always knowledge so like I said this is something that interest you give us a call ... eight\nFive five three one eight eight three eight seven that number is eight five five three one eight eight three eight seven\nBut so subject I have a question but what percentage of retirees would have a pension income at least people that you see you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mass Wealth Radio with Jake Lowrey", "city": "Boston", "day":
