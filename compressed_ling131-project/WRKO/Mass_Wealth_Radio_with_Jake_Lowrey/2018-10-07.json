M. C. place\nHe is our preservation authority and a Tom boy we've seen a lot of natural disasters recently and and the most recent months as well we had\nOf course all the flooding from Hurricane Florence that's been taking place on the east coast now in the west coast is kinda strange but in the southwest Arizona Utah getting the remnants of hurricane Rosa those things aren't usually pushed inland like that\nBut for areas where they had fires you got mud slides now and all these weather situations affect people and their family memorabilia do they not\nYeah that's absolutely the truth and you have to\nBe really careful with these things because they need immediate attention however you don't always have immediate attention to give it because of all the things going on in the same time so we're going to show you how to use a back to the future time machine to be able to preserve your videotapes your audio tapes and things such an eight year old film and such\nOkay so let's talk about fire first of all now people have material I'm sure lost in fire but last means what how do you know film or video or any of these things are lost\nThe only way they're lost is obviously if you can't find them or they're nothing but dust and ashes if there's any kind of media still there even if it's really black and a lot of times it can be recovered\nWhether it's slide your photographs videotapes audio tapes I have had videotapes come into the shelter entirely melted down that you basically it's not too hot plastic around him we were able to take the plastic ... piece by piece and recovered the videotape and the audio tape that was inside the case\nSo you can see something and hold it in your hand there is a good chance or some way to recover and whether it's a professional like us or anywhere else in the country they're professionals or if you're a do it yourself or there's different weight on the Internet you can read about how to recover it yourself\nWow that is an amazing thing to think you had that opportunity to salvage something like that now in fires you've got that\nBut fires also leave the opportunity for mudslides in rain right because of the burn scars that happened so what happens when you get material damaged by dirt or a mudslide or something like that have you dealt with that before\nOh absolutely it down and dirty way to do this if you're really pressed for time is get their stuff out of the mind and get it wet as quick as you can spray it put it in the same I prefer distilled water but if you don't have time to do that just get all of mud and grime off because that's going to cause mold to grow on its going to\nCause the items to be scratched wall transfer as well so what you want to do is get as clean as you can as quick as you can get 'em in zip lock bags get 'em in the freezer so you can storm and work on 'em and six months or years six years or whatever\nAnd a lot of people think well this isn't going to fit in my freezer at my house you can buy those chest Frasier pretty cheap but any home improvement store and just get one of those and put all your things in it whether it's artwork weather's photo slide and it's kind of stuff\nAnd stop them old stock times so to speak in your time machine and then when you can take your breath and get to it then you want to do it the right way and do all the other stuff but the down and dirty way this is a way to do it\nWow All right great advice and then the last thing we ask about what about flooding\nFlooding almost the same thing you want to get any dirt and debris after things wash 'em really quickly put 'em in zip lock bags put them in the freezer if you can get your photos apart easily put wax paper between um any kind of things that you have you on them in separate Ziploc bag so none of the damage from one go to another get 'em in the freezer get the most stopped\nBoy what great advice in this was a great segment to share by the way with friends who may be going through an experience like this Tom thanks so much\nAnd of course if you have a question for Tom pair you can email him at asked\nTom at T.

E. D. I. F. why do it for you [noise] we customize and install it secure smart home that you control the palm of your hand\nThe sound of your smarts security signed installed just for you or would they be T ... dot com slash smart to learn more available ... dot com ATT\nReal protection so boy so Boston\nNew York about one hundred point seven to ... like eighty to Boston and I are radio station [noise]\nFrom ABC News on the written an intersection\nKnow you're better off playing the lottery absolutely are analyst always says you better up by uh Powerball tickets if you think it's that easy so once we maximize Social Security over people pensions maximize that we all by clients identified their income yeah did you as to what they need every month with Social Security provides\nAnd then we help them to close that gap my position therefore when kids IRAs and their retirement savings that they worked twenty thirty forty years to save\n... position and made it to give them guaranteed income for life and he comes in every month goes up every single year doesn't go to a nursing home should want to you have health care issues because even if one person goes to a nursing home you're married couple the other person needs to eat and you can have all the money go the nursing home so it's crucial we think of these things\nFolks if the the things that you're facing if you're near retirement or retired it go for one kid you've done a good job saving but you know the two thousand eight wiped out and you realize that we can't afford another two thousand eight Seventy one to eight one two to eight seven Seventy one two one two to eight seven cyber consultation\nAnd here's where it goes after we helped max my Social Security even reposition for one k.'s and I are as there's usually some money left over it doesn't usually take every penny a person has to close their income yeah so what do we do it that way he is where it comes down to protection burst\nIs management so protection that's the money we ... we call that green money that might not have any risk\nIt may not you twenty percent returns that's for sure but you can in Sicily do five to ten six to twelve you're not going to break twelve much you're not going to lose and that's crucial it's going to give you an income as long as you live if you die your spouse will maintain that income so that gap will be close\nYou know the hardest thing on earth is to lose a loved one I Can't fathom losing a loved one and then having a sacrifice to do without you know be able to pay your bills it's hard enough\nTo our job is to make sure that these things we supposed to think of the unexpected that's our job\nSo the other money this leftover well that's where it comes into play and since my clients and that's the red my that somebody this hot in other words you can try to get a high return if you want because if the market goes down you can ride out the storm meaning you don't need to touch that money in the next seven to ten years\nAnd I find more and more people even when it comes to you but the hot money in the red money they don't want to be twenty percent returns but they'd like to look more like seven to ten but they're still really risk adverse\nDefinitely especially depending on what the money is for if it's for maybe they're leaving it over for children or get grandchildren that are planning on spending it versus they're using that as to supplement their retirement to to go golfing to go traveling whatever it is it really depends on what their objectives are\nAnd then once we figure out what the objectives are for it then we can create a plan based off how much risk they're comfortable taking going forward\nAbsolutely and this is all part of the plant folks getting retirement my way find max my Social Security identify your income gap close that gap would guaranteed predictable income flight green money\nThen put the red money in place in other words the other investments make sure that I'm not taking too much risk\nOftentimes people come in the door and the money's set up the way it was Thirty years ago when they had set up their retirement account and it has to say okay this doesn't fit what you want what you're telling me as you don't want this much risk but it's set up so does that disconnect less correct that for you she can sleep at night\nFor men when it goes to turn on retirement income folks just what this tax is Uncle Sam Zell going the way we need to make sure there's plenty of done the most tax efficient manner possible so at that point our count Walter will sit with our clients and make sure when they turn around and come is done in the most tax efficient manner we have to make sure this plans advantageous to you\nAnd then in the end what we do is we have to wrap it up with a ... some people come in and they've done a trust within the last five years great\nOther people haven't they just did a will years ago when the kids we are so at this point are stay play attorney Jerry Griffin Pato team see what our clients to make sure that when it's all said and done what they have worked thirty forty fifty as four goes to their loved ones or charity wherever they want just not the government of the nursing home\nSo folks this is how the process goes and again it's a process it's not an event\nBut it's getting near retirement a retired you need to go through the process you need to focus on these things cost Seventy one two one two to eight seven\nAgainst Seventy one to eight one twenty two eighty seven we're going to be will walk you through the process we will build a retirement your way and that's what it comes down to is who you are we need to get to know you understand how you pick what year it is then take steps to make sure you get to retirement you deserve\nFolks have a great afternoon have a great week ahead addicts for your time spent ... excellent\nJoined us every week on this show please go on some

in a nutshell protect your nest egg don't correct in that state makes you of an income for life and income that lasts as long as you goes up every it obese inflation\nBecause my grandfather who's from Indiana would say Adele today doesn't buy what it used to it so funny I used to think the man was a fool and now I Know he's a genius [laughter] I always thought he was she got a full but shape\nYou know it was as much as I did very well\nYeah you know he his guy with the sixth grade education words on a farm came to Boston to become a machinist and it's a little bit about his story takes the really applies all areas like there are people who do that you know take the steps and proactive and there are people who wish they were and they become reacted and that's a story of my two grandparents are the two sets of them\nAnd folks debate the common denominator is all my grandparents expected to have to you know their fifties and sixties\nAnd my grandfather and my mom's side died at sixty nine of cancer but my mother's mother who had a tough life words pushing carts and food and did dishes that Lawrence Memorial Hospital ... she lives on Ninety two\nAnd my father's mother lived so Ninety two and my father's father my grandfather why rave about he live to Ninety One why my telling you this Dutch brag about hold my grandparents were but to share with you that the reality is you're going to live longer the good news and bad news Jerry you know what it is\nIt's the exact same so Jerry I Know that when Clive come in you know oftentimes just to us well I don't want to live into my nineties as if this you know a button to stop\nWhat rain you know you just look back in time in history you know a retiree in the late Nineteen forties right up through the mid Nineteen fifties\nAt an expectation that they retire around sixty five but you know they only to clinch folks Fifteen Years now they have to plan for Thirty years you have to make sure you have your retirement plan that's going to protect you and provide solid monthly income for at least thirty is for you and your spouse\nIs folks feel within five years retirement or retired you really need to put this plan together because if you plan properly retirement is a thirty a vacation about Thirty years of doing what you want when you want but you got to do the planning\nSo folks if you're near retirement or retired meaning within five years retirement\nCosts Seventy one to eight one twenty two eighty seven ... seven eight one two eight one two to eight seven and ... set you up for consultation they're complementary because we don't even know if we can help yet but we'll sit down and will roll up our sleeves with you will get down to the cause and conditions of your retirement goals how intractable enemies them\nAlso will sign you up or workshop because that's when you get to know us our process\nSo longevity people living longer was gives some facts you know the average sixty five year old has a fifty seven percent chance of braking to Ninety eleven apps and she has two hundred eleven helps central women to a hundred sharia I mean it's\nAmazing and just thinking about that ah you know when they used to do the shows on TV where they talk about the folks who are turning a hundred you know there's just so many of them that uh you know it's up to like a hundred and ten though\nIt's amazing to me you know that climbed this morning we had a client come into office this morning\nAnd Jerry and I was talking to them and she was telling us about somebody ... live to a hundred and four and that's that's crazy to me and she was within two hundred and three in fact my wife's grandmother lived to a hundred and three until about Ninety eight years old she was cracking jokes and rolling around just to fund bubbly lady\nSo folks that that's good if you take care of yourself you do plenty she'd have a long fun enjoyable life and do the things you deserve to do\nSo longevity and this is where we come into play the accumulation advisor is the advisor or plan administrators the guide you in your twenties thirties forties and even early fifties while he's saving for retirement and that involves like a primary care physician and they chose to kind of overall keep things how to keep things healthy\nBut there's a goal is to have our why return on investment\nFolks that's their only focus so something happens every seven to nine years and Jerry you know every seven genius is Nineteen twenty nine what happens\nYeah we have a correction in the markets and people just get low to sleep thinking it's just gonna keep going up up up in up in Detroit you know have to work every day and then suddenly they see those red arrows on the screens and it's in freefall when it's too late
