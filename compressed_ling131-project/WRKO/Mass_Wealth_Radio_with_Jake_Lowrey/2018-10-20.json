I've told you this\nWhen Donald Trump's first became president I thought to myself there was such\nA Haiti's describe like backlash like women taking to the streets pink hats everywhere and I thought wow this is going to be hard for him to win again because everyone seems really riled up and they really seem like a lit a fire under them energized their base and then I thought\nAt first they have to pick somebody to run against him\nAnd now I'm thinking like oh my God they have to pick one of these people they have to pick between\nWillie Brown's ex girlfriend Spartacus the fake Indian\nJoe Biden who is Joe Biden I think is like ... like they think he's all he says what's on his mind but whenever he goes off script he said something very offensive like stand up to a guy in a wheelchair so they're ... it's just one ... for that\nRussia Today you know Joe Biden gets to the debate with a race of say how how could you be an Indian you're on a seven eleven at Delaware remember when Joe Biden subtlety Indians Oh yes\nYou have to have to be an out of that yeah yeah and it's just like the other part of it is that when they run because all these it's not so much like Donald Trump where\nYou're running because you think you could do a good job they all just want to be president really badly like Spartacus you can see it in those eyes every time he cried he wants to get messages\nOn our car [noise]\n\nThis is Dale the director of the northeast men's clinic here's Chuck to share his experience\nOver the last four years I noticed that I was gaining weight I lacked energy I didn't have the drive to get up and go to the gym like I used to and I just didn't feel like myself when I tried vitamins supplements every snake oil products that was out there are tried it but nothing ever worked\nCalling the northeast men's clinic was the best thing I ever did I've been on the testosterone replacement therapy for several months now I feel fantastic I feel you full again I'm getting a great night sleep I actually feel like I Want to run the Boston Marathon again like I did Twenty years ago\nI'm never getting off this program I Want to feel the way I feel now for the rest of my life I highly recommend northeast men's clinic if you know you should make this phone call don't waste another four years like I did it will change your life it did for me\nWe'll Chuck we can help you to go for your confidential if women today six one seven five six four thirty eight eighty eight or northeast men's clinic dot com\nBubble boy so Boston you walk working over one hundred point seven deadly UCLA HP to Boston and I are radio station on ABC News\nAttacks are different groups but the MO is always kind of at the same\nBut we're not going to even get into that that I Will get into that later in the week this was the beginning of the trial today at the district court house federal in Boston\nBut the big story today is that oh Elizabeth Warren has released what she claims is her DNA tests and she's claiming\nThat it it proves that she's a Native American in reality a claim she's it proves that she's not a Native American so the the fake news Boston Globe a you know they're the\nI mean they just have so many fake news stories in the past I Can't even\nI don't have time to even a lay it all out for you but just lay out of my article\nJason Blair Patricia Smith Kevin color and those are a few of their fake news reporters and column this over the years people have been busted for uh making stuff up they uh they they made up stories about the ... they said us soldiers raping women in\nIraq during the first Gulf War turned out it was a porn movie still they said Ted Kennedy was turning his life around over and over again\nThat turned out to be a lot I mean it just goes it it it never ends so today they put out a story Elizabeth Warren has new evidence proving that she's one between one thirty second and won five hundred and twelve\nIndian Native American and then you read down into the story they didn't they they ... they included ... anyone who has it Mexican Mexican DNA\nPeruvian DNA Colombian DNA so in other words for ... Native American it it it could be Hispanic so her name was ... she can change your name from Elizabeth\nWarren to Elizabethan till Warren like the bust out the Texas Senate candidate whose pretending she's pretending to be an Indian and he's pretending to be Hispanic\nSo my question is if you are one sixty fourth Asian is that enough for Harvard to discriminate against you\nRight I well but anyway listen so here it is so so then about like an hour after they post the story they say a correction\nUm the range isn't from one thirty second to five hundred won five hundred and twelve that's for one thirty second to one one thousand and twenty four and so again I'm not a I'm I'm not very good at math\nBut I said to myself well if the if the upper range\nIs faults than does at the bottom range has to be false to I mean it's not like basic\nMath\nBut the you know so we used to I we started referring to it as one sixty fourth and a Breitbart News started referring to it as one sixty fourth but the globe kept running with it because they want to allow all the moon bats that put their Facebook pays postings up saying that it's one third but she's she's got evidence\nSuch as it is claiming that she's one thirty second\nBut it was false so finally about a half hour ago they posted a second correction saying but at at most she is one\nSixty fourth India\nOr native America or non white\nAnd of course here's the thing the average\nWhite America and the average American or European descent has more Native American blood than she apparently does but she's claiming to be in India and she is claiming that she has a right to uh to have gotten and affirmative action position\nFirst at the University of Pennsylvania and then at Harvard University law school\nAnd of course we have powwow chow or cook\nWhat one fifty five Elizabeth Warren she's a member of she's a Cherokee wedding to this was before Cherokee and her uh her her she's got several recipes that here they're all lifted from various places my favorite is called on what's with crab meat which lifted from uh New York times French cookbook\n\nAll right uh [laughter]\nYou know this is this is just such a such a crock and it's so classic of the Democrat Party and the mainstream\nMedia the print fake news and then correct the fake those after the uh after\nThe lives have gone around the world and are are already posted and so tonight I guarantee you if you go to the the usual left wing cable news cast they will still be repeating the lie which is already a been retracted\nBy the uh additional fake news outlet to report it the Boston Globe that she's one thirty second India but you know what it doesn't even matter if she's one thirty second Indian that's not good enough to claim to be an Indian\nWhether it's a bureau of Indian affairs standards whether it's the a tribal role she she claims she's part Cherokee part Delaware\nThat's not good enough she's not in India if they if they were printing truthful headlines in the end they all left media the headline would say white woman's DNA test proof she's white woman or a DNA test\nConfirm Elizabeth Warren\nFate is a fake ending 'cause that's what she is she's a fake Indian\nDidn't achieve some attacks there says didn't the Cherokee Nation state that done her ancestry and could not find any connection yes of course yeah she's a she's a fried\nShe's a fraud and now they're saying that the oh she's she's proven that she's in ... she is she's proven she's proven she's not in India and and we don't even know where this DNA test wasn't on\nShe gave it to some uh Stanford University professor who is a a I guess he's a biochemist these not even a geneticist these of I think a biophysicist\nAnd ... they let him do the analysis the quote unquote analysis of the DNA and he's and he's given her this uh this this bill of health although it's not a bill of health is just proving she's not in India\nAnd yet they're gonna yet this is going to be this will be today's big ally from the ... left media Elizabeth Warren prove she's in India\nNo she's not by the way back in the back\nAnd Jim Crow south they used to have this thing called the one drop rule if you went ... ... if you had one drop of black blood didn't matter if you were like one sixty one thirty one sixty fourth black you were considered black so now Elizabeth Warren\nHas returned to her party's a Jim Crow Ku Klux Klan reconstruction bays and she's she's reclaiming the one drop rule the one drop rule\nShe's got she's got maybe maybe probably not one drop or maybe one one hundredth of a drop of a Native American blood in her I'd I'd say they'll nothing and uh she's climbing she's an Indian\nEight four for five hundred a forty to forty to us
