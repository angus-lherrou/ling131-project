P. O. one day and now\nWas yeah so they had a very good I. P. O. day but then not so good right right and we're going to discuss tax cuts to point no rain ... of the tax cuts exactly and this is really important stuff because yeah\nAs investors you know one thing that you're just clearly trying to understand is what is on the table if the Republicans McCann miraculously hold on to the house as well as the Senate\nOr will they be able to get tax cut to point out when it was included in that and I have to tell you there's just some surprises in there that I was surprised that I and I'll give you a hand capital gains aren't included interested yeah interesting uh where I was going to discuss emerging market if we\nThat that far my friend [laughter] we'll see we'll see if they ... we got a lot to do it well see if they emerged during the show OK\nWell we've got a very busy week on Wall street there were some peace and there were some dies overall what is your take on the market\nWell right now you know the it was actually a very good week for the market both the Dow in the U.S and the five hundred hit all time highs earlier this past week and the NASDAQ\nHas just off it's all time high by about two percent of all three of the major U.S indexes really haven't quite a year or this week the Dow earned about one percent the S P was essentially level and the NASDAQ was down about one percent as war international stocks now a year to date\nIncluding dividends the NASDAQ has been the winter it's ... it's returned about sixteen percent\nThe S P and the down there up about ten percent and don't forget really three quarters of the way through the year right okay I mean that's that's really quite something and at the exact same time international stocks they're down almost five percent year to date so us stocks have greatly outperformed their international counterparts\nAre those international stocks when they go down does that affect us that much\nAnd it sure does if you're an investor um it absolutely in impacts you because\nI think about it this way most Americans have some international stocks in their portfolios are typically it's about two thirds us stocks one third international stocks if one third of your stock portfolio is losing five percent year to date you're going to notice that exactly yeah so\nSo that's the so if your overall account is doing well because the American market Ryan is doing a little poorly because of the international market that once again just shows just how strong this market\nIs it is and what it also says those the importance of the asset management that your financial advisors doing few because if your financial advisor just doesn't do kind of an index strategy where they say\nHey it's two thirds us than one third international I guess it's thanks to have that one third international if you have an active manager light costs\nThat says no no no we liked the U.S markets more then we then we like international markets at this point so instead of being two thirds us one third international we're close to four fifths us one fifth international that's a big difference\nWell that's because for you it's not a hobby gets a job that's right and the and that makes all the difference in the world\nAnd you know again past performance can't guarantee future results but we took those positions because we liked the underlying fundamentals of the U.S markets and we didn't like some of the fundamentals of the international markets including some of the uncertainties for example the Brexit story that we're going to talk about a little later on today\nRight excellent for more information I Would call eight eight eight nine seven two seven five to six\nAnd write down the number because what happens and I listen to your show every week obviously were part of a doing this program and I get it and I said wait a minute what about this fall and I find that I call you mid week ... throw it all and I'll call because we don't know one of the story comes across nieces all women will this affect\nMy savings will this affect my retirement right so called eight eighty nine seven two seven five to six and also just visit plans strong dot com go ahead about us bonds\nOkay so if you ... as you would expect if stock prices were up for the U.S this week you'd expect bond prices to be down and they were\nA high quality bond yields were up for the week so yields act opposite the way prices go so the tenure U.S Treasury yield rose from three point O. five percent to three point ... almost three point two percent of the highest level since twenty eleven\nAnd the two year was up from two point eight percent to two point eight seven percent another thing about short rates is that the probability of a short term rate increase by the fed is now eighty three percent for the fourth rate increase of the year in December and that means we end with overnight rates between two and a quarter and two and a half\nPercent last thing I wanted to mention about us rates was that the fed projected last week that they would raise rates three more times in twenty Nineteen\nAnd at the same time if you're an intermediate longer term rates the first time we've actually seen longer rates go up on the curve this is really important because of what that represents and what I wanted to talk just a little bit about that if you don't mind because it's important for our investors to understand that\nThe fact that longer term rates are increasing is actually really good news and let me tell you why it's some it's important because the longer term rates typically reflect the outlook for the economy over a longer period of time\nWe know short rates are reflection of what the fed thinks is going to happen as a result and what they're trying to do is normalize rates were note the economy is strong enough that they can\nThey can normalize short term rates but the longer term rates are really a reflection of what the market thinks the prospects are for economic growth over an extended period of time\nSo the longer term rates really reflect their confidence\nIn the long run ins and outs and confidence in more growth right how much more growth ...\nThat that's like the shipping companies buying new tractor trailers that record pace directs eye in trucks they're buying trailers that's not something to do next week right that's a long term plan\nThat's exactly right and so what they're saying is they anticipate\nRates as they anticipate inflation being higher in the longer term the only way inflation can be higher in the longer term if there's a lot more demand out there I ... up the price is right right so this is actually very good news and I would say\nAs an investor I saw this week is a really kind of a breakthrough week this the first time in a long time that an intermediate term rates that the tenure U.S Treasury has eclipse all three point two percent at really is a big move\nUp well it's a lot of confidence it is that's right and oil prices are up this week is that good news or bad news going I'm going to pay at the pump yeah exactly right there I was gonna say depends who you are but I have to say one thing Paul why is it when oil rates go up the pump rates go up\nInstantaneously simply ... in ... when they come down what happened six about four weeks yeah to a job and if you ask the a gas station or you know he says oh I I bought all the inventory at the high price and and I have to work my way through the inventory right but they didn't buy all the inventory at ... you know at that moment when they raised the price\nI Want to find the gas station that buys all the inventory at the lowest rate\nThat I I if you find that I was learning uh yeah so ... to your point of who wins who loses ear oil prices were up about three bucks a barrel this week west Texas now's mid seventies Seventy five bucks Brent is it eighty six box a barrel and that's a direct reflection of what's going on\nWith the impending sanctions against Iran so you know in the international oil going to be more expensive\nAnd and to tell you how much that impacts that crude oil inventories were actually\nUp this week in the U.S and still we're seeing a Brent Crude at eighty six bucks a barrel that's a high number and again who's a good for\nGood for the oil companies if you're a shareholder in an oil company good for you if you're a consumer less good for you because you go to your local gas station more than likely they're going to Jack the price up pretty fast I Know we're\nGoing to talk about Tesla coming up maybe I shouldn't have bought that electric car after all\nWe absolutely have to think about that your\nFinances my friend there not a spectator sport if you're going to make anything from it you actually have to be in the game and to be in the game you want a professional somebody like Paul Parsons to contact Paul it's very easy you call him directly eight eight eight nine seven two seven five to six or visit ... plans drawing dot com\nAnd this is Paul Parsons president of plans drawing investment management and you're listening to the plan's strong financial

much more of your four one K. R. IRA and save big time on your taxes if you're a small business owner you maybe\nWe'll too which is why you need to listen to my friend financial advisor\nBall Parsons Bebe these plans are best suited for profitable small businesses with fewer than five employees and depending on specific circumstances the owner can make contributions to their retirement account of a hundred to three hundred thousand dollars a year that's excluded from their taxable income\nAs you said Kirk sole proprietors small business owners if there's anything that drives them batty is that they're paying too much in taxes encourage income tax and they're looking for ways to get that taxable income number down ... I I\nDon't want to interrupt you but there is that we want to pay the taxes that we we feel are are we were do and it's not like you're trying to make as much money as you can and not pay tax you need to make more money or as much as you get to pay your employers prior to grow your business right and then you need to save money so you can protect yourself in the future\nSo it's really important is not just I don't want to pay tax it it it it's a real big picture thing\nAnd that's that's the second part of it not only do you feel like you're paying too much in taxes\nBut at the same time you're unable to contribute as much as you'd like to contribute to your retirement at least on a tax deferred basis in other words hey throw me a bone I arrest or you know I I Need to save a lot of money for my retirement I Know I'm fifty or fifty five\nI've got a successful small business and you're telling me the most I can contribute to my my own personal pension or my own personal IRA is fifty or sixty thousand bucks I'm not going to make it I Know I Need several million dollars to support\nYou know my lifestyle I don't have a pension coming I'm making my own pension and so I got to put aside sizable contributions and you're not letting me do it on a tax deferred basis except you can\nOkay and that's what I'm here to talk to you tell us how you can do that yeah so there there is a kind of retirement plan allowed by the IRS that a small business owner can contribute much more\nThan two a four O. one Karen IRA and at the same time of course the big time on taxes\nNow let me tell you these are best suited for these are best suited for profitable small businesses with fewer than five employees and there are some specific circumstances that really matter here let me tell you why\nBecause it's the number of employees you have the age of the employees and also um what wages they're being paid it's all those factors\nMatter so this may work actually very elegantly for some small employers and be relatively ineffective for others so it's not a one size fits\nAll but it's vital if you fit if that shoe fits you you want a weird that you and this is vital if if it so the we have to contact you to find out if it's that's where I Know you want to get more information on it but I feel it's my duty\nTo say call Paul this is I can relate to this if you're listening and you have a business I Know you can relate to this\nThis is the Christmas comes early on this one that is right this is absolutely right game changer there's one\nThere's one fact it's really important that I think our listeners need to hear and that is that not only does this help you put aside literally hundreds of thousands of dollars a year towards your own retirement and decrease the amount of income that you are taxed on\nBut it also may allow you to qualify for a new pass through deduction that the new Trump tax plan has created and as a result something that you may not have qualified before you may be able to now and that's a permanent tax savings to you\nAs I said before this was a game changer it's vital because many people are affected this is a way that you can reduce your tax liability save more for your retirement and it only works for certain people so let's find out if you qualify if you qualify it's important\nTo know called eight eight eight nine seven two seven five
