Boston\nNew York or Boston one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and I are radio station\nNow is going to be interesting to see if the midterms change that formula what does that mean for investors so we'll talk about\nThat we had an ideal that came out this week we're a monkey\nOr a monkey or actually last week and they they really uh uh it's funny it was very warmly welcomed that but I wanted to follow up with what happened to it since ... and a little more on tax cuts yeah so you know if the Republicans can miraculously hold on to the house\nAs well as the SAT at a then it'll be really interesting to see what's in and tax cut\nVersion too because some of the things that we'd hoped would be in there may not be in there after all so I Want to talk to investors about that well\nLet's start up all we're looking at the u._s. stock market is kind of a rough week or so so what the heck happened\nI Would say Ross is a good [laughter] okay uh you know ... and ... by the way a warning everyone who wasn't paying attention please stay away from sharp objects won't talk about the sits\nAt the same time I really want everybody to understand it's so important to put this news in the proper context we've had a fantastic year last year and we were in the midst of a very strong year this year again and we actually had\nSome sort of an adjustment are correction this past week low actually the the last six trading days before\nSo yesterday friday okay and here's what happened that the major U.S stock indices were at or near all time high is at the beginning of this month you know we've talked about this a lot and you know of course then the concern is oh how can they go and you know will they crash and is this the beginning of the end and all that [noise]\nUh and sure enough a a little over a week ago that was the case now year to date they were up to ten to sixteen percent including the evidence that through you know two thirds or sorry three quarters of the year\nThat's that's really quite a strong returned especially after last\nYear when they asked if he was up Twenty one percent run all your compounding on top of compounding at this point but starting on October force which was a week ago Thursday\nStocks started to slip and value every day over the next week and then this past week we had two very bad days on Wednesday and Thursday where the market the for example the Dow dropped you know five hundred points plots each of those two days\nAnd the tech heavy NASDAQ I dropped more than that dropped on nine or ten percent uh and then I still recovered on friday a bit the S. and P. and the Dow were down about six percent when all was said and done\nA from the top down and then we're covering on friday so now year to date the indexes are up around four to seven percent instead of ten to sixteen percent\nYou know that's a substantial decline sure and and so you know obviously a lot of people want to know what is going on without I'll talk about that in a second and it was especially troubling for some very popular domestic stocks\n'em and because those were especially hard hit for example Amazon and Netflix and\nEntertainment arts those were down twelve to sixteen percent uh since the beginning of October ... that's a big move down\nBig bump of course some of those dogs had been up pretty high up this year\nWell again it's all important to keep it in a contest\nAnd finally you might say well but did international stocks do okay\nBecause you know everybody knows where most people know at this point that international stocks already had gotten kind of lousy start to the year ... through October third they were down three percent as opposed to the U.S markets up ten to sixteen percent right but they dropped another six to nine percent\nAlong with the rest of the market um ... all over this you know six days slide period kind of in line with us stocks they're now down about nine percent year to date so no they didn't avoided if anything they were you know they just went right along with the ride that the U.S stocks went along with as far as the downward ride was concerned\nAbout let's look at what happened about a ten days ago or so everything was at or near all time eyes will act everything looked grade we knew that the fed had promised to bump interest rates so that we should have ... I guess the built into the market to a certain extent there's been tapped promising us that\nFor for a year or two now so so what happened what ... what happens so suddenly the made this go sell so quickly\nAnd well you know first of all that's the way the markets work you know the markets tend to go up slowly and come down fast ... catch the falling knife right and they it's a it's a good a phrase for a reason right um but it certainly part of it had to do with investors becoming concerned\nWith any kind of economic fallout caused by rising interest rates and and just what you said [noise] that interest rates are normalizing at this point where they're still the fed does not have a policy in place to raise interest rates to combat\nInflation or to slow economic growth they're still trying to just get interest rates back to neutral from if you will the the low life support levels they had been on for literally a decade so close to zero hostess zero\nAnd you know by all accounts of starting with hours on the U.S economy has been in quite good shape for the it's certainly the last year and and maybe two years now and you you how can you justify having ridiculously low interest rates when the patient is no longer on life support them ... actually doing very very well\nGDP Growth was good inflation was good and within target employment was incredibly tight all three of the ... the measures the criteria\nThat the fed uses to a set their mind monetary policy\nSaid green light green light green light all is good so it makes lots of sense for the fed to want to normalize rates at this point it doesn't help though that we have a president who likes to tweet\nAnd our president who likes to tweet said hey the feds killing us yeah uh and you know I I don't think that helps investors ... because that makes it feel like oh gosh does she think the feds raising rates too fast and should they slow down and why is he saying that and all that that certainly causes some uncertainty\nBut another thing is that you know think about one race rise there you are worried about some stuff for example rising interest rates make it more expensive for companies to borrow money right to fund their activities\nSo it that makes their costs tire so they're not going to borrow as much they're not going to expand as much it also makes bonds with higher coupons a more attractive alternative stocks and so now\nYeah maybe I'll maybe instead of\nPutting all my money in stocks maybe I'll put some of my money on bond so what I Do I sell some of my stocks to buy some bonds that drive stocks down\nBecause interest rates are now up a bit so there are a number of reasons why weeds rising interest rates investors could and should have some trepidation says it relates to you know what does it mean for the first stock prices\nAnother thing that people are concerned about our recent indicators in housing in autos and we've talked about that has nausea him in this in this show that at least some portions of the economy may be losing steam or ... the word I use is cresting\nYou know they've hit all time highs and now they're down a bit uh that's the case in autos is not the case of housing thank God because housing was so over done in the last economic expansion\nBut we are seeing housing coming down from their highest from this expansion and then of course finally Kenny the third leg of the stool to cause some concern was the U.S trade conflict with China may be actually worth seeing a bed\nAnd a slowdown in the Chinese economy could spill over into global markets so you know those are some of the causes that at least some people are trying to work their way through and when we come back I Want to talk about whether or not you should be worried or if I'm worried should we be worried\nBall gives us his answer when we return supplies drunk financial form\nThis is Paul Parsons president of plans drawing investment management and you're listening to the plan's strong financial forum if you\nLike what you hear on our show and what they need to take a look at your investments in retirement plan called my office in eighty nine seven two seven five to six eight eight nine seven two seven five to six that's eight eight eight nine seven to plant\nSecurities and advisory services offer through commonwealth of\nRegistered investment advisor\nImagine if you could contribute much more of your four one K.

also free number eight eight eight\nAnd you know if you're wondering why do we talk about what happened in the market and and so forth and we talk about oh well these kinds of stocks have done well in these haven't in the end what are the most important things that that we do as investment professionals is we assessed the overall market and we say do we want to have\nA a neutral waiting in stocks do we want to be overweight and stocks are underweight in stocks and a lot of it has to do with\nOur perspective on what do we think over all the market's going to do and the underlying health of the economy that supports that market right that's why we talk about this stuff so much and that is what drives a lot of our overall asset allocation an asset allocation is a\nHuge component of whether or not you're going to over perform outperformed more under perform\nPolicy about what else happened in the markets this week a U.S bonds\nSo us high quality us bonds were actually down a yields were down this week prices were up because obviously the the the stock prices were down substantially so a rash if you will took her to quality\nOr the tenure U.S Treasury yields fell from three point to three percent a three point one six percent the two years down very slightly from two point eight eight to two point eight sex\nOr the probability of a short term rate increase by the fed now is about three quarters that is very likely for December rate increase that'd be the force rate increase uh this year a overnight lending rate would be a finishing the air between two and a quarter and two point five percent don't forget\nHigh quality US government or corporate bonds of lost two points three percent year to date so stocks even though in the last six days we've had this slide\nAs I said you before ... a U.S stock indexes at this point are are are up four to seven percent year to date and high quality bonds during the exact same period of time have lost two and a half percent year to date so it has been worse taking the extra risk\nCompared to the alternative of being in high quality bonds and watching the value of your portfolio including interest payments go down during the same period of time Paul\nWhat do you think about the president's tweets you say the fed now is it a Seventy six percent chance for fourth reading increase do they pay attention to that\nI don't think they pay a lot of attention and they're an independent body and they should\nBe an independent body so the fact that the president says a killing me they're going whether they're going to raise rates or not they just won't pay any attention to that\nI if I were to governor wouldn't impact me much rent\nTold him come back we'll we'll get oil prices a few economic data reports and it will get into some

say so what do you make of it and and you know we gave them our perspective is very similar to what I've set you obviously I've covered a lot of this and you know a longer period of time but the short answer was no we're not worried about it right now and I\nWill other obviously some criteria were looking at and none of those are flashing even yellow at this point so we're good at this point\nSo for folks who are listening if a if you didn't get the same kind of a response from your financial advisor or if you're not sure what your financial advisor thinks of what's going on\nYou didn't want to give ... collagen eighty nine seven two seven five to six or plan strong dot com [noise] All right so we're looking at what else happened over the last weekend of the big story of course the stock market or oil prices\nWell and I say part of the big story was that the market uh turned on friday so you know I think that's very important for people to recognize that this is the difference between a prolonged downturn and you know a market that cracks and then ... pretty rapidly corrects itself and the way back\nAnd we saw you know substantial improvement on friday and and I think that's very important at the market saying okay what kind of clarity ... out a little bit maybe we're a little bit over a ... a little bit but now we're you know we're backing and\nWe've we've kind of gotten ourselves back to evaluation that we think is is full and fair\nAt this point right so oil prices to answer your question we're down a little bit this week actually down\nFortified barrel a dollars a barrel is weak and you know guess what kind of in the range that you know I've talked about where we thought they'd be this year no surprise there\nWest Texas right now is Ron Seventy one dollars a barrel brands are on eighty one dollars a barrel a and crude oil and the Tories and the U.S increase this week by six million barrels that's only eleven percent below ... a year ago level\nAnd it's the third week in a row that US soil and the stories of increased and what does that do that puts downward pressure on west Texas prices and\nWe're seeing that and we expected this we expect as oil prices were in the Seventy dollar range for what\nTaxes we certainly expected to see more and more of these ... go back on line and and you know it's not it's this is a much easier for these guys these operations to turn capacity back on than it used to be because fracking\nIs on existing you know oil oil fields are very easy to access you know you're not going out to the sea and drilling down ten miles and you know spending zillions of dollars you're literally going driving your car does area and you're ... restarting up an an oilfield\nMuch much more versatile and and we're seeing that kick in and an air go that's also why you're seeing the big discrepancy between west Texas\nA and Brent Crude because Brent as as you know out of the north sea uh and\nWhen you look at data oil you know it's a lot harder for them to turn on the turn the switch on and and get that all the way up to Brent and and make it a sexually available for for a European and and I'm Asian\nAnd eats so there is a big difference in price right now we are much able to a much more able to get our oil to market in the United states than they are there and also of course\nThey're having constraints whether it's in Iran and some other places as well that's really curtailing a supply in um a European an international markets overall\nAt a fairly quiet we go round and economic data\nIs so true and again you know the data was good and it was kind of Goldilocks data and I keep talking about that not too hot not too cold just about right and most investors understand this at this point you know this isn't like ... there's nothing is being to Richard too thin um in in investing you don't want to be too hot or too cold\nAnd and we're seeing that all as it relates to the economic data as well and what we saw was uh we got two big reports for inflation for September inflation it was reported both at the producer and the consumer level at the producer level core prices were up point two percent ... over a month and two and a half percent year over year\nThat's certainly within target growth consumer prices as measured by CPI there were a point one percent Mondo Vermont below target and to point two percent year over year at the core level core means excluding food and energy\nOn that reflects a deep celebration from August level if anything what this does is it further ah goes after whether or not the fad or should continue to raise rates because if inflation isn't high enough they shouldn't keep raising rates to we ambitious lay it certainly\nFeels more of the president's ah anti rate hike rhetoric at this point but I Would argue that both of those readings are right on target and\nYou know the market continues to take a in inflation continues to rise at very much at the rate that the fed would like to see it'd be going at the other keen a number that we got was initial jobless claims came in at two hundred and fourteen thousand\nAgain ridiculously low number we're talking about you know forty fifty year lows as far as how many people are applying for first time unemployment benefits at this point and that in spite of the impact of Hurricane Florence not Michael
