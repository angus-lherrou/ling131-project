and sure enough it was um you know they dropped\n... in total a couple of weeks ago between four and five and a half percent depending on which index we're looking at you know this week of course this past week was much better uh\nUp until the middle of the week we had generated gains of say one to one and a half percent of it does essentially evaporated on Thursday or so as of now you know what we're looking at is I'm a ... a market that essentially was flat as you relate to beginning to end of the women when all was said and done\nBut it's really important to remember that us stock indices before all this activity occurred you know two weeks ago gaining of October ... they were at or near all time highs at you know at the beginning of this month rent that's just like a couple of weeks ago\nA year to date us indices are up three to nine percent excluding dividends and five to ten percent including the impact of it and so you know a lot of people will say hey five to ten percent isn't so bad\nIn spite of all that we've gone through over the last couple of weeks the market being up that much when you think about how much the market's up last year as well sure\nOverall we're still up this past week looked like it was going to be better and then turn a little disappointing but overall I at least the bleeding stopped\nTo some degree and what about international stocks you know they they followed us stocks actually a little bit worse they were down slightly this week they're down and this is a huge disparity as I've said us stocks year to date\nAre up between five and ten percent or international stocks now are down\nTen percent excluding dividends at eight percent including David as you are to date so big difference between being up five to ten percent us\nVersus being down call it a eight percent for international stocks big disparity between the you know international prospects or at least international performance and us performance year to date to this point\nAnd what about the bond market started with the U.S you know believe it or not they were relatively flat in spite of all this stuff uh the tenure us\nTreasury yields right around three point one six percent the two years later on two point eight six percent you're right there's not a lot of difference between those two right the spread is very very small only thirty basis points or point three percent between a two year and a ten year okay so it's pretty flat curve is what I'm trying to say they're\nThe probability of a short term rate increased by the fed is now eighty percent over eighty percent of our force rate increase of the year in December\nOr we're going to likely end up overnight lending rates at between ... to point two five and two point five percent I'm going to talk more about the fed and just a man it's all come back to that another thing though if she just invest in treasuries and\nHigh quality us corporate ... in the U.S um you would have lost two point two percent year to date\nAnd that includes the the positive impact of any dividends or earnings associated with those bonds\nAre so why is that important you know the aggregate bond index for the u._s. hasn't lost ... only lost money one time in the last ten years that wasn't twenty Thirteen and obviously needs to be in a period when interest rates are rising the certainly could portend\nYou know more losses if you think that interest rates are going to continue to rise for a while certainly in the intermediate long term space at least\nOne of our oil prices history of it they were flat to Kenny um you know west Texas is around Seventy one dollars a barrel Brent surround eighty one dollars a barrel we had what third or fourth week in a row or crude oil and the doors and the U.S\nIncreased uh by another six and a half\nMillion barrels were now only nine percent below the level we were last year at the same time as far as inventories are concerned\nAnd you know as I said this is important because this is putting downward pressure on oil prices at this point certainly in the United states and\nIt's not a surprise because you think about ... you know between Seventy and eighty bucks a barrel they can make money certainly at that ... ... and especially with the prospects of perhaps around some other places\nThe impact of sanctions on them really decreasing how much supplied they're going to push into the oil pipeline makes a lot of sense for the U. S. crackers to say time to turn on or turn on the ... make some money and that's what they're doing\nAs far as economic data is concerned kind of a quiet week but it was climbing donors you wanted to let us know about\nWell yeah I mean probably there were some that were a little concerning you know what have we been saying pretty universally for the last certainly six to ten months maintenance and\nThings are cooked yeah the economy's good economy strong you almost can't find Miami indicator that that doesn't reflect either goldie ... type situation which means not too hot not too cold just about right\nOr or or other situations where you're seeing substantially you know good numbers and\nThis week we had a couple of numbers that were a little bit on the edge and I wanted to talk about that so first a retail sales they kind of flat lined at the headline level in September a lot of people pay attention to retail sales because retail sales are good proxy for what consumption is going to be\nSense consumption represents I don't know Seventy percent of GDP in the U.S you know if if consumption is down that means GDP Growth could be down so that's why a lot of people look at retail sales\nBut if you look a further under the covers there and you look specifically at the the metrics that Dr personal consumption\nOr your those actually rose point five percent month over a month so even though at the headline level which includes you know gasoline and you know food and all this other stuff if you look at some of the more personal consumption expenditures those rows very nicely and on an annual basis\nSales are up just around five percent so even though it's not great at it the question is is it going to portend slowing court consumer activity and all I can say he was the next few readings are going to be very important because when you have something like this\nYou know one data point does not make a trend right and we certainly have seen a number of other indicators that for one month\nThere was a slide and then boy it more than recovered the next month so I I Would say it's too early to be nervous about retail sales with one data point in\nAnd industrial production yeah manufacturing industrial production all of that those came out actually quite good I'm Nat nationwide industrial production rose healthy point three percent a month over a month in September and manufacturing activity was up a similar level but here's even the more a leading indicator\nWe we get these regional reports from New York and from the Philadelphia fat and so forth and those for October\nWere very strong um for both of those regions so not only did we have good numbers uh and solid numbers for September on a nationwide basis but actually at the regional level on the newest readings we're getting does continue to be not just good but very good\nRight and we're continuing to see some slow numbers and the housing starts area yeah it's\nA little soft and again it's it's ... ... I'm not really concerned about it I I'm I'm actually comfortable\nThat housing starts are right around one point two million and you know the the the degradation is between one point two and one point three million to a lot of people make all meet a lot to me and on macro basis I'm not disappointed at one point two million housing starts on an annual ... basis\nThe thing is they ... it looks like they may have peaked around march of this year and they've been somewhat disappointing starting in June\nAnd part of that by the way has to do with just the costs the underlying costs of some of these things including the cost of lumber and labor and everything else and the question is are homebuilders actually slowing down and you can tell that because building permits fell slightly in September as well um but\nYou know overall I Would say housing numbers are a little soft but at least from my perspective not cause for serious concern at this point\nProbably come back we'll cover a couple of more data points but we really want to talk about two three corporate earnings were getting a better look at some of those earnings and what does that mean for investors that's when we return to plan strong financial for\nThis is Paul Parsons president of plans drawing investment management and you're listening to plan strong financial forum\nIf you like what you hear on our show and what they need to take a look at your investments in retirement plan called my office in eighty nine seven two seven five to six eight eight nine seven two seven five to six that's eight eight eight nine seven to plant\nSecurities and advisory services offer through commonwealth of\nRegistered investment advisor\nImagine if you could contribute much more of your four one K.

actually hit their revenue targets and actually had positive rather a revenue growth not this time at revenues actually declined to present\nA that's not good news the stock was down almost eight percent on the news and I would call them more of the traditional economy compare that to Netflix\nNetflix at an absolutely blowout quarter and it showed in earnings growth would earnings exceeding expectations by thirty one percent they added almost seven million new subscribers is that mind boggling\nWith most of those coming from international markets\nAnd they're projecting adding another almost ten million subscribers in Cuba for these are just huge numbers of paying customers to them shares were up Fifteen Percent on the news that's what we call a good day\nAnd there were up to eighty percent year to date on as consumers literally continue to cut the cord with traditional TV providers\nOne other thing I wanted to mention about Netflix and this whole cord cutting thing and this mega trend that you and I've been talking about well a couple of years now\nAh and and certainly Netflix being a fantastic way to take advantage of that one research group projects that more than sixty percent of the U.S population will be using what are called over the top services like YouTube or Netflix or Amazon or who or HBO Now by the end of the year that's\nUp three percent from a year earlier that's that's an awful lot of the United states population when you think of our county right and here's the deal Reed Hastings is the c._e._o. of Netflix came out this week and he said you know the future of of\nOf TV and specifically kind of the network TV they believable mainly be live news and live sports and almost everything else is going to get pushed to these over the top solutions my Netflix and and so forth so investors that's something they really need to pay attention to absolutely right Kennedy\nAll when we return we're going to talk a little bit about annuities you have an interesting case that you handle recently that he wants to discuss so folks who have annuities are thinking about annuities they want to pay particular attention when we returned his plans

eight eight eight nine seven to plant we can go online to plan strong dot com one word plan strong dot com\nIt's so for those who are just joining us a ... and we're into our third segment of the show already just flies by sometimes and certainly today is one of those days\nSome of the stuff that Kenny and I've talked about so far\nI'm probably some of the most important things are the economic data continues to be good but there are a couple of data points that we continue to kind of keep our eye on retail sales is one and and probably the other big thing that we're looking at is housing and we've talked about kind of the softer housing market and whether or not that's a big implications for the economy\nBut other than that we're seeing good economic data come out and then the other thing we talked about were corporate earnings and corporate earnings you know we only have ten percent of the rings in for two three so far but we said they better be good because if they're not good this market is based on good corporate earnings and go to corporate earnings expectations\nAnd we are ... you know the market is delivering these companies are delivering to great degree and one of my favorite stories is a mega trend type story within those because as you know at plants drawn we invest\nUp to some degree based on mega trends in one of the mega trends we've been talking about for quite some time has been this move of cord cutting and\nCompanies like Netflix really changing the way dinosaurs like you and I\nI'm actually die in digest\nOur entertainment and more and more of of America now almost two thirds of America is digesting some of their entertainment through these set top boxes the over the top notches through cable anymore but through other means whether it's Netflix or Hulu or anything else\nAnd you better or recognize that it's coming because if you don't you're going to get run over ... as an investor okay\nSo moving on we talked about annuities earlier in the program and many programs in the last six months or so you mentioned an interesting case he handled recently that involved annuities want what can you tell us about that before I Do that can I just talk about your beard for one more to love my beer is on ... this is\nMy third third time I've talked about us in the last three weeks I can take it though because it's like\n... I mean it ... it's a little wider that I had hoped it\nI Know if it's and it's like really full beard yeah yeah and see what two more weeks yeah because it has to come up before my daughter's wedding but it's for your your\nRole as ... as King Henry the second engine this as I said you last week 'cause you're only time ever to became a hit and I'm playing it up boy I Would\nTell you and I were the crown on a house\nLike this I practiced magical million ... dollars anyway well I'm as I've said many weeks now in a row of beer and highly impressed I Wish our radio listeners could actually see it because it is it's overwhelming sure of tall skinny Santa Claus and yeah that's true\nThat's true but anyway okay so back to ... and then I Do on a by the way I Want to talk about my tortoise problem but that was talking about that and kill other issue yes okay um so let's talk about annuities as you said you know we get approached quite a bit uh by people who come to us now that we've talked a lot about annuities and they've said\nYou know either hey would you take a look at our overall portfolio or would you take a look at some of the annuities that either already own or I'm considering buying [noise] because you know some of these claims almost seemed too good to be true but they\nWere they check all the boxes for me what am I missing yeah and so a shirt off this past week we had a very interesting situation where we were talking to a new client who is concerned about out living uh they're fun\nUm and here's the deal this is not uncommon ah the the wife is Seventy while her spouse to significantly older\nAnd they have no children are direct families so what they want to do is to be sure that they can take care of themselves through retirement because there's no family there to be a like a financial backstop right I'm right and\nSo one of the things they were considering doing was they were considering buying a deferred fixed annuity to supplement her income are at around that time when her husband might pass away let me explain to what this means they're going along you're retired\nYou uh the the wife is Seventy the husbands say eighty okay maybe I he thinks I'm five or ten years to go but at some point\nI'm not going to be or any law or the probabilities sorry I'm not going to be here any longer and right now my wife and I we ... we collect one and a half times my usual Social Security check when\nI pass away my wife's going to get the survivor benefit it's no longer and it'd be one and a half times my benefit it's going to be one time my so we're going to be missing you know pick a number Fifteen thousand dollars a year twenty thousand dollars a year\nI'm for income because of Social Security and the question is well how do we make up for that how can we be sure\nThat you know when I get if you will or my wife gets that quote unquote pay caught my demise how do we make sure that that can be replaced and one way to do that as a thing called the deferred\nFixed annuity what does it differed fixed into what he means it means you buy it now but it doesn't start paying you until later so as the payments are deferred it's a fixed annuity because it pays you a fixed amount for the rest of whoever the newer tense life is OK\nSo deferred fixed annuity ... okay and that differed fixed annuity would make up for the portion of Social Security that the spouse would lose when the husband passed so so far so good right now okay well Hillary here the particulars", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The PlanStrong Financial Forum", "city": "Boston", "day": "20"}
