I decided to read the link the story about the uh\nThe Harvard admissions controversy Harvard's admission process once secret is unveiled and affirmative action trout they're introducing one uh one guy named sang cute yeah he's a senior\nIn the eye and they're saying we don't discriminate against all Asian seems to be out in the middle east right he has only meddling test scores but was admitted to the college by showing a strong work ethic and infectious Lee happy personality\nI could've sworn I had a an infectious lay happy personality and have a strong work ethic very fake\nSo\nMr Fitz ... she's the uh he's the Seventy year uh Seventy something admissions director\nUh he quoted in admissions interviewer saying what was most striking about Mr de ... was his fund casual nature fun casual nature oh these dog whistles fun casual it sounds like us it sounds like a a you know Chili's restaurant doesn't do\nChilies is a fun casual restaurant and the thing the way up as a fun casual guy\nBut an impressive understated maturity so I kept reading this fascinated as I said there's something I'm missing here why why if they let thing the the up and you know when he has lousy ... the mediocre scores in you know he's getting into had all these agents that are getting perfect scores and everything else\nIn summing up Mr de ... personal essay one reviewer highlighted his immigrant Vietnamese identity and said that Mr de\nUp was here it comes grappling with\nSexual either go [laughter] of data bang bang bang bang so I saw this is why I say why didn't I think of that in Nineteen sixty eight when I was applying the Harvard University that I was grappling with my sexual identity not that I was rapidly whether you understand but why didn't I just think of something like that\nSo but here is infectious happy personality are they saying that he has a a gay personality\nHe's funding casual so fun cases fund casual nature of these are old dog whistles yeah this is just this is just such B. S. I mean I again\nThere's there's so many stories that need to have be getting more attention than they are getting and this and this is one of a bright here you know that they all these scams but but I'm putting this out for for all of all of my fellow\nWhite people and all of my fellow Asians cause I consider myself an honorary Asian if you want to get into Harvard just write the just mentioned in your S. S. say that you are grappling with your sexual identity so there when they see you tried to pick up ...\nYou know when you're in the yard and you know once uh once orientation is out of the way they just say well I ... I was grappling with it but\nI have grappled with it long enough to know I'm a heterosexual after all\nJust get once you get inside once you get into Harvard it doesn't really matter you know 'cause they got no one wants to add a harbor I've never run it that some people drop out like soccer burger Bill Gates but nobody ever wants out of Harvard I and I have to\nTell me if I'm wrong I don't I've never known anyone who walked out of Harvard for worst case scenario they put you on the six or seven year plan\nRight right or they yeah they tell you to come back in the year ... year off and then died since everybody at Harvard is rich you know doesn't matter you know just go in the you know do something to do something fun goes tend bar ... [noise]\nSo remember this river these words if you want to get into Harvard you happen to be white or Asian grappling with sexual identity the those are the magic word somehow a car [noise]\nWith fall among us into days getting shorter a good night's sleep is more important than ever do what I did get a my pillow I have been getting the best night's sleep with my life\nAnd I can't thank the inventor of my fellow Mike Glendale enough one more reason to thank them he's giving double your listeners is best offer yet buy one get one free is back don't delay order now\nCall one eight hundred nine seven two twenty three sixteen or go to my fellow dot com and use the coal W.

solutions it's not that they're not a good solution it in certain circumstances is that they're way over prescribed and and and there's a real obvious reason why that's the case and I want to talk about\nHow right so it's coming up later in the program course papers available free of charge up to our listeners it's a paper that you write for your client's first and foremost houses are clients get it you are for it to our radio audience we appreciate\nThat sort of the equity markets stock markets fall a rough week kind of a rough month what's happening you know what I\nThink I think that the red Sox are a contrary indicator for the strength of the u._s. stock or not okay because it was a bad week and there's just no other way to put it for us stocks this past week there were down essentially four to five percent this week\nI and you know it's it's been a rough market really starting since the beginning of October so this entire month\nKnow what twenty five days or so\nWe have seen really a rough go and and the market overall has been down call it you know nine to twelve percent during that period of time that's just stunning yeah you know in one month is actually\nAll three indices are in correction territory in just in the month of October around ... ten percent ten percent of the opposition official correct it is and you know but\nThe other thing you have to keep in mind and I always it's so important to whenever we talk statistics whenever we talk business stories\nYou have to keep it in context and the question is well what does the market do up until then\nAnd the answer was the market was already up substantially at\nThat point you know essentially up ten to Fifteen Percent year to date during the same period of time so year to date\nYou know the u._s. stock market even excluding dividends is still either slightly op or up um you know call a two percent kind of zero to two percent year to date has so let me say it another way it gave up all the gains of the year\n... from where we are right now based on what's happened in October but uh you know I'm going to talk a\nBit about kind of the outlook\nFor the economy which is incredibly important I'm going to talk about\nEarnings which is incredibly important as well and frankly I look at all of this and and really where I'm going with this is a you know I think this was a natural pause and almost a natural kind of\nCollect your brass kind of moment for the markets I don't see a real fundamental problem underneath this that would\nThat I Would say you know this was the beginning of the end of this ... stock market an end you know something we mentioned I don't know it was last week or two weeks ago ... to\nUm censor this a bowl stock markets started on march in March of two thousand nine I've forgotten the number of times in the markets down five percent or more but it's something like Seventeen times and each of those Seventeen times people said this is the beginning of the absolutely and\nWe talked about on this program going back to ... uh two thousand ten eleven back\nUp and guess what Seventeen times in a row they weren't right try okay so you know take a breath or take a look and look at the underlying fundamentals\nAnd I think what you're going to hear from me is that still most of the underlying fundamentals are actually quite strong and and uh to that end I should we should probably talk about you know some of those ... those are reports that we got from the government\nOr this week and why don't we just go right to that\nYeah and and obviously the marquee report of the week was the first estimate of killed three GDP so period from July first to September thirtieth um cubes three GDP you know don't forget\nA cute to GDP grew four point two percent you knew that was unbelievably to jump right so what did we expect for two three four and a three point three three point four percent was I was kind of the expectation\nOf the ... the consensus of the expectations were I had you know it recently\nAnd the actual two three GDP report came in at three point five percent so slightly beat that was actually a good number and more importantly there was nothing underneath nice that they made it look like it was an artificial three point five percent was ... you know consumption went up substantially and consumption is a huge part\nOf our GDP gross so first of all GDP Growth was very strong in Cuba three and now it looks like we will have a a GDP Growth for the whole year of twenty Eighteen in excess of three percent\nThat's the first time since two thousand five five that we've seen a GDP for a a full calendar year start with a three year batter okay so ... in in a way Trump kind of came through with what he said he was going to come through with\n'em so that's the good news the other really important part of this report Kenny how to do with inflation at the same time\nAnd you you know how inflation so important 'cause if inflation starts to kick up a bit what's the fed going to do they're going to raise raise right they're going to raise rates and they're going to make it more difficult for people to borrow and sure enough what we saw as it related to the price index with in\nThe GDP report ... actually only increased one point six percent on an annual eyes basis that's actually bolo target of two percent and it's below what last quarters inflation came out asked\nSo overall you know I Would say this was a very good report now mind you it's a trailing indicator it's a trailing indicator because you're measuring what happened in the past\nAnd you're measuring and again it's a first blush measurements the first estimate but you're you're estimating how fast the economy was growing over the prior Ninety Days and the answer was it was ...\nOkay and better yet it was growing pretty fast but not stoking a lot of inflation so it's I I Would look at this very much as a kind of a Goldilocks report a really good report are really important report as it relates that\nI'm supporting a market valuations with where we are today\nAnd you mentioned the GDP is a trailing indicator but we we get some leading indicators coming in with some data this week to\nAnd see that those are incredibly important leading indicators are the best indicator is for us to look forward and say okay I get that's where we were but where are we going on this thing\nAnd you know a couple of the the best leading indicators actually came out this week starting with ... composites ... pm I as an acronym for purchasing managers index\nIt's it's a centrally all the purchasing managers are in the big companies are in the United states\nThey they have a survey of them and they take a look at both\nUh services activity as well as manufacturing\nActivity those are the two big segments of activity in the United states ... activity in the U.S\nAnd guess what both levels are quite healthy and both were improved over last month so I Would say that's a really good indicator again not they weren't smoking hot\nBut they were really solidly warm and and I would put them very much in the sustainable strong category so very very good number there\nAnd then on the other big a forward looking an indicator is durable goods and you know think of this it's airplanes and um you know machinery for plants and you know big things that last a long time durable goods orders\nWere also a up there they were mixed they didn't show accelerating growth but the key is that their year over year growth is at eight percent overall and six percent X transportation that's a very healthy growth for durable goods orders\nAnd all of this you know really shows solid evidence of the strength of of kind of the nation's economy both a factory side in the service aside very very good news there on on all looking forward\nBasis and we continue to have the lowest unemployment in thirty forty fifty years here\nAbsolutely including initial jobless claims that came out this week and they came in at two hundred and Fifteen thousand after two hundred and ten thousand last week\nThat is just be these numbers are absurdly low they're forty fifty year old as low as they are just incredible and we did get a kind of a downer reporting on housing new home sales actually\nYou know if there was one area and I've said this you know there are many many weeks in a row now if there's one area of the economy that really has not been kicking in nearly as much as some of the other areas it's housing\nAnd there were two reports related to housing released this week one was new home sales so these are new homes that are built and then they're sold\nDe de celebrated in September to a level of about five hundred and fifty thousand that's down from about August level of about six hundred and thirty thousand that's you know that's a big craze and more importantly this is another indicator of you know just kind of a slowing a de feller rating of these\nUm you know when you think when you look at the grass\nA new ... new home sales are really good momentum increasing the overall level from the beginning of say twenty sixteen and they kind of Pete until maybe march of this year\nAnd there was one soft spot in the summer twenty something she but most of the time you're just a beginning a twenty sixteen kind of all the way up till march or twenty Eighteen men were they looking good these sound rated since then and so yeah it's it's you know that's certainly one concern but you know\nCountering us um is that there was a pending\nHome sales index so these are all homes that are about to be sold not just new homes\nPending hit home sales in next that pointed actually just strength for the next existing home sales report due next month so overall kind of a mixed bag for housing on the on the new home sales it down\nBut pending home sales is looking pretty good for next month kind of a mixed report there\nIt this is not a this none of this a scientific you know what you're trying to do is identify what you think is going to happen in the marketplace but think about this Wake County we started this year the first two or four weeks of the year\nThe market was up you know eight eight and a half percent then it then I had a correction then worked its way all the way back up to those ... and got up to say ten or eleven or twelve for sat\nAnd now we've had another correction you know my\nPersonal take is that the market is going to likely kind of finish up and that kind of the ten percent gain area how we've had a couple of healthy corrections each time with you know making sure that the underlying earnings growth really is there\nThat the uncertainty that kind of creeps into the picture gets dispersed and then people say\nOkay I'm okay with you know bidding up the prices a little bit right now valuations are quite reasonable ah ... you know we're trading at Fifteen point nine times forward earnings and the U.S and the five hundred that's actually below the five year average\nAt this point so you know valuation seem reasonable and as you'll hear from me in a minute earnings are quite good and you know earnings are what will drive or not drive stock prices up\nA and what we've seen is stock prices are up because corporate earnings have been very good last year and a very good this year\nAnd frankly we expect them to be good again next year\nBut back to what you would asked about what's happening you know kind of going forward\nTo that the chief investment officer of our broker dealer commonwealth financial network weighed in on the state of the U.S equity markets this week and he said he's maintaining a target of three thousand ... five hundred right now that's up eleven or twelve percent from where it is today okay and at the same time he said look\nThere are some downside risks and some of them have increased most notably rising interest rates\nBut and of course that's because as interest rates rise historically stock values can decrease depending on how high those interest rates go but in the end\nHe's heartened by three things first corporate buybacks ... companies can't and don't do corporate buybacks right before earnings season\nAnd that's going to resume after earning season finishes up so when companies that had suspended they're buying start buying their own stock again going to drive the price of those stocks up\nAnother thing that's an uncertainty out there that we've talked about a little bit is the mid term elections right and again one way or another that's going to get resolved in the next couple of weeks\nBut I Will tell you that he sees too probable outcomes of the elections either a continuation of Republican controlled Congress or a divided government he does not see the probability of a full blue you know house and sat him so if that's the case\nAt worst it means kind of nothing happens and at best it means maybe another tax cut\nSo neither of those is terribly negative and then the third thing is the tech sector that you know the tech sector represents over twenty percent of the U.S in the five hundred and ... if the earnings with the tech sector continue to come through strong\nThen that could yet again lead the broader stock market so\nThose three things are really reasons that he thinks\nThat you know there's still room for us to be relatively hopeful that we kind of get back to where we were close to three thousand on yes in the um by the end of the year\nAnd when we come back we'll talk about the election a little bit more we can have to go what it means for the markets what we should look out for women returns glass on financial forum\nThis

coming up and just a week and a half before we get to that we've been talking about your new paper and uh even talking about a new disease many times over the last several years and the show right so you mentioned this particular new paper what what can you\nAbout well you're right I have talked about annuities for quite a while and I think it's it's something that\nSo many of our listeners may not be aware of and and that's because\nYou know I host this year when I host this radio show on investing but we're just one of many financial professionals who actually advertise on the radio do these shows we have a rare advertisements and so forth and [noise] you know what's interesting is I I listen to the radio a lot so I listen to everybody's at ...\nAnd you know there's this ...\nA lot of ads that kind of cut cheap he'd be getting repeated and after a while I Wonder if I was somebody who didn't really understand investing in investments how would I pick\nYou know who to higher higher how would they pick somebody to you know say okay that's the guy or gal that I'd like to talk to about potentially taking care of me and my financial circumstance\nAnd here's the thing that really bothers me there is a dirty little secret in our business that so few people really get and that's part of why I wrote this paper and the secrets this many of the financial ... professionals who advertise on the radio in the Boston area\nThey're just insurance salesman selling annuities that's what it is okay and while some annuities have some attractive features they're often not the best solution for the investor\nAnd that's really what got me to write this paper five things you must know about annuities and ... starting with how can you even identify who is selling annuities how how do you save\nYourself from the call 'em and and I'll tell you there are some code words your coat phrases for annuities that investors long here and there are ... and buy these and it's things like safe money don't lose your money lifetime income tax\nEfficient guaranteed for life all those things don't they sound for a short guaranteed as good we're down to ... but\nAt the same time well almost all of these circumstances are cold phrases for war selling you annuities they know I have never\nHeard that mentioned annuities by name and their advertisements and I think that's because many annuities have earned an undesirable reputation in the investment community and you know I explain why that's the case in this paper\nYou know in the end this paper is intended to provide a basic understanding of annuities and frankly to decode the sales pitch\nThat used to sell them and you know while on a fee based advisor and I typically use stocks bonds mutual funds each he asked\nUm I'm also license to sell annuities\nBut while I'm able to I very rarely used them and and really the purpose of the whole papers to explain why not and in my opinion\nIs in many circumstances there is a better solution that is very much in the best interest of the client rather than the best interest\nOf the person selling you knew what he who can make a big fat commission from that\nSo I talk about a number of things in the paper Kenny I talk about kind of traditional advantages and disadvantages of annuities and many people know a bunch of these things you know things like you know the advantages include tax the for all and you get a guaranteed pay out and you have some protection\nBut on the disadvantages side you know you talk about how the in some cases they're very costly from a taxation perspective they are not ideal you know kind of those things those are very typical but the five things you must know go way beyond that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The PlanStrong
