National Guard brought in by the governor instead of the president at each state\nIn other words uh is their constitutional justification to use the military as commander in chief up to deal with the problem of uh seven thousand people trying to cross the border\nWhy are you at the code ah eight\nA five and I I I think that that you could say that this was an overwhelming force I mean we're not talking about a hundred people that want to cross the Texas border or something like that\nGreg Abbott the governor there than the national guard were talking about for ... fourteen thousand that continues to grow I mean\nSince from one day a has a knack for it now to fourteen thousand a growing so I think you get to some point where it's more like an invasion or maybe they don't die and us any harm but remember\nAh we've seen video today\nAh ah you know one group or taking an American flag painting a swastika on it and the burning the fire and then uh the same boat actually caring\nOr the ... what am I what I mean these people are coming to seek asylum so to speak which by the way it is another issue would go into because it's not appropriate to have a trial for the situation\nAh but they're asking for asylum and a nation where they hate that nation's flag and they're airing their own way you could call that a a an external invasion of the country well airport appropriate for the commander in chief to use the military\nBut we have we have a precedent here as I said a nine times more people were in the Mariel boatlift as here and the commander in chief\nBasically didn't stop them at the border and then when they got a reason I'd let them in because it was an overwhelming number a hundred and twenty five thousand people maybe more but the the point was there was no use of the military there they were allowed to enter the country in a chaotic fashion\nAnd actually as I said there were more than six hundred homicides in Nineteen eighty one after they got here in Nineteen eighty\nIn other words there are there is a precedent which was far more onerous than this where the military was not used and I'm not defending it I think we should use the military I'm just saying\nThat was a case where we did not use the military uh and maybe it was because quarter believe that this military should not be used for this kind of circumstance defending the border when we're supposed to be having the military go overseas\nWell you know one of the signature a point that from a campaign Don Was closing the border and reforming immigration or what he wanted to do things like eliminate chain migration the lottery change you know the\nMigration lottery system you have that precedent but also um\nOr you have that at least ... a building you know\nProviding a foundation for this decision but also there is no precedent that whole\nYou know legal precedent the horses hall isn't Supreme Court\nWhere you follow precedent but even the spring cork and overturn a precedent if they think there's enough evidence\nAnd he could make an easy case I think that you have to take action that it's overwhelming and you know what I suppose\nOr the entire fourteen thousand decide to come over a through San Diego border area ah you could say that a California being a thanks very state what prevent them from coming in\nWell look the ... then then it comes down to states rights versus federal\nAnd immigration is a power that exists in the federal government that does not exist in the states we've been to new ... about the states doing the sanctuary business\nAnd I I my opinions that Jeff Sessions I Know he's called a couple of lawsuits but that's taking ... to get done the fact of the matter is that the states don't have the authority and no matter what these local federal judges are saying in Seattle or San Francisco or Hawaii um\nI Would venture to say that in California and and the Washington state pot is legal recreational use the judge was probably used it before the right decisions [laughter] yeah\nSo you know and and look what the Supreme Court that reverse all that nonsense about stopping the president's from stopping immigration from six countries if you will\nSo I ... the ... their records that will say some of them will say anything the real point is um ... in the judicial sense what is the Supreme Court say um and I would I Would give venture to say\nThe president has the authority to do emergency actions\nThat would protect the country from its own overthrow you know when they did this edition decisions in the late teens during World War one of the court basically said if somebody is out there by themselves are protesting and he says I'm going to\nAh bring down this country with violent revolution\nAnd he's got a water pistol in his hand um the basically the court would say you know you can't stop 'em maybe there's never an actual practical ability to do what he said but in this case you have\nWhat seven thousand people maybe fourteen thousand people now who actually could cause harm to the country and maybe I Would argue that the Mariel boatlift was an example of what we should not do in the future\nBecause of the chaos that it created and the deaths that it caused we should be doing something to protect this country from that kind of harm and uh I Would argue that presidents should have the authority to bring in the military to do exactly that\nBut you also your organization points out the danger here or that there is potential fraud which means the other states and implemented the same thing might also have problems or potential fraud how serious is this problem\nWell it's an exceptionally serious problem Mike anti and let's hit on a few points with that first of all it's a bit more nuanced in terms of elections you're right that the constitution\nPlaces the primary\nResponsibility for elections for the machinery of democracy\nOn election day in the hands of the states typically under an elected statewide secretary of state in under a local election officials as well but at the same time you also have the election\nClause of the U.S constitution which empowers Congress to make laws regarding the time and place or manner of elections for federal office you also have a fifteenth amendment that makes it a a unconstitutional\nOr to impair voting on the basis of race the nineteenth amendment with respect to biological sex the fourteenth amendment with respect to equal protection and then you have a number of laws like the very powerful voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five\nPredicated upon those constitutional authority since so you have these two separate levels\nOf government state and federal that engage on this on this profoundly important issue now what you saw in North\nBut how how the election is O'Hare eat out for example um what kind of machines are used in a state even for federal elections or whether whether a state for whatever reason might want to use the Internet voting another state might want to use it\nFor ... right I Know I I Would interject with editorials I'm sure you agree\nAnd I do agree but my only point as the ... states decide the mechanism by which the votes are taken\nA vast right though of course Congress under the elections clause Congress has the authority to say you can't use Internet voting for federal officers\nYou kept that's a that's a long day for Congress what's that say again that's not law today as far as I Know\nIf that's correct comes as no such law today\nThe thing is that they do have a constitutional mandate to be able to address those things\nAnd do but but you're you're an initial point is absolutely correct and it's a critical aspect of federalism under the tenth amendment and this constitution is that the states are the laboratories of democracy under our constitution and so they have extraordinary latitude in in how far they can go on these things now what we saw\nIn terms of where the process goes or why we saw in the case as you mentioned with North Carolina where in twenty Thirteen\nYou had a Republican governor\nWho inactive this legislation with voter ID laws and other provisions to safeguard the integrity of the ballot box\nIt gets challenged it goes into federal court it goes up on appeal to the U.S court of appeals for the fourth circuit which covers the mid Atlantic region which I mean we we all ... a lot of people on the right to speak about the Ninth Circuit kind of as a by word\nThe reality is until President Trump got some nominees to it the fourth circuit was the most liberal federal\nAppeals court in the nation even to the left of the Ninth Circuit and when they got to hold up north Carolina's voter id law\nThat's why they struck it down and in fact there are still aspects of those ...\nThat are enforced today right now the fourth circuit is a very very difficult area so you're talking\nVirginia West Virginia Maryland and north and South Carolina very hard to have even commonsense measures to protect the integrity of the ballot box and this is where elections have consequences the reality is that they're under nine Supreme Court\n... says you have a hundred and Seventy nine judges on the U.S court of appeals to have a a around seven hundred federal district judge has its in those courts of appeals like the fourth circuit where if you just have judges\nThat give the plane the public meaning of all those constitutional guarantees and all of those federal statutory provisions there's nothing in the U.S constitution or federal law\nThat says the state cannot enact the common sense measure up saying\nBefore you can cast a ballot one that can change the outcome of no watching it in my state of Virginia there was a legislative race that was that that was a centrally tied it was decided by a single vote one vote\nWas the difference in terms of which not trust which a party won that district\nBut in an evenly decided legislature that one vote decide which party had with George ... control of that chamber\nOf the Virginia legislature when you're talking about one vote margins in the state legislative race or even state wide five hundred and twenty seven votes out of millions and millions in the state of Florida for the presidency of the United states in two thousand when those are the stakes involved\nAnd the state says before you can cast a ballot\nThat can change the course of the state or this nation\nWe just want to have reason to believe that you are the person that you claim to be\nAnd so government issued id and you know what if you can't afford it will give it to you for free\nRight what was that was a mechanism to make sure that even if you can't afford a six dollar processing the we promise you weren't going to get it to you so that you can participate in election day when there is nothing in the constitution or a federal law\nThat says that the state can't adopt such a common bond measure but when two to three charges on end up on a panel of a federal appeals court said that said that you can't\nIt shuts down that safeguard in then you get messages like you have\nIn ... in North Carolina right now under attorney general Josh Stein and under governor Roy Cooper who is the Democratic attorney general at the time and refused to even protect but what galaxy of these duly elected laws in his own state\nI mean our we have actually get promoted to the governorship I mean this has got to change\nWe're we're closing have less than a minute the bottom line Ken estate require photo ID yeah under federal decision yes\nConstitutionally yes and the Supreme Court case on point Crawford versus Marion County or out of out of Indiana establishes that as black letter constitutional law\nSo we're we're protected there and they can do that the problem is they don't have to do it or what the what the Supreme Court does give you the bottom line uh gives you the the the basic parameter it but if you allow the sailing yeah because if for example they could say you have to have probable cause to get into\nA vehicle as a cop but a state could say well we want it to be reasonable suspicion so you know a ... that it it's all a or vice versa as the case may be\nAnyway um the states the point is the states have considerable authority and people need to understand that but we need to prepare for this voting and make sure it's protected ... it's a pleasure\nI thank you for the hour we'll buy good to talk to you sir [noise]\nHi I'm Dr building go M.

Cale the voice the\nVoice of Boston\nYou working in one hundred and twenty seven to ... like an HD to Boston and my heart radio station [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nOr the or the known illegal immigrants that are here and the research that they're using when you have that pretty well documented from different sources out who's going to pick up the tab for these fourteen thousand people\nWhile at the look I I could ask you that my experience in Nineteen eighty one and I'll ask you the question who in the blank picks up the tab for a hundred and twenty five thousand Marielitos I mean the the the you know you could go back to that when Jimmy Carter said let 'em in the same kind of pressured different numbers\nBut the same pressure so the fourteen thousand now is peanuts compared to men\nAnd that created a catastrophe in Dade County was the highest homicide rate in Nineteen eighty one on the planet per capita wise highest on the planet of earth period during that year\nAnd it's changed everything dramatically very obviously so I ask you the question um\nDo we want to go through you know since the end and made the comment and those who do not learn from history are condemned by it and when are we going to what are we going to learn from history\nAbsolutely at the very famous book by the way uh I think that the Geraldo Rivera is wrong\nAnd I asked big big time wrong and I will make by protection right now are based on the fact that nobody stopping this caravan as Bob Said by the way this little\nSecondary caravan that are that are coming together and shelling together and getting it out a larger and larger group I think that there's no stopping them Mexican but not stopping them currently\nAnd I think they are going to reach our border and I think that Trump is already prepared to accept that action going to happen this week I Do not think it's going to take\nOriginally the ritual for thousands more time to get here on election day Tuesday November ... I think for obvious political reasons why\nUh but I think this is actually going to happen sooner\nAnd I think it's going to fire in the face of a Democrat and I predicted in my latest ... came out just a few hours ago that this was going to shift the election further toward Republicans going to pick up this this particular event and Trump's reaction to it\nIn my forecast bottle are going to influence for more speed that will go Republican the Republicans would have lost and one more sent it to be\nSo we're talking about four seats in the house and one in the Senate right\nNow I'm\nThe first of all I'm not sure it's a caravan how about calling in a mob\nI think Bob is possibly more appropriate caravan with a while you know the origin of that work out to the original um mediate term was army\nAn army of immigrant and they got so much pushback from the left is that this wasn't treating them ... column and army like more military that you had to come up with another word for the ... came up short caravan so that is a media generated her\nAll right so so let's let's call it the that as it may well I suppose caravan could be cars and vans right I mean\nThere are ours and band they're also flatbed trucks that are carrying you know a hundred people for ...\nWell they can all sit at the border and the Mexican side and enjoy themselves\nThat I [laughter]\nThen then the other question is ah with respect to Honduras El Salvador Guatemala um maybe Nicaragua why or why are these people leaving in other words\nI'm I don't know if there's no proof in any way that George Soros is behind this but it's the type of thing he would do but what about those countries and the instability of those countries is there a legitimacy to that side of it and should we be doing more to strengthen the stability\nOf those Central American countries\nWell I think the ... this particular Bob Let's call it went up Bob\nHas been recruited by the left a and an American organizations on the left and America have basically refer to them in front of me and we we have seen videos of people in this a mob or caravan actually being handed money\nI think they've been paid to go to the U.S their promised a better life and chances are they figure America has a richer country so they'll be better off but I think it was bought purchased organized and managed by the last\nWell you've got as I'm sure you've seen the pictures of the bridge between Mexico and Guatemala right and uh it's just full of people I mean of vehicles wanted across they couldn't do it they're just people all over the place\nIt is it's it's a nightmare\nUh what these left wing groups what what is their objective is to just to turn the United states into a third world country because obviously hypothetically if they got what they wanted this becomes the third world country these people in a trained and skilled\nThe way the president's talking about bringing immigrants in who can contribute to the country they're not teachers they're not doctors engineers\nOr they're not skilled craftsman carpenters electricians masons they're not any of that there are a bunch of people want fortunately have been treated as

National Guard brought in by the governor instead of the president and each state\nIn other words uh is their constitutional justification to use the military as commander in chief of the deal with the problem of uh seven thousand people trying to cross the border by\nA U.S the code ah eight\nA five\nAnd I I think that that you could say that this is an overwhelming force I mean we're not talking about a hundred people that want to cross the Texas border or something like that were\nGreg Abbott the governor there than the national guard were talking about a force that potentially fourteen thousand that continues to grow I mean since from one day to the next to it now to fourteen thousand uh and growing\nSo I think to some point where it's more like an invasion or maybe they don't intend to any harm but remember ah we've seen video today ah ah you know one group\nOr a pig in American flag paying a swastika on it and the burning the flag\nAnd then uh the same folks essentially tearing at the clock Guatemalan flat I mean these people are coming to seek asylum so to speak which by the way is another issue would go into because it's not appropriate to have a dial up for the situation [laughter]\nAh but they're asking for asylum and a nation where they hate that nation's flag and they're carrying their own way you could call that a a an external an invasion of the country well therefore appropriate for the commander in chief to use the military\nBut we ... we have a precedent here as I said a nine times more people were in the Mariel boatlift as here and the commander in chief\nBasically didn't stop them at the border and then when they got a resorted to let them in because it was an overwhelming number a hundred and twenty five thousand people maybe more but the the point was there was no use of the military there they were allowed to enter the country\nIn a chaotic fashion and actually as I said they were more than six hundred homicides in Nineteen eighty one after they got here in Nineteen eighty\nIn other words there are there is a precedent which was far more onerous than this where the military was not used and I'm not defending it I think we should use the military I'm just saying that was a case where we did not use the military\nUh and maybe it was because Carter believed that the military should not be used for this kind of circumstance defending the border when we're supposed to be having the military go overseas\nWell you know one of the thing that you're a point that from a campaign Don Was closing the border and reforming immigration ... they want it to do things like eliminate chain migration the lottery changed you know the migration for the lottery system\nYou have that precedent but also um\nOr you have that at least ... a building you know\nProviding a foundation for this decision but also there is no precedent that whole thing I mean there's no legal precedent that that forces you to haul isn't Supreme Court or you follow precedent but even bringing cork and overturn a precedent if they think there's enough evidence\nAnd he could make an easy case back bay that you have to take action that it's overwhelming and you know what I suppose\nThe entire fourteen thousand decided to come over a through San Diego border area ah you could say that a California being a sanctuary state what prevent them from coming in\nWell and look the ... then then it comes down to the state's rights versus federal\nImmigration is a power that exists in the federal government does not exist in the states we've been to name be pan be about the states doing the sanctuary business\nAnd I I my opinion is that Jeff Sessions I Know he's filed a couple of law suits but that's taking odds noisy him to get done the fact of the matter is that the states don't have the authority and no matter what these local federal judges are saying in Seattle or San Francisco or Hawaii um\nI Would venture to say that in California and and the Washington state pot is legal for recreational use the judge was probably used it before the right decisions [laughter] here\nSo I you know the end and look what the Supreme Court reversed all that nonsense about stopping the president from stopping immigration from six countries if you will\nSo ... the ... their records that will say some of them will say anything the real point is um we're in the judicial says what does the Supreme Court say um and I would I Would give venture to say the president has the authority to do emergency actions that would protect the country\nFrom its own overthrow you know when they did this edition decisions in the late teens\nDuring World War one of the court basically said\nIf somebody is out there by themselves are protesting and he says I'm going to bring down this country with violent revolution and he's got a water pistol in his hand or the basically the court would say you know you can't stop them they'd be there's never ... an actual practical ability to do it he said but in this case you have\nOne seven thousand people maybe fourteen thousand people now who actually could cause harm to the country and maybe I I Would argue that the Mariel boatlift was an example of what we should not do in the future because of\nThe chaos that is created and the deaths that it caused we should be doing something to protect this country from that kind of harm and uh I Would argue the president should have the authority to bring in the military to do exactly that but as far as the state's having sanctuary safe sanctuary cities\nIt just doesn't fly because in the end the Supreme Court would have to ... ... you know with the supremacy clause right and he at the end the constitution", "show_name": "The Mike Siegel
