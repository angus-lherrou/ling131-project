the ultimate huts book and gall because she as Christine Blasey Ford's attorney wants the FBI to interview Dr Ford\nAs part of the investigation\nOf Brett Kavanaugh\nFactor Ford's lawyer says it is inconceivable she would not be included\nAccording to the letter from Deborah cats and Michael Brown which the two attorneys for Dr Ford they set in their letter the following it is inconceivable that the FBI could\nConduct a thorough investigation of back to Ford's allegations without interviewing her judge Kavanaugh or the witnesses we have identified in our letter to you and call\nAnd I were\nShake my head and I say are you kidding that's almost an ethical violation\nFor frivolous activity on the part of those attorneys folks if you remember Dr Ford spent several hours being investigated and being questioned under oath\nBy ms Mitchell\nThe prosecutor of sexual assault cases from Arizona\nAnd that's more than ... not even adequate it's Thoreau everything that could have been asked was asked\nBy ms Mitchell of Dr Ford and then you have judge Kavanaugh who spent several hours in the same way dealing with questions\nFrom the committee Democrats went after him lock stock and barrel\nStarted for the Republicans and then it turned into the Republican members of the committee wanting to question judge Kavanaugh they felt that having these eleven white men\nMiddle aged men in bed questioned the giant Dr Ford would have been\nLooked at by the left wing as overkill of course then the left wing complained that they should have asked the questions themselves and not had the prosecute from Arizona do it a woman who has basically protected victims of sexual assault tour women\nYou would think they would want somebody like that but no not these Democrats they want to have political cover and devious despicable Miss USA and the views of the confirmation process to go after the president and go after the conservatives\nAnd do something that is absolutely heinous and takes the other part of Deborah cats and Michael Brown which the two attorneys for Dr Ford a whole lot of chutzpah\nWell\nWe know as I said that this investigation is about wrapping up could be a vote by friday\n\nAnd I think that\nIt is almost a fictional story that you would have that same movie showing the reprehensible way in which the Democrats have handled this thing the unfairness of it and any one of them put under the same microscope\nWould be found to have had some kind of ... some kind of problem in their lives\nThat would justify there being removed from the Senate if they want to use this kind of standard for removing a nominee from a Supreme Court nomination why should they even be in the set of course the difference is going to be in the arguments going to be that the public votes on them and therefore the public\nOught to have\nThe final say on elected officials and the public thinks that something about a senator is a problem then they could vote against that person but if any one of them were put under the same microscope as judge Kavanaugh how would they come out\nAnd wouldn't it be nice\nTo see what their reaction would be they said the judge was angry why shouldn't they be angry\nHe had a right to be angry\nThis is absolutely nonsensical\nSenator Lindsey Graham who's been the hero for judge Kavanaugh and the United States Senate\n\nSuggested the president\nThat they should re nominate judge Kavanaugh if the Senate fails to confirm him for the Supreme Court\nSenator Graham said that earlier today\nNow as Senator Corker said I mentioned earlier Senator Graham also believes the capital is going to be confirmed to the Supreme Court very soon and they also mentioned Mitch McConnell the majority leader is saying that it that he'll be voted on this week\nBut in case it fell short Graham says he would of course the president three nominate judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\n\nSo the number of Democrats voted a number of people supporting Democrats and their local district has gone down in one month from fifty to to forty nine now when it comes to Republican\nIn this month of October the Republican gets forty two percent generically in their districts across this country forty two percent but in September a month ago\nThe Republican got thirty eight percent so actually numbers have gone up for Republicans and down for Democrats that doesn't even include this past week and the hammering of judge Kavanaugh which I think pretty clearly is going to have a further effect of eroding Democrats support and increasing Republican support\nTo whatever degree you believe this kind of poll is accurate the same poll found most\nVoted for Democrats in charge of the Senate and most disapprove of President Trump's job performance which amazes me because I guess it's because the media don't report on all the things that have been done in this administration that are remarkably good for the American people\nI think that's more about his style and a lot of people find that offensive and so they don't want\nTo have the\nPresident's style supported they reject his style is what they perceived as being has a very abrasive this\nAt this point fifty percent want the Democrats in charge forty three percent of what the Republicans in charge fifty three percent approve of Trump\nForty one percent disapprove he's doing pretty well there and um that's um the latest poll from a Quinnipiac\nAnd according to Tim O'Reilly who's the quarterback university poll assistant director he put out a press release and they said these numbers basically suggest that the so called big blue wave of Democrats support\nMay have lost some of his momentum because the house races are now tightening\nAnd then we are with that so bottom line is that there is an increase in support for Republicans\nOver the last month and a decrease in support for Democrats over the last month and of course next month is what counts and with another month of this ... trail I think frankly if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed\nIt's going to lead to what you want to I Hope a huge energizing of independents and conservatives and Republicans to get out there and vote the ... the I I you know it may be that if\nHe's not confirmed by the by election day you might get more conservatives out there are voting in favor of Republicans if he wins the the the scary part becomes that maybe Republicans\nAnd conservatives and independents who would have voted Republican become less energize because they'll sit home and say well we got judge Kavanaugh that's a good thing so I don't need to vote everything's great whatever they won't be great\nIf you don't get out and vote because um if the Republicans and conservatives and independents who are going to vote Republican don't go out and vote\nYou could see Nancy Pelosi as the next speaker of the house and\nTen times that there were these parties where guys wind up to take advantage of young ladies and she was that those parties never want nobody else knows about it if you're going to tell me that nobody knows about ten parties where women were er or girls under the age of Eighteen were betrayed\nBecause of their uh being maybe ... and therefore these guys took advantage you're out of your mind that nobody else knew about it\nAre you kidding me if that happened it would be all
