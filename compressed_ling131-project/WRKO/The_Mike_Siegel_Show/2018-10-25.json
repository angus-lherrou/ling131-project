Bush Bill Clinton\nBrock Obama burger Obama's senator\nWas one who said we cannot have\nIllegal immigration coming into this country matter of fact the president\nSent out a tweet earlier today\nBased on a statement made by senator bronco bomb at the time\nAnd the prison I agree with the President Obama that statement\nWhich is that it was intolerable\nHave people coming into this country illegally I Wonder if anybody at CNN will ask Obama that question next time he was there\nSee how he justifies\nBecause he point blank took the same position\nAs the president\nBoth of us who believe in having sovereign borders in this country\nLet me give you some thoughts\nAbout how we can deal with this problem\nOf these people heading toward our border\nTo arbitrary and capricious Lee cross it\nGive me a list of ah\nAbout eight ideas that we should pursue\nTightening the standards\nAnd the limited and loopholes in our asylum system\nAnybody can say a mom I'm fearful for my wife I go back to my country\nWell there's gotta be some standard before you just arbitrarily say that\nAnd have a justified\nLegitimacy to your claim\nOr being a person who is facing persecution in your homeland that's number one\nSo what's at tight standards\nFor people who are looking for asylum\nThen when you screened them an interview them you can readily determined in many cases whether they have a legitimate claim\nAnd then secondly how about increasing the threshold standard of proof\nIn terms of the fear interviews\nProve to me that you have a legitimate fear credible fear\nShow me how that's the case\nWhat is it that you fear tangibly\nIs there in a written order out from your country's president\nOr attorney general for your arrest\nBecause you are a dissident disagreeing with their policies what is it that is causing you fear so what's\nBasically increase the standard of proof\nAs to whether you're fear is legitimate\nThan we ought to impose and also enforce\nFor the following\nOr baseless\nOr fraudulent asylum applications have you come to try to come in here with the phony\nApplication for asylum\nFrivolous superficial meaningless fraudulent\nFalse on its face\nNo grounds for you to get the asylum\nHave that standard at this point\nHow about closing loopholes in the law\nSo we bar terrorist aliens from coming into the country and receiving immigration benefits\nFor example ...\nThe woman who with her husband in San Bernardino killed fourteen people\nWe knew she was going to be a terrorist\nAt least we should've known because she was writing on her social media about being in the follower of jihadism\nFollower of extremist groups\nAnd then we can clarify and enhance\nThe legal definition of an aggravated felony\nThat would ensure the criminal aliens\nDo not receive certain immigration benefits\nIt'd be coming here\nIncluding let's say a DUI for example which is a criminal act\nAnd then he was the other major criminal acts then you don't get any benefits here\nOf the enticements to come into this country is getting the benefits\nIf you committed any criminal act and we can document it but you don't get it and you don't get any benefit period\nYeah no I mean we we send a beef\nYou know wait a little bit and they were at me and everything else were imported from China and I don't know about you but and I'm not I'm not certain that protection as another president not but uh\nYeah I think we remember the good days when we can buy American products that lasted ... Chinese products that you know kind of like a an added benefit of these trade deals\nAre but we make more good quality manufacturing ah American manufactured products here but the terrorists are just designed to get the Chinese back to tell because they weren't\nBudging under previous administrations but right now what these tariffs have done to China's disproportionately affect them\nSo that if they tried it you know cold out or they're going to try to keep with the staring contest this game of chicken and ... and ... and these are twenty five percent 'cause right now where we're at ten percent terrorists\nUm if we go up to twenty five percent come January one in China hasn't hasn't budge their economy is going to take a much much much much more significant hit\nAny kind of consumer a feeling that will have here because we've got consumer confidence to all the time either so good great purchasing power here um you know the economy's doing so well where whereas China's not doing as well um that this is really the long game that President Trump is playing and he's really ... when\nYou're on the um ... basically what it's doing is putting the pressure on them and it's creating a free and open marketplace because of\nThe Chinese which is is gonna costs twenty five percent more in January the costs now and all of a sudden here comes ah I don't know let's let's say Sweden would this would this twenty five percent less or we're going to buy the Swedish which is\nYeah and that's going to do yet or the ... you know going to an ally that's not stealing stuff\nWell exactly so uh so I Do you think that at some point China will fall in line because of the pressure from all the other deals the president will have made with other countries\nWell that's exactly what the president's strategy is it's it's too it's to shore up first of all of the existing agreement like we just saw with NAFTA you know we've got the U. S. MCAA deal now a shoring those up revising those make sure that they that they work better for United States is going to turn his gaze towards the European Union\nJapan uh and of course the u._k. oh we're going to get those deals done and then ... is going to actually be\nYou know pain you know put a corner\nBecause they're reorient with President Trump is doing is United States companies now and companies all around the world are reorient their supply chain away from China\nAnd really toward North America you know this is why companies are all manufacturing plants here it got more manufacturing jobs here you've got all the time you know I think you know aren't jobs they're open than there are people to fill them in the United states\nAnd so the geopolitical you you think about all the money that used to flow toward China no longer flowing toward China it puts a herd of their economy\nWell you know ... that's one thing the other thing you I I thought of Iran where he put the sanctions back on and now the European companies have had to make a decision between the United states in Iran will\nUh that it's not even a choice yeah they're going to stick with us because if they did business with Iran or they lose our business so obviously runs losing that business\nAnd um and then then the European governments complain about it I don't get that because um you know we're we're we're accomplishing great economic\nUh ... the pressure on Iran which we should be\nShould be overthrowing the government from the people within the country and there are movements to do that\nAnd then the other part of that is that um we're benefiting of these other companies coming to us being told you can't do business with both so ... this is working to a positive effect bulls geo politically and economically\nYet another that's the beauty of being in a position of strength\nAnd that's why it's so important and that's that's a perfect perfect example of why these pro growth pro business\nPro American policies that President Trump deregulation tax cuts corporate and individual tax cuts and jobs to act right you've got the opportunity it don't it stimulates investment in some of the more you know ... ... talking about\nRevitalizing America but not just you know you're you're subject to talk about revitalizing America\nA you know your urban environments near rural environments that has a huge position of strength when we're renegotiating these these deals and were able to put these economic sanctions on countries like Iran\nWhere by your you know the European can you know a good friend of mine record now with the ambassador to Germany you know he's he's carry that message to a lot of these German companies that listen if you're doing business with Iran you know you can expect a very serious response of the United states to choose between\nFreedom with the United states and you know someone who respects human rights or Iran you know a a frequent state\nSponsor of terror ah someone who use people and kill people and uh you know human rights violators uh and and that only change the shame of the Europeans but at the economic sanctions or\nHurt the Iranian people out of the people that the government it puts them in a in a bind and it literally suffocate and it crippled their entire economy\nNow tell you what I was not the policy they ... I Know that regime change is not the goal but we want behavior change you know we want them to to to cut off their their funding of a terrorist organization want to start acting like a like an adult and uh playing by the rules\nAre and so these tools these weapons that President Trump is effectively employed uh you know being this\nReal genius you know you only have this kind of mentality I frankly I I think it was speculate coming from the private sector where you have to you know you have to survive otherwise go bankrupt you know it uh you know he's taken this mentality into the oval office\nWhere ... they changed the way that we interact with our training allies with our defense allies and we're going to make sure we put the American people first not that he's done\nAnd then there's no question about that we're wrapping up got about a minute do you think uh there's there's talk and I was the president loves what the best ... doing in Germany but do you think that would the some of the talk that he might wind up as you want to ...\nWell I'll tell you I Know that uh you know he's been family favorite uh yeah we all we all love Rick and you know he's just a just a\nHeck of a guy I Know that you know it was a long time a spokesperson ran with Ambassador Bolton personal time you know now is a national security adviser\nAnd so I think the president likes a
