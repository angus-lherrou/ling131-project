side of this story\n[noise] you know because the media loves group think and ah they're all in one camp as you do and I'm not going to go to the other side but ... says you know Mike Pence was never about the truth but it was all about a bloody up Kavanaugh and delaying this nomination and then they\nSo uh you know that's what it was about wasn't about finding the truth from before they put up their story showed that investigated and corroborated and uh it it fails every test and so you know we never even heard that story\nAnd then the Republicans out of fear for being called insensitive to women had to go through with this hearing and then had to extend it a week and then also used a woman to do the questioning instead of eleven white males so to speak um what about the President's Day I'm Sorry go ahead on that point\n[noise] well you know a Republican politicians in this country have never been known for their spines I mean that's why Donald Trump garlic or because they never did anything they promised they would do but you know all that my don't you\nKnow I haven't seen it and I grew up in New York\nVery familiar with Donald Trump or in the old days and that he's no different

out to vote this time I'm a ... this year you've done a lot of writing about abuse of power or senators prosecutors all that it would seem to me that as a committee\nAnd the Senate Judiciary committee has performed abuse of power and a much higher level than we've ever seen 'em or much lower level depending on how you want to describe it in terms of the changing the whole nature of the game of a nominating the\nJustices or confirming nominations of justice is that the Supreme Court\nAnd and the ... just elimination of any rules at all\nAbout that price rise the you agree with that and does it concern you\nAbsolutely I mean you know he he is Kevin guilty until he posed plays or they're sort of the fact that [noise]\nHave accuser can come forward with something from a from thirty six years ago when he was in high school and then back you know be on TV it in front of a full Senate hearing and\nTo tell her story is just shocking and and just totally inverted entire system that way but you\nKnow what's going to be on the long term impact of this because I'm look when Harry Reid the eliminated the requirement of sixty votes for federal district judges and federal appeals court judges that he said it's going to be majority from Iran and they got rid of the culture\nUm all all McConnell did was extended to the Supreme Court when what ... what\nWere you had done in the first two levels I basically McCall just said we're going to the third level the Supreme Court and now every judge is going to get confirmed by a majority and not by a super majority you know fifty one rather than sixty so when you when you\nUm they would seem to me at least that number one that I think it makes it more equitable but now the rules are going to change again because now anything goes when it comes to dealing with the nomination process the Democrats have now shown use anything you can use even the fact that the guy through a Cuba vice across the bar room\n[laughter] that's true I mean basically we're down to political have jobs and that's really what you're going to see that's what you're watching in progress so it's um\nIt's very alarming and then very disturbing but you know it

O. you'll be glad\nYou did do ... do you do ... and ...\nAnd we're\n\nTalking\nWant to miss the gate and journalist\nOn Madison involving abuse of power I'm suffering honest one to wrap up on that prior case you have a female prosecutor she goes after a belief to present a supervisor a presumably the supervisor in the priests\nThat some of the things that are going on than Boston Bernard Cardinal Law for example who protected by the pedophiles which is worse than they've been being without a file since a pedophile is sick and these bishops and cardinals knew exactly what they were doing to protect the church from scandal at the expense of of the day that actually\nTrue and that's all in Philadelphia too\nRight and that happened in foreign recently so let me just ask you know ... this prosecutor known that the the guy recanted won the case was going on\nNo I don't think a ... to ah [noise] but there's some confusion as to whether he told her about that part of it but he he gave killer at every step of the way that every witness the interview and including members of the victims on family\nA motel story completely different from the ... the most telling\nSo in other words a minute wait a minute I'm just asking whether she knew that the victim a legend victim recanted the victimization\nNo we don't know that she knew that part of it\nOkay so therefore she may have acted in good faith is my point\n[noise] we all know the fact of doesn't think so because he kept telling her over and over again that look this kid stories and checking out in his own mother and his own brother and his own father contradicting I'm an O L decrease some nuns and his classmate you conduct and\nSo uh she just kept saying I Believe I Believe so uh you know maybe it was blind faith thing\nBut the ... and ... who would do we know shampoo or even ask them the question\nThat the detective race than we do a\nHe's not what I'm trying to get to the air for the audience the audience understand is that a average folks look at this and think that the system operates the way it's supposed to\nWhich are ideally happens but the question here as well go a prosecutor can get a person convicted a who's innocent\nAnd act in good faith doing it or we've seen for example a legend rapists who've gotten away for ten Fifteen Twenty years and because now with DNA evidence being available we find out that they actually didn't commit the crime and that they're released but the last ten or Fifteen or Twenty years of their lives\nSo what do but those prosecutors acting in good faith and because the evidence I lead them in that direction so I'm just asking whether if somebody ... if you can determine that a prosecutor acts in bad faith then that prosecutors should no longer be a prosecutor probably should be barred from practicing law altogether\nI agree\nSo avoidable you don't know whether she acted in good faith and when you said there were other things she did\nYeah well I mean like I said she took notes when she first interview the fact that man this kid's stories are all over the law\nAnd she took notes and then she told people that she didn't take notes when it came time to turn those over to the defense lawyers\nThey said what are your notes and she said there are no notes and uh she said this and she and her colleagues uh other D'Leisha this in three different courtrooms in front of three different judges and then eight years later they're notes mysteriously appear\nAnd that's after the trial is over though right\nWell yeah but we're going to really try to gauge the whole thing binary tried and look what I just bought a obey a central part of it and then early on in the case um the victim or what do you call them uh for the archdiocese to file complaints\nHe basically told them that he didn't want to go to court he didn't want to press charges of any kind of all he wanted was money and he asked if uh I Would go about gay pay information which hadn't found offensive to oil and that'll be another\nUm you know so that's that's what some type of the defense will argue that that was willful misconduct are to the theater\nWhile the if if in fact the next trial happens is is that\nProsecutors still prosecuting all these years later in the same thing I Do\nShe left but she left the district attorney's office or\nAround the time I'm getting to a grand jury report and found about owning mistakes a fact and wrote about them or a short while after that she was a a office and a ... said she resigned\nAnd maybe that's what happened but we never got an explanation for twenty factual mistakes in the grand jury recall\nI think the better way to say that she was allowed to resign and that's what it sounds like [laughter] I ... and that's going to work on your part but now we'll let me ask this question is if in fact she\nUm is found to have lied about the notes\nWhen in terms of when she was supposed to turn them over to the defense which is an absolute violation of your a fiduciary requirement or whatever the legal requirement on the part of the prosecutor to turn over a skull matory evidence to the defense attorney\nIf it's found that she didn't do that is as anybody talking now when the straw goes back for a trial is anybody's suggesting that she might be prosecuted for violating the law in that case\nCertainly in the defense lawyers would like to stay here just borrowed enough talked about that um but um you know since the case has been where he tried yet\nUm all that will be you know a matter of dispute when it is but the district we have a new district attorney he pledged to try the case so I I don't think there's any doubt at this point that it will be re trial\nRight so then that that would probably be boring as you said in the central evidence of the case and the result of that\nWill be that uh if the if if that's if that's a finding in that case this former prosecutor or could be vulnerable would be vulnerable the prosecution because that's a violation of law she did she intentionally perjured herself\nBy by denying there was evidence that there actually was and the ...\nSome of those might've might have um\nA ... and the defendants correct that there are no might have been\nAnd the judge in Seattle said well it's OK yeah you can't do that because what you said during the campaign it's for the wrong reason and the truth of the matter is the president has the authority no matter what when he said during the campaign is totally irrelevant\nIt doesn't mean anything it's what the president's authority is under the constitution which exists now you've also got California and Hawaii judges who've done the same thing they made law instead of interpreted law under the constitution\nSo let's get back to the the the lawsuit from the feds one of the elements of that would be that the federal government could withhold funding to the states and cities who carry a sanctuary policies is that correct\n[noise] well I don't say I mean there have been lawsuits on that\nBut that as I understand it is separate from the federal government lawsuit that sought to overturn S. B. fifty four now when the administration tried to withhold funds because they were not because localities were not cooperating with ice [laughter] um\nState and local governments went into court\nAnd they prevail and have prevailed in the lower courts or to date on that now there there has been there a couple of them is here I mean there has been legislation introduced to make it clear that um funds would not go to sanctuary cities and\nSome of it has to do not just with legislation but with\nUm administrative rulings so it's possible that even though the Trump Administration has lost on the funding issue to date it may be able to structure future agreements and sharing federal funds with localities upon their cooperation with federal authorities um\nSo it's again it said it's complicated but the fact\nThat to a couple\nPossibilities here I mean the Trump Administration may prevail and appeals and being able to um\nWithhold funds under current legislation or the um there may be future legislation passed when she gets more authority or it may be adjusted structuring agreements left the executive branch it may say you have field law enforcement phones at your local\nYou know city Boston San Francisco but only a few cooperate with federal government ... an immigration matters so it's possible the administration could prevail in the future and being able to cut funds from sanctuary cities\n[laughter] you know in order to crunch going on you know it didn't work and ...\nIt can work either way a and end up and appreciate the point but it can work you know right now the I Believe they're ... they're going up on appeal though I Know they intended\nTo wind up at the Supreme Court from the Justice Department at the get the authority from the Supreme Court decision which would be in the future to withhold funds from those cities in ... than than than this case the state of California but the uh the bottom line is that those states might just the\nAwe and those cities who want to have sanctuary status would say okay then don't give us the money will get by they'll somehow suck it up and then deal with it um and but the other lawsuit which is separate\nWould give the federal government the authority and would tell the states you can't do this at that point you could start putting mayors and governors in jail\nIf you if you have teeth and they build a law once the Supreme Court makes a decision that the federal government has the right to tell the states and cities you can have sanctuary status\nUm do states and cities uh could then face from Congress a legal sanctions that could make a criminal for mayor or governor and do that look at the state the mayor of Oakland what kind of idiot is she going to tell criminals watch out ISIS coming against you\nI mean do you have\nA degree much more I mean it's just ridiculous give criminals are headed up so they can continue to get away and commit crimes um\nYeah I mean there there could be a real repercussions\nI mean in ... oh I think a lot what change it even if they just say if the federal government has the authority to pull back some of those federal dollars that has a long way of making people come around and ... and it could be if there is clear authority if the court say um\nStates have no authority to do this I think you'll find a lot of the uh the local police would ... the cattle gladly cooperate with ice\nA man and might not pay any attention to the marriage that for some you know a clear federal court decision on their behalf um so yeah well we're looking to the court to look into an issue we're looking to changing legislation we're trying to keep active and all these different fronts\nNow as long as you have these friends as you call them uh the courts a public opinion I'm a petition and local legislators agreeing that they want to opt out of sanctuary status in California\nUm ... what's your sense as to whether this movement is growing or whether it's ... ... what's the status of that\n[noise] well you know there there have been you know it varies quite a bit across the country uh I mean some states have me I'm used to have the opposite fight going on in Texas which acts of said you know you can't have sanctuary jurisdictions and and Austin, Texas because it's um it's a left wing and saying no we want to be saying sanctuary I'm\nA ... you know in spite of what the state is saying [noise] you know I think a lot of I should get me looking at the Oregon initiative because I'm Oregon's a pretty liberal stated when the Clinton uh but\nThey were surprised that last time I mean there they had um they'd pass a law giving me a driver's license for illegal aliens and they got an initiative and they put that all about and they were surprised voters voted by I think if I remember is pretty clear majority um to say no no driver's license for illegal aliens\nNow the same thing as well past with the um [noise] uh this tape passed the sanctuary law I'm and I'm\nYou know the voters put that on the ballot again petitioned to put it on the ballot or so the with the politicians are against the initiative Nike came out you know some big corporations they said they're against the initiative so a lot of us who are we looking at what what happens in Oregon in a few weeks\nOr so let me ask you this question ending in California and putting it out of here and not just for the sanctuary which would\nOh glad for the driver's license to both among the same ballot initiative\nI'm struggling you kind of a run on sentences I'm trying to ... interject here uh you got to listen if I'm if I talk to you would you do that and we're\nGoing to get back and actually I'm Glad\nI was just going to ask you um does that mean now that because of the initiative in Oregon they no longer issue driver licenses to illegal aliens is that correct\nThat is correct yeah okay so if they pass the initiative a to prohibit sanctuary status in Oregon that all of the sanctuary status in Portland and the state and other cities would be eliminated as well is that correct\nThat is correct so that's a great way to ah to end this program and then you've

Believe to present a supervisor a pre civil is supervisor of the priests\nThat some of the things that are going on in Boston Bernard Cardinal Law for example who protected by the pedophiles which is worse than they've been being a pedophile says about a mile is sick and these bishops and cardinals knew exactly what they were doing to protect the church from scandal at the expense of of the ... that\nIs true and that's all and Philadelphia to\nWrite I happen to the next four recently so let me just ask you though that ... this prosecutor know that the the guy recanted when the case was going on\nNo I don't think a ... to ah [noise]\nBut there's some confusion as to whether he told her about that part of a ... a girl or at every step of the way that every witness the rodeo including members of the victim's family a motel story completely different from the ... the most telling\nSo another war and what women I'm just asking whether she knew that the victim a legend victim recanted the victimization\nNo we don't know that she knew that part of it\nOkay so therefore she may have acted in good faith is my point\n[noise] we all know the the directive doesn't think so because he kept telling her over and over again but look this kid stories and checking out in his own mother and his own brother and his own father contradict the M N O L the priests and nuns and his classmate you conduct yeah\nSo uh she just kept saying I Believe them believe\nSo uh you know it was blind\nBut the ... and ... who would do we know share even ask them the question\nThat does affect the race that no it was\nYou know what I'm trying to get to hear from the audience the audience to understand is that a average folks look at this and think that the system operates the way it's supposed to\nWhich ideally happens but the question here is ... a prosecutor can get a person convicted a who's innocent\nAnd act in good faith doing it or we've seen for example a legend rapists who got away for ten Fifteen Twenty years and because now of DNA evidence being available we find out that they actually didn't commit the crime and that they're released but the last ten or Fifteen or Twenty years of their lives\nSo but but those prosecutors acting in good faith and because the evidence like lead them in that direction so I'm just asking whether if somebody ... if you can determine that a prosecutor acts in bad faith then that prosecutors should no longer be a prosecutor probably should be barred from practicing law altogether\nI agree\nSo avoidable you don't know whether she acted in good faith and whether you said there were other things she did\nYeah well I mean like I said she took notes when she first interview the victim and this kid stories were all over the law\nAnd she took notes and then she told people that she didn't take notes when it came time to turn those over to the defense lawyers\nThey said what are your notes and she said there are no notes and uh she said this and she and her colleagues uh other ... in three different courtrooms you found a traitor and judges and then eight years later little notes mysteriously reappear\nAnd that's after the trial is over though right\nYeah but we're going to really try to gauge the whole thing binary tried and I just bought a obey a central part of it and then early on in the case I'm a victim or what do you call them uh for the archdiocese to file complaints\nHe basically told them that he didn't want to go to court he didn't want to press charges of any kind of all he wanted was money and he asked if uh I Would go about getting paid and that information was heading\nWell and that will be another\nUm you know so that's that's the type of central argue that that was willful misconduct are to the U.S bitter\nWhile the if if in fact the next trial happens is is that\nProsecutors still prosecuting all these years later in the same ...\nShe left ... she left the district attorney's office or\nAround the time that um I don't get into a grand jury report and found about owning mistakes a back and wrote about from a short while after that she was a a office and uh you know she said she was on\nAnd maybe that's what happened but we never got an explanation for twenty factual mistakes in the grand jury recall\nI think the better way to say that she was allowed to resign and that's what it sounds like [laughter] and then ... and that's a good work on your part but now we'll let me ask this question if in\nFact she\nUm is found to have lied about the notes where and in terms of when she was supposed to turn them over to the defense which is an absolute violation of your a fiduciary\nRequirement or whatever the legal requirement of the part of the prosecutor to turn over a school matory evidence to the defense attorney if it's found that she didn't do that is as anybody talking now won the straw goes back for a trial is anybody's suggesting that she might be prosecuted for violating the law in that case\nCertainly in the defense lawyers would like to stay or disbarred and I've talked about that um but um you know since ... says and then when he tried yet\nUm all that will be you know a matter of dispute when it is a district we have a new district attorney he pledged to try the case so I I don't think there's any doubt at this point that it will be redrawn\nAll right so then that that would probably be bored as you said of the central evidence of the case and the result of that\nWill be that uh if the if if that's if that's a finding in that case this former prosecutor or could be vulnerable wouldn't be vulnerable to prosecution because that's a violation of law she did she intentionally perjured herself\nBy by denying there was evidence that there actually was and the evidence might've might have um\nA rated the defendants correct ... there are no ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Siegel Show", "city": "Boston", "day": "06"}
