I mean I I mean I well I Would I Would if the globe said that I Would say the global lied to the probably covering for each other but I mean it just didn't say anything to that that seem to\nSeem to ah stop 'em um but but I but I I Would I Would say that you know she got she got a ... way there with a with a complete lie on that particular point\nMike I Want to get to other people on the line but just quickly and I agree with you by the way I find it kind of hamburger on that point overall who do you think one who do you think last\nPoll I think good oh Jeff Jeff on the one that uh it for at least at least at least at least to the media isn't going to be able to say oh he attacked her\nHe'll he was mean you know you you know like like you were talking about uh uh before the thing that that was what the you know I don't see how the media is going to be able to claim that always attacking a woman you know that business\nSo overall you think he won but should have been more aggressive I think that's the emerging consensus but I Want to get to a few more calls and then in Westport you're up next go ahead Evan\nHey Jeff I just wanted to say I I think that Jeff deal really wants to say this isn't a wind just for death is the one for the people in Massachusetts he talked about\nUnemployment he talked about wages he he uh I like you said before you know I wasn't going to the millionaire who's used government to enrich yourself Well Jeff is you know is a state rep for women who I Know will work hard on behalf of the people Massachusetts and there'll be a full time senator I think the contrast between\n... and Jeff you couldn't be stronger and he made a strong case tonight\n[noise] Evan do you think he's going to get a big bump in the polls\nI certainly think he will but as we've seen in twenty sixteen and and ... uh before that at the polls are are\nReally you know not necessarily true measure of of how people are feeling I think the people in Massachusetts are are are fight about Jeff deal um I think they'll definitely get a bump in the polls I think um you know\nHe's running a great grassroots campaign across Massachusetts He's he's visited a ... a countless cities and towns he's met with with tons of voters I mean I mean gifts ground game couldn't be more contrasting\nThe firm that Elizabeth Warren who is constantly out of the state um who's running for president and twenty twenty I mean this campaign is really about Massachusetts and and that couldn't be clearer tonight\nHaving very quickly 'cause I Want to get to the other callers\nUm if you get these people are listening right now ... okay we just lost them I was going to ask him what do you think of Sunday's debate\nDo you want him to do exactly what he did tonight in other words did he do enough or some of the other callers and frankly myself think he needs to be a little bit more aggressive he's got to go after her and land some more shots\nSix one seven to six six sixty eight sixty eight Ross in Boston you're up next go ahead Ross\nWas Warren played Walter based sticking church hockey fights\nIssue going substance and understand the issues I give the edge to Jeff deal\nBut Jeff unfortunately not be a champ decisively you own a car blows fortunately for us this is not the wrong Fifteen of this fight [noise]\nAnd you know let's face it with Elizabeth Warren take away or anti Trump cat and she runs an empty and I'll tell you that Jeff what really gets me when you understand substance\nIs ... ... jobs depend on just spent spending by Saudi Arabia and shake could care less what turmoil she causes for the president in dealing with Saudi Arabia\nThey don't see any state senator that wants to you know stop a trait but Saudi Arabia you got to be a bumbling idiot not understand the damage you'll go to the American worker\nRuss what's your advice for deal on Sunday\n[noise] first of all what I Would like to see how you do is I'd like to see him pick up that\nAll the things that she is set erroneous lay okay and let's face it what many think she set in reference to the place has\nCaused people out there that are on the edge go do senseless things like shooting police officers and everything else I Would like to say your pick or a pot with everything that she says in our own rhetoric and get her that way\nInteresting Russia as always thank you for that call Jerry on the cave comrade are my friends I Want to hear from you what do you think the job when one doing ...\nJeffs needs to do one thing I can eat when she opens yourself up for a tax that's when they should attack otherwise sit back there's no way you should attack on needlessly and he's done a good job of that so far\nA couple of times I thought he jumped in but ... I agree with you on that Jeff but overall he's done a great job and I think he's going to have to build on it\nOn it and the repetition is load\nOkay that's what I Want to ask you a comrade Sunday is around to it deals people are listening should deal do the exact same thing what issues should the highlight that you think he didn't highlight one does he need to do more in your view\nHer connections to shed a weak government figures you know dark money figures I think you should I liked that she I think you should just keep highlighting the fact that she's done nothing except\nTwenty percent of the funding for the situation for the wall to wall on the ocean the people that own property pay eighty percent of it don't make it sound like she did something great ... nothing right there that's a joke\nJoke as always thank you very much for that call huh are these the best colors in the business or what okay Jeff in Rhode Island Europe ... go ahead Jeff\n[noise] oh Jeff how's it going on and how are you worried\nOr want to say and I don't want to pick up to watch your time uh fortunately that I don't think that just deal with a lot\nUm I think he should've pushed more on the fact that a loser with one of your heritage and so forth you did nothing in that and I thought that was a big mistake on this\nBar yes I think that's a truthfully\nI think that uh if Donald Trump\nDid that which he did he should have done it as well and then I don't understand why he did not I don't understand why he didn't push a few other things as far as Massachusetts as concerned\nA liberal went on but I grew up in a mess so I Know all these things I Know what's going on I'll tell you right now there was a big mistake on his part he should've pushed hard on the Indian factor\nI agree with you did not Jeff I agree with you and thank you very much for that call look to all of you know honestly I'll tell you when I told Brittany as she and I were watching the debate I said if this was Trump debating her if this was debating her\nShe would be on the floor blood everywhere politically obviously speaking within the first Fifteen minutes\nA first Fifteen minutes would have been your fraud you perpetrated a fraud you enrich yourself because of a fraud you took advantage of a a vulnerable population like Native Americans you are nothing but a scam artist I Would have hit her and she had her and she had her\nSo that her credibility would have been finished\nI Would not have just done a couple of jobs and then move I mean this was the opportunity to take her out and I thought honestly\nNow he's got two more rounds she's got two more debates but honestly I think that's that was as if there was a mistake that he made I think that was his mistake just my opinion a Leslie in Western Europe next go ahead Leslie I've got one minute go\nHigh gas thank you for taking my call on the way that I I think I think the ... absolutely were lifted base and I was listening on the concert and I was listening to it with the here\nI'm considering all of my democratic friends around here\nWho are Democrats but they voted for governor Baker because they believe he was going to do the ... that she had that so I was like\nAll right what am I listening to that is going to tell them that this is the same kind of guy that three things that stood out for me that shocked me really was number one how deal started a small business with his ways sixteen years ago [noise]\nLet me go on quick and it was alright hum I agree with you look she came across as a viable reasonable alternative I think a lot of moderate Democrats will find that appealing\nSo voice in Boston do you watch the working over one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA HD to Boston and I are radio station\nThat very clearly that there's no ambiguity about that so I Would just raise that point\nThat this wasn't done without the founders agreement but let's let's turn to what needs to be about it because really the court has the authority to find any law to be unconstitutional or constitutional any policy look look what the federal district judges\nIn Hawaii in San Francisco and Seattle did\nThey basically said we're putting his a nationwide ban on the president's ability to stop people coming from certain countries\nEven though those countries don't bet there are people properly and that's one of the end the president goes to countries from Obama\nHis was not his own his own list so and it does give us your thoughts about the fact that we have federal district judges making brandishing their power across the entire country even though there was one small area\nWell I've heard people in who went to law school who said that when they got an air class oh gosh show law the professor would start out by saying the ah the the law is what the Supreme Court says it is\nUm and and uh it it sort of a famous court is the final arbiter there and the constitution is what the Supreme Court said it I Would actually disagree with you can have you had absolute and April misinterpret the absolute\nSo um [noise] but you know what\nWhat what's really happening here I'm Mike is that in the past over the past twenty or Thirty years the left has increasingly put\nEmphasis on the Supreme Court as it has been unable to get some of its movements and some of these things through\nUh the state legislatures and Congress and so for them this ... became increasingly important and a conservative followed suit with that so um I Would argue that is an extent what we have right now is is a reflection\nOf the division between liberals and conservatives in it you know\nThat when you and I were younger you had you had Republicans who are liberal and conservative you had Democrats who are liberal and conservative and so uh I think could appoint a Republican who would've and who could have been fairly liberal and a Democrat could have a point it's a ... a\n... a Democrat who would have been fairly conservative so that's all changed now and it's I I see the Supreme Court has sort of a a real battle ground right now and I I don't know what to do about it\nYeah and the ... and and the problem is that the people who would say let's follow the constitution have to exceed to the fact that the constitution says the the these nine people have lifetime appointments period is closed and that the Senate confirms and frankly there's latitude in the\nU.S Constitution about the Senate advice and consent role in that\nThere are no parameters they could decide they don't like the guys here style and and knock them down if they chose to do it\nYou know and and I guess is as a as a matter of principle I I wouldn't if if we were to impose a I'm a constitutional amendment that said\nIt had to retire at picking age eighty let's say or something of that nature\nThat would not I mean that would not upset me terribly because you know even I I never heard of them can can function very well after the age of eighty if you did that I Would find that not unreasonable to do and not not not a huge British or what the founders had in mind [noise]\nUm because of course for life expectancy when they found that was much shorter as well\nWell that's ... that's a good point but you'd have to do it by constitutional amendment so you ...\nYou have like a minute I'm just saying if they did that\nI Would not find that as as a as a a ... and overturned to try to pack the court or destroyed or something of that nature I ... I think a person could make a reasonable case that that that that could could or should be done I don't know what I'd be a strong supporter of about that you can make a case for it\nWell the other thing that a times even any says about this is that the Congress in the states and the executive branch should reassert their co equal obligations to interpret and apply the constitution\nBut it's not their job to interpret and apply the constitution ... job to carry out the laws at least in the executive branch and the Congress's role to make the laws that the executive branch carries out its really the role of the court to interpret whether in fact the law is constitutional\nRight that's right and and what I think comics trying to get at fair is the fact that in my in my opinion Congress's advocated a lot of its authority and handed off to\nThe executive branch um saint but because they didn't want the political fallout from doing things and that the administrative the executive branch especially under Obama ... and ... are executed a lot of the law of it there are laws where this guy going or those things we're not going to enforce it\nAh so I I Would say that both of them have both of those branches of actually aggregated some of their authority\nUh and so I Would like to see both of them again to take back some of their authority and my mind especially from Congress\nThat Congress shouldn't be the one glaring whether or not we go to war Congress should be the one at a car or they're not we impose taxes um Congress should be the one and it makes when it passes like Obamacare it shouldn't be making decisions about what happened there and not say the secretary of health and Human Services\nThree thousand quake three thousand times and the Obamacare law said go to the secretary at school come right back stay right than\nIn line\nFolks do what I did get yourself for a special person in your life the empty themselves are watching this is Mike Siegel

those who are too sick to shop and cooked for themselves and how you can certainly not or\n...\n... you\nWent back to my ... have you\nUs we get back to our conversation with Dr Morrow Matthews resident scholar at the Institute for policy innovation glad that one of those to\nA doctor Matthews Obamacare is still around November first\nIt kicks in in terms of the people being able to make changes or get their new policies under Obamacare and the premiums have been enormous part of the problem is you're required to take\nA elements of health care but you may not need or want whether it's a mental health care of some form\nWhether it's a pregnancy\nOr as contraception ... whether it's a pregnancy care even if your mail you get that in the policy everybody gets these elements in the policy under Obamacare So obviously is going to sky rocket the cost is no free market about that it's government telling you what's going to be in your plan\nAs a result the costs are high ... ... the one where you going to see lower health care premiums under Obamacare if at all that's possible\nIn fairness though for sixteen states had a increasingly been mandated health insurance cover various types of things I used to actually yeah Iran organization and we uh we tracked all the mandate the chair and published a I'm\nA document that highlighted the various mandates I think we're up to a two thousand and twenty five or something like that mandate from the states prior to Obamacare passing and it was it was exactly the things you were talking about and those mandate\nApply to individual policy that is somebody who goes out and buy their own policy by themselves and a small group policies so if you worked for a small company that that are provided health insurance and it apply to them they didn't typically a pot apply and large companies Obamacare apply that every one but it also apply more things to it\nSo you're absolutely right you're cover you require insurance to cover more things\nAnd you can ah you can bet the premiums will go up even though Democrats argued that they would go down if you did that\nWell and then we go around in circles on this though because the people who are suffering\nOr a first of all individual policyholders right then and now a days\nBuying a policy as an individual is an absurdity uh I've told you before about the cases of people I Know where the married couple a years ten thousand dollar to duck doubles each and they pay about Eighteen hundred a month which is in premium which is Twenty one thousand six hundred a year\nSo now you're talking thirty one thousand dollars in payments for each of them before you even get to the coverage if it's absurd it's it's not working and it was ... and it's gotten more poor people coverage\nBut at the expense of other people who went and I urge been beaten to a bloody pulp economically by Obamacare and um\nMy wife she had a policy with Blue Cross in Texas\nShe like had a twenty five hundred dollars out only with the individual policy and it ... it would change the way we found like really could live with this\nUh she goes just about any doctor um wherever she wanted to and that and that he got cancelled because of Obamacare Blue Cross came back and said All right where we're at the cash for that policy because you're the pocket dot qualified or we're going to go to an Obamacare qualify policy\nHurt adaptable wet from twenty five hundred to six thousand and the premiums went up five fifty percent that's in the first you know the first round\nSo we're paying more than twice that adaptable and ... percent more in premiums and then and then halfway through the year in July Blue Cross sent out a letter to thirty three hundred and fifty seven thousand taxi\nWho had that are saying we've lost four hundred million dollars on this policy so we're going to cancel it at the end this year and will offer something else what they offered was not very good she tried and and ... and it turned out to not be very good to have to go to the to the Christian sharing ministry\nYou know and that's what I Do a lot of people have been doing are just not really insurance which as you say it's sharing but right now it look it's a system\nThe bottom line though is that the the ... the Democrats have insurance themselves with Obamacare the Republicans have done little or nothing the only thing they did was to remove the individual mandate\nWhich means that you don't have to buy the policy and then therefore pay a penalty which is what it would actually be if you had to pay and you didn't buy the policy but other than that uh it it's pretty much were was ... what needs to be done well first of all what's gonna happen November first we're going to see skyrocketing increases Enrique's again\nMost of the most of the announcement to come out right now or that the premiums well in some cases are going down ... percent or two and I don't think people are really understand they sort of fat guy I said great what happened is actuaries at ... in in the middle of the year ... have to try to estimate how much\nTheir costs are going to be the next year without even knowing who is necessarily going to be in their system\nSo they come up with a premium they think will cover\nOr they try to estimate how many how many sick people kind of half what's it going to look like and they come up with a premium for that\nUh and the way the way the actual real science works his\nIn one year that they may they ... and this is true for for a decade they may say we think it's got to be this much what they said a premium they find out they under charge for their premium so the next year they raise the premiums up a little above what they really need to to cover it in order to cover the losses from the last year [noise]\nUm and so that just kind of how the gas where it goes so sometimes actuaries actually charge\nThey they they say what do we need to charge this much more they come up and they find out where we didn't need that much so next year will lower premiums a little bit because we did okay and that's that's what's going on now the only reason the extra the Obamacare exchanges have not collapse completely is because I'm\n... under under the law when a\nWhen a President Trump remove these ... sharing payments that the government was paying a people actually gotten more federal ... covering their premium so you have\n... most of the people who are in the exchanges are being covered by taxpayers and if taxpayers are covering your insurance when you're why would you why would you leave [laughter] so that's that's the only thing that's keeping the uh the pool from completely collapsing\nWell and then it shouldn't there be proactive legislation to change things to bring back\nYeah the Congress as a [noise] unfortunately pretty important in that respect I mean they can subpoena Rosen staying they've been threatening to do that forever and they haven't\nYou know they could hold him making ten like they did Eric Holder or they've threatened to do that but they haven't I of course we have no leadership in the house because Paul Ryan is about as a wall and feckless anybody can be\nSo that's been another problem I'm the only way you can really happen is for the president to fire sessions Dan Rather than staying or at least president stain and put somebody in there that will take charge of it and clean the house\nYou know the the I mean to me\nIt's got to go to ray just hadn't done squad\nOh yeah the FBI Director right or like ... like he\nWas Andrew Weissmann supervisor in the department of justice one ... running roughshod over buddy and east and as I describe in the book\nAt Enron the Enron right all of that you know get into and\nYeah he's he's he's a a totally ... without principles or integrity from what I Am ... well like mowing cut deals with Whitey Bolger in Boston when he ran the FBI and Boston\nOh yes on top of that he tried doing trap Harvey silver ... very well known and highly regarded lawyer bus sending somebody to aim to try to get him to do a false affidavits in the case\nSo you know Mahler is no prize either and I'm not\nBut my my concern a I'm a first of all I Want to see everybody prosecutors should be that's a given\nBut my concern is that this has exposed the system for not being a legitimately and by no fault of the founders of ... because sometimes things seem to be changed but what do we do to change it there's the question how do we how do we get the authority I suppose you could say that they could impeach Rosenstein I mean the the the house could do that\nWe the the Congress could also strengthened the role of the inspector general for the department of justice he's actually the weakest of all these Seventy two I think it is a specter general sprawl the agency\nCouldn't the Congress give the inspector general subpoena power I'm Sorry what\nCouldn't the inspector jazz couldn't the Congress given the inspector general subpoena power\nYes I think they could\nAnd then I mean that's something he doesn't have now I don't think any of 'em have subpoena power at this point\nI don't know whether any of the others do or not but I Do know that he has less power than any of the others that one of the first things Eric Holder did when he took office was make it a lot more difficult for the inspector general to get access to any of the information he's supposed to have automatically\nYeah which which means that they were just trying to protect against\nAnd then is Sally ate came in she for close the inspector general from any access to information and the national security division of the department of justice which is where all this crap I'm a native from\nAnd Sally Yates says the person who refuse to carry out the president's order a on the immigration or the six countries yet he thought she was always person\nMeeting in the White House with the president and James Comey and Clapper and Brennan and by and I think Susan Rice will probably Valerie Jarrett on January six as they proceeded to get calmly to go the next day\nTo brief President Trump on the only the fallacious aspects of the steel da da da da da da da da da da and they knew it was doing this they knew they were providing the media hook that CNN needed to run with the whole field off the story\nAnd buzz the two because they were just waiting for a nice hook to explode that into the press in that briefing provided that\nKnow and then they ah we're we're we're off to the central point a little bit but I Want I Want to get back to one fundamental question does the Congress have enough authority now to do what it needs to do to get those documents I guess\nThat's where my own question because they could they could to impeach Rosenstein and then if he turns over the documents the Senate would not convict I mean there's not one way to do it\nYes but you know impeachment is such a difficult process than a political process there I don't think they're anywhere near the votes to do that\nWell in terms of what he's done I mean if the Republicans have a majority in terms of what he's done a ... year view I think\nIt takes a two thirds vote\nIf if he not in the house would take two thirds of the Senate and house would indict with a majority and then the Senate would convict with two thirds I'm not even looking toward a conviction that that's\nThat's a good I I just bring the articles of impeachment\nWrite the bill of particulars with articles of impeachment and um and then hold that over his head basically hold it hold it over him a ... give us the documents are you going to be impeached\nAnd that means you're gonna have to probably leave office that's justification to get rid of them um and even though he wouldn't get convicted he'd still be gone from office and he'd have a permanent blemish on whatever integrity and his reputation they had left\nThe Congress the hair doesn't have the guts to do that\nThat's that's a polite way of saying it was possible that I was shooting for [laughter] it's a well you know when I think Jim Jordan is speaker might have more gumption to do\nIt oh yeah Jim Jordan great I really ... the speaker\nI think he would\nYou know if he does become speaker somehow the Republicans hang on and he becomes speaker you're going to see I'm going back over this on the other side maybe a special should should that should not be right now a special counsel to investigate the other side and all matters related to Russian interference\nIn the department of justice could do it with an attorney general that wasn't conflict it out and what the capable deputy attorney general\n[noise] the one that I ah older just you know they're just they're expensive they're\nNightmare\nThe one that I Would like to see would be Trey Gowdy\nWell I Would agree with you except as best I can tell he talked to the good line but he's never done anything\nHe wants the prosecutor in South Carolina yeah he was\nA ... or or Rudy just\nAccomplished squad in Congress\nYeah he had those hearings with Hillary didn't go anywhere or um nothing yeah or or um Rudy Giuliani a you know who might be a good FBI Director I don't know if he's got the the uh\nSort of case that there would be Joe Lieberman because Democrats could not how could they ever vote against him and Lieberman is a pretty honest guy he'd be down the middle\nAnd thought about that\nHe'd be um he'd be I think it'd be a terrific choice because the Democrats would have to go along with him because he was one of the evidence\nAnd a good spot now and actually holds all the cars because the White House is seen enough of the documents under attack that to know exactly what what's going on and to know that the president\nCan classify it anytime and blow it all up and I think the reason he did not do so it was because he got calls from two of them are five as intelligence people out of gas was England and Australia for it because they were implicated in all over I was down there and help her and miss foot and all those characters

Turkey that admission came directly from the Saudi Government on friday\nPresident Trump in the presidential race in the final race and he's worked very closely and very effectively with the president since then and and Trump came to Texas several times massive rallies backing cruise though I think that helps heal to breach and also time as\nTime has passed and Robert Francis O'Rourke has a who calls himself ... in the same way that I could call myself quite neat though\nBecause I miss Hispanic as he is which is to say not at all there's not even one twelve one thousand and twenty fourth\nPiece of Hispanic blood in Robert ... case he was Hispanic then with Warren is Indian but he uses the name Bayh do in the hope of getting Hispanic but that's it\nApparently they put it\nThe money in his race though to twenty\nEight million dollars from out of state Democrats they are really really eager\nTo try to find a new face for the Democratic party and I was on the Lars Larson show the other night and I said just because you drive drunk and leave the scene of an accident doesn't make you a Kennedy\nBut that's the ... seem to think about Iraq\nWell there you go I mean it's a the ... you didn't have a di\nDi di he fled the scene of an accident he was so drunk his car went into oncoming traffic and could easily have killed a mini van full of full of kids it\nJust might be your luck that he didn't fully\nMurder entire families not rotting in in state prison right now\nWell since that's come out here now you're in that sense he is Kennedy esque\nI'm fair enough but it but but isn't that the case that this is a list I Would think would have a detrimental effect on his standing that this would cost him votes for moderates are independents who could go either way and then I might say I'm through with this guy\nWell you know a lot of the other a lot of people will just desperate to have a Democrat and it would be such a symbolic when the Democrats to elect\nA senator in Texas they haven't won a state right white race in Texas and early nineties [noise] um but I think oh Rourke is running for something different I think he knows he's not going to win I think he's running for the same thing that Wendy Davis ran for remember when she ran a few years back and made her big issue abortion\nYou knew that Texans are pro life but she also knew\nThat there are ... million airs all around the country who are eager to keep abortion legal through nine months of pregnancy so she was running for their support and sure enough she got herself a nice job high paying job on the board of Planned Parenthood\nAnd I think that's what Robert Francis of work is really running for either really looking for a job with Planned Parenthood or some other national left wing organization where he will\nYou know you can play a leader without ever winning vote\nWell people for the American way would be another spot Norman lose group but that's there to hold there are plenty of them there are plenty and he won dot org what am I on as George Soros involved in that race at all the you know\nI don't I don't I haven't seen any evidence of that he's big in the Florida governor's race is the big sponsor of Andrew Gillum the radical socialist a mayor I think Jacksonville or I'm not sure you mayor of a of a city and he is running he's running for governor and he was hugely backed by George Soros um\nBut I think a work but I Can't I have not seen any evidence that he's getting money directly from SARS but he's certainly are on board with a similar agenda he he is opposed to ice teas opposed to a border wall\nHe is in favor of impeaching Donald Trump it was so funny during the recent debate again the last debate against crews are overworked seemed like he was trying to distance himself from the national Democratic Party he was saying he could work with President Trump\nWell as Ted Cruz pointed out he's promised to try to impeach and removed from office President Trump that's probably not the best building block for a collaborative relationship\nOf although there's never going to happen to them I mean it's not going to win or if he wants to do and\nIf they did when he would have zero influence he would be able to do nothing for the state of Texas He would just be part of the same resistance gang a along with Cory Booker and Dianne Feinstein\nYou know he called for the defeat of Brett Kavanaugh based on those paper is fake allegations which just vanished when you have to put the light on them they they faded like the morning that morning fog\nUm he ... he favors gun control he wants he wants to lead rate Medicare in order to create a single single ... single payer Cuban style health plan um he basically just obeys whatever the national Democratic Party tells him so ... if he were elected for protects us\nWould be essentially representing Massachusetts or San Francisco because his his use or in lockstep with those of the left wing of the Democratic party\nWhile and then the but as we suggested or he's not going to win but we'll get himself a job in the private sector which is fine with me was like I'm off

billionaires had had pulled their money\nTo get a conservative evangelical Christian to run for the Senate in California everybody would know that it was kind of a symbolic candidacy\nThat it didn't

dot org where I write about these things five days a week and uh do you check out the powerful film\nTrumpet war it's Trump at symbol war and I'm Steve Bannon made it show highlighting the

getting burned that the most chilling image was was an anti FARC group marching in black cuts\nDown the street like soldiers chanting no Trump no wall know usa at all\nAnd I I think that's pretty close to becoming the platform of the national Democratic Party\nI've been talking to people who follow these things are a fact of an expert on I'm modeling for a public opinion because polls really don't cover we learned in twenty sixteen they don't do it um I think there's an undercurrent here at a couple of things number one\nOr the American people are most American people like to just live their lives to take care of their families do their work\nUh and and take care of their responsibilities won a pollster calls and says who you're voting for there's there's a pretty substantial number who are gonna say\nMaybe ten percent who are going to say a person X Y or Z but may not really mean at the point is that may be voting for Trump they may be voting for cruise they may be voting for a conservative\nBut they're not going to say it because they don't want to get harassed\nOr to become known as a Trump supporter because of the way they're treated\nRight well that's one of the cars getting torched cars getting all that much of a Trump bumper sticker you know people I Know are afraid to Ted Cruz signs in their front yard\nYeah exactly and and so\nThere they're going to okay you and which is really shocking but the point is they're going to vote that way anyway so you got this undercurrent there are people who and there are other people just want to go to find the pollsters uh to to to give them a false reading or they might say they're voting for\nO'Rourke and then they have every intention of voting for Cruz my only point is that the that the uh listening you could go back to Nixon calling it the silent majority that the the vast majority of people in the center in this country because independents are going to the side many of these elections are the four hundred and thirty five districts for the house\nBut the aisle ultimately independents decide that and they're going to get fed up with this because it may be the Republican view as they perceive it as imperfect but the Democrat view is is basically going to\nBut and they can take care of themselves that's why the president has told NATO cough up some money that's all he sold the European Union or you're gonna you're gonna change the way we do business here by uh by some of our natural gas and oil instead of buying it from Russia\nPart of the Europeans are like this is that they have not had to defend themselves for six years now because the United states took care of them\nThat's right and so they've been able to kick back and have five week vacations paid and retire at age sixty two and have one\nPoint to children for a couple you know they're only last so long\nNow we're seeing Europe is being taken over by hordes of Muslim colonists coming from Africa and the middle east\nAnd ah
