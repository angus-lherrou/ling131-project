eight hundred Eighteen anyone and meet Kelly financials\nFamily of experts in all fields of financial planning\nVoice of Boston\nNew York about one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA eighty to Boston and heart radio station from Haiti\nHungarian holding our nation wide investigation under way into\nOf um crime committed by illegal aliens in our country was staggering all of that but the thing that really launched me into this fight kill\nWas though a lenient the\nThat our court system show on illegal aliens I'm like hearing the state of Arizona when an illegal alien is sentenced to jail or prison they only have to start fifty percent of their time in Arizona that isn't half to serve eighty five percent of their time and\nAs you know and a lot of cases with the angel families these criminals are given a slap on the wrist and many more chances then you were I Would as a as an American citizen that defense attorneys play their\nCrimes down to where you know they're not punished as an American citizen would be for the same exact crime so that's what really spurred me into this fight because I thought this isn't right\nAnd my son Shirley didn't deserve to die at the hands ever repeat illegal alien criminals who had been traveling in the prior for crimes committed\nAnd it's a very well said other than it's understandable that you're battling the way you are because of that was his inspiration but it's also very frustrating\nThat and I know the cases for example where a DUI is plea bargain down to let's say perilous driving or even reckless driving which doesn't conjure up the criminal charge your conviction of a DUI which might get that person kicked out of the country it's as if the criminal justice system protects\nI'm from having to leave the country and still give them out on the streets\n[noise] exactly and you know this happens a lot within the DACA program to because they're allowed to have two misdemeanors on their record and a lot of time these duck participants commit a felony and their defense attorneys and the judge agreed to play it down to a misdemeanor so that they stay within the DACA guidelines and are able to remain in our country\nIt's it's mind boggling what it is and and and it's not even equitable in terms of as you said we treat our own citizens so given given that\nWe have a Congress that has been lame\nWe are now with President who's battling to get things done\nAnd we will get them course through your purse comments on the migration but\nWe have this\nI don't know how to describe it it's a chaotic situation it's this is worse than it's been allowed to fester\nBecause Congress has done little or nothing in the decades even since the Mariel boatlift that I covered when I was on the air and Miami back in Nineteen eighty one yeah and uh we've had we've had no tangible work done except\nAnd Trump Obama gave for any admitted\nHe was giving the two year doctoral program to six hundred and Ninety thousand I Believe it was but he also said that he didn't think you have the authority to do it but he figured Congress would deal with it within those two years that he gave and do something more permanently well they didn't and then this president\nIs elected partially on building the wall\nAnd tightening up security and they still haven't done that\nWell and you know Congress they they have the opportunity so many times that takes us I mean this wall that approves since Reagan time\nWhat's so sickening to me is that these politicians are basing followed their fights and everything that that that they're doing because of their hate for Trump and how what the American citizen safety they don't care about uh it's just about putting their foot down because of their hate for Trump um\nYou know I met with representative Andy Biggs from Arizona the other day he presented to Paul Ryan a no nonsense um secure the border act it was a stand alone bill about getting our staff at the border wall built\nAnd it being funded by things like tactics remittance money going back over to Mexico charging people more money to come in the country it's a completely logical bill\nAnd what is Congress do they put it in seven committee because they don't want it out on the floor and they don't want anybody voting on it um and this this\nLogical way of thinking of our politicians to\nKeep in mind their American elected politicians and yet they're fighting harder for illegal aliens present in our country this is what is so thick Maine and\nEverything that comes out of their mouth is alive because it's special interests it anybody is probably illegal is paying these politicians money to keep them on the road of open borders on\nI'm telling you we need a standalone secure the border act we don't eat a bunch of other things put in there like Andy was telling us telling me you know these these bills that they bring to the floor\nAbout border security\nBuilding a wall always has something to do it jak attached to it gave me ... um amnesty\nAllowing chain migration and then the Republicans try and get either by and and the money to get the wall built in there and then you know if it's approved by Congress that goes to the Senate and the Senate's going to rip it apart and get rid of e verify and get rid of most of the funding for the wall and we're going to be left with\nJak approval and chain migration and all of the things that they want anyway so a lot of our Republican politicians are between a rock and a hard place because\nThey want to have border security but when they vote for Bill that's going to that they know is going to just push the chain chain migration [noise]\nYou know it's a hard thing for them to swallow\nCome right back and pick it up there with

joined by Mary in ... she lost her son to a new legal alien\nIn an automobile accident where the illegal alien was way over the\nLimit on blood alcohol content while he was driving and had been out of this country and back in illegally previously a it's one of those stories that you keep hearing Steinway of course the other one of them but there were thousands of others which are which meant those is another issue here\nAre the mainstream media you don't want to talk about it but there were many more of these fatalities\nThan anything close to the five hundred\nFamilies who are supposedly separated at the border\nI mean you're talking five hundred families\nAnd they're separated but you've lost your children all of you are permanently and there were inordinately more numbers of fatalities among the family members who are legally in this country of citizens\nDenouncing near the five hundred that were separated and the ... to make the big deal out of a five hundred explain that\nYou know that was a conscious decision they made coming to our borders knowing that that was a possibility and you know we all know as as things started getting you know investigated and stuff a lot of those children weren't even with people who are with our parents\nUm and I often say thank God the United states was at the border to intercept those stuff that people bringing those children end but our loved ones did not have a choice of what happened to them um and yes we all are permanently separated\nBut you know something that I really want to touch on right now and why Michele rate and I started angel families dot com is because\nWe wanted to bring more people survivors of illegal alien crime because there's hundreds of thousands of people every year affected by illegal alien crime in our country and there are survivors of rape\nAssault identity theft you know so many more American citizens are affected by this than than the age of families have just had you know loved ones killed\nUm you know that that's the worst possible scenario but\nUm I was just an outside of Atlanta a few weeks ago visiting Cathy and Billy and men they were struck from behind by illegal going at least sixty miles an hour and their pick up taking their son fishing on Father's Day Kathy him and has been in a wheelchair for Eighteen years\nAnd her condition is getting worse and worse and worse from her brain injury\n'em and they you know when I when we did that to them and I was able to see their houses that they got ripped off by a contractor they got a ten thousand dollar grant to revamp their bathroom can make it handicapped acceptable for the for Kathy they were totally ripped off I was just appalled at what somebody did it it looked like a Fifteen hundred dollar job on\nCat the brain injuries are now pushing her to where she's going to be losing our site here probably within the next year you know I'm reaching out to organizations that will donate service dogs to see if I can get the help\n'em there's angel families his daughters had been killed and their grandchildren have been taken by the state and adopted out to families when the grandmother was available to raise the debt grandchild\nYou know when when children have been killed and they they had children have their own the grandparents have had to take on raising the grandchildren which has been a financial burden\nUm there's there's so much more that happened to American families than just the accident and lost that that loved one this pain and suffering goes on for years and years and years and if that's so many of our families financially and this is what I was talking about before the break there's nothing there\nFor American victims of illegal alien kind but there is hundreds and thousands and probably millions of dollars for illegal aliens\nWho have committed a crime in our country and you know this is one thing that I really would like to see um our politicians do is start taxing the remittance money that goes over the border and if it's not used to construct a border wall\nAll to create some sort of fun to victims of illegal alien kind would have to go to some family members need counseling\nAnd um it's not available to them um some families need legal representation they can't afford that thousands of dollars is going to cost them tens of thousands of dollars for an attorney to fight their case um this is the tragedy of what American victims families are left with that people don't even think about\nWell it's the set of very well but the bottom line is that the as you said the president met with the illegals Obama that is in the ... with the had I'm a I'm a composer him\nWhere we had the illegals or the people from the Muslim Brotherhood and all of that sort of thing but I'm the wouldn't meet with you and um\nHe he wouldn't even meet with moderate Islamic people at the time it's a whole separate question but it it's all against the best interest of the United states to meet with the radical elements\nOf the weather it's illegal aliens or whether it's from the middle east I\nAm a passion from American for their fellow Americans who have been dealt us blow 'em this is what sauce punishing to me right now that\nSo many people are ugly on Facebook and Twitter and they\nJust the most ugly things to angel families um in defense of you know keeping our borders open a lot more of them fall over I'm not doing this for notoriety I Am not doing this because I Want attention I'm doing this for my fellow Americans so that you're not harmed in the same way my family and then\nUm and that is our temple organic story in our truth and that is all that we every one of us do this on a daily basis we're dealing with things and fighting our fight and um\nI just wish that that and the majority of fellow Americans are very compassionate don't get me wrong because we have very loving supporters and followers but the liberal mindset um\nI I'm just blown away by how ... they become to their fellow American I really am\nAbout your thoughts regarding the migration is taking place we we've alluded to it here but I'm the reports now that some people who have dropped off\nAnd it brings Austrian or they're they're about the worst movie is fourteen thousand others there's park the most of them are young men which is not a very\nPromising thing for the country because many of those could be him is Thirteen that could be some lower court till they could be a crooks that could be thugs oh they they could be bad guys yeah um and there were some families mixed in as well but what's your feeling about the way this was unfolding and what do you think the president should do\n[noise] um you know\nAs I said earlier Mike they've got a call for a everybody to get out and and just respect their neighbors and ... and do whatever they want to vote is the worst thing you can do right now is if you're a political or other leaders continue the rather\nA because\nThat reinforces this other mentality that the talks about um you know that that the president ... instigated this through is rhetoric or that the uh the Democrats are trying to do a false flag attack and and\nAnd you know we got to win the elections as a result or get that we've got to you've got to erase this sense of otherness and seeing the the other as is outside of your tribe and will say look we're all Americans we all need to vote and and you've got to stop this divisive rhetoric or is it\nIt will spark more violence on one side or the other either and either and support or retribution and by the way when they do that they don't know what they're supporting their just supporting fire which so he absolutely has to get away from that\nUm you know the bottom line is it's not whether you're a Democrat or Republican you're American if we've got this sort of attack on the other Americans we don't know who it is a then\nYou can't we shouldn't be assuming it's one side or the other because we don't know we have to assume that it's somebody who is acting and ... on American way by attacking people\nWho are either governmental leaders of form of government former governmental leaders and leave it there it's on American to do that and that's the only met sending right now\nGiven that fact and and certainly that's that's the way the\nEnforcement agencies the FBI\nThe um\nUS marshals who might get involved ah the postal investigators all of that uh they love the scenario that you just described but let me ask you is it to what degree if any\nIs the investigation complicated by volatile rhetoric by politicians on both sides\nI don't know that it complicates that the the investigation at this point um\nI I don't know that I think it does at all um you know whatever again putting aside political rhetoric\nYou know I work a hand in hand with yes when I was at the Pentagon on my own defense well we're talking about uh any sort of terror attack a large scale like criminal attack we're talking with some of the most dedicated public servants that are\nNot equal to the ones that are in the military and there's no question that they are not listening to or are going to be driven by the rhetoric at all or they're just looking to find this individual individuals as quickly as possible\nYou know what I meant was a year of course that's the case these guys and women do their jobs or how with high focus but I'm Talking about somebody who might get antagonized one way or the other by the rhetoric or to to get involved in doing some of these acts themselves or\nI'm somebody who might uh trying to interfere with\nUh the evidence furry availability now at the scene in other words an antagonism on either side from people who are on one extreme or the other who get motivated to get involved and complicate things in some way\nOr I don't want to speculate on that\nAll over again uh I just want to keep emphasizing so we get the rubber it's especially in this particular case a and just focus on the elections and let the FBI Secret Service postal inspections do the job\n[noise] they would be also finally in the best interest\nOf the of the big because of when this happened just before an election it would seemed to me at least that it would be in the best interest of the country that the answer result\nAs quickly as possible before the election as we discussed earlier but for the purpose of bringing back a sense of stability that we know who it is 'cause right now\nAs you pointed out I mean there were people on all sides I get calls from listeners on all sides of this thing\nEverybody speculates and they they come to their own conclusions before we have the evidence and and the determination of who did it so wouldn't it be and are in the country's best interest to have this done as quickly as possible accurately what as quickly as possible\nUh you know even hesitated on this one and that when Mike and the reason is a you know the human mind is a very complicated thing\nSo you can't say or what the motivation of the individual what Eric Rudolph said I Want to stop the Olympics why was the Olympics bad we don't know or does this individual want to stop the elections we don't know maybe he just wants to generate even more divisive ...\nThat's the case that I think like just like we went through with the Olympics we've got to move away from the devices\nAnd that's because that's sort of achieving the individuals goal is to keep a separate we've got to just sort of get away from that and get away from the speculation [noise] I mean I'm not ...\nYou know even when we finally got like you know what's gonna happen is people don't let the oven to his background like everybody's going to pick out details this individual or individual's background and say here's their motivation and it may or may not have been\nRight [noise] I'm not only I mean\nWe we assume that this is political but we don't even know that at this point\nNo we don't so um [laughter] ... you know I I guess people like closure is what I'm trying to get to and I am I'm it sounds as though we may never have real closure on this thing\nThrough my mind closures this individual being arrested and convicted has nothing to do with politics and I ... and you know maybe I'm a simple guy but he made on that on that level makes things a lot easier\nNo I agree with you uh that's that's got to get done which they were about a minute left the do you think there's a possibility when you say this guy could it be a conspiracy more than one person\nI think it probably is more than one person only because we've got the the belief that some of these packages originated in Florida and then some of these were a hand delivered you know somehow used a courier in New York City and possibly in Washington I'm so it's probably\nMore than one guy but it could just be one main guy doing this I mean what we can say about ... bombers is that they want a certain amount of anonymity or a certain amount of distance at least and they're almost always white male if you look at white males if you look at the at the history of

Wilson says it's understandable but you're battling the way you are because of that was his inspiration but\nIt's also very frustrating\nThat and I know the cases for example where a DUI is plea bargain down to let's say careless driving\nOr even reckless driving which doesn't conjure up the criminal charge short conviction of a DUI which might get the person kicked out of the country it's as if the criminal justice system protects them from having to leave the country and still keep them out on the streets\n[noise] exactly and you know this happens a lot within the DACA program to because they're allowed to have two misdemeanors on their record and a lot of time the stock a participant commit a felony and their defense attorneys and the judge agreed to play it down to misdemeanors so that they stay within the DACA guidelines and are able to remain in our country\nIt's it's mind boggling what it is and and and it's not even [noise] equitable in terms of as you said we treat our own citizens so given given that\nWe have a Congress that has been lame\nWe are now with President who's battling to get things done\n... will get them of course to your press conference in the migration but\nWe have this\nI don't know how to describe it it's a chaotic situation it's was his worst most been allowed to fester\nBecause Congress has done little or nothing in the decades even since the Mariel boatlift that I covered when I was on the air in Miami back in Nineteen eighty one yeah and uh we've had we've had no tangible work done except\nBy Obama and Trump Obama games and he admitted he was giving the two year doctoral program to six hundred and Ninety thousand I Believe it was but he also said that he didn't think you have the authority to do it but he figured Congress would deal with it within those two years of the year you\nAnd do something more permanently well they didn't and then this president\nIs elected partially on building the wall\nAnd tightening up security and they still haven't done that\nWell and you know Congress they they have the opportunity based on many times to fix this I mean this law that approves since Reagan time\nWhat sells take me to me is that these politicians are based in all of their fights and everything that that that they're doing because of their hate for Trump and how what the American citizen safety they don't care about us it's just about putting their foot down because of their hate for Trump um\nYou know I met with representative Andy Biggs from Arizona the other day he presented to Paul Ryan a no nonsense um secure the border act it was a stand alone bill about getting our that though the border wall built and it being funded by things like\nTaxing the remittance money going back over to Mexico charging people more money to come in the country it's a completely logical bill\nAnd what is Congress day they put it in seven committees because they don't want it out on the floor and they don't want anybody voting on it um and this is\nA logical way of thinking of our politicians to\nKeep in mind their American elected politicians and yet they're fighting harder for illegal aliens present in our country this is what is so thick Maine and\nEverything that comes out of their mouth is alive because it's special interests it anybody is probably illegal is tainted politicians money to keep them on the road of open borders\nI'm telling you what do you need a standalone secure the border act we don't need a bunch of other things put in there like Andy was telling us telling me you know these days bill that they bring to the floor about border security\nBuilding a wall always has something to do with DACA attached to it giving DACA um amnesty allowing chain migration and then the Republicans try and get either by and and the money to get the wall built in there and then you know if it's approved by Congress that goes\nTo the Senate and the Senate's going to rip it apart and get rid of either if I get rid of most of the funding for the wall and we're going to be left with jak approval and chain migration and all of the things that they want anyway so a lot of our Republican politicians are between a rock and a hard place because\nThey want to have border security but when they vote for Bill that's going to that they know is going to just push this Canaan Canaan migration

over the\nLimit on blood alcohol content while he was driving and I've been out of this country and back in illegally previously\nA it's one of those stories that you keep hearing Steinway of course the other one of them but there were thousands of others which are which meant those is another issue here are the mainstream media you don't want to talk about it but there were many more of these fatalities than anything close to the five hundred\nFamilies who are supposedly separated at the border\nI mean you're talking five hundred families and there were separated but you've lost your\nChildren all of you are permanently and there were inordinately more numbers of fatalities among the family members who are legally in this country of citizens\nBut I'm seeing near the five hundred that were separated and the ... to make the big deal out of a five hundred explain that\nAnd you know that was a conscious decision they made coming to our borders knowing that that was a possibility and you know we all know as as things started getting you know investigated and stuff a lot of those children weren't even with people who are their parents\nUm and I often say thank God the United states was at the border to intercept those those bad people bringing children end but\nOur loved ones did not have a choice of what happened to them um and yes we all are permanently separated but you know something that I really want to touch on right now and why Michele rooted I started angel families dot com is because\nWe wanted to bring more people survivors of illegal alien crime because there's hundreds of thousands of people every year affected by illegal alien crime in our country and there are survivors of rape\nAssault identity theft you know so many more American citizens are affected by this than than\nThe families have just had you know loved ones killed um you know that that's the worst possible scenario but um\nI was just in outside of Atlanta a few weeks ago visiting county and Billy in men they were struck from behind by illegal going at least sixty miles an hour and their pick up taking their son fishing on Father's Day\nCathy in men has been in a wheelchair for Eighteen years\nAnd her condition is getting worse and worse and worse from her brain injuries\n'em and they you know when I when we visited him and I was able to see their house and stuff they got ripped off by a contractor they got a ten thousand dollar grant to revamp their bathroom to make it handicapped accessible for the for Kathy they were totally ripped off I was just appalled at what somebody did it it looked like a Fifteen hundred dollar job on\nCabbage brain injuries are now pushing her to where she's going to be losing our site here probably within the next year you know I'm reaching out to organizations that will donate service dogs to see if I can get the help\n'em there's angel families his daughters had been killed and their grandchildren have been taken by the state and adopted out to families when the grandmother was available to raise that the grandchild\nYou know when when children have been killed and they they had children of their own the grandparents have had to take on raising the grandchildren which has been a financial burden\nUm there's there's so much more that happened to American victims' families than just the accident and the loss of that loved one this pain and suffering goes on for years and years and years and affects so many of our families financially and this is what I was talking about before the break there's nothing there\nFor American victims of illegal alien crime but there is hundreds and thousands and probably millions of dollars for illegal aliens who has committed a crime in our country\nAnd you know this is one thing that I really would like to see um our politicians do is start taxing the remittance money that goes over the border and if it's not used to construct a border wall to create some sort of a fund that victims of illegal alien crime would have to go to some family members need counseling\nAnd um it's not available to them um some families need legal representation they can't afford that thousands of dollars is going to cost them tens of thousands of dollars for an attorney to fight their case um this is the tragedy of what American victims families are left with that people don't even think about\nIt's that the set of very well but the bottom line is that the as you said the president met with the illegals Obama\nIt was the night he met with the ... he had a a a compose him\nWhere he had the illegals or the people from the Muslim Brotherhood and all of that sort of thing but um it wouldn't be with you and um\nHe he wouldn't even meet with moderate Islamic people at that time it's a whole separate question but it it's all against the best interest of the United states to meet with the radical elements\nOf the weather it's illegal aliens or whether it's from the middle east side\nAnd a passion from American for their fellow Americans who have been dealt this blow 'em this is what ... to me right now that\nSo many people are ugly on Facebook and Twitter and said just the most ugly things to angel families um in defense of you know keeping our borders open a lot more of them fall over I'm not doing this for notoriety I Am not doing this\nBecause I Want attention I'm doing this for my fellow Americans so that you're not harmed in the same way my family and then\nUm and now those are simple organic story and our truth and that has all but we every one of us do this\nOn a daily basis we're dealing with things and fighting our fight and um I just wish that that and the majority of fellow Americans are very compassionate don't get me wrong because we have very loving supporters and followers but the liberal mindset um\nI I'm just blown away by how callous they become to their fellow American I really am\nTell us um about your thoughts regarding the migration is taking place we'll look we've alluded to it here but I'm the reports now that some people have dropped off\nAt of exhaustion or they're they're about the ... fourteen thousand or there was there's parts of most of them are young men which is not a very\nPromising thing for the country because many of those could be amiss Thirteen that could be some lower court till they could be a crooks they could be thugs all they could be bad guys yeah um and there was some families mixed in as well but what's your feeling about the way this is unfolding and what do you think the president should do\n[noise] um [noise] you know\nAnd in conversations with different people and ranchers who live down there at the border I mean it is a frightening thing you know there are a lot of groups I'm In a same get down to the border kind of heavily armed we need to protect our country and it's sad that this is what is counted that citizen kill like they need to do the
