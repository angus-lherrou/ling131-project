through the character and fitness element as well\nAnd the investigation they go back to every place you lived every place you worked they go through a fight every place you went to school they go through a fine tooth comb I'm investigating so it can be done\nSo I'd like to see maybe ah the Koch brothers have somebody on the right to spend the money to hire pinkerton or some other high level\nInvestigative agency private agency to investigate Blumenthal in Connecticut in Durban in Illinois and Feinstein of California and a rhino in Hawaii that woman is a complete buffoon mentioned shut up are you kidding me you shut up parental\nAn idiot senator from Hawaii they don't know how to elect anybody except the left wing radical without a brain in our head the ones that complete idiot and the way she presents herself\nAssuming that everybody out there if it's if it's a woman is it is correct no matter what she says the sweat like is a good example of that she doesn't know what she's talking about or maybe she knows that she lied to try to get away with it\nAnd then she was by the way in college at the time the supposedly happened and she's going back to high school parties what kind of person does that\nSomebody doesn't have the level of maturity to hang around with their own friends in college when I was in high school yeah we went to parties and yeah we had beer and drank\nWhen I was in college we did the same but we did it as college students with college students we did it as high school students with high school students we didn't do it as college students going back to high school I Would never think to do that you grow out of that this woman has her own problems\nAnd the doctor Ford's case even the one that has the most credibility there is no cooperation for people who might have known about it said they don't remember any of it they did not say it didn't happen because they can't know if it happened or didn't happen they weren't there that's what they said\nBut nobody has confirmed it\nThat Brett Kavanaugh did anything to her whether it was Nineteen eighty two or whatever you're it might have been\nThis is absolute fraud and all the American people\nUnderstand fully what's going on here because it isn't about judge Kavanaugh it's about stopping Donald Trump at every turn it's about vengeance and vendetta because Merrick

Jain Dr Ford would have been looked at by the left wing as overkill\nCourse on the left wing complained that they should have asked the questions themselves and not had the prosecutor from Arizona due to a woman who has basically protected victims of sexual assault who are women\nYou would think they would want somebody like that but now not these Democrats they want to have political cover and devious despicable Miss USA and the views\nOf the confirmation process to go after the president and go after the conservatives and do something that is absolutely heinous and takes the other part of our cats are Michael Brown which the two attorneys for Dr Ford a whole lot chutzpah\nWell\nWe know as I said that this investigation is about wrapping up\nCould be a vote by friday\n\nIt is almost a fictional story that you would have that same movie showing the\nReprehensible way in which the Democrats have handled this thing the unfairness of it and any one of them put under the same microscope\nWould be found to have had some kind of ... some kind of problem in their lives\nThat would justify there being removed from the Senate if they want to use this kind of standard for removing a nominee from a Supreme Court nomination why should they even be in the set of course the difference is going to be in the arguments going to be that the public votes on them\nAnd therefore the public ought to have\nThe final say on elected officials and the public thinks that something about a senator is a problem then they can vote against that person but if any one of them were put under the same microscope as judge Kavanaugh how would they come out\nTo see what their reaction would be they say the judge was angry why shouldn't he be angry\nHe had a right to be angry\nThis is absolutely nonsensical\nSenator Lindsey Graham who's been the hero for judge Kavanaugh on the United States Senate\n\nSuggested the president\nThat he should re nominate judge Kavanaugh if the Senate fails to confirm him for the Supreme Court\nSenator Graham said that earlier today\nNow as Senator Corker said I mentioned earlier Senator Graham also believes the capital is going to be confirmed to the Supreme Court very soon\nAnd as they also mentioned Mitch McConnell the majority leader is saying that at that he'll be voted on this week but in case it fell short Graham says he would encourage the president three and nominate judge Kevin outside the Supreme Court\nThe October Democrat candidate\nIn their local district in this poll gets forty nine percent but a month ago on September the Democrat candidate got fifty two percent\nSo the number of Democrats voted a number of people supporting Democrats and their local district has gone down in one month from fifty to to forty nine now when it comes to Republican\nIn this month of October the Republican gifts forty two percent generically in their districts across this country forty two percent but in September a month ago\nThe Republican got thirty eight percent so actually the numbers have gone up for Republicans and down for Democrats that doesn't even include this past week and the hammering of judge Kavanaugh which I think pretty clearly is going to have a further effect of eroding Democrats support\nAnd increasing Republican support to whatever degree you believe this kind of poll is accurate\nThe same poll found most voter prefer Democrats in charge of the Senate and most disapprove of President Trump's job performance which amazes me because I guess it's because the media don't report on all the things that have been done and this administration than a remarkably good for the American people\nI think that's more about his style and a lot of people find that offensive and so they don't want to have the\nPresident's style supported they reject his style is what they think perceived as being has a very abrasive this at this point\nFifty percent want the Democrats in charge forty three percent want the Republicans in charge fifty three percent approve of Trump\nForty one percent disapproved he's doing pretty well there and um that's um\nThe latest poll from a Quinnipiac\nAnd according to Tim O'Reilly who's the quarterback university poll assistant director he put out a press release and they said these numbers basically suggest that the so called big blue wave of Democrats support\nMay have lost some of its momentum because the house races are now tightening\nAnd there we are with that so bottom line is that there is an increase in support for Republicans\nOver the last month and a decrease in support for Democrats over the last month and of course next month is what counts and with another month of this ... trail I think frankly if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed\nIt's going to lead to what you want to I Hope but huge energizing of independents and conservatives and Republicans to get out there and vote the ... the I I you know it may be that if\nHe's not confirmed by the by election day you might get more conservatives out there are voting in favor of Republicans if he wins the the the scary part becomes that maybe Republicans\nAnd conservatives and independents who would have voted Republican become less energize because they'll sit home and say well we got judge Kavanaugh that's a good thing so I don't need the vote everything's is great but everything won't be great\nIf you don't get out and vote because um if the Republicans and conservatives and independents who are going to vote Republican don't go out and vote\nYou could see Nancy Pelosi as the next speaker of the house\nAnd that ain't fun by the way on the Robert Mueller investigation\nAnd there may be some good news hard to know it's hard to read but apparently Mahler is now trimming more attorneys off of his investigation team\nWhich may be a sign that the team of prosecutors is winding down at least some parts of the investigation into the alleged ties between the Trump\nCampaign and Russia and of course there's nothing there to prove any of that just doesn't exist\nLiterate to prosecutors who were detailed to the Russia investigation for the past year they're going back to their other jobs in the Justice Department they're off of this investigation there were two other attorneys who left this the Mueller team\nAssigned also to investigate ties with Russia and the Trump campaign over the summer so that's in the last several months\nFor over the prosecuting attorneys on the Mueller team investigating the Russian collusion allegation four of them are now gone from his team and Mueller confirmed this earlier today by the way that these people are gone\nIt's a it's an indication nothing definite put an indication that he's wrapping up some pieces of the investigation\nThat has basically been shadowing Donald Trump almost since he took office or what may have twenty Seventeen about four months into his presidency\nAh but we don't know much more than that because they keep very tight control\nOver the messaging at the Mueller investigation\nPeter car the Mahler spokesman said that these two prosecutors left they went back to the national security division\nAnd that'll be that they um\nGrand jury inquiry into Roger Stone is now taking place there are other elements active in this investigation their inquiries into whether the president took action to obstruct the pro meeting obstruction of justice and the answer is no\nBecause an article to the constitution the president can fire and then the obstruction would be by the fact that he fired Jim Comey\nBecause he wanted him to stop the investigation of Russia and from the campaign collusion with Russia well guess what article for the constitution gives them the absolute unequivocal right to fire the FBI Director anytime he wants\nPeriod and so\nThey're not going to make enough structure in case and even Giuliani the president's attorney's already said we're not going to answer questions on article too because the president has full authority under article to the fire call me period case closed so what happens there is no case to be made there\nIt doesn't look like though that Mueller\nIs showing signs of narrowing his focus after made all these deals with former Trump\nAffiliates are associates what he's doing is referring cases to other offices of the Justice Department now\nAnd letting U.S attorneys takeover cases that Muller originally brought\nAnd his letting prosecutors leave his team without replacement so in other words what was some of the cases that he's done he's giving to the regular us attorney in that area that has jurisdiction over that case rather than keeping it so he's getting rid of cases so he's starting to and his his investigation\n[noise] and um so far most gotten six guilty pleas [noise]\nFree of excuse me for campaign advisors also a jury conviction [noise] and he's got twenty six pending charges against others and three Russian companies so he's winding down and I think sooner rather than later most going to be done Mike Siegel thanks for listening\nTo yourself in the world in the world will be good to
