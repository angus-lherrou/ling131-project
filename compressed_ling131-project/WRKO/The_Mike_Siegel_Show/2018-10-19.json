know two centuries old you know as opposed to it\nYou know a a you know hundreds of years sometimes thousands of years that our competitors have tried different types of economic programs different types of economic structures none of them have worked this great experiment that we have here in the United states called you know freedom democracy the free market capitalist economy\nUp you know allowing people to\nUh to to the to the side and determine their own faith you know that is what's made us\nThat enabling of the entrepreneurial spirit that enabled ... of a of a business ideas creativity or\nAn exchange of of a freak you know goods and services across the free market that is what has made us the strongest economy the strongest nation a world leader in every respect there is a and so you just take a look at this that and you have to ask why would we want to move\nToward a system that we know is tried and failed\nTo socialism when we have experienced under presidents that if I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican you know it was JFK that cut taxes back during his tenure every time you cut taxes you get more money they weren't you get more money into businesses to grow and expand\nYou see economic expansion unlike anything else so that the President Trump did when he came into office at two major major thing number one deregulation\nRegulation that's probably the most under rated under rated thing but it did ah you know whereas President Obama added I Want to say you know several hundred billion dollars with regulations that hampered business growth a president\nFrom has actually cut about a thirty billion dollars in a in regulations and so he's he's really done a great job to let it grow and expand\nAnd number two the second biggest thing was the tax cuts and JOBS Act that tax cut was the biggest tax cut in decades and you have Republicans that had been campaigning on tax cuts for decades never did anything President Trump comes in office and I hear it\nIt cuts taxes and Ninety percent of Americans have more money in their paychecks because of the new withholding tables the iris of this this is the story of the year we've got all time consumer confidence highs business optimism at all and I uh I mean manufacturing indexes are our search I mean this is this is the story of the year\nWell but the but don't forget to own course Garcia a deputy ... is deputy director of the Commerce Department don't forget um when when you have the speaker the minority leader a say in the house he was speaker of the house\nReminding us that when everybody was only crumbs right I mean [laughter] I ... ... ... there's a there's a ... and and she represents a party this the other major party in the country how does how does anybody is stand and say that\nAnd then want to increase taxes is when she has said she wants to I mean that I bring it I'm not cause the elections a few days away and um people need to understand the consequences of their vote\nNo that's and that's exactly it so so you know put this into perspective a you know you have one party and and the Democrats and and I I Try to be as as fact based as I can but you have one party and the Democrats that is actively trying to concentrate power\nAnd and Edgar regulate and run your life\nAnd by doing that they have to actually for simply take more money out of your pocket to do it they have to control these programs government programs social welfare programs they want to be in control and I can tell you one thing for being an office or you know\nWe inherited a bath comment but it's fresh and and it's because of the ... and it's because of the size of government and it's because of\nFrankly the lack of oversight that you know everybody knows all the careers you know the political come in by Republicans in office careers you know they know oh boy we better get our act together we better you know a way but we better but you know ... try to clean up after I saw was for the relative come in you know what we find things that just we're\nJust very very troubling you know and it happens that are Democrat administration they spend spend spend oh there's no accountability uh you know they all look out for each other ... you know kind of get in trouble and they may try to blame it on Republicans cars where the bad guys that have to play the adults to clean up after that\nUh but you have a one party that wants to forcibly control more of your life when you have another party a distinct difference Republicans that say with the guys we don't believe that we should be the stewards of your life what you believe that you\nCan spend your buddy spend your money better than the government can't\nYou know this is what this is built on we're both on letting you spend more money and that that is it periodically what creates an efficient economy what it creates a\nA a good free you know\nA ... you know when you have individual liberties people can pursue their own interests and you have a fish in a you know ... you know economy that way so I Can't it can't allow you know a government takeover by Democrats if you're really really think ah you know that you're going to be\nBetter off hundreds Democrats to take a look at where we were two years ago\nAnd look at where we are today it's very very disturbing because of President Trump's leadership in the White House because his energy is high energy is contagious whipped you know the house and Senate\nInto shape [noise] they've actually gotten it passed legislation

Chris Garcia's here he was the deputy director at the Commerce Department are under a\nWilbur Ross who um I think it's done a terrific job I think his background in the business world has been a big part of that um let me turn to if we can the trade agreements I Want to even just a quick backdrop\nIn Ninety four when\nBill Clinton brought the brought out all the former presidents to support NAFTA being implemented I was vehemently opposed to in fact I debated other Republicans who were more moderate\nRather than being I'm a conservative because I I look at it\nThat those were not free trade agreements they may have been trade agreements but they weren't free trade my concept of trade is that you you have one sentence on a piece of paper that the signatories sign and it says each country has the right to decide for itself\nWhich countries that will trade with and on what basis that our mutual that on one basis or that trade is mutually agreed to\nThat's it if you want to free trade that's free trade\nThere is no restriction but here we have an unelected bunch of bureaucrats\nMaking decisions um I I remember when Massachusetts so we have double your kale in Boston on our network and I remember in Massachusetts when the legislature passed a resolution not to do business anymore with men more because Burma they were\nAbsolutely outrageously uh anti human carrying out these ferocious policies against many of their own citizens and the Massachusetts found out and was told where you can't do that because you don't have the authority to do it\nBecause the Congress abdicated its responsibility and interests now under enters an interstate commerce and the commerce clause internationally in the constitution by turning it over to the world Trade Organization that to me was outrageous so we lose our sovereignty and only\nRight no I mean so this is what this is what the America First agenda that President Trump has implemented is all about you know might even elected to return sovereignty and respect to the United states not just on the trade front but on every other front you know we we we were not respect under ... frankly\nA Nikki Haley did a great job with the un ah we're not bullied around by those folks a NATO getting getting a more nations to contribute part of their GDP\nYou know toward the fat that was a major major get the president and and so we were trained trade this is really the uh the philosophy overall the president has implemented you know this America First you know where where parties in any kind of a deal any kind of an agreement\nApt to put their people first you have to put your interests first editing here I mean what allows for efficient agreements whether it's the private sector than a multinational multilateral deal\nSo with NAFTA you know we had a very nice um you know one very positive effect of NAFTA was that we had lowered surprised many many uh products are made with cheaper labor overseas\nI wouldn't north and south the border of course ah and then uh but what an unfortunately happened when China joined the world Trade Organization in two thousand and one all the things that they had promised a you know that would that would happen after they joined us members\nNever came to pass for example um you know that's kind of a high level you know a a financial apple you know base of MasterCard American Express we're all promised it would have access to the Chinese market\nBy two thousand and five a\nNet access never came and there's a Chinese painted process to their controls Ninety percent of the Chinese markets or something just an example like that but you have shot subsidizing\nTheir industries unfairly having the government subsidize their goods the industries that makes the products are a lot cheaper than us products that's obviously very non competitive for U.S companies\nIf you can't really be those that cheap rent they've got their finger on the scale and then with that with NAFTA China was shipping through Mexico and actually taking advantage of the NAFTA agreement by by gaming\nWith Mexico a into a you know these are all the things that President Trump came adopt a you know he saw a you know as trade advisors you know start with them you know Peter Navarro is in a fantastic job and advise and helping drive the president's agenda as is Jared Kushner or this is what he saw any of it how in the world\nAre we letting middle America letting the real heart sold market hollowed out and these factories shipped overseas thousand factories shipped overseas towns being hollowed out turn into ghost towns meanwhile we got Chinese spent now we've got you know a heroin epidemic you know the opioid epidemic of taking\nA take lives because people don't have meaning in their life anymore they don't have jobs anymore and\nWe we call it has reached grade they called her face [laughter] well I'll tell you what\nWith with President Trump in office\nAll that out the window I mean this is this the say\nEverything's on the table this president he's delivering went after when whether it's this do us a MCAA deal you know we've got the ... coming out that got Japan coming up and then once we get those deals done we're going to turn and face take a look at China in unison with our allies and I guarantee you trying to hurt her her until they change their practices\nYeah because it's basically actually I'd I'd make an analogy they're doing on trade by getting all of those deals done and then China's going to be put it in the position of looking as though\nThey're fools if they don't go a long they're going to have to go along to get along because the world would have mood move past them so they'll be pressured into that a ... I think that's important just in the same way as in the middle east\nAre now you've got the Friedman and and Christian or working on the idea that the now that Israel talks to the Saudis putting aside ... for a moment um you've got the Saudis the Egyptians the Jordanians\nAre you've got the um a cookie cutter or the United Arab Emirates but Ron I'm you've got the Gulf states says well all putting together a peace agreement and the Palestinians at some point when they see that their friends\nIn the Arab and Islamic countries are going along with a peace agreement that uh they they need to support they're going to be in the same position of pressure politically as China will be economically does that make sense\nNow that that that's a great point I mean it it it's all about building coalition building alliances with those that can put pressure on your common enemy if you will that was a show with an Australian anchor I think it was ABC Australia\nAnd uh and and you know some liberal commentator anchor said\nYou know aren't you worried about your allies who you're affecting what these Chinese terrorists aren't you concerned that\nBecause even Trump earlier today was saying I've asked to see the video and to hear the audio if it exists okay we don't know if it exists maybe it does maybe it does I think in the meantime write anything can be happening in these three days\nIn which it look in which case it looks like Saudi Arabia is guilty over what we may never know who's going to take the fall\nMaybe that will just be you know the fall guy maybe it was ordered from the top ... I don't I doubt that we will ever know but it's very clear that this guy\nJust as a journalist doing all of these ... you know whatever his background was writing against the the royal family and slow paced server farms\nDoes not seem to be enough to kill him on your enemies soil which can create precisely this type of outcome which is on think I'm really horrible even from Saudi Arabia is perspective\nAs well as the only the only we need to know\nWhat was the only thing you're right and then ... war speculating here but you're raising things when we're not being raised they should at least be raised in either discounted uh or or um reinforced than supported one way or the other\nOne being that as it may um if you were writing\nA negative things about the royal family that might not that certainly would not be enough for any normal person to kill somebody I mean they don't have free speech but we believe in free speech but\nMaybe there was that they they knew that there was more than the sky intended to do to disrupt the royal family and therefore disrupt Saudi Arabia and therefore maybe and you know this is very speculative\nBut the maybe give Iran a foothold into Saudi Arabia in some way could that be\nI mean I see it less likely that ... that he would be working\nOn behalf of Iran thing is though it was so in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood\nBut yeah ISI quota but as to the point of whether he had more in the works that he was planning to do could spell secrets was planning on writing and the worst articles uh you know ... ... ... ... that could very well the and it could be enough to ah\nTo spark that kind of reaction unfortunately from the from the Saudi royals I mean okay they allow that was part of their farms are women to drive but at the same time they arrested women or protest bang\nNot being able to drive these are things that to us here in the United states than anywhere in the west that doesn't seem to make sense we hold of the reforms that are being pursued by the crown prince\nAre happening on even late\n... so it's difficult for us to engage okay the guy seems like he is writing bad things that that enough to try to kill him in this\nBetter dust that yeah that is like of course not but\nYou know here's the thing is maybe maybe if you want to have him\nGet that look I I have no knowledge of this but I'm I I assume\nThat the CIA has had to do similar things over the years with informants source sources the CIA has had because they became all of a sudden the danger or it was found out that they were a basically a traitor or a double spies are two ways so to speak\nUm and so the same type of thing might have happened when it happens very quietly this couldn't be quiet because was happening in another country so that's why it's puzzling that Saudi Arabia really wanted to get rid of this guy or they would have done it on Saudi territory\nAnd made sure he got lost inside of Saudi Arabia next time he was there\nRather than doing it in Turkey as you said they're bitter enemy or even though it's their own sovereign territory at the embassy but doing it in a place where they're not going to get much support because no one has no love lost for the Saturday morning monarchy\nRight yeah turkey thinking that we don't Turkey's Muslim Brotherhood supporter so ...\nWe we have heard that the reason he was visiting he went to the study that found all had to do something about a marriage license or something\nTo do with his fiance no one's asked that question is why why did she go to this study constant in Washington DC this you have a green card and you live in the United states seems less likely that such a granddaughter occurred here again don't know\nAnd no one's asked that kind of that guy that question it's just it's\nAll rather all rather puzzling and I don't think well I don't think we'll ever get to the bottom of it unless the media does its job by asking these type of questions you know which should be easily put to rest the\nCase of course being that if this has to do with him being than intelligence asset for one country or another we'll never know what I Do know though is that for the United states to calibrate its response correctly makes sense to do the Magnitsky type of\nA sanctions number one and number two we should also calibrated looking at what happens in another country does this look at Russia they used chemical weapons to\nKill our and our spies in London right the application and a and allies capital\nRussia who I consider to be an enemy they have they're an enemy of the United states in the way they act\nAround the world so our response should be stronger to them then to someone who is an ally Saudi Arabia so there are many ways\nTo look at how the u._s. should act in their spots because the question that people also asked which I was asked yesterday is what is it above the United states that we need to ever stop he wasn't the United states is and\nIt was a foreign country they did something in a different foreign countries soil so why is it or want to ask me what the United States is going to do about it as opposed to Britain or France or ten bucks for that matter like this is our problem all of a sudden just well we're allies\nWith all those powerful nation in the world and you know everybody turns to what the United States is going to do that's why the Trump Administration policies have been so disruptive\nTo the European Union to NATO to a NAFTA to uh the Korea agreement I mean in other words even in even in the middle east we would the embassy is now in Jerusalem\nAnd um we have the downgraded uh the Palestinian conflict so um you know we're we're looked at is very important that part of the world we're going to wrap it up and got

R. K. on Boston on our network and I remember in Massachusetts when the legislature\nPassed a resolution not to do business anymore with men more because Burma they were\nAbsolutely outrageously uh anti human carrying out these ferocious policies against many of their own citizens and the Massachusetts found out and was told where you can't do that because you don't have the authority to do it\nBecause the Congress advocate of its responsibility and interests are under enters an interstate commerce and the commerce clause internationally and the constitution by turning it over to the world Trade Organization that to me was outrageous so we lose our sovereignty and only\nRight now I mean this is what this is what the America First agenda that President Trump is implemented is all about\nYou know my he was elected to return sovereignty and respect to the United states not just on the trade front but on every other front you know we we we were not respect under less ... frankly a negotiated a great job with the UN\nUm you know we're not bullied around by those folks are NATO getting getting a more nations to contribute part of their GDP\nYou know toward the fat that was a major major get the president and and so returning trade this is really the uh the philosophy overall the president has implemented you know this America First you know where where parties in any kind of a deal any kind of an agreement\nApt to put their people first you have to put your interests first and that is inherently what allows for efficient agreements whether it's the private sector whether it's in a multinational multilateral deal\nSo with NAFTA you know we had a a a very nice um you know one very positive effect of NAFTA was that we had lower surprised many many uh products were cheaper labor overseas\nWhat North and south the border of course ah and then but what an unfortunately happened when China joined the world Trade Organization\nIn two thousand and one all the things that they had promised that would that would\nHappen after they joined us members never came to pass for example a you know this is just kind of a high level you know a a financial example that you know base of MasterCard American Express we're all promised it would have access to the Chinese market by two thousand and five\nA net access never came and there's a Chinese painted profits controls Ninety percent of the Chinese markets or something just an example like that but you have shot subsidizing\nTheir industries unfairly having the government subsidized haircuts do those industries that makes the products are a lot cheaper than us a product that's obviously very non competitive for U.S companies if you can't really beat those the cheap they've got their finger on the scale\nAnd then when China was shipping through Mexico and it's actually taking advantage of the NAFTA agreement by by aiming it with Mexico or in so uh you know these are all\nI think that President Trump came adopt a star you know ... is traded visors and you know start with them you know Peter Navarro is in a fantastic job and an advise and helping drive the president's agenda as is Jared Kushner or this is what you saw any that how in the world are we letting middle America\nLetting the ... market hollowed out and these factories shipped overseas thousand factories shipped overseas is towns being hollowed out turn into ghost towns meanwhile we got Chinese spent now we've got you know a heroin epidemic the opioid epidemic of taking\nA take lives because people don't have meaning in her life anymore they don't have jobs anymore\nAnd we we call it reached grade they called their race well I'll tell you what\nWith with President Trump\nIn office all that out the window I mean this is this the sea\nEverything's on the table this president he's delivering went after when whether it's with this this do us a MCAA deal you know we've got the ... coming up it got Japan coming up and then once we get those deals done we're going to turn and face take a look at China in unison with our allies and I guarantee you try to hurt her her until they change their practices\nYeah because it's basically actually I'd I'd make an analogy they're doing on trade by getting all of those deals done and then China's going to be put it in the position of looking as though\nThey're fools if they don't go a long they're going to have to go along to get along because the world would have mood move past them so they'll be pressured into that a ... I think that's important just in the same way as in the middle east\nAre now you've got the Friedman and and Christian and working on the idea that the now that Israel talks to the Saudis putting aside ... for a moment um you've got the Saudis the Egyptians the Jordanians\nAre you've got the um a cookie cutter ah the United Arab Emirates but Ron I'm you've got the Gulf states says well all putting together a peace agreement and the Palestinians at some point when they see that their friends\nIn the Arab and Islamic countries are going along with a peace agreement that uh they they need to support they're going to be in the same position of pressure politically as China will be economically does that make sense\nNow that that's a great point I mean it it it's all about building coalition building alliances with those that can put pressure on your common enemy if you will that was a show with an Australian anchor I think it was ABC Australia\nAnd uh and and you know some liberal commentator anchor said you know aren't you worried about your allies who you're affecting what these Chinese terrorists aren't you concerned that", "show_name": "The Mike Siegel Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "19"}
