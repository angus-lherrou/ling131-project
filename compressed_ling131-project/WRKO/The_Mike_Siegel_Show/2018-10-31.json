I had to take a stand out to compete with ... what do you get hit me with\nNo I agree with you I agree with you maybe my only fear is I don't know if people really care I mean you care I care but I'm Talking about the voters out there I don't know if they really care about well ethics violations any legal fundraising\nSaid the same thing about Scott Brown and you know the first time and you know it's it's gonna take everything's going to have the phone to place just right and the people\nGot to get out and vote decay and say well he or she doesn't have a chance I'm not going to vote because she's somebody I just can't stand [laughter]\nOh no I mean how do you look I think now there's no question if she's getting signals and I believe now she was from all the sources that have been telling me this or if she's getting hand signals and they've been there coaching or during the debate\nHe pushed the fear of God in her I think they've now realize they've got a real race on their hand\nOh I think she'll be around the next six days\nSo yeah oh yeah I agree with you I don't know she's a Eddie the next six days you're going to see her in Massachusetts\nShe's not going back to Washington the only time you're going to see her for six days is going to be the next six days there is no question about it I think it's going to be close I think honestly it depends on voter intensity and passion and who wants to get more\nAnd look I don't know what she's got plant but I Do know that Jeff is gonna barn stormed a state for the next six days\nSo that's why I'm urging all of you if you can\nGive to his campaign volunteer signs whatever you can do go to deal for Senate dot com B. I. E. ... it's now for all the marbles six one set up to six six sixty eight sixty eight Chris in Peabody Europe next go ahead Chris\nHey Jeff longtime several times here's my question about it I don't think anybody's asked is 'cause you swear on the lives of your children to get ill work to be elected he would not you know there's\nA Scott Brown yes\nWell okay you know that that's great that you're able to do that yet and they needed somebody to do that you months ago so I that's great that you went out and I'm thinking you were able to come back with that but I think it out it's just too late for him\nOf course I'll be very honest with you OK like I'm In the confessional um [noise] we had a debate we had a discussion about a debate forgive me a discussion\nThis was a a almost a year ago it was at ... restaurant a patriot place and just talk to me it was meant a man heart to heart and he told me everything that he believes in everything that he wants to do and then he asked me point blank do you think I can win\nAnd let me tell you exactly what I told him I said if you run\nA no holds barred I mean grassroots campaign where you hammer her and hammer and hammer you will win\nAnd my only fear is he's honorable he's got the character the moral integrity the knowledge of the issues I think he's ready to be a great senator I just don't know if he was aggressive enough ... I'm Sorry\n... it it's too late for him\nYeah my instincts are no look out that he called the last caller and he said you know he could have had a Ronald Reagan moment when she said I didn't interrupt you and he said I did\nHe could have had her right away John Keller did a horrible job is a moderator but he did ask the opening question on the DNA test\nAnd I'm telling you if that was trumped up on stage honest to God if that was Jeff corner up on stage I would've politically cutters throat\nShe'd be on the ground politically bleeding because I Would go right at her character saying what you did was you try to read your professional advancement\nYou perpetrated a fraud\nAnd what you did was racist and it was insulting to the Cherokee Indians you've been denounced by the Democrats you've been denounced by the media your own party is turning on you and I'm giving you a final chance we'll you apologize to the Cherokee Indians who you use to advanced your career it's over\nChris after that moment it's over because nothing that comes out of her mouth anybody would ever believe\nAnd I think that was the golden opportunity that I think he potentially squandered that's my big fear to be very candid with you Chris\nBut you're getting a chance to talk\n... thank you very much Chris but as for him being a closet rhino Norway\nGeoff Diehl is America First Jeff deal is a conservative populist\nGeoff Diehl take this to the bank\nWill put you in Massachusetts first no bookstores he's not going online as pocket he's not going to run for any other office this is the job that he wants and that's why I'm ... there's an expression Eastern Europe I have so much confidence in this kind of put my hand and fire\nPlug in other words I mean not leaving burn my hand just to show you how much I Believe in this guy for Jeff deal I'm telling you I Know him I Would put my hand in fire okay ah [noise]\nI could go on for another hour but alas I Can't um I Want to thank all of you for calling the calls were absolutely phenomenal tune in tomorrow noon to three we're going to continue with this debate and discussion [noise] this is Jeff corner Boston's bulldozer\nWork cleaning up the liberal ...

I Want to go back to where we were talking about the finish it up or you were making the point about Donald Trump of course having Jewish grandchildren now his daughter converted to Judaism because your marriage or Christian or an Orthodox Jew a and all of that\nI don't know why I I I look at that\nAnd all these done for Israel you pointed out about moving the embassy to Jerusalem I pointed out earlier was demanding how he also took away the money from the Palestinian authority which is about as bad as Hamas without the military capability because my mood a boss the so called moderate over there\nPays money to families of homicide bombers who killed Jews so they're using our money to kill Jews in Israel a blood money\nUh and so he stopped that and ah he stopped are being part of the donating money to the UN's refugee program for the Palestinians because it's also being used just for more like acts against Israel to liquidate the state of Israel\nAnd the other side we talked about George Soros Bernie Sanders um it gives us up to Linda ... who is the worst venomous anti Semitic bigot and anti Israel big it may be on the planet\n... given any level of credibility um she is out there villa find Jews the over and over again vilify Israel or doesn't think it ought to exist commands Hamas and it's brutal homicide bombings\nAnd yet Bernie ... gets away with it and of course he also got away with the fact that when the shooter shot Steve skull lease\nThe hospice you're already with\nNo of course Cuomo didn't say a word Jake Tapper didn't say a word about Bernie being connected if somehow they want to connect Donald Trump to this one\nHow does this happen\nIt's it's actually it's relatively simple the um the last control as we know that controls the mainstream media and so they attempt to drive the narrative in terms of what the mainstream media is gonna be talking about and as a result when it's inconvenient\nBut the mainstream media mentioned the British British Sanders supporters tried to kill a number of Republican congressman\nOn a baseball field is Asia started mentioning you know this guy was a ... but you have somebody who is obviously deranged going in to a synagogue in Pittsburgh\nWho hates President Trump's because of his pro Israel stance and yet somehow President Trump is responsible for this guy individuals' greatest act and you know it's a challenge we have here is relatively simple\nCapable who believe in individual liberty leaving individual responsibility but if you don't believe in individual liberty collective responsibility and they so they are so last Israeli it easy transformation for them to blame\nSomebody for political purposes because of the end justifies some days it fits their philosophy or is on the right to say you know\nI think there was something to do with video games may have played a role or this may have played a role but ultimately every individual response for their own actions and that individual is responsible for this action that individual she has a fool for so long because like joy that other people will say I don't want to ever do that again because it was because it didn't turn out well\nAnd that say you know so we believe in it\nSo actually and individual responsibility and they don't so they said it was very easy for them to say to appoint any place blame either when it doesn't belong\nBy a good job of explaining it um I Wonder what's getting through to the American people well I'm I'm In the process of putting together a piece for publication about this the publicity about the duplicitous between\nUm the the uh attempts to connect Donald Trump to this shooting and I happened to be Jewish and I know I mean I Love what Donald Trump has done I Love a when what George W. Bush did with respect to Israel\nUm yeah and there are other presidents that had that look that Bill Clinton tried to get the most left wing liberal a prime minister elected in Israel by using James Carville to go over there and and and the politic uses skills to try to get the dialect that um I so I'm I doubt I'd\nDie discern between among people uh I Know that Bernie Sanders despises Israel he's the type they always talk about it very clearly that he he's sympathetic to the Palestinians\nI I Know the ... the bronco Obama had no love lost for the state of Israel obviously I'm betrayed them at the end betrayed Netanyahu has betrayed them at the un I mean all of this is well known\nBut yet none of it gets talked about but all of a sudden the Jewish people become the centerpiece when it's somebody on the right or Donald Trump who they want to rap with this false narrative\nHe becomes the the the hitting the hedging post or the uh the the guy that gets pounded when in fact it's on their side where the problem is\nIt's it's relatively simple they expect a lot of resources um and I think people don't actually believe it now that you say that Donald Trump those the equivalent of Hitler\nAnd so when they get something that occurs which directly target is Jewish people even though I'm sure it has nothing to do with it um they immediately jumped the narrative that they've been pushing that it must be Donald Trump's fault because Cal keys like Hitler in fact\nUm I I remember who wrote if there is in the Washington Post that Donald Trump was worse and worse that Hitler had somebody on CNN saying he can he is he a radical as more people than ISIS\nHe had a job the her name is John you sit\nThere you said I truthfully I spend I don't use of names and mass murderers or people completely ... complete idiots because that's what they want so she happens to fit that category so I\nI came to wipe idiots out of my brain because I don't want to have it's it's like and in fact I don't want to\nPut the a waiver like you're saying but nonetheless we have all these people who are sitting there doing a a wants to cast aspersions at President Trump when President Trump this is ultimately done and the situation [noise]\nNobody thinks is the president took office um look the black unemployment is the slowest in history since recordkeeping began as is Hispanic and then female for that matter but um so that's all changed and Hillary in the even during the sixteen election Hillary did not get\nThe intensity of votes that the bronco Obama got a sheet and the people stayed home they may not have voted for Trump but they stayed home\nSo I uh she didn't get the numbers in the African American community and um and there's been an odd to me there's been a drop off a they're talking about McCaskill in Missouri has not done enough to reach out to the African American community which he's going to have\nIn order to have any chance of winning I think she's done in the water but she\nAny chance he has his was with the African American community and I'm just wondering whether the Democrat and I see I don't ... I think there is a loosening up of the stranglehold by the Democrats on on the black community but eventually Democrats make all the promises for decades just to keep the blacks hanging around\nAnd um the Vatican Americans and brave people they understand what's going on and on and it seems to me that they're starting to change their tune and move in another direction and that's just my sense of what's happening not in big numbers but they're starting to be an erosion from the Democratic party at least as I\nThink you're right and I think that that was a\nGroup of people like to be taken for granted and I think that that was what Kanye was trying to say may not have been as as articulate as what it is to be I mean he was kinda all over the place but it was fairly clear and that just because I have a black man\nDo think that I'm going to fall in line behind the Democratic party because you just\nYou know when you do the Iraq someone you don't need to do anything to work for that you don't have to worry about their welfare if you just think that you can snap your fingers and they're going to fall in line behind you said things with and and and arming immigration attorney and I do like a lot of Latino than than it is\nThis perception that Latinos are going to vote you know on that in a lock for the Democratic party is just wrong headed\nBecause a lot of Latino that Hispanic happened to be conservative special conservative so the idea at no growth again like making for granted we didn't do that to be taken for granted you know\nDoes and that at the end and then I think the things are changing in that regard and I think it'll change from those groups even in this election um but let me turn to since you were an immigration attorney we have of course some huge problem for the few minutes we have left\nAs you well know title IV section Thirteen twenty five of the u._s. code has as the first offense for the country illegally a either a civil fine and or six months behind bars second offense and later is a civil fine and or two years behind bars it it's a crime either way period case closed\nI take the position that if you came to this country and cross illegally that you're committing a crime from the get go when it's an ongoing criminal act\nAnd that the country has a right to uh Korea well first of all the Congress needs to create a better system and second of all that we have a right to say that you have no right to be here\nGo through the loop process or you would be probably one of the people would be an attorney for one of the people here illegally if if you're doing immigration law and the Olympic ordeal the case that if the court decides you have to leave and you have to leave\nUm the problem is we don't have enough judges and a backlog of several years on these cases was which was good and brings us to the present situation the migration what do we do\nAs an immigration lawyer what do you say we do\nHow many second to last three minutes\nI work that morning I'm going to be back in immigration court I was there yesterday I was there today or every morning I'll be there to mar a Lago barrel next week I go to court every single day and I agree with you there is a\nHuge problem we're gearing ... essentially and it's just you know we are\nUm we're not able to to put up\nWith the number of people who are in our system the system is clogged up I Know it's it's an interesting thing is that um about\nA re entries in treating illegal entry a as a crime because right now and now it's it's a federal law that not a criminal product that little ... there were only get to a criminal offense and if your listeners that we that would take it out of the ...\nThe civil area where you're just talk about court case and\nAs a penalty and not I'm no longer periods of imprisonment\nWell let me ask you very quickly I mean ... the ... site and says you couldn't get six months the first the first two years the second offense to me that's what I mean on a felony\nOr that because of that it is a tomato effect because it's different immigration violations are different from federal criminal violations of federal criminal violations and re entry after prior removal does essentially become a window offense\nBut the thing is an immigration court you are not entitled to the same level of due process Moore you entitled to have attorneys appointed for you you know that um you don't have a six amendment right to appoint account for all this because it's not a criminal proceeding though\nIf if we're going to turn it into a criminal proceeding or in a half destroyed if we're also going to have to deal with all of the constitutional protections that that are going to attach\nTo that immigrant um that they don't have right now\nSo I was a fair enough but then the the the little time left a minute and a half who do you do support strong protection of this country's borders at the borders\nAbsolutely a one hundred percent and I got I think you can't be an immigration attorney and not back\nThe walk of our country that will\nOf border because Without Borders that don't have a country and I said this over and over and over again I Am a conservative and I am an immigration attorney and I don't see there be any kind of um disconnect between those two I adore my country I\nWant to welcome people here who want to be a part of my country I Want to make the process\nEasier and less time at last\nYou know open to illegal entry things like that um but I absolutely understand that we need to have a sale face steps to protect our borders we cannot have any clue reporters it's not safe and it's not fair to American\nAnd I think that's something that going back to my first point about an hour ago is that women look at that the safety and security of their families is a vital part of their lives and they if we can no longer assume that we saw what happened was an immigrant though but we saw it happen at\nThe synagogue we've seen that happen elsewhere in the name of the various extremist causes and I think people want safety of security and letting people in who are unknown and not vetted properly becomes chaotic country\nIt was four hours it's a pleasure I look forward to talking to you again or the time flew by so that's a good thing and I appreciate your being with us and uh it's
