of the ones I just mentioned\nWe're uncertain\nIt was unclear as to how those people\nAnd now I think\nUnless something happens between now and election day that scandal is\nI think all of those states I just mentioned are going to go Republican\nAnd that is going to be huge and there's every possibility the Republicans will have sixty senators which would mean the filibuster rule would be necessary\nBecause we're six the Republicans Chuck Schumer has no power whatsoever\nHe's just stick stick him in the back corner of the Senate chamber and let them go to sleep for the rest of the session because he will have no authority no power no control\nWhere the threat\nOf a filibuster debate\nThat's if the Republicans get to sixty what's happening there now is a pretty good shot that that will happen\nNow the house is more problematic but as to things that are unfolding\nI think it's more likely the house will stay in Republican hands maybe not by a huge number but I think it will say number one\nIs the way justice Kevin always treated at when he was judge Kavanaugh\nAnd the reprehensible way Democrats treated him independence I've got to look at that\nAnd reject out of hand that kind of treatment\nIt was just totally outrageous\nThat there would be that kind of treatment\nOf a candidate for the United States Supreme court coming before the Senate Bork was mistreated\nBut never in that way or to that degree\nAnd I think people are fed up with that kind of treatment the bullying verbal abuse the degradation the suggested that people should be confronted wherever they are Mad Max Maxine Waters doing\nThat I think they've had it and I think what's gonna happen\nIs that ah those independents would do often and sometimes the negatively make the difference I think what's gonna happen is that there will be in fact\nA backlash against the Democrats for their obnoxious behavior\nAnd it was purely obnoxious throughout that process the second thing\nIs on the immigration this caravan of three thousand people coming to the border\nAll of a sudden when the president said the administration and said that maybe they wouldn't cut back on foreign aid to those countries have Guatemala Honduras El Salvador\nAll of a sudden those countries are saying they want to cooperate and to keep control over this illegal immigration problem of people coming from their country going to Mexico and then the United states but when the international law works is that\nIf you're in one of those countries and you were being politically oppressed in El Salvador Honduras Guatemala\nIs inevitable let you go through Mexico to get to the United states and the role is that the first country you get to outside of your own is the one\nWhere you have to ask or should ask for political safe haven\nFrom retribution by your your home country because you are at risk in your home country\nWhat they don't do that as you know they come to the American border through Mexico Mexico it's got a tough one up its position and hold these people in Mexico and if they want to send them back to Guatemala or Honduras or El Salvador feel free Mexicans but don't send the mayor keep them\nOut of the United states a territory [noise] and so that the way that three thousand was going to the border now [noise] looking to obnoxious Lee illegally criminally and disgusting only cross

cause we go along and anything we talk\nAbout eight six six five eighty to Ninety nine thirty three let's say six six five eighty to Ninety nine thirty three\nBe troublesome situation in Saudi Arabia\nIs very complicated\nAs usual\nThe fellow who was the real pong from the Obama administration Ben Rhodes\nAnd that's all he is is a punk\nWho knows nothing about diplomacy\nStarted criticizing today the president\nFor giving Saudi Arabia or pass\nOn the death of Mr ... shocking\nAlthough the president did not give anyone to pass\nFirst thing I'm going to ask Ben Rhodes\nDeputy national security advisor to\nYou want to talk about roads\nGiving somebody a pass how\nYour cowardly president\nWho said there was a red line in Syria\nAside one over the red line with the chemical weapons\nAnd then your boss Brock Obama\nThe incompetent than nothing\nWhen you do nothing\nOf any consequence or integrity or strength how about when your boss Obama roads kiss the ring\nOf the king of Saudi Arabia remember that when he took office and apologized for the United states behavior you remember how he kiss the ring and vowed to the king of Saudi Arabia\nAnd now you want to condemn this president about the very same country where the hell do you get your standards and that's the problem on the left\nThey don't get any facts\nThey only look at what they want to disingenuous sleep\nArrogant Lee smuggling wrongfully\nAnd with a venomous\nAnguished toward anybody who disagrees with them\nA Jamal ... show these\nThey now claim the Turks\nThat they've turned over\nThis audio recording to the United states\nLast thing Trump said about this\nWhen he was asked about he said we've asked for it meaning the tape\nIf it exists\nAnd then he said it probably does exist so that sounds as though he has not gotten it\nNow ... back tonight so we'll see\nWhether he's bringing with him a copy of that tape or Mr ... just horrifying death\nThe president pointed out that the king\nSaid here or nothing about it and the president\nAnd formerly kind of indicated\nThat he either believe similar was going to hold off on any decision regarding this until all the facts rent which is the right thing to do\nThat's why Ben Rhodes\nIdiotic statement\nAbout the president letting Saudi Arabia off the hook as is bogus you have to have all the facts before you can make a decision\nBut apparently\nHang Solomon and crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nThe heir apparent\nBoth have denied knowing anything about this that it might have been Saudi operatives\nGoing off the uh\nRegulations and doing it on their own that's what they're claiming\nAnd none of us know what happened yet we hopefully we will but it seems to me that the problem\nIs that you're talking about an autocratic country\nThat's now trying to make itself\nMore twenty first century they're letting women drive and some other things that they didn't do before\nKind of a Neanderthal society that's starting to be more civilized\nThe president says he's not covering up for the royal family\nThey're important partners to us\nI mean when guys like Ben rose want to just throw them to the wolves the Saudis\nAnd then what happens to going after Iran Saudi Arabia is one of our great allies as a buffer against Iran\nAnd they're fighting Iran in Yemen\nWhere the ...\nSurrogates for the Iranians\nAnd that battle continues\nTo we want to give up on Saudi Arabia in Maine and then leave the reality\nThat Iran will have greater freedom to do its mission from the middle east\nUm and and I think that most people agree very often we all know what the outcome of the price of oil it till he's actually left the office of weaken the with the with the fallout out on the results are of that\nBut what I Will say about our current president is that people are having to adapt very rapidly cheetahs change so it really is as far as those individuals go head of the country\nUm if we're not emotionally stable it it's going to feel threatening to people because people don't like change forced on that people will change anything if the change is up to them and they're making the decision to do it\nWell here's the thing we're starting yeah yeah well but here's the thing that this is really interesting because there are some people\nWho are well we're in ... in many ways we're a nation of sheep I mean people most people follow right most people right\nAnd most people like repetition you know and radio and there's a principle that you want consistency in familiarity um ideally you want to keep the same house and the same people on the air\nSo that when the person wakes up in the morning for example to turn on the radio and get the weather and all of the traffic and other problems or they have the same person doing it they like the repetition the familiarity um here it's very different\nNow many would argue that the people who elected our president did so precisely because he shakes things up that they were tired of the system\nThat this rule disrupted their lives and put them on the back burner not caring about them making trade deals and all the rest of that at the expense of American Jobs and here's a guy who's going to turn that around than in fact on the on the on the political merits of what he said he would do he's not as much\nAnd practice about what he promised as any president in history in this short period of time I mean it does so from that point of view is there but then there was the other crowd that likes the comfort of of a like a John Case it who would say who says things in couched ways\nUh and it's very part of the mainstream whatever his point of view might be and doesn't disrupt things\nThere are so there are people who want that versus people who want the disruption\nSo I'm really a don't doesn't the purse that do by by saying that doesn't that mean that the president conceivably has great emotional quotient because he understands what he's doing and doing it within Penn and reason to achieve the results he wants others could say he's doing it as a child\nOr when he goes after Roseanne Barr\nI or or or Rosie O'Donnell whichever when he went after one of me like Roseanne Barr he likes Rosie O'Donnell is Twenty one after\nUm lure Maxine Waters or are the people he goes after uh that maybe is acting childish that's how people perceive it which is right as he emotionally disabled or is the emotionally brilliant\nI well I think the answer is is that the the key is actually responding to a culture that we have created\nI'm going after people the way that it goes after that right from the very beginning I mean we um we're seeing a president that came into the White House after a you know a couple of decades the reality television\nAnd people being programmed of really wanting to experience crazy that's right up on in their face\nSo I think that Donald Trump knew that he was part of it obviously he had the credits for chatting\nUm and he knew what people were how they were responding to those things so I think that the argument is that um there is this by by your parents are going to do things by on way because he's done that his wife\nA which you know I mean if it works it's great if it's wrong but we stayed but it's been it's June I mean if it doesn't work out what you said that his juvenile or something like that um but if it works out that you know that people are are behind it but he's a gathering support an individual that are actually you're afraid to\nSay what it is that they want\nA because so many people are on the other side of the year and they're attacking those individuals show\nUm that again while I'm what I'm trying to say about what where he's coming from exchange or he's the he's taking a step back\nAnd he's basically responding to their share playing one side off the other and that's why you got to be president nobody thought that he would ever that can be president because he saw something that nobody else saw and that was highly emotionally respond as a country\nI yeah and I think um people in the people who are elected and got fed up with the mess usual the matter who got in they I've cooked because I heard this\nFor more than for a couple of decades from conservatives they're fed up with the Republicans there obviously fed up with the Democrats but the they expect from the Democrats what they get but they certainly didn't expect the Republicans to be so passive about making promises and never keeping them\nAnd so um you know they'd get created this situation where they said yeah we got to go to the outside I mean uh if he and rent a good campaign for example the Iacocca who had run Chrysler might have won this or or a\nH. Ross Perot a because people were any for an outsider it happened to be Donald Trump in this case a and the other guys might've operate in the same way because when you operate in business you're you're you're the bottom line authority so you're going to make the decisions\nIn politics it doesn't work that way even a president doesn't have the same authority as the president of um of IBM or Microsoft or any of those they don't have the same authority do they\nKnow they don't exactly and yeah it's like you mentioned corral a week I mean he's pretty one he's pretty much the the one that stop Bush from getting a second term so right that'll just go to show you how many people were ready for some kind of a change that he was able to swing that vote and uh and put in the state\nYeah that's a great point because that that actually he got Nineteen percent which which I mean everyone I think would agree most of that would have gone to George George Herbert Walker Bush and he would have won that election so at the history was changed by that um what are we only have about a minute left what\nWhat's the bottom line here should all people be looking to increase their emotional quotient as they go through life or if their convention just stay where they are\nReally saying that they should they should look at increasing I have no way that they do that it's probably developing a value of course we're broke it continued grow through their life I think that it's a real shame when we get to a certain age or\nYou know some people they get out of high school or they get out of college and they're like I'm never going to I'm never going to do anything to grow grow should be a lifelong process and it should be part of a value system that we adopt for ourselves and I think that was the\nBetter community solve your community is I I think that we would be better about our country and overall a better world if\nPeople did that because a lot of the belief systems that were running around with are are very very out of date and we act like you know um it was you know two hundred years ago or two thousand years ago and it's not it's completely different world that we that we live at and we're not emotionally catching up to it [noise]\nFor being with us David NATO dot com as the the id NEA G L E if you want to follow this further David ... thanks I'm sure we'll have you back to talk to you\nThanks by which led storm ...\nLet's talk about down home values made in the usa blue jeans and like you wore as a kid I remember\nThere's ways now saying\nWhere they may lose\n... every\nYear and change the way they\nVoted down and cry\nAnd moves\nDown and then\nGood old fashioned comfort getting diamond Gus the genes every stitch guaranteed in order to vendor motorcycle gene guns gambler reinforced seat of a G.

question that you probably don't have an answer to but then since it's over at the second circuit [noise] do you think there was any kind of political decision by any of the justice judges at the second circuit or with regard to you're being a ... was your conservative point of view in your opinion a factor in this decision\nGuy knows matter of fact that it was a a it was a disclose somewhere along the lines that uh\nMy case was actually mandated from the highest levels because\nWhen you say highest levels was that during the Obama administration\nThat is correct yeah\nSo it is then is it reasonable to suspect at least\nSome elements or maybe the president himself bronco bomb and didn't know about it but is it ... maybe Eric Holder did uh the attorney general's is or or Loretta Lynch is it possible that they wanted this case pursued that that they weren't instructions given to pursue this case precisely because of your conservative point of view\n[noise] it was because they were after me I mean I've had clients that at\nMy client we represent a lot of legal or illegal law firms and our clients that actually filed I stopped counting at our staff members count how many lawsuits we brought against president is led astray talking about Obama\nRight here in uh we stopped counting fifty three lawsuits show on your ... your analysis\nAbsolutely\nAnd uh they want to just to get to use to get rid of your being in that Mrs to them\nThat was part of it and also you know the whole fact that this was a political agenda by the radical homosexual left if you call that um\nYou know they were determined to do away with the federal DOMA state marriage amendments and it was a combination of everything together frankly I was an eye out for a political target\nYeah we're going to get to the specifics about I just wanted to lay that part of it out that you are conservative point of view appears to have been a factor in the Obama administration at some place in the mid ... coming

here we are joined by all of sudden fill of societies\nWho is a victim of the Obama administration shall we say I mean the only crime you allegedly committed and I'm not suggesting allegedly because\nWhen you did perhaps the falls ruin the category of criminal action by driving a woman with her baby\nFrom one state to another and then she left\nThe country and then the wind up as you said of Nicaragua nobody knows where she is since then I I don't understand the point of this because the other woman never adopted the child so how in the world is she have any parental rights the woman who was\nThe by the by the actual mother given causes that custody but\nVisitation uh in good faith\nAnd then we will find out that that woman given the visitation would not accept\nAnd being a a a legal guardian if you will didn't adopt a child or we find out that she allegedly committed child abuse against the child um I I'm I'm not clear\nHow the court came to the conclusion that she had parental rights do you understand how the court came to that conclusion\n[noise] well it was a political motivation\nThey they were determined to uh the this case will be the first case a for same sex or parental rights or thing or you know each civil unions are marriages and uh uh that are just trying to set a precedent\nBut I mean I understand that but and I understand and I have no problem with it if somebody says I'm I'm I'm taking a measures to adopt the child let's say it's the same sex couple\nAnd the woman in this case we're talking about did adopt a child\nWhich is fine\nUh then she has a case to be made as being a legal guardian with a right to visitation rights because she is in fact illegal parent of the child even though the two parents were separated same thing in a male female divorce I mean there's still visitation of happens for both two for one parent who doesn't have custody what I'm not clear about\nIs the legal connection between the non custodial woman\nWhose civil union with the mother was ended as you said and the child who I mean where's the connection where's the legal connection between the non custodial\nWoman and the child and does your attorneys\nArgue properly the sink or do they miss something here\n[noise] no I think you're absolutely right I don't think there was a connection and a a you know I don't\nThink any of your walls were broken in this case a ... a\nA you know you had a they had passports are afraid to travel especially they didn't take the patch or two away\nA area you're asking a very valid question\nDoes your lawyers raise this in defending you in this case\nAs they raise it they wouldn't do it well did you read the uh the the brief or free or and or hear the arguments they made to the court or in the case of ah the appeal to the second circuit\nDid they make that case on appeal that there's no legal connection between the non custodial mother and the child\n[noise] um they made the case that I'm a lawyer made the case that there was still the case had you know the whole matter had not been settled down to two thousand and Lisa Miller left the country a country in two thousand lie\nSo it it it wasn't over was still in the courts\nThey they did make that case\nMade the case I just described about the ... legal connection between the the non custodial woman and the child they made that\nTaste well that was really a matter and that the trial and that that was really a a but it was brought up in the\nMedia you yeah but it would be a it said that I mean when you go up on appeal you can argue that that or a judge or at a lower level are made him degree just sour or however you want to define it and therefore um or went beyond his or her discretion\nA as a matter of law\nBecause what's the protection I'm not clear I and and I ... I don't know if anybody could convince me of this one is the what is the right does that non custodial woman had putting aside the fact that she\nMay have abused the child let's assume she didn't she refused to adopt a child so what right does she have to any kind of um\nVisitation rights she has no legal relationship to the child period case closed\nI Would agree with that but the court did not well\nWhy did they say in response of your attorneys raise that point one of the court say\n[laughter] um [noise]\nThe central point to the case yeah I mean you you you could be because in that situation didn't they argue that you win or simply took a mother and her child because you knew that the other woman didn't adopt a child so there was no legal relationship so you had no intent to commit the crime of conspiracy or there has to be in ten\nI was ...\nThe whole issue was about an egg\nAnd\nSo we're waiting in ten where were you lawyers on this I mean there was no one can do in\nFact there was absolutely no effect\nSo now I Want to do all the jewel lawyers argue that adamantly passionately they did\nAre you confident that you had a good law firm handling this\nYou know I think it could have been more force bought there would have been brought up ... out\nI probably would have\nDone it differently follows arguing myself\nYou are or what you like is the best the\nAttorney in a you know pray for the best\nWhile I mean you were in a financial position to have a good attorney correct I don't want to get into your finances but you seem to be in and as you as we were you were successful in business correct\nYes her\nAnd you and I'm hiring a gun top quality law firm would not be a problem I'm assuming correct", "show_name": "The Mike Siegel Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "18"}
