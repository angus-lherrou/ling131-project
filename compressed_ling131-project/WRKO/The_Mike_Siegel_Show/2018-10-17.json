... like eighty to Boston and I aren't radio station [noise]\n\nI'm Gary all they are saying we have to find out what happened first\nThe electoral college\nToday is valid and worthy of being in existence\nThe founding fathers by the way never intended for there to be a national vote\nOr national plebiscite or national determination on the popular vote to elect presidents they actually wanted to preserve federalism\nThey want to integrate the best system majority rule and also a necessary protection of minority but the majority would rule in fact\nAnd so these people don't even understand why the Senate exists and why the electoral college exists\nLeft wing is now talking about the Senate as a dark Republican conspiracy I mean the Senate how horrified I didn't hear them saying that when the low life the graded a trash by the name of Harry Reid was Senate majority leader\nHe's nothing but political trash\nInch Harry Reid's lied about Mitt Romney not paying taxes and then he said so what\nHe didn't win the election\nHe didn't care that he lied out now wide\nAnd then then defended the lying because the one\nThat's the kind of crappy one from of somebody's supposed to be in a leadership position Harry Reid is nothing but the lowest of the low but none of the people on the left complained about him with his degree that way of running the Senate and it was degraded\nHe was above bully he never gave the Republicans any kind of a dignity any kind of position any kind of legitimacy and they kind of input he didn't protect the minority in that case that all well the founders realized\nThat the representatives in the smaller states worried about the interests of the larger states for obvious reasons that they would be overwhelmed by the larger states if you had a popular vote because California New York Illinois\nAnd a few other states could decide the election\nAnd says the urban centers are mostly left wing radicals these days\nWhy even bother\nWhy not create a system\nThat gave every state some input into the presidential election that's what the founders did\nSo this was a compromise\nAnd preserving the concept of federalism in the states have the power\nThat the federal government does not\nNow the founders gave\nThe Senate very specific powers\nAnd in regard to executive branch nominees the Senate would advise and consent\nAnd that means that they would in fact\nGive the okay or thumbs down\nTo nominees of the president of the United states\nAnd then the house would control spending because all bills have to emanating from the house ways and Means Committee and so they tried to create this dispersion of power which they did beautifully and creating our constitutional federal system\nSo the house represents democracy\nAnd the Senate represents the equal power of the states within the federal system\nAnd of course the set up some more tempered branch of government because it's a six year term at a smaller number is in a leap fraternity with six year terms in the house of course turns over every two years that's just the way it happens\nAnd so we have the\nReally well the well designed and well engineered political structure that creates what we have today\nWhen this left wing radical crowd says well wait a minute we don't have\nFairness in the Senate\nThe point is when the when if these people knew anything they were illiteracy in political a history\nAnd philosophy\nOn a scale of one to ten is about minus six they're illiterate pure prone purely illiterate they just want what they want to fit their own needs they don't want something that's a fair system\nYou couldn't have a fair system\nThe Senate gives every state equal representation and the upper body of the Congress the Senate\nEvery state has two senators that means every state as equal in the Senate\nAnd it's a smaller number\nAnd therefore it gives every state\nEqual representation they wanted to keep the state's having a federal control\nAbility to have input into what happens in terms of\nThe operation of government between the states and the federal government and in the house is worth a democracy is\nI think it's approximately five hundred thousand people per\nHer congressional district in the house there's four hundred and thirty five members of the house only a hundred members of the Senate which means the four hundred and thirty five members of the house\nPresumed equal\nIn terms of the numbers\n[noise] each of those districts [noise] having one representative [noise] they go to the house of representatives [noise] knows that that's where [noise]\nThere is the Democratic process because that's where California it might have and I'm not sure the number they might have fifty members of the house and my only might have two members of the house because of the difference of population so population applies for the house but not to the Senate that gives balance the state's get control\nAnd the popular vote also gets control\n\nFolks do what I did get yourself for a special person and your wife the empty I'm silenced or watch this is Mike Siegel the empty Amazon military tactical\nWatch

his\nAnd who did it\nAnd I think most people would say\nThat if we get definitive proof\nThat the Saudi Government did it\nIs an American citizen he had critical comments about Saudi Arabia that's not a basis for taking somebody out now I Know ... and\nWould kill people who\nIn the media who tell you who criticize him severely if they have impact especially\nBut the truth of the matter is\nThat free speech has got to be protected and I realized that some of those countries it is not certainly not in\nRussia and apparently not in the ... in the Saudi Arabian kingdom\nAnd Jamal crush again was\nFifty nine years old columnist for the post\nWe know that as you've heard already\nIt was on October second\nWhatever happened to\nTook his life thinking that was going to be what\nThat still needs to be determined\nSays it has audio of shaggy being killed\nI think it would be essential\nTo bring that forward\nAnd to the to solidify the proof\nThat the Saudis killed\nSaudi Arabia now issued a warning yesterday\nTo any country it says\nThat is considering punishing\nSaudi Arabia force could shock is this the parents the kingdom statement public statement official statement was and I quote\nIf it receives any action it will respond with greater action and quote\nAnd the Saudi Arabia confirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine at\nIs that when he cannot abide\nThe killing of a journalist\nFor writing critically about the Saudi Arabian government about the crown prince personally that's why it's believed it may have had something to do with\nCausing this to happen\nOr maybe somebody did it thinking that the crown prince would have wanted ... getting killed\nBecause of the critical reporting that he did over the crown prince ... bin ...\nTwenty senators wrote a bipartisan letter to the president\nAsking for an investigation\nPresident says we are investigating says we're going to find out what happened\nWith respect to the terrible situation in Turkey\nHaving to deal with Saudi Arabia and the reporter\nAnd that at this point the president says nobody really knows what's happened\nPerson says there's going to call the crown prince of Saudi Arabia to talk to him about this\nAnd you had Senator Bob Corker\nAnd Senator Robert Menendez\nBoth signing off on the letter by the twenty senators\nThe chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee leads to our\nSenator Lindsey Graham signed off on at Senator Patrick Leahy\nAnd others so lot of a\nBipartisan support it I Can't believe we finally got\nBipartisan support on something\nClinton has has to be dealt with none of president being a business guy\nI'm sure has concerns\nAbout the fact that we have more than a hundred billion dollar commitment from Saudi Arabia to buy\nMilitary weaponry and material\nComing into America for jobs and\nIncome and all of that\nBut how at what point do you say\nContinue with that kind of contract\nWith a country that wound up murdering\nA journalist and American journalist\nThis is going to be very interesting to watch how it plays out\nThere's some reports that the Saudis may come out and say that somebody did it\nEmbassy in Turkey\nAnd uh they did it without the authority of the government\nIf we want to buy that but that's one one of the possibilities that may happen here there's a twenty twelve law it's called the global Magnitsky human rights accountability act that's a big mouthful\nAnd what it basically says is when there was a letter from the chairman and ranking member\nOf the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\nOr other human rights violations\nAnd I'm also an occupation would mean that you are inoculate in your audience in advance so that the effect of what happens later from your adversary has less impact\nBecause they've already been prepared for that\nSo in other words if I'm a ... for example when Bill Clinton is that we're going to get to the Hillary and bill but um had he been in a forthcoming about Monica Lewinsky from the get go it would be the fused he would have ... to people because people say well he admitted it\nSo it's over and done with is that there was ... it was consensual by both parties what's the big deal [noise] same thing with Trump by the way\nStormy Daniels would have gone away and five seconds of he admitted and I don't know if he had the affair with her or the one night stand but\nIf he had said that if he did\nAnd admitted it if he if he actually if it actually happened it would have gone away it's an occupation that eliminates because what what's left for ... to say if Trump says yeah I did that and yeah he was my own funds to make a deal hush money deal what are your what do you do then\nWhat you're basically disarming your opponent exactly that's what he's doing exactly\nAnd he's doing this if you look at it almost every topic um he does that you know for example but back to the Paris climate accord that\nRemember he said we're going to look into the parents were going to look into it we're going to think about it and everybody said oh he's backing off of climate change that agreement but then what does he do it comes in\nAnd that falls out of it right but he was letting people sort of think he's thinking about it and it's not really showing his hand he basically kind of giving people hand but not real but you have to watch when you listen to them or where he is and if the ultimate\nStrategy is he is he trying to get in on board to have a discussion is that an opening negotiations a toy or something else and that and then he he marches\nOr whatever is real object to it but I think in many ways is very clever\nWell that's what I that's why I raise that because it's it's it's filled fulfills the theory of an occupation in persuasion theory where a group\nOf ... or your communication or\nAnd a while and they ah we used to teach that I mean it's still they still do it's just it's it's just a basic primitive premise of persuasion theory that you would not get laid people in advance and has less impact a and then when it when somebody tries to come up against you later\nOr when you admit something you've defused it completely let me turn to um our good friend Hilary whose father all over the place a very interesting that she says that it was not an abuse of power by bill even though you have an intern with the president of the United states\nIf that's not a a dichotomy or a a complete separation of power\n... there's no equality there I mean the scale will be to completely down or up depending on which one it is yes he says it's no abuse of power and uh he should not have a reason\nAnd when he was she was asked if he should resign she said no um what is what just first that part of it what does that do in terms of the public image in the discussion that's now taking place\nI think it makes her look hypocritical\nI think a lot of people in the uh the problem with her position and you know basically supporting her husband by is bad behavior and certainly in lieu of me too movement\nAnd current thinking what is it would be less supportive of anyone who uh goes over the limit their uh it just makes her ah less credible and that\nAnd uh but it also seems to me at least is very damaging they're now going on a tour apparently a stadium tour to raise money\nI'm ... I had a fellow in the spring Joel Joel Gilbert I'm a film producer ... a conservative documentaries he said he thinks he's running\nAnd now they're going on in the stadium tour a and I presume if they raise money maybe we'll use that for a campaign or she's been out there publicly she's certainly isn't hiding the the things that she's going to be out there trying to campaign for president\nOh I think she is but let me add makeup production you know I like make fiction from the data and that is using that data on her a capability of\nBringing people for it or are these kind of activities I think it's going to stop I doubt if she'll get past three of the hurricane I think they're going to have such low attendance that they're going to be losing too much Harry off the whole lemon\nBecause I don't think she can get a crowd out any more I don't think people just willing to do what they do with Trump they're not wanting to circle up building or stadium or a you know some type of larger arena ah with people who are going to just sit there and St\n... Obama audiences or who are gonna be all extremely enthusiastic like Trump audience\nSo I I think it's an attempt a to run for president I think she is running for president I don't think she'll get the first base I don't think so get the nomination and I think this particular chore is going to end a and another step back and frustration for both but\nWell yeah if if they don't get enough people up there you better believe that that's what's gonna happen uh that'll be the nail in the coffin politically for sure uh El Al ... a fellow wrote a piece I'm\nIn the week and he wrote this\nAbout Hillary possibly running it said the real Hillary as the sarcasm here the real Hillary's the minority or senator who inherited her seat from Daniel Patrick Moynihan\nThe woman who ran a vicious race baiting primary campaign against Brock Obama\nThe unwavering supporter of the Iraq War the architects of our ill fated Libyan excursion the Osama hunter the wouldn't be assigned to destroy your the welfare queen shame or the tough on crime denounce or of super predators and quote I think [laughter]\nI mean if somebody should take that paragraph of and then the Democratic primary and just use that against survey that's really the bottom line she is she and he had become have gone from the from the Pentagon to the basement I mean they're they're kinda like Richard Nixon in that respect aren't they\n[noise] yeah oh I think even worse than that I think make those aren't up to a oh and it was time to go home so to speak and I don't think they know it's time to quit I think they want to pick up where they left off a\nTrump was a diversion a a beat them but now they want to go back go back to the power the center of power\nAnd running a party I I don't think they're going to get the first ... but I really don't think they have or within the party\nAnd with the ... well yeah that was that was my question about it because we're running out of time the ... the party ... numbers\nThe Democrat Party would reject them that doesn't have to be is the American people\nJust the party itself well yeah I I think there's no question authority over maybe maybe her uh Arab parent is across

I\nTo point like I I just want to finish the point that\nThese presidents and then uh the bbs the boycott the vestige or sanction a project against Israel or as a while to just continue along a virulent anti Semitism happens on campuses and then the the president's argue it's free speech while it's only free speech so long\nAs as you don't create an environment for violence against others that everybody's supposed to have\nA fair treatment or or the harassment of people attending Jewish events\nAre sponsored by Jewish groups on campuses uh I don't want to single that out but the point I'm making is that these presidents are absolutely in the pocket of we're doing what's expedient and the politically correct left wing and they're going to do what's going to make the help them to survive the one function is to survive in the job\nAnd then not to do what's right that's why I wouldn't trust the I'm the title mind that you talk about it wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them and their needs to be outside intervention\nWell you're absolutely right that they only to ride to keep their job because that is all they're doing\nAnd what the schools are afraid of is they're afraid of losing federal funding and that applies to private schools as well as public because they all get federal funding and regarded didn't land there's some other federal funding\nSo it their all afraid that if they don't follow it I don't mind they are going to lose federal funding and you can do that by making it and civil rights complaint to the office for civil rights within the department of education\nMany people don't even know that the department I mean I think that the chances of us still losing their federal funding because the title nine violation are very slim because everyone jumping it they said\nThat they use that\nTo justify bringing on them as liberal I'm biased individuals that they can find to be their title nine coordinators and therefore those people have a personal object is\nTo just hate men and to push women at the you know\nAt at the risk of pushing down I mean kind of stepping on them do that and that's what they're doing and you know if you're a man today in today's society and it\nFrom my experience it doesn't matter what race gender religion you are if you're a male you weren't as distinct miss that landed in school and it is a\nIt's a very strong likelihood that you or someone you know we'll be charged with a title nine violation why you are in school\nIt's a very very frightening for ...\nWell it said look I I also was discussing this with my brother and his wife they have two sons\nUm and they look at the Kavanaugh case and the way you just described it\nAnd that must have started the premise I Know we both agree anybody who commit sexual assault or rape or attempts to do so or sexual harassment should be have the book for them to the full extent of the law of what it is that they did within the parameters of the penalties for what they did that's a given course\nBut there has to be but there has to be\nA process by which you're comfortable a in a criminal case beyond a reasonable doubt um I I don't know what state are you would use on a college campus but um you got I'm learning more than what they have now but the point the point of that they were making the me is that they have two sons who are adults professionals or want it was a dentist\nOr so supply it just crossed my mind the Smith supposing a woman comes in and she wants to make a few bucks she goes in and my nephew uh cleans your teeth or does a root canal whatever it may be or than implant\nA and all of a sudden I half hour later the police ... office because they report that he or she reports he attempted to seduce me and he put his hands and inappropriate places if they're the only two people in the room now what happens\nWell it's very frightening I'm ... now but the difference is if you go through the criminal justice system there is a process which means that you are going to be innocent until\nProven guilty [laughter] so what is scary is that the groups that are protesting list and gender and there's one particular group called the end violence against Women International and they're pushing the agenda I Believe the victim\nAnd you know what I mean we were going to a break so let me pick it up on the other side but my point is even a ... for you to process and criminal law protection you still have your name be smarts than there are still bounce another people's minds maybe this guy did this and they don't go back to the dentist anymore\n... later\nSaid no one ever it and that's why I have a little\nRobot it's an automatic self cleaning litter box for can really work in the little robot totally

R. K. oh boy so often that gives you an\nDown here we\nMike Seeger was a show on just one of the she's an attorney\nCases on college campuses university campuses\nWhere there are ... typically young men accused\nOf some kind of sexual harassment or abuse or some other form of sexual behavior that's technically is illegal or not even just technically but it is illegal and um many times these are false accusations the Duke lacrosse case was a great example of that\nBy the way you are one of the problems was owns is the uh media\nA Rolling Stone to the whole story about the Duke lacrosse case\nAnd and they\nEnded up prove that they had one source the source for track that and they never really came dinner or contrite about if they just went right along I think they were sued\nBy the Duke lacrosse are the victims and these these guys were victims and the press and I think there was a settlement but um but that was outrageous or the press is a big part of this too is not believe the woman or the girl on campus and then the guy who loses his rights\nWell right and you can't entering the bell and they're not to say and an illegal or a new one out there it's out there and he can't take it back\nBecause less people who hear it a crime they think of right and they don't really they go well there was something about right so you know you and your name is Trevor says it was great and that's not what you want when you're looking for a job or trying to get into graduate school\nSo you know it ... it is a very very damaging thing for these boys\n[noise] tell me a if you would because it was I was that occurred to me that we have many people listening who might be the college students or parents of college students typically young men\nAnd the danger they face a tell us about how title nine plays into this it's a federal title nine education are tired I work with us well it's a\nIt's a federal law that this people think of it as\nI'm dealing with equality in education is typically the number of scholarship that women get as his men and that's what it was intentionally created that they had to kind of equal out\nThe ah the ability of men and women to get a college education somehow and it has morphed into um sexual harassment and sexual assault\nAnd I know how it it it was in two thousand eleven that with a dear colleagues letter written after the bomb at ... but just\nTo me legally does that make sense when I read it I don't think that that what town line was intended to do and it's certainly I think if there with them if there was anything that was impeding your ability to learn it should be educated it would fall under title nine but this is not\nHitting these girls are ability to be educated\nUm not the stories that I'm hearing I'm hearing of girls who are equally as aggressive sexually as that are and you know they go out on a day and then the girl regrets it forced them or anything\nNow and not saying that sometimes there are actual race that occur or sometimes even misunderstanding\nBut for the most part what I see our girls who are ... what happens later\nMaybe they were drunk maybe the guy was trying to and it was just something that they regretted or were uncomfortable with and so they're now told me they sell a friend and they're sold to go to your title math and then the title nine office\nKind of propaganda says them into believing that they were sexually assaulted\nBy the ... the question you raised a minute ago the point how ... how do they invoke title nine to fit this category of accusations\nUnder title nine now because it got and into that smell it and it became mandated ender of on that at every college in is the city every color guard with her high school as well but that they all had a title nine apartment\nIt feels this specifically with sexual assault now again I\nI don't know the whole let me just ask you the Obama administration invoked sexual harassment or sexual abuse on college and university campuses under title nine is that correct yeah yeah they\nCried so okay so that's the case because the title but from what you're describing I haven't read it recently but the the title specifically describes sexual abuse or sexual harassment as a category under title nine\nNow but in in law and and how it with a title nine and law like a lot of things it can be\nInterpreted to mean that there is there is a fair to advertise and that it could be that I don't believe that was the intention I don't think that that's really what it does but we're stuck with it now and it's going to stay that way well\nActually it's the it's not really one of the things that particularly since you're so directly involved in this area of the law wouldn't this be feasible maybe it's been done to bring a lawsuit under federal\nAnd a federal district court maybe ultimately getting to the Supreme Court as to whether title nine actually\nShould be used to invoke this or whether the Congress would need to amend title nine to include specifically and express overtly sexual harassment sexual abuse or sexual um misconduct something along that well\nI like the way you think [laughter] but I don't think it would work because there isn't nuts in their cars and title nine that you know anything that in the ability\nOf anyone to learn and if you're sexually assaulted or harass campus it's Lincoln paid your ability to learn that are\nPoint my music loud and the next door to door in a dorm room or that's going to improve I mean what you could take I have\nI mean I I agree and that's part of the problem is anything that you know go under it but I don't think you're when that but what is happening\nNow I don't know you know you have five justices might look at it with the strict construction and I know and a more narrow interpretation but I don't know maybe about a mile or or or or running or the other or Brian\nYeah yeah well anyway they got a very special concern [laughter] you know I
