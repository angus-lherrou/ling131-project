they might be able to say well he was already a federal judge when he testified\nAnd they're claiming that he committed perjury they're claiming that he lied under oath about his activities in high

I suppose you can do an impeachment on any grounds you want a few of the house of representatives and then the the trial goes in the Senate but\nIf you did something that long ago a arguably impeachable offenses a car when you were in office because if the people elected the person and in this case the Senate approved this member of the Supreme Court\nThen that means that anything prior to that was taken into account and extinguished\nAbsolute but\nSo I you know he did something while in office All right let's just leave it ... of of not him but anybody a Alcee Hastings was a federal judge who got impeached and convicted by the way member that from Florida\nHe's very famous yeah\nAnd that he left wing has always the tax Trump and now he's in the Congress because ah you know he was able to uh get elected but um yeah so you're saying that this is going to be much more red wave coming up in a few days\nWell surprisingly it may not turn that many states but what's gonna happen is the margins are going to be much bigger\nThan others but from a Republican so one by three percent are going to win by five percent or ... percent that's what's happening\nWhile that although that's nice but it doesn't really accomplish anything in terms of the numbers in the house and Senate or the real question becomes I think that this the the the house I'm In the Senate has uh the possibility of nine seats that the\nThe Republicans have a shot at on the Democrats I don't mean they're going to win them all means my might win a few and the Republicans only have about three seats at risk\nThere's there's that small number of races that are that close so the likelihood in the Senate is the just based on the numbers would be the probably you would see a a Republican increase in the Senate or am I missing some yeah\nRight now my forecast this fifty seven Republican in November\nOh fifty seven in the Senate so that would be a substantial that'd be sick so this is within the framework I was just talking about a\nYear okay they're right on\nAnd then you have a my question is why did high camp and I think Joe Donnelly a vote against a Cavanaugh I'm a and and the McCaskill from Missouri why do you think they all voted against them but don't they know that's going to cost them\nWell you know what they may have thrown in the towel campus I just mentioned is down by about sixteen percent it's why I mean she fell far from the tree it she just went along with the Democrat because you want ... plans with them in the future\nUh Don Leah is another thing he might have been able to pick up ... percentage point by voting with Kavanaugh so that I think was a mistake on his part but he's going to lose anyway\nSo he's he's going to lose either well well now there's this cement his loss further yet is that how about Jon Tester in Montana there's that he's a clown a ... to me anyway what about him when he voted against\nKavanaugh as well in Montana and um I Would think Montana would lumped Kavanaugh\nThat's a tough one call bill um I I I'm going to reserve the right to wait till next week to tell you I Want to see some more numbers on that one\nSo it's still tentative yet and tests or couldn't win that one he could win yeah\nAfter the president need to go back to Montana they if they should know citizens have\nEight of them won't make any difference at this point than\nNow I think if it is a you know he's put his stamp on Montana already he's got a bunch of other places the dough and it'll be more in on this trip\nThe think that um these trips that he's taking our and and he's primarily focusing on the Senate but also somewhat the house are they making all these trips making a difference\nYeah clearly there make it there [noise] house though not

originalism\nThe ... and it's not political it's judicial and here's what I mean\nPoliticians take an ideological can take an do normally take an ideological position they face but Bernie favors um\nUm the Medicare for all Bernie favors free college tuition Bernie favors a free lunch a Bernie favors ... salaries for everybody whatever it may be I'm being facetious but ... that's ... that's a political philosophy\nA judicial philosophy would mean that you interpret the law\nOr the issue before the court\nAgainst the constitution\nAnd that makes you an originalist district construction this however you want to describe it and all that means is that you test once they are now against the constitution and the amendments that have been incorporated into the constitution to decide if a law or a policy or regulation this constitutional\nThat doesn't take a political position\nIt's a position of independence as a justice Kavanaugh said\nAnd I wonder what your thoughts are about what I think is a misrepresentation\nOf the public or of many people that somehow he's politically conservative one actually because he believes in precedent for example and he believes in the case of roe v Wade was reinforced by a second Supreme Court decision or at this point is forty five years old\nAnd he has already said that some better than the law so he wouldn't change it having nothing to do with what his own personal beliefs are having to do with ... views the constitution and the way the court and makes decisions what about that distinction between political and judicial so-called conservatism\nSure what you make a very good point and it is a point most people probably math but basically it conservative ... is one that the way is a strict construct an originalist sometimes called the ... ah that they they rebuilt\nThe words in a law or they read\nThe constitution and they read or what it says they don't interpret bang for example roe v Wade came about because they ... the Supreme Court at that time came up with this right to privacy that they found in the constitution\nWhich conservative but I'm Talking about conservative\nPolitical thought didn't exist on the ... to ...\n[laughter] so when they're all upset about this fellow because the conservative\nOr you're not a politically conservative you get really temperate his first fruit conservative so that in a over tolerant overturn the the big issue there are a lot of Democrats ... the way\nHe would have to find a a factor of evidence that says that this is unconstitutional so in other words they even have to find\nEnough to overrule the precedent that already that because there is there and uh and so it it can happen\nBut it it's not easy to do there are other people on Trump's list I went for Trump's original list that detail and studied for those folks are ready to go back to the back and listen and that there are people\nThere who would a much more likely turn over a if you will liberal or progressive policies are because they're in a type of a judicial a philosophy\nIs a little bit more conservative leaning anyway so but I think this power that the one of the best people the Democrats that have ever gotten in terms of being conservative\nDo the Democratic federal point fair enough you just as you usually do brilliantly raise the segue for me to the Democrats have a point\nThat Merrick Garland was the best that the Republicans could have gotten under Obama and therefore maybe should have given him a shot because these are on the same DC circuit court of appeals highly distinguished he's the chief judge they're\nEven more prominent than judge Kavanaugh's so into the Democrats have gripes there\nWell I don't think they have a break but but that statement is also true he probably would have been a one of the better ones that the Republicans voted for during the term of Obama's administration\nBut on the other hand there's precedent when you're that close to a presidential election where you have a lame duck president and asked them but to wait until the new person is elected so I don't I don't think it really had\nA leg to stand on arguing that this was some terrible precedent breaking thing was it ... it was perfectly normal to expect\nThat the Senate in the hands of a you know party that not also controlling the White House would hold off\nWell see I'm wouldn't it be the ultimate sticking it to the Democrats if I'm justice cabinet and his wife\nAnd became a cozy and friendly and went to opera and a lovely dinners as Scalia did was about um Justice Ginsberg and her husband boy we would not be a shot at Schumer [laughter]\nI'd be surprised [noise] find a way the next one of the bat ah from reading the less than that I think it's Amy Coney Barrett and she is more conservative in a in a political fat ban Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I was going to ask you about her next I Can't believe he read my mind I Would know her name Amy Barrett who was flooding through my brain and I was about to ask you about her yeah she was going to make the point to that ... at least she appears to be more conservative than Kavanaugh\nHe is he's more conservative both a judicial early and politically and\nActually there at much greater threat of being a progressive policies and programs overturned and fire decisions overturned with that in Coney Coney Barrett and by the way I think he's up to bat I think we're pretty sure that when Ruth Bader Ginsburg decide who\nYou know put out her her each chair and on on the beach somewhere in Florida that the Amy Coney Barrett it's gonna be the one place or\nWell maybe that's a coming I I noticed that a sitting in the front row tonight she was a a kind of taking a little nap meditating maybe who knows but [laughter]\nWell less house in a in a in a different way there's always the well actually it is about the crime and Kevin O's going through that now and I mean sure there and I'll find it I'll find you the crime they found the crime I mean if if he had done and I don't believe for one second they did it but if he had done to Dr Ford what she says that's a crime\nYeah absolutely and vital and then there's the other question was the under age at the time I mean I I started worth discussing because I didn't believe it happened but there are some legitimate questions about that but that's what we've come to hear now you can make the case that he's a of a statute that he can defend himself\nHe's got half the Senate defending them the basically the Republican side he's got half the American people pretty much defending them\nUh but when you get to people like I described in Wenatchee, Washington or basically apple pickers people the many cases were from Mexico and couldn't speak English very well or at all and couldn't hire fancy attorneys\nYou've got a real problem there and unfortunately in the end because of it then attorney volunteering as time attorney great stature and they've got turned around but their lives where basically screwed up for for those years and in some cases ruined because of this\nSo when you say All right go without me can be railroad mind discovery in every court is ... ... ... ... what was that I've seen them\nWell wrote it because ... or so much a or a specially will have the media or side they can basically destroyed\nLet me look good judge yet but I never use reputation guy whether they can call them tomorrow and\nWell then that that's true and he said they made that point um yeah but you know\nAnd it's just\n... and ... there's no standard being used to I don't have any problem if you've got a person where there's there are reasonable evidence and it doesn't have to be beyond a reasonable doubt because the Senate can make its decision on whenever grounds at once but at least those grounds to have to be justifiable in some fashion\nAnd now it's come out that her ex boyfriend\nAnd I talked to Ford's ex boyfriend is saying she did help a woman with a lie detector um she can fly\nA and she says she sat on the wrong she never help anybody ... as to how to use all a lie detector a polygraph test um and then now the foreign for instance he watched her do it I in other words we've got these\nI'm clear violations of any standard of justice and even though they're not you don't have to have the rules of evidence as you would in court\nIt would seem to me at least that you would have to have some standard of fairness before you tell somebody you can't have this job because you committed that that crime against Dr Ford when we see that she has all these discrepancies in our in our presentation and there's nothing there to tangible you go on\n[noise] right well you know like you know why I Am a stay on this so I can gauge and all that time I mean the bottom line was they didn't want to investigate and they want a good toilet alive\nAnd for the middle east and the way the vote and they pull that off\nA to disagree but I think\nHe's going to get confirmed in the end I Can't imagine a and now that the reporters in and then then that's all done but the the the other question becomes what is going to happen in the future and the other question becomes a I mentioned a minute ago and the criminal justice system we have protections in St cards for defendants when you just pointed out\nAnd I just pointed out defendants who\nConvicted\nAnd the case in Philadelphia and the case in Washington state that these people were wrongfully convicted and how many more of those kinds of cases are there by the thousands over the years that the better for more for the system didn't work with the way it was supposed to for people because somebody short circuit the system\nAnd shouldn't have been some kind of severe punishment that that that ... that a prosecutor knows if they do this they're going to lose their license to practice law and maybe even go to jail I mean shouldn't there be some clear guidelines about this even though there are laws they don't seem to get enforced\nAcross as basic she'll be on my job to get the points of special investigator and you know they carried over to them that\nAre you guys get you know that\nThey do and if they can show they acted in good faith which they probably protect themselves even if they're acting in bad faith these prosecutors know that only after the show that they're acting in good faith and the Mets have evidence of that\nAnd then they're going to be protected you right in fact in bad faith and you do something intentionally like uh like for example or denying the defense evidence and you knew that it was evidence electrical paint the defendants uh you got a problem then 'cause that's criminal\nBut I'm\nAlso from the stack line is you know against a Ninety percent of federal indictment that under the plea bargain you know and then the ... that are already to go to take the case to court\nOr like the senator I wrote about in the book I've done\nA they always say it's over Ninety percent of those cases are one of those you know most of the news or four years ago when the appeals court she got like three or four percent chance of winning also some of the fact that they're coming over from\nWhile the other part of it is that the prosecutor typically has I mean they've got a they've got deputy prosecutors on staff\nSo they can choose to go after whatever defend that they want to go after and uh they're they're paying these people anyway so it's not as if there's more than maybe more expense for travel or investigating or whatever else\nGoes on during the investigation but they've got to people on staff a defendant doesn't have unlimited funds I'm right you know so uh so and then the defendant can never stand up to a prosecutor if the prosecutor has it in for that defendants unless the defendant has great wealth\nOr the money to continue the case they're going to lose\nAbout him that I've gotten 'em yet at the ... as well\nAnd we're still lost because the whole system is back over here and I don't know you know I Know you got on the way as well as all the bottom line is\nIt that way of the cars are supposed to be the case we're supposed to call these costs of care is accountable and typically in some cases especially the most more hardcore probably journalist Amanda ... says his goal to oldies accountable insurance horses what\nThey say horrific thirty seconds do you think that there that the Kevin our case in what you're describing sleep to greater justice or early going down the past of a more power and less justice for prosecutors [noise]\n\nLet's let's do come let's talk about\nDown home values fade into us they blue Jay he was\nLike you more as a kid I

and I are radio station\nOn ABC News\nI was amazed at how this Kavanaugh confirmation hearing\nHas impact that the election it is actually made blue way I'm Sorry the red way even more rat\nIn other words the margin for example like in North Dakota Heitkamp he's going to lose out by sixteen percent and and it's it's rather incredible at the numbers are just going oh I Can't ah the ... the Democrat\nRacist against Republican in other words they have really turned on the Trump supporting paid\nAnd I got them to go out and vote you know voting is starring in some places around the country already early fall right right so the impact was immediate area and they're not good places for the a Democrat to be so they have really hurt themselves badly\nAnd I don't think they even catch on to the fact that what they've done and and what they are continuing to do by saying oh we're going to each have an odd despite the fact that they can because of the canopy somebody for something a thirty six years old at the time was a misdemeanor\nWell not only that uh that says you got into that\nIt's it's also the case that it was long before he got into office and ... I suppose you can do an impeachment on any grounds you want a few of the house\nOf representatives and then the the trial goes in the Senate but if you did something that long ago a arguably impeachable offenses a car when you were in office because if the people elected the person and in this case the Senate approved this member of the Supreme Court\nThen that means that anything prior to that was taken into account and extinguished\nAbsolutely so\nI you know he did something while in office or let's just leave little of of not him but anybody a Alcee Hastings was a federal judge who got impeached and convicted by the way member that from Florida\nHe's very famous yeah\nAnd and he left wing all these attacks Trump and now he's in the Congress because ah you know he was able to get elected but um yeah so you're saying that this was going to be much more red wave coming up in a few days\nWell surprisingly it may not turn back many seats but what's gonna happen is the margins are going to be much bigger so in other words that from a Republican so one by three percent are going to win by five percent or ... percent that's what's happening\nWhile ... although that's nice but it doesn't really accomplish anything in terms of the numbers in the house and Senate or the real question becomes I think that this the the the\nHouse I'm In the Senate has uh the possibility of nine seats that the\nThe Republicans have a shot at on the Democrats I don't mean they're going to win them all means my mind when a few and the Republicans only have about three seats at risk\nThere's there's that small number of races that are that close so the likelihood in the Senate is the just based on the numbers would be that probably you would see a Republican increase in the Senate or am I missing something yeah\nRight now my forecast this fifty seven Republican in November\nOh fifty seven in the Senate so that would be a substantial that'd be six listen within the framework I was just talking about\nA year okay you're right on\nAnd then you have a my question is why did high camp and I think Joe Donnelly a vote against a Cavanaugh I'm a and and the McCaskill from Missouri why do you think they all voted against them but don't they know that's going to cost them\nWell you know what they may have thrown in the towel campus I just mentioned is banned by about sixteen percentage point I mean she's so far for victory it she just went along with the Democrats because she wants to be friends with them in the future\nUh Don Leah is another thing he might have been able to pick up a few percentage points by voting a whip Kavanaugh so bad I think was a mistake on his part but he's going to lose anyway\nSo he's he's going to lose either well well now does this cement his lawsuit out further yeah\nHow about Jon Tester in Montana there's that he's a clown a ... to me anyway what about him when he voted against Kavanaugh as well in Montana and um I Would think Montana would lumps Kavanaugh\nThat's a tough one to call bill um I I I'm going to reserve or out the right to wait till next week to tell you I Want to see some more numbers on that one\nSo it's still tentative and test or couldn't win that one he could win yeah after\nThe president need to go back to Montana the same ... you know citizens that he doesn't eat it won't make any difference at this point them\nNow I think he's he's put his uh you know he's put his stamp on but Tanner already he's got a bunch of other places the dough and it'll be more in on this trip\nDo you think that um these trips that he's taking our and he's primarily focusing on the Senate but also somewhat the house are they making all these trips making a difference\nYeah clearly they're making a difference [noise]\nHow so not pay Republican and the Senate is going to go much\nFor the house they Republican at about the same numbers that is now\nA slightly less [noise] so the Democrats will pick up what a ... and but

originalism the ... and it's not political as judicial and here's what I mean\nPoliticians take an ideological can take an do normally take an ideological position they face the Bernie favors um um the Medicare for all\nBernie favors free college tuition Bernie favors a free lunch a Bernie favors free salaries for everybody whatever it may be I'm being facetious but ... that's ... that's some political philosophy\nA judicial philosophy would mean that you interpret the law\nOr the issue before the court against the constitution and and that makes you an originalist district construction is however you want to describe it\nAnd all that means is that you test once they're now against the constitution and the amendments that have been incorporated into the constitution to decide if a law or a policy or regulation this constitutional\nThat doesn't take a political positions it's a position of independence as a justice Kavanaugh said\nAnd I wonder what your thoughts or about what I think is a misrepresentation\nOf the public or of many people that somehow he's politically conservative one actually because he believes in precedence for example and he believes in the case of roe v Wade was reinforced by a second Supreme Court decision at this point is forty five years old\nAnd he has already said that some better than the law so he wouldn't change it\nHaving nothing to do with what his own personal beliefs are having to do with ... views the constitution and the way the court makes decisions what about that distinction between political and judicial so called conservatism\nSure what you make a very good point and it is a point most people probably math but basically it conservative ... is one that that way as a strict construction as an originalist sometimes called the extra list uh that they they rebuilt\nThe words in a law or they read the constitution\nAnd they read it for what it says they don't interpret bang for example roe v Wade came about because they ... the Supreme Court at that time came up with this right to privacy that they found in the constitution which conservative but I'm Talking about conservative\nPolitical thought didn't exist them too so\n[laughter] so when they're all upset about this fellow because he's a conservative\nOr you're not a politically conservative you kick surely his temperament his first fruit as conservative so that mean uh to overturn overturn the the big issue there are a lot of Democrats ... said he would have to find a\nA evidence that says that this is on how to do so in other words they even have to find enough to overrule the precedent that already that because there is there and um and so it it can happen\nBut it it's not easy to do there are other people on Trump's list I went for Trump's original list that detail and studied for those folks are afraid to go back to the left\nAnd that there are people there who would a much more likely turn over or if you will liberal or progressive policies\nAre because they're in a type of show uh off the fate is a little bit more conservative leaning anyway\nSo but I think this is that the one of the best people the Democrats that have ever gotten in terms of being conservative\nDo the Democrats have a point fair enough you just as you usually do brilliantly raised a segue for me to the Democrats have a point\nThat Merrick Garland was the best that the Republicans could have gotten under Obama and therefore maybe should have given him a shot because he's on the same DC circuit court of appeals highly distinguished he's the chief judge there\nAnd more prominent than judge Kavanaugh's so can do the Democrats have gripes there\nWell I don't think they have a break but\nBut that statement is also true it probably would have been one of the better ones that the Republicans could've voters or during the term of Obama's administration\nBut on the other hand there's precedent when you're that close to a presidential election where you have a lame duck president Aspen but to wait until the new person is elected so I don't I don't think they really had a leg to stand on arguing that this was so terrible precedent breaking thing was that\nIt was perfectly normal to expect that the Senate in the hands of a\nParty that not also controlling the White House would hold off\nWell see I'm wouldn't it be the ultimate sticking it to the Democrats if I'm is justice Kavanaugh and his wife and became a cozy unfriendly and went to opera and a lovely dinners as Scalia did was about um Justice Ginsberg and her husband boy ... wouldn't that be shouted Schumer\nBe surprised by the way the next one up to bat from reading the less than that I think is Amy Coney Barrett and she is more conservative in a in a political than than Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I was gonna ask you about her next I Can't believe you were in my mind that was the name any bird was flooding through my brain and I was about to ask you about her yeah see I was going to make the point to the ... at least she appears to be more conservative than Kavanaugh\nShe is she's more conservative both a judicial early and politically and actually there at much greater threat of being a progressive policies and programs overturned\nAnd fire decisions overturned with Amy Coney Coney Barrett and by the way I think he's up to bat I think we're pretty sure that when Ruth Bader Ginsburg decides to\nYou know put out her her beach chair and on on the beach somewhere far enough that the Amy Coney Barrett is gonna be the one place or\nWell maybe that's a
