joined by someone who has some answers to Kabul Rocco is with us he was up for ten years president have direct TV pan America and it's a pleasure to have more this was a couple of how are you sir\nMike how are you\nDoing very well um we've got a good at it in a climate here last couple of days maybe in the market hasn't been so good but I'm the climate in the country is very good um for jobs so then the question is how would this be for young people listening\nOr for that matter matter even middle age you want to switch careers and do we go with a passion I mean many people have done that there's you know or to get into a job to get into some work and then I\nFrench for example in Florida who worked as a real estate broker had a dream of running a a school or after school for kids to learn how to act\nTo ... they would perform plays musicals dance the whole realm of those things in Boca Raton Florida and she put it together I don't even know about it until after the fact we never discussed that we were friends and would talk periodically but she put this amazing thing together\nAnd you know the old story build it and they will come well that was her passion she brought her daughter and who was very talented and they created this monster of an organization where kids love going there and they do the place and the whole work and a spectacular that's the passion that led her to that what about that\n... that's ... that's such a beautiful story right um because people's dry is what makes a thing happens so I'm a look I've got a career in the media ... which is really my passion and for all of my uh\nUh Twenty years in the industry to all of the young people who ah would come talk to me and get a career as I saw it with all of this uh say uh you know you need to be passionate about what you do but I'm\nActually recently that I I uh I saw this a blog by Mark Cuban was challenging that assumption I say hey you know passion is over\nA is overplayed is overused such a cliche uh what greeting makes you a good days the effort that you put any to some ...\nUh\nAnd and and so like or something I didn't expect right um uh and I did a little ... surgery and I think at the end we're sort of say the same thing you need to\nYou know different actually queen are performing or a you know at the top of your game and performing it averages gigantic gray so she really needs to be a top performer you need to be somebody who are excellent work um\nAnd for many of us are ... ... that's not going to happen if you're going to have an ashtray for what you do so that you actually put into trying it is needed to shoot to a format that at that level I mean he's not different than a you know being great sports is it\nYeah you know and then that's a good example of the passion is is professional sports I Want guys go through I mean there are players now in the in the major leagues who started at Nineteen or twenty and the miners\nAnd as a few of them are now twenty eight twenty nine thirty thirty one years old have gotten their first shot at major league baseball it's it and you're playing in the minors is is no glamour and it's no money [laughter] you know you're you're doing that for the hope for the dream so they they stick with it um I'm not sure I agree with Mark Cuban because\nThe passion will help you get through those points when\nI'm you're kind of down or you're not feeling the way of life and I've been doing this for example for many years and I know that to me if I don't after a program is over if there's something that I missed the question I didn't ask\nA I'm going to be very frustrated about that um because its attention to detail is the passengers to wanting to execute the best you can execute and no matter what field urine isn't that really connected the passion connected to the excellence to go together don't they\n... well I think again the passion connects you to the dry the willingness to put the effort which leads you to the excellence but there could be some uh [noise] some patients that go\nBeyond a um a dog you're capabilities do ah I mean I I could not be a ... a a a tall basketball player because I just don't have the\nUh the high end and the the two I thought that when I was a yeah I'm I was a Christian when I was a teenager aspiring musician I realized I didn't really have the

look I tried the um\n[noise] excellent strike you know this this person is capable of a delivering a stripper job but what they're going to be passed by so that's why I'm a to a ... you know a democracy they should\nBuy is this person coming or or interested in this opportunity for the right to research\nAnd finally the third one of these cultural fit a you know to this person said our ... our company a philosophy our company culture and I started by third because I think it say it's extremely important\nAnd um and uh you know direct TV a and a\nAnd also now that uh with uh the portfolio of companies that are a ... my investment from where we work with the um [noise]\nI mean I'm a believer in collaboration a flex organization is a direct conversations a from a\nProductive no games so no politics at work or you know their work is complicated Adolf we need to be able to trust one another right a colleague cohesion so uh so so that's the most important thing and sometimes their mission which is very important also\nSometimes personal ambition getting the way that Dr because sometimes one starts to believe that uh\nYou know to get ahead or you know it needs to control the information control or I'm\nAsked at the end there or not let others participate and I think that is the strategy for the company on the long term [noise] so um so so that's very important and probably one of the most difficult to see when you're seeing somebody\nOr the other two excellence or a ... is is really about a scene that trajectory\nAnd are and what I like to do any interviews is talking about\nThe challenges they faced a in the previous time and seeing how the reason and how they explain\nHow they were able to resolve a complicated issue is whether they are complicated or a because there were problems that were not previously solved or complicated because the humidity\nStructure suppliers are customers it said it was a it was challenging um\n[noise] so uh you know these are sort of like a you know the the main things uh that I look at a\nAnd a\n... it's the get go for an interview you want that job or prepare find do as much research as you can about the company\nOne what about 'em knowing something about the person who's going to interview you um maybe there is some time\nIn the conversation ... maybe that person raises a horse's thoroughbreds ... ...\nAnd then perhaps you did get into mentioning something about that or um there are a big sports fan and maybe I'm a particular team and maybe you're bringing a piece of memorabilia that you happen to have\nAnd you say look I have this I Know that your team um it'll mean more to you than me 'cause I Know how much you love that team a and that player and here you are or things like that this is that just over the top\nOr does that show\n[laughter] uh I I I actually I think that those are you know different people react differently to things like that I personally I tend to find it over the top right because we all have a you know a social media profile\nUm you know ... actually it was pretty much everybody today you know he's he's on the ... and uh it's putting their resume out there for the public see so uh\nI I actually see that's a red flag right somebody who was trying to ah make a um again it goes to the culture right so you want people to be I Want people to work in my team who are true about themselves\nBecause they do not have layers of a um [noise]\nYou know different masks for different situations uh be watched you are and you are or what you are and you know that's what you get\nOn let me ask you this let me let me get to a question for you um\nWas a direct TV customer\nFor Seventeen years two thousand one to this year I'm very much of a button and I'll just say to be candid about it um that over the last six months that I had the service and start to deteriorate and it was after AT and T. bought it\nAnd it had been ... before that\nAnd as you probably know the dishes come along and really uh gotten into great technology and also great customer service and I switched and I'm Glad that I did but but if I were going to go to work at the time let's say or for an interview with direct TV and come in and say look\nOr whether to you or somebody else at the company in the hiring position and I said look\nI Want you to know that I've been a customer for many years and they were the problems I see because I I I live with it I Want to watch a ballgame and then all of a sudden I get ... or I get the frozen picture or I Want to buy a movie and then it picks the lights and I don't get or in some cases I didn't get the audio\nAnd I said these are problems and here's what I Would do to fix them is that a good approach\nThat it's a great approach ... right to get you get to a a cheer you relate your personal experience with the product with the company and uh you can talk about it with a\nUh we all try to because ultimately that's what you're saying that say oh so you're experienced this what did you do you know you create a fluid conversation um and again you can make those things off right so if you're going to talk about it I mean you've had directv are studying in years I'm sure you can tell me a lot of great\nOtherwise we'll just stay on the roller coaster and hope that the other stocks catch up because one of the things that's happening right now is even with all these gains a goal like in two thousand two thousand two we see these thanks stocks bear the leaders in terms of drawing the markets to these peaks\nBut the the the as we look closer to the question becomes how many other companies are participating and when you see low volume and not a lot of breath or death that's it that's a that should be assigned to us that we're probably getting the copy market territory\nYeah and that's a good point so are we there is a right now as we speak is there a lot of activity in the market or do we see a investments portfolios going into a cash just leaving the money all the principle that are going in a bind be\nMoved yeah some people might be moving to cash because they're they're fearful but as I say that's because they haven't asserted their limitation\nSo this seems like a failed state uh let me just put it there are right and then I'll get back yet but let's also understand if you if you do the cells side right and you miss the by side you know you didn't get back in April of two thousand and that's why\nYou got out in two thousand eight so maybe it wasn't as bad as most people but you also didn't get all the gains of two thousand nine\nSo you know we wouldn't buy every ... test I turned ...\nWhen I got half of the answers correct that's fifty percent fail so you need to get by side all along with the cells type strategy in place and it's bad so that you can see I Know I either I'm going to do this for my systems are going to do this for me\nSo that I can participate in the upside but don't get crushed by the downside here's another way to to to look at it\nNo we all know Mark Cuban right great guy ... billionaire and what he said in just a in November and what he said back in February when things are getting dicey kind of like what they're doing right now\nHe said he was a hundred percent hedged\nNow you and I don't have any idea what that means\nBut he knows what he's doing he believes he is hatched and to me that's a great example for the rest of us a stable either busy guy and suddenly he has that opinion about his portfolio will never see the details\nBut the question becomes how can I developed that opinion for me and my portfolio so that I Believe that it could get very nasty but I don't have to go down like the tech Kathy never decide\nSo he had to get I mean look at the last couple of days you saw a Jeff Bezos lose about nine billion dollars with a B that rice who days now obviously he's still the I guess the richest guy in the world it doesn't matter\nIt's all on paper anyway and he's never going to spend what he has on his own personal solving couldn't buy enough rolls Royces a ring that town very far right so you know that so it's but the but the point is that it is a big number it's it's symbolically a big number\nIt's symbolically and and real world terms a troublesome to Amazon\nBut I I think what I'm hearing you say let me as an example\nLet's say one of your clients says three million dollars in savings that retirement\nAnd he has come to see you and they say look all I Want and this is your job race to do this is the get me four percent a year which is a hundred and twenty thousand dollars I'm happy to live on a hundred and twenty thousand a year but don't you dare reduce my corpus of the three million can you do that that person\nGreat question so what people can do with some systems and not with others is\nTake the portfolio and habit design\nSo that we're not trying to ride the roller coaster ride we're going to make sure we're in David and paying stocks where we can see the history that yields are pretty consistent at three or four percent if we can see that that meets exactly their prescription for the income\nFour percent on three million one twenty good to go now if I get two percent three percent upside growth\nThat's icing on the cake but I can see that if the defendant is is that three or four percent might incomes not going to be on the darn roller coaster my income is going to be stable I don't want my income on a roller coaster maybe I Want five percent of my in my portfolio someplace else where it may be more aggressive\nBut the majority of it I Want in places where I can see that that evidence alone is going to provide the income\nTo that extent you know that I Am I'm not really I don't see a lot of had a tale wins behind residential real estate I Do see tail wins behind healthcare real estate do if it is the case that I Believe it is\nThat ten thousand people today are turning sixty five through the mid twenties thirties what\nI'm saying is well wait a minute the the the way was rental real states that was passed\nBut let's understand things to do research in the Census Bureau we can see that the average American spells their average house that eight Seventy nine and we know where these folks are going to go so maybe we should be in the business they're buying shares a health care related real estate where for example one\nPortfolio will be like a it's a it's comprised of one operator where this operator has a hungry nursing care homes in three different states built in the last Twenty years\nDo you think that'll hold up and by the way the oldest at six percent so if we've got the evidence at four and spent money coming into the stakes are high now I can see this is not for Iraq is roller coaster ride that at least for my income and if the corpus can rise that's great but I also recognize that I mean think about this way\nIf if you got three million dollars and you can live off of one twenty that's four percent but at that three million dollars is allowed to drop to one point five what does the you'll have to do to keep the income at the same level of a hundred and twenty thousand it's\nGot a double to eight percent of our ... our so let me ask you this because we only have about a minute a ... minute and a half okay uh let's say a guy comes to you is a forty years old he's got two hundred and fifty thousand dollars saved he said look I'd like to have two million of retirement can you help that guy out\nAbsolutely now we'll verify where there's two man came from ...\nExcuse me he's done his homework she's donors on her homework this so then we would say OK given the timeframe that you have and the money that you have now will and and and okay the the amount that you want to achieve in this timeframe now the question becomes\nWhat kind of return to you need to ah average and what kind of contributions to you need to
