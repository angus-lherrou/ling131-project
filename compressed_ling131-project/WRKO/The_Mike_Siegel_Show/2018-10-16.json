the\nThe voters would say I'm going to vote for a Democrat or Republican or that I Want a Democrat or a house or a Republican is what does it mean\nWow it basically means that uh or well more than a

the Republican or had\nA fair enough but let me ask you this way let's say let's just say I'm giving you a number is is a hundred million voters in America\nLet's just say ten million or in California I'm just I realize this is all way off that would mean ten percent of the voters in America would be in California under my numbers does that mean that the pollsters are only giving ten percent of their uh questions to respondents in California where are they giving more than that\nIt goes much deeper than that but you're actually on track uh what's wrong and the numbers are just plain off

it\nThat very fate of America but I don't even\nThink that's accurate yeah I Love numbers by the way that to the tenth power that made ten generation\nA light and they went back they said six to ten generations right well\nToday the ten hours ten twenty four so that they by the way\nWho knows I might have I'm a Native American someplace\nI probably not because my grandparents came from Europe but I'm listening that much somebody who's been there a is that since the Mayflower came over yeah um you know people in that of\nLineage or could have Native American blood going back before that the ...\nX number of generations\nThere's other another little subtle point I Want to mention and that uh I have a learn from people who are expert in that area you know in a kind of testing people that are\nGoing to be or at least and I have no way to verify them [laughter] you know I mean they're in that business I guess but any rate they said\nThat that you know all the people that are tested\nA in a in North America they don't have enough Native American and that's what they do is they're they're actually I'm reaching down to a South America and using a gene\nFrom that team old down there\nBut when they say someone I might have Native American they don't actually know that because they don't have enough Native American data in the sample but it could be that her one one thousand twenty fourth part of her DNA is actually Colombian or parochial and fat so\nBut even even though even you can't even say it's really Native Americans from what I understand\nWell that it would be ridiculous to try to argue that ah she claims she did not use her so called minority background or because it's at that time people as you might have one eighth\nWhich wouldn't be enough but she didn't use it she said a minority background or getting the job at Harvard so I'm a you know she claims that that had nothing to do with it and she's not claiming to be a Native American or what she did claim that\nAnd at least in terms of lineage but if somebody is this just say she's one thousand one one thousand Native American on any scale anywhere does that mean anything to anybody\nI don't think so tense generation that maybe she did it in order to do the cookbook powwow chow book that she brown participated in\nWell I suppose but I my simple point would be I had a few hours that I mean anybody can find a thousand going back ten generations even if it's accurate um and and I have to be have the ultimate audacity if they try to claim that lineage whatever that lineage maybe\nYeah your I mean I one one thousand Swedish or one one thousand or a Icelandic who knows\nMean I can be if I can be one one thousand black and I'm sure like I say I'm a black person I mean that's a short one one thousand would be ridiculous one one thousand Hispanic Hispanic was\nWhen she when she was hired by the way a Harvard said that she was the first woman of color that they had the highest in that kind of position\nYeah the so they go so for her to say that they didn't use it is absolutely absurd and violates the accuracy because of those statements that Harvard made us a time which I Do recollect that they implied that that was part of what made her part of the multi cultural backgrounds of Harvard or right\nTotally outrageous well here's what the Cherokee Nation\nOf the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck ... junior\nYou set a DNA test is useless determined travel citizenship current DNA test and not even distinguish whether a person whose ancestors were indigenous to North of South America the point you made\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship\nAnd DNA test can be used to determine lineage but as such as paternity to an individual but it is not evidence for travel affiliation using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any travel nation even vaguely isn't appropriate long so they slapped down Elizabeth Warren at the Cherokee Nation\nActually I think she's come out of this looking much worse I think people not believing before sounded better than that because they thought maybe he was one thirty second which is the fifth generation back\nAnd and now to get this but it may actually be ten generation and then it may not even be any Native American DNA or jeans they might actually be Colombian or Peruvian or some other uh country down in America\nThat makes us look like it's just a game that is ridiculous so I think on balance or lost some points here in terms of people\nAnd her credibility\nAnd suddenly a turning switching gears a there's a report that came out that ISIS last year attempt at an assassination of Donald Trump\nWhen he was um in the in manila in the Philippines and the secret service stopped that it's fascination that Sam I Wonder what he thinks ISIS is a out the window think again\nWell I think that they have a foul around the world at different places and they have different levels strain in different fight and that that whole Carter there were a photo of fellow fans are are are are there are quite a few people that's the part of\nThe um city of New York\nAnd just opposed against Chicago\nA shooting free weekend\nAs of this weekend after the first time and twenty five years check that\nAgainst what what's going on in Chicago\nThat's right well hey maybe Chicago need learn some lessons from New York they certainly have learned some lessons from Rudy Giuliani but did a lot down crime\nBut you know there are a lot of things going on there that are wrong in Chicago and a ... a problem that really has to be a threat I mean uh I think that the leadership in that city has to address that I mean what is the purpose of their leadership if they don't call it\nIt is unacceptable is wrong\nAnd that is clearly a violation\nBy these people at the top of the FBI\nAnd depending on which person you talk about\nEither talking about which law they violated certainly using the agency to affect the political election or to unseat a sitting president\nIs a federal criminal act\nWe've seen the Republicans\nNow safe for months\nThat the FBI did not provide federal judges on the surveillance court the Pfizer court\nForeign intelligence surveillance court\nThat undercut the government's premise for opening the Trump Russia investigation and twenty sixteen and the first place\nThere now suggestions\nFrankly more than suggestions\nThan the information related to George Papadopoulos them every Papadopoulos is the guy who was in London\nAnd allegedly was having a few drinks with Alexander down or\nThe top Australian official in England at the time\nAnd while they're having drinks\nAnd obviously a Papadopoulos was not the target of the Warren but he was the facilitator of the investigation\nOf Mr page Carter Page\nAnd then by the way they have for warrants three months each and Carter Page and found nothing\nPage never there's never has even been\nSuggested to be indicted for anything\nAnd he was the guy that got the warrants on\nFor for warrants three months each\nAnd so this whole story about Papadopoulos winds up in his getting convicted of a line which is when Martha Stewart got convicted of\nAnd he gets I'm\nVery very short prison sentence\nAnd so the whole thing has been a sham but\nThe ... the information related to Papadopoulos\nWas one of our cars the FBI to open this investigation that the Trump in the first place\nJohn Ratcliffe\nMember of the United States House from Texas\nTalked about this he said the FBI failed to include evidence\nRegarding Papadopoulos\nThat would've been exonerated\nNormally Papadopoulos with Carter Page and on and and really would have ended before it even started the investigation of Donald Trump\nThe FBI openness investigations wife thirty first twenty sixteen\nAnd so the Trump Russia alleged collusion scandal\nThey got the information from the Australian government\nThe apples guy from down there as I mentioned\nCongressman Ratcliffe is adjusting to the FBI and Justice Department information in his possession\nContradicted its intelligence on Papadopoulos that refuted\nSofas department of justice and the FBI have a piece of evidence that contradicts a piece of evidence\nThey're using to get a warrant then that should be a wash folks if the pieces of evidence are equal in value\nBecause one side says one thing\nThe other side says the other thing you have evidence both ways\nYou can get a warrant on that basis there's not probable cause\nThat's why the the FBI Justice Department according to Radcliffe\nInformation hidden\nIn order to present to the\nSize of the court only the evidence\nSo the court gets only the evidence\nOf the government's case they get the warrant to spy on Papadopoulos\nAnd that was Carter Page beginning October twenty first twenty sixteen\nAnd of course that warrant relied almost exclusively on these trash document\nThe smart document\nUnverified documents even admittedly Christopher Steele puts together said that\nThe ... that\nWas allegedly to assert that page was acting as a foreign agent of Russia and of course nobody has ever shown anything as I said to verify that just the opposite is fundamentally been exonerated\nBecause there is no evidence that Carter Page did that\nAnd there beside the\nOther Republican\nHave said that intelligence exists which designer rates Papadopoulos completely\nAs I said the only thing he's got\nIndicted on but he wound up pleading guilty on\nWas lying to the FBI about contacts he had with this Maltese professor named Joseph myth sued\nThat's what he was indicted on that's what he was prosecuted on and they made the plea deal on that\nCan you imagine we're spending tens of millions of dollars\nOn this investigation by\nThe special counsel Robert Mueller\nAnd that's what we get and we get crimes by Manafort going back ten twelve years\nThe whole thing is absolutely ludicrous\nIf there is the classification\nOf this group of FBI and Justice Department documents\nCongressman Red Cross says that would corroborate his claims\nThat those new documents that have not been released to the public what in fact exonerate Papadopoulos you know what that means the FBI had those documents\nAt the same time they got the dot CA\nWhich implicated Papadopoulos\nAnd it means that they should never have gone for the warrant\nBecause they have credible information that we should have coming out publicly demonstrating that Papadopoulos was alleviated of this probably wasn't he would he would have been freed from any problems they never would have gotten the warrants so this whole thing was an attempt to get anybody\nWho would do anything to help them get Donald Trump\nUnelected or out of office\nTragedy of the way the department of justice and FBI well you\nKnow I Am Dr building an empty am a C.

I'm being part of the show who would you be motivated would you be going forward would you be cited would you be moved and I think that's really well\n... north Americans who are in\nLine to get than we would match dot com so voice of Boston and give you a lot of us in one hundred and twenty seven deadly UCLA hates to Boston in my heart radio station [noise]\nTo stay in one way or the other what I thought about having a and and and\nAnd the sport doctor for it I think\nBut it was a great illustration as to what happened to my students\nAll the time and they are just kind of\nTaken off guard with something that happened ... years ago and they are not given a chance really to defend themselves before it kind of become a frenzy and you know that's what happened then that's not good for either side you know it's not good for anybody\nWhen that happened and try to stop this\nWell you know the erasing several points one of which is I wouldn't trust when watching these university campuses I wouldn't trust the president's as far as I could throw them\nPlaces like uh Brandeis and welfare Massachusetts which is a private school so I guess they can do what they want but even on the public institutions\nI Ann Coulter couldn't speak at Berkeley right a right you know other other ... I don't want the boy if I I I just want to\nBritish the point that these presidents and then uh the bbs the boycott the vestige or sanction a project against Israel or as allowed to just continue along a virulent anti Semitism happens on campuses\nAnd then the the president's argue it's free speech while it's only free speech so long\nAs as you don't create an environment for violence against others that everybody's supposed to have a fair treatment or or the harassment of people attending Jewish events\nAre sponsored by Jewish groups on campuses uh I don't want to single that out but the point I'm making is that these presidents are absolutely in the pocket of we're doing what's expedient and the politically correct left wing and they're going to do what's going to make the help them to survive the one function just to survive in the job\nAnd and not to do what's right that's why I wouldn't trust\nThe under title nine that you talk about I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them and their needs to be outside intervention\nWell you're absolutely right that they only to ride to keep their job because that is all they're doing\nAnd what the schools they're afraid of is they're afraid of losing federal funding and that applies to private schools as well as public because they all get federal funding and and the guards didn't land there's kind of federal funding\nSo they're they're all afraid that if they don't follow it I don't mind they are going to lose federal funding and it can do that by you know making it and civil rights complaint to the office of civil rights within the department of education\nAnd then people don't even know that the department I mean I think that the chances of us still losing their federal funding because the title nine violation are very slim because everyone jumping it paid\nBut they use that to justify bringing on the liberal I'm biased individuals that they can find to be their title nine coordinators and therefore those people have a\nPersonal object is to just hate men and to push women at the you know at at the risk of pushing them down I mean kind of stepping on them do that\nAnd that's what they're doing and you know if you're a man today in today's society and it\nFrom my experience it doesn't matter what race gender religion you are if you're a male you are ... distinct disadvantage in school and it is a\nIt's a very strong likelihood that you or someone you know we'll be charged with a title nine violation why you are in school\nIt's a very very frightening for ...\nWell it said look I I also was discussing this with my brother and his wife they have two sons um and they look at the Kavanaugh case and the way you just described it\nAnd that must have started the premise I Know we both agree\nAnybody who commit sexual assault or rape or attempts to do so or sexual harassment should be have the book for them to the full extent of the law of what it is that they did within the parameters of the penalties for what they did that's a given course but there has to be but there has to be\nA process by which you're comfortable a in a criminal case beyond a reasonable doubt um I I don't know what standard you would use on a college campus but um you got I'm learning more than what they have now but the point the point that they were making me is that they have two sons who are adults the professionals are one of his a dentist\nSo supply it just crossed my mind the Smith exposing a woman comes in and she wants to make a few bucks she goes in and my nephew uh cleans your teeth or does a root canal whatever it may be or than implant\nA and all of a sudden I half hour later the police ... office because as they report that he or she reports he attempted to seduce me and he put his hands and inappropriate places if they're the only two people in the room now what happens\nWell it's very frightening I'm\n... now that the difference is if you go through the criminal justice system\nThere is a process which means that you are going to be innocent until proven guilty but what is scary is that the groups that are protesting this gender and there's one for a group called the end violence against Women International and they're pushing the agenda I Believe the victim\nAnd you know what I mean that we were coming to a break so let me pick it up on the other side but my point is even a few years to process and criminal law protection you still have your name be smarts than there are still doubts in other people's minds maybe this guy did this and they don't go back to the dentist anymore will come right back stay with\nFan line today [noise]\nI Love skipping out later that no one ever\nHad a little robot it's an automatic self cleaning litter

attorney bill\nSigned on mine cases on college campuses university campuses\nWhere there are ... typically young men accused of some kind of sexual harassment or abuse or some other form of sexual behavior that's technically is illegal or not even just technically but it is illegal\nAnd I'm a many times these are false accusations the Duke lacrosse case was a great example of that by the way of one of the problems with zones is the uh media a Rolling Stone to the whole story about the Duke lacrosse case\n[laughter] and and they end up prove that they had one source\nThe source retracted and they never really ... the the cave dinner were contrite about if they just went right along I think they were sued\nBy the Duke lacrosse are the victims and these these guys were victims and the press and I think there was a settlement but um but that was outrageous so the press is a big part of this too is not believe it leaves a woman or the girl on campus\nAnd then the guy who loses his rights\nWell right and you can entering the bell if we're not to say and the legal or a you know when it's out there is out there and you can't take it back\nBecause less people who hear declare cry they think of right and they don't really they go well there was something about right so you know you have to cross and your name is Trevor says it was right and that's not what you want when you're looking for a job or trying to get into graduate school\nSo you know it yeah it is a very very damaging bank or these boys\nTell me a if you would because I was that occurred to me that we have many people listening who might be the college students or parents of college students typically young men and the danger they face a tell us about how title nine plays into this it's a federal title nine education they are tired eyes that work with is\nWell it's a it's a federal law that this people think of it and\nI'm dealing with equality and education is typically the number of scholarship that women get as as men and that's what it was essentially created to do that to kind of equal out\nThe ah the ability of men and women to get a college education\nSomehow and it has morphed into um sexual harassment and sexual assault and I know how it it it was in two thousand eleven with a dear colleague letter written after the bomb it minister I shouldn't\nBut just to me lately it doesn't make sense when I read it I don't think that that would count on line was intended to do\nAnd it's certainly I think if there were than if there was anything that was impeding your ability to learn to be educated would fall under title nine but this is not\nHitting these girls had military to be educated\nUm not the stories that I'm hearing I'm hearing of girls who are equally as aggressive sexually is that an hour and you know they go out on a date and then the girl regrets it for some reason\nNow I'm not saying that sometimes there are actual rate that occur or sometimes even misunderstanding\nBut for the most part what I see our girls who are ... what happens later\nMaybe they were drunk maybe the guy was drunk too and it was just something that they regret it or were uncomfortable with and so they're now told maybe they tell friend and their cells to go to your title\nMath and then the title nine office kind of propaganda says then into\nBelieving that they were sexually assaulted\n... but the question you raised a minute ago the point how ... how do they invoke title nine to fit this category of acting as they head\nUnder title nine\nNow because it got an entity that smell it and it became mandated under Obama that every college in us history every kindergarten with her high school as well but that they all had a title nine\nApartment that deals that typically with sexual assault now again I\nI don't want to do the whole let me just ask you the Obama administration invoked sexual harassment or sexual abuse on college and university campuses under title nine is that correct yeah yeah they card\nSo okay so if that's the case says the title from what you're describing I haven't read it recently but the the title specifically describes sexual abuse or sexual harassment as a category under title nine\nNow but in\nIn law and and kinda ... with the title nine and law like a lot of things it can be\nInterpreted to mean that there is there is a fair and covered ice and that it could be that I don't believe that was the intention I don't think that that's really what it does but we're stuck with it now and it's going to stay that way\nWell actually if this is not really one of the things that particularly since you're so directly involved in this area of the law wouldn't this be feasible maybe it's been done\nTo bring a lawsuit under federal and a federal district court maybe ultimately getting to the Supreme Court as to whether title mine actually should be used to invoke this or whether the Congress would need to amend\nTitle nine to include specifically and express overtly sexual harassment sexual abuse or sexual um misconduct something along that well\nI like the way you think [laughter] but I don't think it would work because there isn't nuts in there and says and title nine that you know anything that in the ability of anyone to learn and if you're sexually assaulted or harass campus it's going to teach your ability to learn\nThat are on a five point my music loud and the next door to door in a dorm room that's going on ... I mean we you could think I had\nI mean I I agree and that's part of the problem is anything that you know go under it but I don't think your wind that but what is happening\nNow I don't know and now you have five justices might look at it with the strict construction and I know and a more narrow interpretation but I don't know maybe ... or or or or running or the other or Brian have", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Siegel Show", "city": "Boston", "day": "16"}
